The elders carried smoke and songs were sung, as the numbers of the procession grew. The Sydney festival event began at Town Hall before landing at Barangaroo for the Vigil, part of artistic director Wesley Enoch\u2019s commitment to finding new ways to mark 26 January. Women danced and sprayed water from the harbour to cleanse the land, passing the site where an Indigenous girl, Patyegerang, taught the first fleet marine William Dawes to speak her people\u2019s words.

Some would stay until dawn, the fire still burning, reflecting on what life was like before the first fleet landed and before the Union Jack was planted. Here were tender moments of togetherness for all races on sacred Gadigal country; a communal reflection on the eve of Australia Day before hashtags of #InvasionDay and #ChangetheDate proliferate on 26 January. In a country whose national day is marked by a conflict \u2013 between commemorating the British colonial project and recognising the most long-standing continuous culture on Earth \u2013 might an annual Vigil such as this, the second held by Sydney festival, be a way to assuage the tension? At a forum earlier that day, Enoch \u2013 a Noonuccal Nuugi man from Stradbroke Island, and the first Indigenous artistic director in Sydney festival\u2019s history \u2013 had suggested that every Australian should adopt a totem animal they would pledge to look after: spurred not only by the devastating wildlife losses brought on by the ongoing bushfire crisis, but by the need for a sense of ceremony on a national day that \u2013 unlike Anzac Day, for instance \u2013 is lacking ritual.

On Saturday afternoon and evening at Sydney Opera House, two premiere performances of a tribute concert, Bu\u014bgul, were held in honour of Dr G Yunupingu, the beloved blind songwriter, former Yothu Yindi member and multi-instrumentalist from Elcho Island who died aged 46 in 2017. Nine Yolngu men, all Dr G\u2019s kin, danced, sang and played yidaki and clapsticks, accompanied by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Dr G\u2019s prerecorded and multi-tracked voice, in the first concert version of Dr G\u2019s posthumously released fourth and final album, Djarimirri (Child of the Rainbow). In 2018, Djarimirri became the first Indigenous-language album to top the Australian chart. Eight of the album and concert\u2019s 12 songs \u2013 including numbers about a scrub fowl, crocodile and blue marlin \u2013 come from stories from Dr G\u2019s father\u2019s clan, the Gumatj, and were sung in Dhuwala.

Pierre has had his FA Cup moments before, notably when trying without much success to mark Son Heung-min while playing for Wycombe against Spurs three years ago, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/23/wolves-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool</a> is the sort of draw that gets a club like Shrewsbury noticed, and by the time he hit his late winner in the third-round replay it had already been made.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/25/manchester-united-tranmere-fa-cup-preview-solskjaer\">Solskj\u00e6r hopes FA Cup win at Tranmere can finally kick-start United\u2019s season | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t strike me at the time,\u201d Pierre says. \u201cIt took a while for what I had done to sink in. It was only after the game that I picked up on the energy around the club, the supporters running on to the pitch and the chairman asking me why I couldn\u2019t do that every week.\u201d</p> <p>Pierre is in dreamland twice over at the moment, for along with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/16/omar-beckles-shrewsbury-league-one-play-off-final-mental-health-football\">teammate Omar Beckles</a> he has just helped Grenada qualify for the Concacaf Gold Cup for only the third time in the small nation\u2019s history. International success and FA Cup progress have actually gone hand in hand, for when Shrewsbury beat Bradford in a first-round replay at a freezing Valley Parade, their pair of Grenadian defenders had just flown in from a game in a very different climate away to St Kitts &amp; Nevis.</p> <p>Beckles played in the Bradford match while Pierre was kept on the bench, so the former takes up the story. \u201cThe contrast was amazing,\u201d Beckles says. \u201cSt Kitts was incredibly hot and Bradford was Baltic.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a tough job getting back in time, too. We qualified on the Thursday and were supposed to fly back on Friday but the flight didn\u2019t take off. It was carnage at the airport and we had to stay another night. That meant we got back on the Sunday, trained on the Monday and played the Cup game on the Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t ideal but you get used to a little inconvenience when you play your international football in the Caribbean. Our manager is very understanding and always tries to look after us.\u201d Originally on Millwall\u2019s books, Beckles spent six years in non-league football after being released, moving around frequently until Accrington gave him his break in 2016 at the age of 25. \u201cIt was the school of hard knocks and, yes, there were times when I felt like giving up,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2336eb4e759d2cbc6e638a843194097594cc3a90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2336eb4e759d2cbc6e638a843194097594cc3a90/0_331_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omar Beckles, pictured here in 2018, used to work part-time as a PE teacher.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omar Beckles, pictured here in 2018, used to work part-time as a PE teacher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou are playing part time, I was working in a school as a PE teacher and still chasing the footballing dream, and it\u2019s not easy. When Kettering promised me full-time football I couldn\u2019t wait to sign up but they were late paying our wages the first month, then the second month they couldn\u2019t pay at all. I ended up going back to Boreham Wood and then on to Billericay.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of stress in all that. Even at this level one-year contracts are quite common. There\u2019s no stability like there is at the top. People don\u2019t realise what goes on behind the scenes, how volatile the life can be. Players are uprooted, sent out on loan somewhere else, and I\u2019ve seen people lose relationships because of that, but footballers are not perceived as humans with real feelings and real problems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/16/omar-beckles-shrewsbury-league-one-play-off-final-mental-health-football\">Shrewsbury\u2019s Omar Beckles: \u2018I\u2019d get back and be breaking down in tears\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou have to wear a mask, even though it is uncomfortable, and you are not allowed to be yourself. People can\u2019t really cope with footballers being just like everyone else.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI just went for it,\u201d Aaron Pierre says modestly of the winning goal against Bristol City that earned Shrewsbury a fourth-round tie against the champions of the world. \u201cThe gaffer encourages the back three to go forward, it was the last minute of the game and anything could have happened, but luckily it worked out for me.\u201d And for everyone else at the League One club from Shropshire. Pierre has had his FA Cup moments before, notably when trying without much success to mark Son Heung-min while playing for Wycombe against Spurs three years ago, but Liverpool is the sort of draw that gets a club like Shrewsbury noticed, and by the time he hit his late winner in the third-round replay it had already been made. \u201cIt didn\u2019t strike me at the time,\u201d Pierre says. \u201cIt took a while for what I had done to sink in. It was only after the game that I picked up on the energy around the club, the supporters running on to the pitch and the chairman asking me why I couldn\u2019t do that every week.\u201d Pierre is in dreamland twice over at the moment, for along with his teammate Omar Beckles he has just helped Grenada qualify for the Concacaf Gold Cup for only the third time in the small nation\u2019s history. International success and FA Cup progress have actually gone hand in hand, for when Shrewsbury beat Bradford in a first-round replay at a freezing Valley Parade, their pair of Grenadian defenders had just flown in from a game in a very different climate away to St Kitts &amp; Nevis. Beckles played in the Bradford match while Pierre was kept on the bench, so the former takes up the story. \u201cThe contrast was amazing,\u201d Beckles says. \u201cSt Kitts was incredibly hot and Bradford was Baltic. \u201cWe had a tough job getting back in time, too. We qualified on the Thursday and were supposed to fly back on Friday but the flight didn\u2019t take off. It was carnage at the airport and we had to stay another night. That meant we got back on the Sunday, trained on the Monday and played the Cup game on the Tuesday. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ideal but you get used to a little inconvenience when you play your international football in the Caribbean. Our manager is very understanding and always tries to look after us.\u201d Originally on Millwall\u2019s books, Beckles spent six years in non-league football after being released, moving around frequently until Accrington gave him his break in 2016 at the age of 25. \u201cIt was the school of hard knocks and, yes, there were times when I felt like giving up,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are playing part time, I was working in a school as a PE teacher and still chasing the footballing dream, and it\u2019s not easy. When Kettering promised me full-time football I couldn\u2019t wait to sign up but they were late paying our wages the first month, then the second month they couldn\u2019t pay at all. I ended up going back to Boreham Wood and then on to Billericay. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of stress in all that. Even at this level one-year contracts are quite common. There\u2019s no stability like there is at the top. People don\u2019t realise what goes on behind the scenes, how volatile the life can be. Players are uprooted, sent out on loan somewhere else, and I\u2019ve seen people lose relationships because of that, but footballers are not perceived as humans with real feelings and real problems. \u201cYou have to wear a mask, even though it is uncomfortable, and you are not allowed to be yourself. People can\u2019t really cope with footballers being just like everyone else. Look at all the fuss when that Sheffield United player [Oli McBurnie] went to watch a game in the crowd.\u201d If Beckles speaks with insight on this subject, it is because he has suffered from anxiety and depression in the past and now runs a foundation offering support to anyone affected by mental-health issues. \u201cIt started off as part of the grieving process when my father died,\u201d he explains. \u201cAll I wanted was to step in and provide for my family but the pressure got the better of me. I became so tense I had to wear a device to prevent me grinding my teeth in my sleep. I don\u2019t want to complain about my life because I am where I always wanted to be. I have a lot to be thankful for and I\u2019m grateful but, if I can use this platform to help others, I will try.\u201d Returning to Sunday\u2019s game, both Beckles and Pierre are realistic enough to accept that Liverpool are unlikely to be at full strength, especially after the success of their alternative side in the last round against Everton. \u201cThey played on Thursday, so I think they will be resting a few,\u201d Beckles says. \u201cIf they play their youngsters again, it might make it tougher because players on the fringes always have a point to prove.\u201d Pierre is equally philosophical. \u201cWe just have to try and stop whoever we are playing but, if you are going to get knocked out of a competition, you always want to have been beaten by the best,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt would be good to have the experience of playing against Mo Salah or Sadio Man\u00e9, just to see if they are any harder to stop than Son, and as a centre-half I would love to play against Virgil van Dijk as well.

Once you have been to someone\u2019s home to tell them a loved one has passed away unexpectedly, you can sit down with a rugby player and tell him he has not been picked this week. I do not find that as difficult as maybe some coaches.\u201d</p> <p>One advantage Pivac will have over Gatland, another New Zealander, is that he is used to the politics of Welsh rugby, having spent five years with the Scarlets. The game may not be as tribal as it once was, with 19 first-class clubs having been distilled into four regions, but it remains a country with a low tolerance threshold for failure.</p> <p>Even Gatland came under fire after his few poor Six Nations campaigns while Graham Henry used to lament a lack of perspective, comparing opinion in the country to a shower that was either too hot or too cold.</p> <p>\u201cI was questioned in my final interview over how I would handle the goldfish bowl and the expectation of the Welsh public,\u201d says Pivac. \u201cThere is significant pressure and responsibility that goes with the role but there are bigger things than a rugby match and I have experienced some of them. It puts everything into perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Pivac had a warm-up for the Six Nations last month when Wales faced the Barbarians. The side was without a number of the players who had helped Wales reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, most notably the captain Alun Wyn Jones, but those who were not based in England watched the match and met their new boss.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a number of one-on-one conversations with players,\u201d says Pivac. \u201cIt was a great week to get to know players I had not worked with before. It does not matter which clubs they come from: they play the game for the same reasons. It is a gladiatorial sport and what it important is that we enjoy each other\u2019s company and have a good old-fashioned beer afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>Pivac, now 57, is a product of the amateur era, playing for North Harbour before going into coaching. He brought \u201cold-fashioned\u201d values to the Scarlets and transformed a side that had been in turmoil on and off the field into champions and European Cup semi-finalists. He encouraged players to express themselves and a significant factor behind his appointment was the flowing style of rugby he advocated.</p> <p>\u201cThe guys have been made aware of the style of game we want to play, the positional specifics and the roles they will have, whatever number is on their back,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody has been given clear instructions about what is expected, and what I am seeing is a great reaction.

You think we stroll around the park and have a ham sandwich? Of course we train hard. Come on.\u201d</p> <p>Jones\u2019s face is rarely without a smile at media conferences, even when he is grinding his teeth or shaking his head at an inquisitor, enjoying the sparring, but here it was as if he were bracing himself for a root canal.</p> <p>\u201cCan we have a question about rugby?\u201d he had implored after another question about Saracens, or the \u201ctaboo subject\u201d as he called it.</p> <p>England, after reaching the World Cup final last autumn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/england-new-zealand-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">swatting aside the holders, New Zealand,</a> along the way, are the favourites to win the Six Nations. They did so in Jones\u2019s first two seasons in charge but, unusually when the Australian is holding court, tension was sucking oxygen from the room and he even bridled at an innocent question about the previous four championships that followed a World Cup year ending in a grand slam, later apologising.</p> <p>Earlier he had said Steve Borthwick, the forwards coach for the previous four campaigns who has been switched to skills after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/13/england-appoint-simon-amor-matt-proudfoot-coaches-rugby-union\" title=\"\">the arrival of Matt Proudfoot</a> from South Africa, had been charged with overseeing the way England trained. \u201cHis role will change significantly. He will be skills coach and [work on] special projects; he has already been looking at a couple of areas. We need to change the way we train, to do it better and he will come up with various ways of how we can do that.\u201d</p> <p>England\u2019s first match is in Paris next Sunday. A year ago Warren Gatland, then in his 12th and final year as Wales\u2019s head coach, predicted that, if his side won in Paris on the opening night, the title would follow. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/01/france-wales-six-nations-2019-match-report\" title=\"\">They did</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/16/wales-crush-ireland-win-grand-slam-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">it did</a>, but Jones, as always, is taking it one match at a time, not even concerning himself with the end of the year when world rankings will come into play for the 2023 World Cup draw. \u201cWe need to make sure we learn from the World Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat are the mistakes we do not want to repeat? What are the areas we need to keep doing?</p> <p>\u201cThe boys probably need to have a chat about the taboo subject. Then we need to get on with playing rugby. We will have some periods off the field where we enjoy each other\u2019s company.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones was not at his most accommodating at this week\u2019s Six Nations launch, his patience frayed by the barrage of questions about salary cap-breaching Saracens and the impact their presence in the Championship next season would have on England. Eventually the head coach snapped when asked about the notoriously \u201cgrim\u201d training sessions he put his players through. \u201cThat is a ridiculous statement,\u201d said Jones, now in his fifth season as England\u2019s head coach. \u201cI do not think the players find the camps grim. If they do, they do not have to come. Give me their names and they won\u2019t have to bother coming. \u201cTest rugby is hard. You think we stroll around the park and have a ham sandwich? Of course we train hard. Come on.\u201d Jones\u2019s face is rarely without a smile at media conferences, even when he is grinding his teeth or shaking his head at an inquisitor, enjoying the sparring, but here it was as if he were bracing himself for a root canal. \u201cCan we have a question about rugby?\u201d he had implored after another question about Saracens, or the \u201ctaboo subject\u201d as he called it. England, after reaching the World Cup final last autumn, swatting aside the holders, New Zealand, along the way, are the favourites to win the Six Nations. They did so in Jones\u2019s first two seasons in charge but, unusually when the Australian is holding court, tension was sucking oxygen from the room and he even bridled at an innocent question about the previous four championships that followed a World Cup year ending in a grand slam, later apologising. Earlier he had said Steve Borthwick, the forwards coach for the previous four campaigns who has been switched to skills after the arrival of Matt Proudfoot from South Africa, had been charged with overseeing the way England trained. \u201cHis role will change significantly. He will be skills coach and [work on] special projects; he has already been looking at a couple of areas. We need to change the way we train, to do it better and he will come up with various ways of how we can do that.\u201d England\u2019s first match is in Paris next Sunday. A year ago Warren Gatland, then in his 12th and final year as Wales\u2019s head coach, predicted that, if his side won in Paris on the opening night, the title would follow. They did and it did, but Jones, as always, is taking it one match at a time, not even concerning himself with the end of the year when world rankings will come into play for the 2023 World Cup draw. \u201cWe need to make sure we learn from the World Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat are the mistakes we do not want to repeat? What are the areas we need to keep doing? \u201cThe boys probably need to have a chat about the taboo subject. Then we need to get on with playing rugby. We will have some periods off the field where we enjoy each other\u2019s company. And some good tough training.\u201d The most interesting of Jones\u2019s coaching reshuffles is the appointment of Simon Amor as attack coach. A consistent failing of England since winning the 2003 World Cup, and it sometimes surfaced in that tournament, is a slowness to react when a gameplan is not working, undone by predictability. Amor has a Sevens background, a format that ensures players have to be alert for opportunities. \u201cWe want to keep improving our attack,\u201d says Jones. \u201cWhether we can do it quickly or over a period of time is something we will judge.

      "body": "<p>\u201cI used a psychologist when I was playing,\u201d Scott Parker says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most powerful things: how you can have a concrete head and not let things in. Of course there\u2019s a technical element but nine times out of 10 when you\u2019re having a bad day it will mainly be mental: the mistake you\u2019ve made, the comment you\u2019ve heard, the crowd\u2019s reaction to a shot over the bar \u2013 after that the fear\u2019s coming in.\u201d</p> <p>The mind fascinates Parker. Fulham\u2019s manager wants to understand the human psyche. He aims to give his players resilience and the tools to think clearly under pressure. \u201cYou have your first 10 touches and kick it into the stand, there\u2019s a technical element,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what makes the 11th touch go in the stand again? It\u2019s probably because the crowd are on me. You need to think: \u2018Let me go back to basics and build.\u2019 It starts in your head and taking a deep breath.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/20/social-media-video-games-players-decision-making\">Yes, social media and video games really can hurt footballers' decision-making | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Less than a year into his first management job Parker understands how fear takes hold. As a youngster at Charlton he was carefree. That changed when he moved to Chelsea in 2004. The pressure was hard and it did not become any easier when he joined Newcastle in 2006.</p> <p>\u201cI started to struggle,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d go out every day on the grass and train my left foot. I\u2019d try and get as fit as I could. But there are certain elements in games where it\u2019s nothing to do with technique. It\u2019s more: \u2018I was training today and was really sloppy in the way I was.\u2019 I took it into coaching.</p> <p>\u201cThese boys are only human and at times there are 30,000 screaming at you. Now they\u2019ve got the added pressure of going into the changing room and the first thing you see them do is click on their phone and Twitter comes up. You don\u2019t know the effect it\u2019s having on players but it\u2019s at the forefront of my mind. When I was playing it was a newspaper report. Now it\u2019s a whole new dynamic. You type your name in and nine times out of 10 it\u2019s negative.</p> <p>\u201cWe do live in a world where with the click of a button you\u2019ve got something on your doorstep. I talk a lot about earning the right to take a picture of yourself. Earn the right to be a top player, earn the right to win a trophy. There\u2019s so much money in what we\u2019re doing and added to that is a social media platform where with one picture you can pretend to be whoever you want to be. In reality is it really like that?\u201d</p> <p>At 39 years old and the father of four boys, Parker is an interesting mix. He has old-school values and hates the falseness and toxicity of social media. At the same time, however, he is empathetic, inquisitive and flexible enough to build connections with his players.</p> <p>The former England midfielder \u2013 he won 18 caps from 2003-13 \u2013 was thrown in at the deep end, appointed on a caretaker basis when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/28/claudio-ranieri-sack-fulham-premier-league-scott-parker\" title=\"\">Fulham sacked Claudio Ranieri </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/28/claudio-ranieri-sack-fulham-premier-league-scott-parker\" title=\"\">last March</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI used a psychologist when I was playing,\u201d Scott Parker says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most powerful things: how you can have a concrete head and not let things in. Of course there\u2019s a technical element but nine times out of 10 when you\u2019re having a bad day it will mainly be mental: the mistake you\u2019ve made, the comment you\u2019ve heard, the crowd\u2019s reaction to a shot over the bar \u2013 after that the fear\u2019s coming in.\u201d The mind fascinates Parker. Fulham\u2019s manager wants to understand the human psyche. He aims to give his players resilience and the tools to think clearly under pressure. \u201cYou have your first 10 touches and kick it into the stand, there\u2019s a technical element,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what makes the 11th touch go in the stand again? It\u2019s probably because the crowd are on me. You need to think: \u2018Let me go back to basics and build.\u2019 It starts in your head and taking a deep breath.\u201d Less than a year into his first management job Parker understands how fear takes hold. As a youngster at Charlton he was carefree. That changed when he moved to Chelsea in 2004. The pressure was hard and it did not become any easier when he joined Newcastle in 2006. \u201cI started to struggle,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d go out every day on the grass and train my left foot. I\u2019d try and get as fit as I could. But there are certain elements in games where it\u2019s nothing to do with technique. It\u2019s more: \u2018I was training today and was really sloppy in the way I was.\u2019 I took it into coaching. \u201cThese boys are only human and at times there are 30,000 screaming at you. Now they\u2019ve got the added pressure of going into the changing room and the first thing you see them do is click on their phone and Twitter comes up. You don\u2019t know the effect it\u2019s having on players but it\u2019s at the forefront of my mind. When I was playing it was a newspaper report. Now it\u2019s a whole new dynamic. You type your name in and nine times out of 10 it\u2019s negative. \u201cWe do live in a world where with the click of a button you\u2019ve got something on your doorstep. I talk a lot about earning the right to take a picture of yourself. Earn the right to be a top player, earn the right to win a trophy. There\u2019s so much money in what we\u2019re doing and added to that is a social media platform where with one picture you can pretend to be whoever you want to be. In reality is it really like that?\u201d At 39 years old and the father of four boys, Parker is an interesting mix. He has old-school values and hates the falseness and toxicity of social media. At the same time, however, he is empathetic, inquisitive and flexible enough to build connections with his players. The former England midfielder \u2013 he won 18 caps from 2003-13 \u2013 was thrown in at the deep end, appointed on a caretaker basis when Fulham sacked Claudio Ranieri last March. Relegation from the Premier League was a certainty but the club saw enough to give Parker the job permanently. The early signs are promising for Fulham, who visit Manchester City in the FA Cup on Sunday. They are third in the Championship, three points behind second-placed Leeds, and Parker speaks enthusiastically about building for the long term. As a player he was everywhere. As a manager he wants standards to be high across the board. At the start of pre-season Parker commissioned an external company to assess his squad\u2019s personality. \u201cWe profiled every player on how they want to be addressed, where they sit, certain spectrums of their personality in that sense,\u201d he says. \u201cWe did that so as a manager I have a rough idea of: \u2018This is what he\u2019s like, he doesn\u2019t like a brutal honest conversation, he doesn\u2019t want to be exposed in front of his peers.\u2019 \u201cThose little snippets give me a lot of info because now, if I\u2019m dealing with a player I need to sanction, I have a rough idea of where I need to get. The players understood we\u2019re all different. What Joe Bryan accepts and what Kevin McDonald or Harry Arter accept is very different and we need to understand we can\u2019t all be like this.\u201d Parker has reintegrated Aboubakar Kamara, who was arrested at Fulham\u2019s training ground last January. The striker signed a new contract last month. \u201cAt times you have to manage him very differently from some of the others,\u201d Parker says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve not had a problem.

The Iowa caucuses on 3 February represent the first formal election-year test for the Democratic field seeking to challenge Donald Trump for the White House.

Wood was playing in his second Test match in 11 months \u2013 and his first back-to-back since his debut summer of 2015 \u2013 after a succession of fitness problems that have included knee and side injuries that ruled him out of last summer\u2019s Ashes series, plus three major ankle operations earlier in his career. Wood said: \u201cI want to affect games of cricket for England, it would mean a hell of a lot to me. It\u2019s something you aspire to do, affect games. It was nice to get some runs and get some catches in the last game \u2013 I know my main suit is my bowling but I like to affect the game in other ways as well. \u201cTo be able to win a series away from home against a quality opposition would be especially pleasing for me after coming through some hard times.\u201d England had started the day with the news that Wood\u2019s Durham teammate, Ben Stokes, had escaped a ban for swearing at a fan on the opening day of this match after accepting a level one charge for an \u201caudible obscenity\u201d on Friday. The England vice-captain reacted to provocation \u2013 including a derogatory reference to the singer Ed Sheeran \u2013 from a middle-aged fan wearing a South Africa one-day shirt. Stokes went on to dismiss the South Africa opener Dean Elgar and take two catches. But he was overshadowed by the efforts of Wood, whose opening wicket of Pieter Malan was taken with a delivery registered at 94.4mph. \u201cWhen that wicket fell it was especially pleasing,\u201d said Wood. \u201cI just tried bring a little bit of energy, something a bit different and tried to create a different atmosphere and a different feel to the game.\u201d Wood also revealed he had worked on his batting during his injury absence in the second half of the summer, when he was fed balls from a bowling machine by his wife, Sarah, and father, Derek, at an indoor centre in Newcastle. \u201cI knew we were coming here and it was a bit bouncy, so I was working on how I thought they\u2019d attack me \u2013 either at the stumps or at my head. I\u2019ve done quite a lot of work. It means I\u2019m going to go out there thinking I can deliver.\u201d",

The knockout rounds of this season\u2019s Champions League feature clubs from the five major western European leagues. The last 32 of the Europa League features three clubs from eastern Europe.</p> <p>The past four World Cup winners are all wealthy western European powers (only hapless England remain aloof and even they are improving).

But Cameroon\u2019s climate is not dissimilar to that of Ivory Coast, which will host in 2023. Average June temperature and humidity is much the same in Yaound\u00e9 and Abidjan, but June rainfall is almost double in Abidjan. If the rainy season is the issue, the argument to move the 2023 tournament is much stronger. Mid\u2011January 2023, though, is three weeks after the World Cup final in Qatar. It\u2019s almost as if African football isn\u2019t the main consideration.</p> <p>Fifa\u2019s Infantino, in admittedly vague terms, has spoken of <a href=\"http://www.insideworldfootball.com/2019/11/29/infantino-promises-africa-1bn-new-200m-pan-african-super-league\" title=\"\">plans for a pan-African league</a> to generate revenue, raise the standard of football across the continent and slow the drain of talent to Europe. That sounds a noble aim and if Fifa\u2019s Club World Cup is to prosper, it requires strong clubs from across the globe. But a super league is a super league and a little probing suggests the idea would be for a closed format. Which raises an immediate question: if you are in effect franchising a league across Africa, can you afford Al Ahly and Zamalek, Hearts of Oak and Kotoko, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs or would the great rivalries that have energised football for generations be lost? Not to mention the impact on clubs slightly further down the pyramid.</p> <p>But perhaps that impact is coming anyway. If European clubs are to play in the Club World Cup, it will require enormous sums of money (the source of which raises a host of ethical concerns). The talk is of \u00a340m-50m just to take part, with a prize fund on top. That will further widen the gulf between rich and poor in Europe, but elsewhere, even if clubs from other confederations get less, the distortion will be seismic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>To take just one example, TP Mazembe, who have won seven of the past nine league titles in DR Congo and three of the past 11 African Champions Leagues, <a href=\"https://www.africaintelligence.com/business-circles/2019/07/15/mining-rivals-katumbi-and-beveraggi-settle-their-scores-on-the-football-pitch,108365409-ge0\" title=\"\">have an annual budget of around \u00a38.5m</a>.

They want to think their club is different. They want simply to watch the game. Haven\u2019t the rich always been dominant? Yes, but to nothing like this extent.

This is the greatest scene of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds and it is also modern football. Every week, there comes a new detail, stat or report of an initiative. Individually they can be laughed off. What\u2019s the Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli banging on about this time? Who is Fifa\u2019s Gianni Infantino abasing himself in front of now at Davos? Why has the Spanish Super Cup been rejigged with wildly variant appearance fees to try to put on a Clasico for the people of Jeddah? What\u2019s the point of the Champions League group stage? For almost a decade, four of Europe\u2019s big five leagues have been dominated by one or two clubs. The disparity between rich and poor in the Premier League is so great that champions now get 95+ points, while in more than one in six games one side has less than 30% possession. The richest clubs are getting richer within leagues, but the richest leagues are also getting richer in comparison with other leagues. The knockout rounds of this season\u2019s Champions League feature clubs from the five major western European leagues. The last 32 of the Europa League features three clubs from eastern Europe. The past four World Cup winners are all wealthy western European powers (only hapless England remain aloof and even they are improving). Players in those countries grow up with supreme facilities in a highly competitive environment, which may not be without problems but does tend to produce good footballers \u2013 as further demonstrated by Spain and Germany\u2019s domination of Uefa youth tournaments. Yet the rich demand more. This month it was reported the European Club Association wants four additional matchdays in the Champions League. Within a week, Pep Guardiola was calling for the abolition of the League Cup to ease the pressure on players. Manchester City\u2019s manager may not agree with the ECA, but it hardly matters. The various plans to streamline the FA Cup follow a similar pattern: having already enriched the rich to the point the smaller clubs can barely compete, the smaller clubs are to be starved of fixtures that generate revenue so the elite can play each other more often and make even more money for themselves. Then there\u2019s the Club World Cup, scheduled to begin in its new expanded format in summer 2021. It is not yet clear European clubs will compete but already the tournament has forced the Africa Cup of Nations to be re-rescheduled from June-July to January-February to avoid a clash. Until last year, that is when the Cup of Nations had traditionally been played before it was moved so as not to interfere with western European club seasons. The Confederation of African Football \u2013 which has essentially been run by Fifa since the beginning of August \u2013 insists the switch is a specific issue to do with the weather in Cameroon in June. But Cameroon\u2019s climate is not dissimilar to that of Ivory Coast, which will host in 2023. Average June temperature and humidity is much the same in Yaound\u00e9 and Abidjan, but June rainfall is almost double in Abidjan. If the rainy season is the issue, the argument to move the 2023 tournament is much stronger. Mid\u2011January 2023, though, is three weeks after the World Cup final in Qatar. It\u2019s almost as if African football isn\u2019t the main consideration. Fifa\u2019s Infantino, in admittedly vague terms, has spoken of plans for a pan-African league to generate revenue, raise the standard of football across the continent and slow the drain of talent to Europe. That sounds a noble aim and if Fifa\u2019s Club World Cup is to prosper, it requires strong clubs from across the globe. But a super league is a super league and a little probing suggests the idea would be for a closed format. Which raises an immediate question: if you are in effect franchising a league across Africa, can you afford Al Ahly and Zamalek, Hearts of Oak and Kotoko, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs or would the great rivalries that have energised football for generations be lost? Not to mention the impact on clubs slightly further down the pyramid. But perhaps that impact is coming anyway. If European clubs are to play in the Club World Cup, it will require enormous sums of money (the source of which raises a host of ethical concerns). The talk is of \u00a340m-50m just to take part, with a prize fund on top. That will further widen the gulf between rich and poor in Europe, but elsewhere, even if clubs from other confederations get less, the distortion will be seismic. To take just one example, TP Mazembe, who have won seven of the past nine league titles in DR Congo and three of the past 11 African Champions Leagues, have an annual budget of around \u00a38.5m. What happens to Congolese league football when the dominant side is supercharged by the revenues of the Club World Cup? The same pattern, the same enrichment of the rich, the same profanation of domestic leagues, the same shift to a quasi-franchise model is happening everywhere. It could happen globally. The Club World Cup is not about football. It\u2019s about profit, because everything is these days, and Fifa\u2019s battle with Europe\u2019s governing body, Uefa, for control \u2013 the game\u2019s regulators become financial competitors. People don\u2019t want to believe. They want to think their club is different. They want simply to watch the game. Haven\u2019t the rich always been dominant? Yes, but to nothing like this extent. What about little Atalanta pipping oligarch-owned Shakhtar? Yes, there are exceptions. It\u2019s football: random stuff still very occasionally happens; Leicester\u2019s Premier League title in 2016 is the greatest propaganda the superclubs could ever have dreamed up. Wake up! Turn around, have a look at that climbing frame and ask if this is what you want football to be.",

The bad news is, that\u2019s the small story of our big season. I don\u2019t think Hull played that well in the first half, and I\u2019m not disrespecting them because they showed in the second half that they can be really dangerous. But when a team aren\u2019t playing so well, and we had the game in our grasp ... don\u2019t try at Cruyff, don\u2019t try something else, don\u2019t chip a pass, when we do that we\u2019re not a good team. It allows teams to stay in the game to the 94th minute and we caused our own problems. We have to keep working on that, because it\u2019s going to define you. I sound like a broken record. We\u2019re not making it count in terms of goals and firm results. It\u2019s frustrating. In the last ten minutes we were allowing them to run two on two on our goal. Until we get those details right, we can\u2019t close the gap. This has to be a constant message from me.

But I thought the boys gave it a good go in the second half. It was a chance for us today, we just didn\u2019t take the best of our opportunities.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s your lot! Richard Jolly was on point at the KCom, and here\u2019s his verdict. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! And now a word with Frank. \u201cThe good news is, we\u2019re in the hat. The bad news is, that\u2019s the small story of our big season. I don\u2019t think Hull played that well in the first half, and I\u2019m not disrespecting them because they showed in the second half that they can be really dangerous. But when a team aren\u2019t playing so well, and we had the game in our grasp ... don\u2019t try at Cruyff, don\u2019t try something else, don\u2019t chip a pass, when we do that we\u2019re not a good team. It allows teams to stay in the game to the 94th minute and we caused our own problems. We have to keep working on that, because it\u2019s going to define you. I sound like a broken record. We\u2019re not making it count in terms of goals and firm results. It\u2019s frustrating. In the last ten minutes we were allowing them to run two on two on our goal. Until we get those details right, we can\u2019t close the gap. This has to be a constant message from me. The lessons are clear.\u201d Grant McCann speaks. \u201cI thought the two goals we conceded were sloppy, and we got punished. The second one is inexcusable, it\u2019s really disappointing to lose a man at the back post. But we got back into it and had chances. We just didn\u2019t seem to get on the second ball. But I thought the boys gave it a good go in the second half. It was a chance for us today, we just didn\u2019t take the best of our opportunities. The league is our number one, but we gave it a good go. It\u2019s a big game for us on Tuesday [against Huddersfield] and we\u2019ll try to respond.\u201d Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta speaks candidly to BT Sport. \u201cHonestly, with the chances we had, we have to control better. We have to improve our game if we want to go far. Tonight\u2019s game we could have handled better. It is not the first game that we did not manage well, and at the end we were suffering. We stopped playing and started doing individual actions; if we want to fight for trophies we have to improve.\u201d Chelsea ran rings around Hull in the first half, Batshuayi\u2019s early goal scant reward for their dominance. That profligacy nearly came back to haunt them, Hull giving everything in the second half, though it should be noted that their goal came from a free kick that almost certainly shouldn\u2019t have been awarded, and was pretty darn lucky to boot. Which is not to take away from the Championship\u2019s impressive display in the second period ... just to say that Chelsea would have had a word or two to say had Hull gone on to equalise. Chelsea clear easily, and that\u2019s that! Hull were much improved in the second half ... but the Premier League side are in the bag for the fifth round, reward for their dominant first-half display. 90 min +3: Hull win a corner on the right. One last throw of the dice! 90 min +2: Pedro takes his own sweet time to depart, as Lamptey takes his place. Chelsea are so close to the fifth round now. 90 min +1: In the first of three added minutes, Chelsea deal easily with the free kick that\u2019s hoicked into the mixer. 90 min: Magennis is bowled over, 40 yards from the Chelsea goal, but Zouma. It\u2019s a clear free kick, but Zouma, perhaps still seething over the non-challenge that led to the goal, goes ballistic. He\u2019s booked for his dramatic roar of disapproval. 88 min: Samuelsen bursts down the right, a power run that earns a corner off Kovacic. Grosicki takes long. Tafazolli, at the far post, heads back across goal. Burke can\u2019t quite latch onto it, and in a flash the chance is gone. But all of a sudden, Chelsea are hanging on a bit here. 86 min: A simple long ball, and Grosicki is racing down the left into acres of space. He reaches the edge of the Chelsea area and blooters wildly over the bar. Chelsea hearts in mouths there. 85 min: The corner comes to nothing, though Magennis is fortunate that VAR isn\u2019t in operation tonight, because he was grappling with Zouma in a very hands-on style. The referee saw zilch. 84 min: Alonso rolls a pass down the left for Willian, who reaches the byline then returns it. Alonso, to the left of goal, looks for the top right. He pearls it, but the ball takes a deflection off Burke. Corner. 83 min: Gilmour has a rake from 25 yards. It\u2019s on target, heading towards the bottom right, but an easy claim for Long. 82 min: Grosicki curls one in from the left. Magennis prepares to head home, but Tomori pops up to win a brilliant clearing header. 80 min: I should say that Hull\u2019s goal has been initially credited to Grosicki, but his shot looked like it was heading wide right before Kovacic met it. Kovacis was the recipient of a huge bollocking from Alonso, incidentally, the punishment of breaking away from the wall. Grosicki belts the ball towards the top right. It looks like it\u2019s going wide. Kovacic breaks off the end of the wall. The ball pings off him, a huge deflection that takes it off towards the top left. Cabellero is wrong footed, and it spins in! Hull are back in it! 77 min: Magennis goes over Alonso\u2019s leg, just to the right of the Chelsea D. Not much contact, if any, but the referee gives the free kick. There might be a kerfuffle if this goes in. 75 min: Lichaj floats a pass down the middle and nearly finds Kane in the Chelsea box. His pass is a couple of inches too high. Goal kick. 74 min: Barkley dinks a pass down the right to release Pedro into the box. Pedro draws Long and softly chips the keeper ... but the ball flaps into the side netting. That would have been a very pretty goal. 73 min: Barkley steams down the right and earns a corner off Da Silva. The set piece drops at the feet of Tomori, ten yards out. He should score, but belts the ball straight at Burke. He gets another go, but that effort\u2019s blocked too. Hull suddenly look very tired. 72 min: Batshuayi cuts in from the right and looks for the bottom left. He sends his effort well wide of the target. 71 min: Grosicki has a belt from distance. Nope. 70 min: Pedro tries to release Batshuayi with a backheel down the right. Cute, but not quite. But then he comes at Hull again, dribbling into the box down the inside-left, before tugging a shot across the face of goal and wide right. 69 min: Hull respond with a double change of their own. Eaves and Honeyman make way for Magennis and Samuelsen. 68 min: A double change for Chelsea. Mount and Hudson-Odoi are replaced by Willian and 18-year-old Scottish prospect Billy Gilmour, the latter making his FA Cup debut. 66 min: Kane quarterbacks a pass down the left for Lichaj, who enters the box with the ball at his feet. A chance to shoot, but one he takes a couple of strides too early. It\u2019s easily blocked. Karma does for Hull. Barkley takes the resulting free kick, out on the right. He curls it long for Tomori, who races in from the left to meet the ball, heading carefully past Long. Easy as that. 63 min: Zouma creams a lovely pass down the inside-right channel to release Mount. Lichaj clips his ankle before he can get away, taking a cynical booking for the team. 62 min: Chelsea stroke it around the back for a bit, drawing some of Hull\u2019s sting. The KCOM simmers down. 60 min: Hull make their first change, replacing Wilks with Grosicki. 59 min: Bowen nutmegs Alonso in the centre circle and skedaddles down the middle of the park. It\u2019s a lovely slaloming run. When he reaches the edge of the box, he tries to send a rising shot into the top left. It rises a wee bit too much, and wafts over the bar. Bowen is having a great game. 58 min: Bowen sees a shot blocked on the edge of the box. Wilks can\u2019t keep the move going when the ball breaks to him on the left. Hull are asking a few questions now. 57 min: Hull are pinging the ball around with much more confidence now. Chelsea are being starved of possession right now. They\u2019ve only had 20% of the ball in the last five minutes. Some shift in momentum. 55 min: Another corner for Hull, won by McKenzie down the right. Bowen, who has been Hull\u2019s star performer this evening, makes a rare blot on his copybook by failing to beat the first man. Kovacic clears with ease. 54 min: One corner leads to another, which leads to nothing. But Hull\u2019s performance since the restart has got the crowd going again. This is a proper cup tie now. 53 min: A brilliant take by Bowen, who brings a wild Da Silva pass down from the sky and under control with a telescopic leg. It gives him the opportunity to rush down the right wing and earn a corner. 51 min: It\u2019s been a good start to the half by Hull (again). They\u2019ve clearly been told at half-time that there\u2019s little point in dying wondering. Much more positive. 49 min: ... nothing occurs. But Hull come back at Chelsea, Bowen crossing from the right, the ball inexplicably missed by both Chelsea centre-backs and nearly finding Eaves alone on the penalty spot. Once again, Eaves can\u2019t sort his feet out in time, and the chance to trap and shoot is gone. 48 min: Hull stream forward again, McKenzie slipping Bowen in down the right. Bowen drops a shoulder to trick Alonso and romps into the box. He reaches the byline but can\u2019t find anyone in the middle. Still, it\u2019s deflected out for a corner, from which ... 47 min: Kane likes the look of this. His eyes flickering. He sends a curler towards the top left ... but there\u2019s too much curl and not enough speed on the free kick. It was always going wide, and had it been on target, it would have been an easy catch for Caballero. 46 min: Bowen dribbles down the inside-left channel and is cynically tripped by Kovacic, who deservedly goes in the referee\u2019s notebook. A free kick 30 yards out, just to the left of centre. We\u2019re off again! Chelsea get the second half underway. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. It was 25 years ago today ... Hull nearly don\u2019t survive it. Alonso reaches the byline out on the left. He pulls back long for Azpilicueta, who chests the ball down the inside-right channel before smashing a shot at Long, the keeper saving at his near post. And that\u2019s the end of the first half. Hull have been given the runaround, but there\u2019s only one goal in it. Chelsea will be acutely aware that they\u2019ve been down this road before. 45 min: There will be one additional first-half minute. 44 min: Another Hull free kick, some more head tennis in the Chelsea box. The visitors manage to clear eventually, but the last couple of minutes will give Hull a little succour. Chelsea should have put this tie to bed, but the hosts aren\u2019t out of this yet. 43 min: A free kick out on the Hull left leads to some head tennis in the Chelsea box. The ball\u2019s half cleared, then returned by Kane, who finds Eaves with a classy diagonal pass. Eaves brings it down, turns, and sends a bobbler straight at Caballero. 41 min: Bowen dances down the right. Chelsea are light at the back. He\u2019s got Wilks to one side, Eaves the other ... and plays the ball straight to Tomori in the middle. \u201cThe FA cup is all about tradition and history,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. \u201cHow can Chelsea choose a Spursy White over the Royal Blue? The triumph of merchandise marketing over tradition. How sad!\u201d 39 min: Azpilicueta slides a precision pass down the right flank for Barkley, who is released into acres. He\u2019s got clear options in the middle, but looks for Batshuayi at the busy near post. The pass isn\u2019t much good, and Batshuayi\u2019s effort to stab home from a tight spot is easily blocked. 37 min: That was much better from the hosts. And a reminder for Chelsea that, despite their dominance, and all the chances created, their one-goal lead is a slender one. It\u2019s far from the first time this season that their chance creation/conversion ratio has been all out of whack. 35 min: Hull launch a rare attack, Bowen turning on a sixpence in midfield and dribbling towards the Chelsea box with purpose. He tries a shot but it doesn\u2019t come off. The ball breaks left for Wilks, whose cross is trapped by Bowen on the penalty spot. Bowen spins and shoots, meekly, straight at Caballero. 33 min: Hull, hypnotised by Chelsea\u2019s passing, are suddenly rudely woken up when Kovacic rolls a lovely pass down the inside left for Mount, who breaks clear but shoots straight at Long. The Hull keeper has already earned his corn this evening, whatever happens next. 32 min: And the KCOM is very quiet as a result. A full house, but it\u2019s only the small band of travelling Chelsea supporters who are making any noise. 30 min: Chelsea are toying with Hull at the moment. Hudson-Odoi, Barkley and Azpilicueta stroke it up and down the right, nearly opening up the hosts a couple of times. Hull are just about holding their shape, but they\u2019ve had to make a fair number of desperate last-ditch clearances. They can\u2019t keep going like this. 28 min: Mount trundles a ball along the corridor of uncertainty from the left. It invites a tap-in, but nobody in 1970 retro blue white has gambled. It\u2019s surely a matter of time before Chelsea make it two. 27 min: Kovacic finds Alonso down the left with a crisp pass. Alonso sends it into the box first time; Burke slides in to concede a corner before Batshuayi can get involved. From the corner, Barkley drags a shot wide right from distance. 25 min: Mount turns away from two men, deep in his own half, and strides upfield. He slips Hudson-Odoi into space down the right. The resulting cross isn\u2019t far away from Batshuayi. Tafazolli clears just in time. 23 min: Wilks tries to release Eaves down the left. But now he\u2019s the one overhitting an easy pass. One Wilks cross apart, Hull haven\u2019t caused Chelsea any real bother since falling behind. 21 min: Wilks is standing alone in acres of space on the left. Burke tries to release him with a simple pass, but hoicks straight into the stand. Hull\u2019s early confidence is kaput. Mount dribbles up the other end and sees a shot blocked on the edge of the Hull box. The way this match is going, it won\u2019t be long before Chelsea double their lead. 19 min: Before the free kick is taken, Azpilicueta and Da Silva are pulled aside for a good talking-to, having spent the last 30 seconds pushing and shoving each other. Eventually Mount is allowed to take, and it\u2019s easily cleared. 18 min: Mount rakes a long ball down the right. Lichaj should clear easily, but takes a heavy touch and clatters into Azpilicueta, who was sniffing around. A free kick for Chelsea just to the right of the box. 16 min: Now it\u2019s Chelsea who are first to everything. Mount slips a cute pass down the middle to release Barkley, who is clear on goal but shoots straight at Long. Worrying signs for Hull after that fast start. Chelsea have enjoyed 70% possession since taking the lead. 14 min: Barkley sprays the ball right for Azpilicueta, whose low cross is trapped by Batshuayi, on the edge of the six-yard box. But his back is to the goal, and he can\u2019t spin and shoot. No worries, he soon comes back at Hull again, chasing a Pedro pass down the left and fluttering the side netting with a deflected shot. The resulting corner is nothing to write home about. 12 min: Chelsea ping the ball around in a pretty style. They don\u2019t really go anywhere, just doing it because they can. 10 min: Lichaj bombs down the left and slips the ball forward for Wilks, who reaches the byline and loops towards the far post. Caballero flaps, and the ball lands at the feet of Eaves, just to the right of goal, six yards out. Or rather, the ball lands between the feet of Eaves. The striker can\u2019t sort himself out, and the ball clanks away from danger. 8 min: Chelsea were all over the shop for the first five minutes. But once they strung a few passes together, Hull were opened up with ease. A fortunate finish, mind. Chelsea, their tails up, win a couple of corners down the left as Hull reel from that sucker punch. They clear their lines eventually. Chelsea finally get into the Hull half. Their first attack. And they score. Azpilicueta tears down the right and crosses deep. Mount, coming in from the left, shoots straight into a thicket of Hull defenders. The ball breaks to Batshuayi on the penalty spot. A snapshot is deflected and bounces apologetically into the net. 4 min: Another loose ball in the midfield, and Hull are onto it first again. Kane slips a ball down the inside-right channel for Eaves, who nearly works space to shoot, but Zouma ushers the ball out for a corner. Again, the set piece is no good, but Hull are all over Chelsea like a rash in these opening exchanges. Chelsea in need of some Tiger balm. 3 min: Bowen bustles down the left and hooks a high ball into the box. Caballero rises above Eaves to claim. Hull are first to everything at the moment. Chelsea have started cold. 2 min: Honeyman works his way down the right again, playing a ball towards Bowen, just inside the box. Zouma is forced to block out for the first corner of the match. The set piece is a bit of a non-event. But this is a determined start by the Championship side. And we\u2019re off! The hosts get the party started. They\u2019re on the front foot immediately, Honeyman bursting down the right only to run the ball out for a goal kick. A full house at the KCOM, with noise to match. The teams are out! A good old-fashioned FA Cup atmosphere at the KCOM. It\u2019s cold on Humberside, despite the jets of fire parping pitchside during the pre-match pleasantries. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! And now here\u2019s Frank Lampard. \u201cWe need to get ourselves right, our mindset, how we approach the game. Giant killing, I understand that, I know the Championship very well. We must get it right. I loved it every time I won the FA Cup as a player, I loved it as a boy watching it, and all the Chelsea fans feel the same. The FA Cup has great history, and we have to tackle it head on. There are some players who don\u2019t play so regularly, it\u2019s important for me to use them. Individually there are opportunities everywhere. I know Grant McCann, we came through at West Ham together so I know how much he\u2019ll be up for this. People are expectant, they want to see us fail, so that\u2019s a test for us.\u201d A word with the Hull manager Grant McCann. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough challenge, but a good opportunity to test ourselves. Our boys are looking forward to the game, the stadium is full, and we\u2019re going to try to entertain. We\u2019re doing OK at the minute, we\u2019d like to be closer to the play-offs, that\u2019s our number-one priority but this is a nice distraction.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s bespoke FA Cup kit, marking the 50th anniversary of the very first time they lifted the famous old pot, really is a work of art. A shame, then, that they\u2019ll not be wearing it this evening. Slightly odd, having gone to such lengths, but marketing executives gotta market. Chelsea will instead wear second-choice white, while Hull sport the usual tiger print. Four changes for Hull City from the side that lost 1-0 at Derby. Out go Callum Elder, Josh Bowler, Jackson Irvine and Josh Magennis; in come Tom Eaves, Robbie McKenzie, George Honeyman and Mallik Wilks. Chelsea see Hull\u2019s four, and raise them four, with eight changes to the side that drew 2-2 with Arsenal. Out go Kepa, Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen, Emerson, Jorginho, N\u2019Golo Kante, Tammy Abraham and Willian; in come Willy Caballero, Kurt Zouma, Fikayo Tomori, Marcos Alonso, Ross Barkley, Mason Mount, Pedro and Michy Batshuayi. Hull City: Long, McKenzie, Burke, Tafazolli, Lichaj, Da Silva, Kane, Honeyman, Bowen, Wilks, Eaves. Subs: Grosicki, Ingram, McLoughlin, Kingsley, Magennis, Irvine, Samuelsen. Chelsea: Caballero, Azpilicueta, Zouma, Tomori, Alonso, Barkley, Kovacic, Mount, Pedro, Batshuayi, Hudson-Odoi. Subs: Christensen, Willian, Cumming, Emerson, Gilmour, Lamptey, Maatsen. Referee: Craig Pawson (South Yorkshire). Chelsea, fourth in the Premier League, should see off Hull City, mid-table in the Championship. Shouldn\u2019t they? Well, they\u2019ve won their last seven games against Hull. And while they\u2019re not exactly the model of consistency under Frank Lampard, they dealt with Nottingham Forest, another Championship team, easily enough in the third round. Hull, meanwhile, have lost their last two matches, 180 minutes of football which saw them register a grand total of three attempts on target. Put it that way, and only one result seems possible. Thing is, this is the FA Cup. So you never know. Which is why we all tune in. Can the 2014 runners-up beat the 1970, 1997, 2000, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2018 winners? Or vice versa? It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm GMT.",

But on Saturday, the team mostly avoided the fever swamps, focusing instead on rebutting the prosecution\u2019s case. Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel whose surname the prosecution never quite agreed on how to pronounce (it\u2019s SIP-uh-loan-ee), began with a time-honored trick of the trade: he flipped the script, seeking to turn those trying to impeach Trump into the villains who undermine American democracy. \u201cThey,\u201d he said, his voice indignant as he faced the prosecution, \u201care here to perpetuate the most massive interference in an election in American history.\u201d The Democrats \u2013 who just laid out a comprehensive case accusing Trump of soliciting help from Ukraine to undermine his political rivals in the next presidential election \u2013 are asking the Senate to not only remove the president from office, Cipollone said, but to \u201cremove president Trump from the ballot\u201d in 2020. \u201cThey are asking you to tear up all of the ballots across this country on your own initiative, take that decision away from the American People,\u201d he implored.

In the chamber on Saturday, there was a shift in mood, a changing of the guard after three very long days.

Second-place Exeter were held to a scoreless draw at home against Colchester, allowing Plymouth to close the gap in third. The Pilgrims\u2019 2-1 win over Stevenage \u2013 delayed by floodlight failure in the second half at the Lamex \u2013 consigned the home side back to the foot of the table. Morecambe, who started the day bottom, drew with Cambridge to leapfrog Stevenage. Adam Phillips put the Shrimps ahead in the first half but Harvey Knibbs levelled with 22 minutes left on the clock. Macclesfield pulled themselves away from danger despite going down to 10 men against play-off hopefuls Forest Green Rovers. Carl Winchester\u2019s 18th-minute effort had the away side ahead until the 75th minute when Joe Ironside levelled. Corey O\u2019Keeffe saw red for Town five minutes later for hacking down Josh March but Arthur Gnahoua looped in a superb strike to give the hosts an unlikely win. Crawley and Grimsby split five goals at the People\u2019s Pension Stadium, as the visitors left empty-handed. Both sides led in the first half but goals from Ollie Palmer, his second, and Ashley Nadesan in the last 20 minutes were enough to earn all three points. Strikes from Danny Rose, Nicky Maynard and Andy Cook saw Mansfield brush aside Bradford 3-0 at Field Mill. Leyton Orient ended a six game winless run as all the goals in their 2-1 victory over Newport County came in the last 15 minutes. Ryan Haynes put in his own net from James Brophy\u2019s corner with nine minutes remaining before Ruel Sotiriou sealed victory shortly after. Jamile Matt headed home a stoppage time consolation for the Exiles.",

Amid all of the inevitable non-Indigenous nationalist hyperbole that\u2019ll be megaphoned your way, there is an alternative, quieter but insistent political, social and environmental conversation happening about bushfires and carbon mitigation and what that all means when it comes to being Australian today. This 26 January, as the country burns, as our government becomes the ever-greater subject of international ridicule over its recalcitrance on emissions mitigation, the national mood is one of ennui and despair. There is a deep introspection about caring for country and global responsibility that will more energetically than ever defy the official celebrations on this most divisive day of national self-congratulation, imbued though they\u2019ll be from the top with the politically convenient, she\u2019ll-be-right distraction of Aussie stoicism. Fire and carbon are, ironically perhaps, central to what I think really should be the focus of national reflection on any day of the year \u2013 the key to connecting with this continent\u2019s heart and what we should hold dearest. I\u2019m talking about continental human existence and the increasing evidence that Indigenous people were in this place 120,000 years ago. That\u2019s 55,000 years longer than the generally agreed scientific proposition of 65,000 years of Aboriginal civilisation.

But scholars of various disciplines have interpreted the findings with differing levels of conviction and scepticism. Bowler, perhaps with an eye to posterity and very much wanting his own convictions on record, wrote to me ahead of 26 January pointing out a long academic article he\u2019d just published to reiterate his conviction that his research at Moyjil has convinced him of a 120,000-year human continental habitation. \u201cWith the approach of yet another \u2018Australia Day\u2019, any failure to acknowledge at least the very high level of 120,000-year occupation will come back to bite us,\u201d he wrote.

A grower at the Sydney flower markets, he has grown exotic shrubs and trees for the markets for over 20 years. I spied <em>jasminum sambac</em> \u2013 not one cultivar but many, like my favourite the double petal Grand Duke of Tuscany resembling an old-fashioned rose crossed with a gardenia. I had seen them before in other gardens in Australia but they are still quite rare. Often the other gardens would be owned by other south-east Asian families.</p> <p>In Thai it is simply known as Mali, my aunt\u2019s name was Mali and she adored flowers and plants. My association to this bloom is admittedly personal, but isn\u2019t that most synergistic relationship that we have with nature?</p> <p>Mali is the flower you will see in temples, woven into leis and offered up with prayers. Mali is the flower given on Thai Mother\u2019s day and the national flower of Indonesia. An abundance of blooms floated in clay drinking water urns are placed in front of homes traditionally to be scooped out with a dried coconut ladle on to small cool pewter cups to serve to guest on arrival, offered as a sign of respect and generosity.</p> <p>It is also the jasmine referred to in the fragrant jasmine rice, which unlike jasmine tea has no actual jasmine in it. However if you\u2019ve ever been near a pot of it cooking, the aroma of it wafting into your olfactory senses will remind you of walking past a garden full of Mali at dusk.</p> <p>Science has isolated the fragrance to the presence of the chemical compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. No surprise then that it is also present in jasmine sambac cultivars and also pandan! And edamame! Which blew my mind because I remember my first garden edamame harvest and thinking that it smelled so distinctly like jasmine sambac and pandan, which was confusing as they were not yet in bloom. Neither had the pandan been cut, which is the way to release the fragrance. As it turns out, many plants contain this compound, though most associated with jasmine sambac due to it\u2019s high presence.</p> <p>Perhaps that is why Thai and south-east Asian desserts are so compelling \u2013 so many desserts are literally steeped in jasmine sambac syrup which trigger other food memories that are intertwined with childhood, love and comfort.</p> <p>It is now quite common to see synthetic essences of jasmine(like vanilla essence) being used to make Thai desserts \u2013 it is very easy to source at most Asian grocery stores. What a shame though; steeping the flowers in simple syrup overnight has a far more alluring effect and is easy enough to do if you have a plant. They are prolific in season and new blossoms appear daily, and they can be pruned into a bush or can be trained onto trellising.</p> <p>I felt very justified walking away from my first encounter with Peter at Flemington markets with not one but 10 Grand Duke of Tuscany Jasminum sambacs \u2026 after all they are edible too.</p> <h2>Nahm hom mali jasmine water</h2> <p>Filter water into a jug or jar and float 3-5 rinsed jasmine sambac blooms on top and refrigerate for a couple of hours. Every time you come to have a drink, top up with more water and after a day or so you might notice that the petals will become translucent which is an indication that it is time to go and gather new blooms.</p> <p>You will end up with a heavenly sweet scented beverage that is sugar-free, refreshing and utterly delicious. Serve it to your guests and watch their reaction, I bet they ask for another glass.</p>",

I spent an inordinate amount of time obsessing over varieties of rosemary and thyme, in the end I decided to plant all of them. I did feel conflicted about pulling out the existing roses but gosh, they had been sprayed so much and had aphids all over them so out they went too. As a compromise I replanted in their place Damask rose, widely used culinarily and cosmetically. One morning during a 5am Flemington market run for the restaurants I met Peter. A grower at the Sydney flower markets, he has grown exotic shrubs and trees for the markets for over 20 years. I spied jasminum sambac \u2013 not one cultivar but many, like my favourite the double petal Grand Duke of Tuscany resembling an old-fashioned rose crossed with a gardenia. I had seen them before in other gardens in Australia but they are still quite rare. Often the other gardens would be owned by other south-east Asian families. In Thai it is simply known as Mali, my aunt\u2019s name was Mali and she adored flowers and plants. My association to this bloom is admittedly personal, but isn\u2019t that most synergistic relationship that we have with nature? Mali is the flower you will see in temples, woven into leis and offered up with prayers. Mali is the flower given on Thai Mother\u2019s day and the national flower of Indonesia. An abundance of blooms floated in clay drinking water urns are placed in front of homes traditionally to be scooped out with a dried coconut ladle on to small cool pewter cups to serve to guest on arrival, offered as a sign of respect and generosity. It is also the jasmine referred to in the fragrant jasmine rice, which unlike jasmine tea has no actual jasmine in it. However if you\u2019ve ever been near a pot of it cooking, the aroma of it wafting into your olfactory senses will remind you of walking past a garden full of Mali at dusk. Science has isolated the fragrance to the presence of the chemical compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. No surprise then that it is also present in jasmine sambac cultivars and also pandan! And edamame! Which blew my mind because I remember my first garden edamame harvest and thinking that it smelled so distinctly like jasmine sambac and pandan, which was confusing as they were not yet in bloom. Neither had the pandan been cut, which is the way to release the fragrance. As it turns out, many plants contain this compound, though most associated with jasmine sambac due to it\u2019s high presence. Perhaps that is why Thai and south-east Asian desserts are so compelling \u2013 so many desserts are literally steeped in jasmine sambac syrup which trigger other food memories that are intertwined with childhood, love and comfort. It is now quite common to see synthetic essences of jasmine(like vanilla essence) being used to make Thai desserts \u2013 it is very easy to source at most Asian grocery stores. What a shame though; steeping the flowers in simple syrup overnight has a far more alluring effect and is easy enough to do if you have a plant. They are prolific in season and new blossoms appear daily, and they can be pruned into a bush or can be trained onto trellising. I felt very justified walking away from my first encounter with Peter at Flemington markets with not one but 10 Grand Duke of Tuscany Jasminum sambacs \u2026 after all they are edible too. Nahm hom mali jasmine water Filter water into a jug or jar and float 3-5 rinsed jasmine sambac blooms on top and refrigerate for a couple of hours. Every time you come to have a drink, top up with more water and after a day or so you might notice that the petals will become translucent which is an indication that it is time to go and gather new blooms. You will end up with a heavenly sweet scented beverage that is sugar-free, refreshing and utterly delicious. Serve it to your guests and watch their reaction, I bet they ask for another glass.",

      "bodyText": "It should be one of Australia\u2019s premier tourist destinations \u2013 a remote Indian ocean island with beautiful palm-fringed beaches, coral reefs, turquoise waters and fascinating wildlife. Instead, Christmas Island has made its name as a notorious prison, home to a sprawling detention centre, purpose-built and razor-wired \u2013 and which holds just four occupants, two of them small children. Sri Lankans Priya, Nades and their two bright-eyed toddlers captured hearts and minds in 2018 when Australian authorities grabbed the family from their home in a dawn raid in the Queensland town of Biloela, and sent them to a detention centre in Melbourne. In August 2019 they were dramatically loaded onto a plane to be deported to Sri Lanka, only to be grounded by a mid-air court injunction. Instead the government sent them to Christmas Island, 2,600km from the Australian mainland, far from advocates, lawyers, healthcare, friends and supporters. In the peak years of Australia\u2019s offshore detention program the centre held thousands of people. It was controversially reopened in March 2019, then closed again just weeks later, having cost $185m without a single person being detained. Tens of millions of dollars more have been spent, and more than 100 people employed, to detain and guard the Biloela family. Four people sleeping in one bed, in a centre with scores of buildings. Tampa, hunger strikes and a prime ministerial visit Christmas Island has existed as a place of detention in evolving forms of purpose and severity since the turn of the century. Far from the Australian mainland but close to Indonesia, it has been a target destination for people travelling by boat to claim asylum on Australian soil. There have been riots at the detention centre, and there have been deaths. The expansion, then closure and subsequent reopening of the centre has played havoc with the island\u2019s economy and angered residents, who are sick of it, says the island\u2019s mayor, Gordon Thomson. \u201cIf you\u2019re a planner you would say \u2018close the fucking detention centre, knock it over, turn it into a chook farm, and never ever open it again\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause planners like an even keel. [The up and down] is what we\u2019ve had forever and we hate it.\u201d Thomson, who is also general secretary of the Union of Christmas Island Workers and a Labor party member, describes himself as an advocate for the residents, and acknowledges there have been a variety of opinions over the years. In the early 2000s the island\u2019s residents wanted a dual purpose facility built which would be used to process asylum seekers and for recreation purposes, he recalls. But then, in 2001, came the Tampa. Thomson says he was among those calling for the 438 asylum seekers picked up by the Norwegian freighter to be brought ashore, but instead the Howard government embarked on its infamous standoff, which led to the closure of the island\u2019s port. \u201cAt the time, getting people to support a rally there were two things \u2013 we wanted the port opened and for the refugees to land,\u201d Thomson says. \u201cIt was about human rights and our responsibility to uphold them, not about the economy. But there was not universal support for that position.\u201d What Thomson describes as the Howard government\u2019s \u201chighly authoritarian shit\u201d escalated over the following years. A high-security facility was built, and Christmas Island was excised from the mainland\u2019s migration zone. In 2010, 48 people died when their asylum boat smashed against the rocks. From 2011 to 2015 there were a series of incidents including protests, hunger strikes, and riots, and detainee levels far above capacity. Iranian asylum seeker Faizel Chegani escaped over the fence and took his own life, and conditions for asylum seekers became even more restrictive. The island\u2019s tourism industry was all but destroyed. Eventually the centre emptied out and in 2018 it was put in \u201chot contingency\u201d \u2013 essentially closed, but with a staff of about 12 ready to reopen at a moment\u2019s notice. Less than five months later that moment came, amid a new round of boat-related rhetoric. Its reanimation was accompanied by the first-ever prime ministerial visit to the island, dismissed as a galling PR stunt. Mainland Serco guards were offered secondments at inflated pay, health staff were hired for a new medical centre that would be off limits to island residents, whose health system is so under-resourced that complex fractures and childbirth cases are sent to the mainland. But no one came. The $26m detention centre with 109 staff and four detainees The only people were and remain Nades, Priya, Kopika and Tharunicaa, under the watch of 109 taxpayer-funded staff. The current chapter has cost $26.8m since the centre was melodramatically reopened in February 2019 to prepare for the hordes of people the government said it would be forced to deal with because of the medevac laws. Those laws \u2013 which enabled doctors to have sick refugees and asylum seekers transferred to Australia for care or assessment \u2013 have been repealed. No one was ever sent to Christmas Island, except the Biloela family. Despite promises to close the centre after the repeal, the government has signed a three-year $20m contract with an island-based mining firm to run the centre, as Guardian Australia revealed last year. The former Christmas Island administrator Jon Stanhope described the contract as a \u201cpatently political decision\u201d. \u201cIt was designed to make the prime minister and the home affairs minister look tough on asylum seekers, and it was designed to wedge the Labor party, which it does successfully because the Labor party is so weak and conflicted on the issue.\u201d The slow process of the Biloela family\u2019s final court hearings is now under way, but the government refuses to take them back to Melbourne and so they remain inside a low-security wing under the watch of 96 body camera-wearing Serco personnel, nine medical workers, and two officers from Australian Border Force. The UN has called for their release, but was ignored by Australia. Speaking in broken English and through a translator, Priya says her husband and children are now in reasonable health, but she is finding their circumstances very difficult. \u201cWhen I was moved from Melbourne the Serco officers, the way they handled me, I have bad pain on my shoulder and my neck. I\u2019m finding it hard to sleep and finding it really painful,\u201d she says. \u201cMy neck, shoulder and one side of my face is very painful but the doctor here said they can\u2019t do a CT scan here, so they just give me pain relief. \u201cThat is really bothering me because now I can\u2019t carry my children.\u201d The family share one queen-sized bed. Asked what impact this has had on her relationship with Nades, Priya says she would like to answer the question. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any kind of a closeness as a husband and wife here because the situation with the rules is that all four of us are in one queen bed,\u201d she says. \u201cSo for months I have not slept next to my husband.\u201d Priya says they feel lonely. \u201cEven if we were in jail there would be other inmates we could talk to. Here there is no one.\u201d The two young girls have experienced several birthdays in detention, and separation from their only friend \u2013 a young Vietnamese toddler, Isabella, who was born in the Melbourne detention centre where the family has spent the last couple of years. On Christmas Island her daughters play with leftover broken toys from when children were last detained there. They socialise a little with local children, but their time is restricted, and during school holidays they are not free to leave the centre. Priya says she has been told that is for insurance reasons. \u201cI did ask if they could go visit a friend\u2019s place and come back, even if the guards were there but they refused and said it\u2019s not safe to go,\u201d she says. \u201cThe school and the playgroup is government property. Unless it\u2019s government property they won\u2019t take us.\u201d Figures provided by the department reveal that by the time the family arrived on Christmas Island, $26.8m had already been spent on the reopened centre. On top of the $26.8m spent reopening the centre, the family\u2019s detention and legal costs have so far cost more than $4.5m, according to the department of home affairs. Priya does not understand how the government could spend that much money just on their detention, and says she feels \u201csad\u201d to hear the number. \u201cThe life I am living and the situation and the room that I\u2019m in \u2013 to spend $4.5m on setting up this detention centre with Serco officers and other people, they must be spending the money on them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Serco officers keep changing every three or six weeks, so the transport for them and charter flights, they must be spending money on that. Because the way we are living I think we don\u2019t even have the basics that we need.\u201d",

But I do love Australia. I get an absurd amount of irrational pride when I hear of Australians doing well. When I read stories that Indigenous rock art might be among the oldest in the world I get excited and think, yeah suck it, caves of Cantabria! I can still remember where I was when John Aloisi scored the winning penalty against Uruguay (jumping up in my home in Cairns and cutting my hand on the overhead fan), and like all sensible Australians I let out a deep groan whenever I hear someone start yet again an \u201cAussie, Aussie, Aussie\u201d chant at the tennis. But my love has nothing to do with Australian Day and no, this is not an article about Australia Day. I mean, of course we should change the date. As one who grew up in country South Australia from German ancestors, the English landing in Sydney has never resonated for me as anything more than New South Wales Proclamation Day. Thanks for the holiday and the cricket at Adelaide Oval, but otherwise ... Keep the public holiday \u2013 make it the last Monday in January \u2013 it is nicely timed to signal an end to the summer holidays. Call it \u201cSummer Day\u201d or some such and then find another day to actually celebrate the nation. Better still, become a republic and make it that day. But I digress. This is not about Australia Day, but climate change. Because I love Australia, and the real question is why don\u2019t conservatives who refuse to do more on climate change love Australia? Because climate change will destroy much of what we love about this country of ours. Much of what makes Australia unique and beloved by those of us lucky enough to live here is linked to the extremes of our land and climate. In my lifetime I have mostly lived in country areas \u2013 in South Australia on the Murray River, in Redlynch just north of Cairns, and now in the northern suburbs of the bush capital that is Canberra. So I love our biggest river and the farming areas of wheat, sheep and dairy around my home town to the grapes and fruit in the Riverland where during uni I picked fruit in the summer holidays. Then there are the tropics with Mossman Gorge, the glorious drive from Cairns to Port Douglas, the Great Barrier Reef and the late afternoon rains. And yes, I love the surrounds of Canberra \u2013 where I can live near a national park with kangaroos and echidnas and be able to see the snow caps on the Brindabellas in winter and fiery red of the trees in autumn and the blossoms in spring. As anyone who has spent any time overseas knows, there is something about the sky in Australia that is different \u2013 that shade of blue so perfectly captured by Tom Roberts in his painting A Break Away!. That gorgeous clear, crisp blue. I must admit I don\u2019t love Dorothea Mackellar\u2019s My Country. I find the poem rather maudlin, but perhaps I am biased because I am sick of hearing climate change-denying politicians recite it as though it is evidence that climate change has not occurred. Because here\u2019s the thing: when she published that poem in 1908, the average annual temperature in Australia was about 2C lower than it is now. And those conservatives who recite the line about \u201ca sunburnt country\u201d ignore that climate change is going to wreak havoc with everything we love \u2013 that tenuous balance of droughts and flooding rains, the ability of agriculture to exist on \u201cthirsty paddocks\u201d, our rivers, our wildlife where \u201corchids deck the treetops\u201d, even the crisp air and \u201cpitiless blue sky\u201d. This summer has shown how precarious our Australian lifestyle is \u2013 the bushfires that have not stopped since September; the mix of fires, smoke, dust, hail (and that is just in Canberra in the past fortnight). We are a nation on the extremities, where climate change will affect and strip away what we love much sooner than will occur in Europe and North America. No patriotic Australian can be anything but angry to read stories of a billion or more animals killed in the fires \u2013 especially when you realise the koalas on Kangaroo Island are chlamydia-free and are essentially the best protection against their extinction. Our wildlife is so exceptional and precious that the upset in balance that comes from climate change will render some habitats unliveable. To read that the platypus is facing extinction due to human activity exacerbated by climate change should have every patriotic Australian filled with rage. Conservative patriots love to talk up Australia \u201cpunching above its weight\u201d on things such as sport or business or war, but they turn to self-hating cowards when it comes to climate change. Yes, Australia \u201conly\u201d accounts for around 1.3% of emissions (of course well above what you would expect given our population), but given the fragility of our ecosystem, any political leaders who profess to love Australia should be energising our diplomatic networks and using every economic and political lever we have to cajole, convince and encourage other nations to act on climate change. We should do this even if it is out of purely selfish reasons of loving our country and wanting it to remain in the same state that has caused that love. If you love Australia, climate change should scare the hell out of you because the reef, our rivers, our wildlife, our fresh air, even, as we have seen since December, our relaxed summer holidays are going to be stripped away from us. Our government has more reason than most others outside of the Pacific Islands to be demanding global action on climate change. Given our wealth we should be leading the way \u2013 leading by example rather than leading to ruin as our current government has been at the most recent climate change conferences. What we love about Australia will be taken by climate change well before other nations who emit much more greenhouse gas will feel great changes. And that should enrage us and our representatives, and it should drive their actions. I love Australia and so I want action on climate change. And if you love Australia, so should you. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "body": "<p>As the initial devastating shock of this summer\u2019s bushfires recedes, homeowners and authorities have begun to grapple with urgent questions about how or whether to rebuild more than 2,000 properties destroyed across south-eastern Australia.</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s not just those who lost their homes who will need to rethink. With extreme weather likely to extend bushfire seasons, experts say more Australians must consider the bushfire resilience of their homes, and those living in at-risk areas should consider retrofitting or rebuilding. And for some communities it could be time to come up with an entirely new town plan.</p> \n<p>There has been much discussion about whether to rebuild.

Usually it takes those affected a few months to get in touch, Cotter says, surprised at the flurry. And they aren\u2019t just asking about how to meet the minimum bushfire standards, but also about affordability and sustainability. Cotter welcomes this development because houses that are built to high bushfire-proof standards are also energy efficient.</p> \n<p>\u201c[Perhaps] people who are still without power are thinking: is there a way around that in the future?\u201d she says.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Rebuilding has to be much more holistic or we are just doomed to repeat previous failures</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Kate Cotter, Bushfire Building Council of Australia</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>For research architect Ian Weir, the first step for homeowners thinking about building or rebuilding in bushfire-prone areas is to get an independent attack level assessment of their property.

It\u2019s something he hopes governments will subsidise.</p> \n<p>The national bushfire attack level ratings (BAL) range from low to dangerously high and are based on the severity of potential exposure to ember attack, radiant heat and direct flame contact.

The risk is categorised across six levels, known as the <a href=\"https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/plan-and-prepare/building-in-a-bush-fire-area/building-after-bush-fire/your-level-of-risk\">\u201cbushfire attack level\u201d (BAL)</a>.</p>\n    <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to build on a site that has been inspected, and then is being categorised as a BAL-FZ (the highest rating), then that\u2019s about the toughest set of requirements you\u2019ll need to comply with,\u201d said Raymond Loveridge, an adjunct professor at the University of Technology, Sydney. \u201cAnd they\u2019re mandatory.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The BAL rating covers building materials such as floors, walls, roofs, doors, windows, vents, drainage, verandahs, and water and gas pipes.</p>\n    <p>At the higher end, Loveridge said, there may be requirements for fire-resistant timber, but generally you can build the home as you\u2019d like provided you can \u201csatisfy the building certifier that what you\u2019re proposing to build will comply with the mandatory performance requirement\u201d.</p>\n    <p>\u201cThe main concern of the government is how the building will perform, not how individuals will put the Lego together to achieve that outcome.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The cost of building bushfire-resilient homes need not be prohibitive. An expensive architect is not essential. A local draftsman or building designer can help \u2013 as long as they have experience in working with the risk of bushfires in mind.</p> \n<p>There are also plenty of free resources available.

The roof is covered in soil, making it highly fire resistant. The off-grid house is built entirely with recycled or recyclable materials, including a 100% recycled concrete slab and a steel frame made with crushed recycled brick and insulated with straw bales. Completed in 2015, the construction cost about $600,000,</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of people say they can\u2019t afford to build sustainable houses\u201d, Bakker says. \u201cBut maybe we should build slightly smaller houses and spend more money making them resilient. When you make a house bushfire-resilient, you are also making it a better house and it uses less energy when you live in it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Building bushfire-resilient houses obviously demands a move away from traditional aesthetics, such as timber decks, but they don\u2019t have to be concrete bunkers.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou only really need to robust design if your house is perched right up against the bush and it\u2019s going to receive direct flame contact,\u201d says Leonard. \u201cAnd [the compliance standards] will give you the specs on how you build a non-concrete box type house that actually can withstand flames.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/39391077\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/39391077?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  CSIRO burn-tested the building system behind Joost Bakker\u2019s Kinglake home to make sure it would survive extreme bushfires.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A bushfire-resilient house can be a simple design, says Cotter. It\u2019s the detailing and the materials that matter. Bushfire-proof windows, doors and roofs, steel walkways and non-combustible cladding can make the difference between survival and not. The cost of some of these has come down recently, although things like fireproof windows systems are still expensive, something Cotter hopes the industry will address.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of places where people are losing houses are in our most beautiful regions, the coastal areas or mountains, so you want to be able to have some larger sized windows,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s important to think of the property as a whole, rather than separating architecture and landscaping, says Cotter. Fencing, access and the proximity of combustible habitat should all be considered.</p> \n<p>House gaps should be sealed up or filled with metal meshes to avoid any embers, and sprinklers can also be helpful. Bunkers are another way to manage risk, says Cotter: \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want people\u2019s houses to burn down, that\u2019s what matters, but we have to have back up for life safety.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13c0511e8d997ceb99af1d91364ff4098c460623\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13c0511e8d997ceb99af1d91364ff4098c460623/0_0_6144_4096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Kinglake house was built with low toxin and recycled or recyclable materials.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Kinglake house was built with low toxin and recycled or recyclable materials.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Foxtel/Rhiannon Slatter</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While the current focus is on rebuilding devastated homes, there is an even larger problem on the horizon: retrofitting existing properties.

The experts say the scale of the recent fires could be an impetus to reconsider plans for developments, or to reimagine existing ones. Leonard would like communities to come up with masterplans for their towns in case of bushfire, to consider whether the property boundaries are right, reconfigure how the houses are laid out, and get critical services laid in.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e4de2579eac47fd580c84b1daa29bd8216529be\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e4de2579eac47fd580c84b1daa29bd8216529be/0_0_3264_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rosedale home survived when neighbouring homes burn down.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rosedale home survived when neighbouring homes burn down.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Caddaye architect</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cotter agrees: \u201cIf we could invest in building in a smarter way, everybody benefits [and] we\u2019ll reduce the risk for the next bushfire that is likely to come \u2026 If you\u2019ve got an old house next to a new house [and it] catches fire, it will burn the next house and the next house, like a domino effect. Rebuilding has to be much more holistic or we are just doomed to repeat previous failures.\u201d</p> \n<p>It comes down to political will, she says: \u201cDo we want to put the money into community measures, do we want to look at retrofitting or do we want to just shut these places down? [Ultimately] we\u2019d have to move millions of people every decade, away from bushfire, and eventually we just won\u2019t have anywhere else to go.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the initial devastating shock of this summer\u2019s bushfires recedes, homeowners and authorities have begun to grapple with urgent questions about how or whether to rebuild more than 2,000 properties destroyed across south-eastern Australia. But it\u2019s not just those who lost their homes who will need to rethink. With extreme weather likely to extend bushfire seasons, experts say more Australians must consider the bushfire resilience of their homes, and those living in at-risk areas should consider retrofitting or rebuilding. And for some communities it could be time to come up with an entirely new town plan. There has been much discussion about whether to rebuild. Three planning experts recently told Guardian Australia that destroyed homes in the riskiest areas should not be rebuilt, recommending that the state government buy the land. That\u2019s valid in the most dangerous areas, says Kate Cotter, chief executive of the Bushfire Building Council of Australia, but it won\u2019t work for all properties. She estimates there are 2m properties within 100m of bushland, putting them at extreme risk. As the risk of fires increases, there will be fewer areas that can confidently be declared safe. \u201cOur view is that we have to manage the risk, and if we don\u2019t do it then we\u2019re going to keep losing,\u201d Cotter says. In the past few weeks, the council has been swamped by calls from those considering rebuilding. Usually it takes those affected a few months to get in touch, Cotter says, surprised at the flurry. And they aren\u2019t just asking about how to meet the minimum bushfire standards, but also about affordability and sustainability. Cotter welcomes this development because houses that are built to high bushfire-proof standards are also energy efficient. \u201c[Perhaps] people who are still without power are thinking: is there a way around that in the future?\u201d she says. For research architect Ian Weir, the first step for homeowners thinking about building or rebuilding in bushfire-prone areas is to get an independent attack level assessment of their property. He stresses this should be independent, rather than relying on council assessors, and says the peak body Fire Protection Association of Australia can provide referrals. It\u2019s something he hopes governments will subsidise. The national bushfire attack level ratings (BAL) range from low to dangerously high and are based on the severity of potential exposure to ember attack, radiant heat and direct flame contact. Homes compliant with high BAL ratings can survive even the worst blazes, such as the beach house in Rosedale, on the NSW south coast, that remained intact while neighbouring homes burnt to the ground. Lower BAL ratings are just a baseline and should not be considered fireproofing. Weir also recommends homeowners get hold of a copy of the Australian standards AS3959 to educate themselves about building in these areas. \u201c[With these two things] they would be getting themselves out of the dark as far as understanding what their level of risk, what management requirements they would have for land, and what they would have to do to build a new home.\u201d Strengths and weaknesses CSIRO\u2019s bushfire expert Dr Justin Leonard says the most important thing is that the owner understands the strengths and weaknesses of the planned home. \u201cYou could have a fantastic architect-designed house with plenty of cool features but if, in the first year of ownership, they build a garden shed off the side of it, all of a sudden the whole house is as weak as its weakest link,\u201d he says. The cost of building bushfire-resilient homes need not be prohibitive. An expensive architect is not essential. A local draftsman or building designer can help \u2013 as long as they have experience in working with the risk of bushfires in mind. There are also plenty of free resources available. Joost Bakker, the eco designer behind BuildByJoost buildings, has made the plans and specifications for a fireproof house that he built in Kinglake, Victoria, freely available via the Bushfire Building Council of Australia. Architects Assist also helps those affected by bushfires by referring them to architects or builders who will provide free design and planning approval services. Before construction of Bakker\u2019s Kinglake house began, its building system was successfully burn-tested by the CSIRO under extreme conditions. The roof is covered in soil, making it highly fire resistant. The off-grid house is built entirely with recycled or recyclable materials, including a 100% recycled concrete slab and a steel frame made with crushed recycled brick and insulated with straw bales. Completed in 2015, the construction cost about $600,000, \u201cA lot of people say they can\u2019t afford to build sustainable houses\u201d, Bakker says. \u201cBut maybe we should build slightly smaller houses and spend more money making them resilient. When you make a house bushfire-resilient, you are also making it a better house and it uses less energy when you live in it.\u201d Building bushfire-resilient houses obviously demands a move away from traditional aesthetics, such as timber decks, but they don\u2019t have to be concrete bunkers. \u201cYou only really need to robust design if your house is perched right up against the bush and it\u2019s going to receive direct flame contact,\u201d says Leonard. \u201cAnd [the compliance standards] will give you the specs on how you build a non-concrete box type house that actually can withstand flames.\u201d A bushfire-resilient house can be a simple design, says Cotter. It\u2019s the detailing and the materials that matter. Bushfire-proof windows, doors and roofs, steel walkways and non-combustible cladding can make the difference between survival and not. The cost of some of these has come down recently, although things like fireproof windows systems are still expensive, something Cotter hopes the industry will address. \u201cA lot of places where people are losing houses are in our most beautiful regions, the coastal areas or mountains, so you want to be able to have some larger sized windows,\u201d she says. It\u2019s important to think of the property as a whole, rather than separating architecture and landscaping, says Cotter. Fencing, access and the proximity of combustible habitat should all be considered. House gaps should be sealed up or filled with metal meshes to avoid any embers, and sprinklers can also be helpful. Bunkers are another way to manage risk, says Cotter: \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want people\u2019s houses to burn down, that\u2019s what matters, but we have to have back up for life safety.\u201d While the current focus is on rebuilding devastated homes, there is an even larger problem on the horizon: retrofitting existing properties. The building council says 90% of homes in dangerous regions in Australia are not bushfire-resilient, and the cost of retrofitting can be considerable. \u201cIt\u2019s always more expensive to get a poorly designed house and start changing bits out until it works really well rather than start from scratch,\u201d Leonard says. Cotter thinks it\u2019s critical that the government subsidises retrofitting on a large scale: \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it, we then just have to accept the losses.\u201d Building smarter towns To make communities safer, rebuilding or retrofitting individual buildings is only part of the answer. The experts say the scale of the recent fires could be an impetus to reconsider plans for developments, or to reimagine existing ones. Leonard would like communities to come up with masterplans for their towns in case of bushfire, to consider whether the property boundaries are right, reconfigure how the houses are laid out, and get critical services laid in. Cotter agrees: \u201cIf we could invest in building in a smarter way, everybody benefits [and] we\u2019ll reduce the risk for the next bushfire that is likely to come \u2026 If you\u2019ve got an old house next to a new house [and it] catches fire, it will burn the next house and the next house, like a domino effect. Rebuilding has to be much more holistic or we are just doomed to repeat previous failures.\u201d It comes down to political will, she says: \u201cDo we want to put the money into community measures, do we want to look at retrofitting or do we want to just shut these places down? [Ultimately] we\u2019d have to move millions of people every decade, away from bushfire, and eventually we just won\u2019t have anywhere else to go.\u201d",

After popping the question, CJ was hit by a car and lost his sight.

As his bride approached he regained his vision. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful\u201d he told her, and really meant it. Magic.</p> <p>This miraculous recovery would be mirrored three years later at the wedding of Shane (Dieter Brummer) and Angel (Melissa George) on Home and Away, which saw a wheelchair-bound Angel regain her strength to hobble down the aisle.</p> <h2><strong>5.

She fled her first wedding after a her fiance\u2019s attempts at philandering were revealed mid-ceremony; had a happy second wedding, but lost her husband Flynn to cancer; jilted her third fiance, Brad, on their wedding day after realising she was not ready to move on from Flynn.

In a multi-episode send-off arc in 2008, Sally departed Summer Bay to travel the world.</p> <h2><strong>4. Tony and Tania\u2019s publicity bonanza on The Young Doctors (1978)</strong></h2> <p>In a precursor to many of today\u2019s medical dramas, the titular Young Doctors (and nurses) on this long-running Australian soap spent as much time romancing each other as they did saving lives. But the biggest wedding of all \u2013 which Mercado suggests may have been one of the most expensive in Australian TV history \u2013 was between sexy Spanish doctor Tony and the young nurse Tania, played by Tony Alvarez and Judy McBurney respectively.</p> <p>At the time episodes did not air simultaneously across the country so to coincide with their wedding\u2019s air dates Alvarez and McBurney embarked on a national publicity tour. Channel Nine rented real wedding chapels in every capital city and the actors staged mock weddings for huge groups of fans. Afterwards the pair were flooded with wedding gifts from the public. While memories of the tour linger, the on-screen romance proved less permanent. Alvarez left the show<strong> </strong>the following year.</p> <h2><strong>3. Rose and Julian on Number 96 (1972)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd940a85ea11422d8a97cb15785f0882de81929\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd940a85ea11422d8a97cb15785f0882de81929/0_0_935_684/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rose (Vivienne Garrett) and Julian (Lew Luton) (gets married in the soap opera Number 96.\" width=\"500\" height=\"366\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose (Vivienne Garrett) and Julian (Lew Luton) (gets married in the soap opera Number 96.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cash Harmon Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the first Australian television show to feature nudity and homosexual main characters, Number 96 broke many boundaries. But not all of them were positive. Vivienne Garrett, who portrayed Rose Godolfus, broke her contract with the series after a plot line called for her character to \u201cenjoy\u201d a rape scene. </p> <p>The writers gave Garrett a classic soapy exit \u2013 a big wedding ceremony. The publicity surrounding the nuptials was massive. On the same day the wedding scene was filmed, the production company held a mock wedding reception at a hotel in Kings Cross. \u201cI was told all the journos and the media were going to be the guests,\u201d Garrett recalls. Straight after filming, still in costume, the cast were whisked to a reception. There were speeches, a bouquet toss and, as it was a Jewish wedding, even stomped glasses: \u201cI just thought \u2018What\u2019s this about?\u2019 We\u2019re blurring the lines of reality!\u2019 \u201d <br><br>Because of its controversial subject matter, most children were forbidden from watching Number 96 but in Jewish homes around Australia whole families tuned in to watch the wedding.</p> <h2><strong>2. Vicky and Simon by popular demand on A Country Practice (1983)</strong></h2> <p>The public wants what it wants, and sometimes it is up to a soap opera to give it to them \u2013 with a side of cute animals. The relationship between vet Vicky and doctor Simon on A Country Practice \u201cwas a situation where the nation was kind of involved\u201d, says Mercado. Although the writers were dancing around the golden couple\u2019s pairing, the audience was firm. Reportedly during a telethon which featured actors Penny Cook and Grant Dodwell \u201csomeone rang up and said \u2018We\u2019ll donate a $1,000 if Vicki and Simon kiss\u2019 \u201d, Mercado says. Although the wedding ceremony was later pipped by another A Country Practice storyline (Molly\u2019s death from leukaemia in 1984), at the time it was one of the most watched events in Australian television history.</p> <h2><strong>1. Charlene and Scott on Neighbours (1987)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfe9a106c269ee98f5490e466d82922573d57473\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfe9a106c269ee98f5490e466d82922573d57473/0_91_1761_1475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kylie Minogue as Charlene and Jason Donovan as Scott in Neighbours in 1987.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"838\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kylie Minogue as Charlene and Jason Donovan as Scott in Neighbours in 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are soap opera weddings, and then there\u2019s Charlene and Scott \u2013 arguably one of the biggest moments in Australian television history. The culmination of Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan\u2019s on-screen romance remains one of the most-watched soap opera episodes in Australia, and pulled in almost 20m British viewers, making it the third-most-watched show of the year in the UK. It also made the cover of Time Magazine Australia, featured on postage stamps two decades later, and Charlene\u2019s puffy white and peach wedding dress remains immortalised in the collection of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/19/from-madison-avenue-to-iggy-pop-five-unforgettable-moments-of-australian-music-tv\">From Madison Avenue to Iggy Pop: five unforgettable moments of Australian music TV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the wedding was rumoured to have been sparked by complaints from conservative viewers, upset that the couple had moved in together and were \u201cliving in sin\u201d, Mercado suggests this controversy was a ploy by the writers who always \u201cknew they were already going to marry them off\u201d.</p> <p>Since then Neighbours has managed to recapture a bit of the magic, by reusing the church where Charlene and Scott wed (twice), re-airing footage of the ceremony, and even sending Margot Robbie\u2019s character Donna down the aisle to a cover of Charlene\u2019s wedding song, Suddenly, on the show\u2019s 6,000th episode. Then in 2018 the show featured its first gay wedding after the public had voted \u201cyes\u201d to marriage equality the year before.</p> <h2><strong>Bonus: the wedding that started Kath and Kim</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ce9f1babb65f20715e79b9e37e0baf01362a0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45ce9f1babb65f20715e79b9e37e0baf01362a0f/0_0_480_360/480.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Karen Strzelecki (Magda Szubanski) and Kim Craig (Gina Riley) in Kath &amp; Kim.\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon Karen Strzelecki (Magda Szubanski) and Kim Craig (Gina Riley) in Kath &amp; Kim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may not be a soap, but it\u2019s still worth remembering that one of Australia\u2019s most famous comedies began with a wedding, on a sketch show that lasted only one season.

While the final broken engagement was used to write actor Chris Sadrinna off the show in 2007, Ritchie\u2019s exit was a different kind of happily ever after. In a multi-episode send-off arc in 2008, Sally departed Summer Bay to travel the world. 4. Tony and Tania\u2019s publicity bonanza on The Young Doctors (1978) In a precursor to many of today\u2019s medical dramas, the titular Young Doctors (and nurses) on this long-running Australian soap spent as much time romancing each other as they did saving lives. But the biggest wedding of all \u2013 which Mercado suggests may have been one of the most expensive in Australian TV history \u2013 was between sexy Spanish doctor Tony and the young nurse Tania, played by Tony Alvarez and Judy McBurney respectively. At the time episodes did not air simultaneously across the country so to coincide with their wedding\u2019s air dates Alvarez and McBurney embarked on a national publicity tour. Channel Nine rented real wedding chapels in every capital city and the actors staged mock weddings for huge groups of fans. Afterwards the pair were flooded with wedding gifts from the public. While memories of the tour linger, the on-screen romance proved less permanent. Alvarez left the show the following year. 3. Rose and Julian on Number 96 (1972) As the first Australian television show to feature nudity and homosexual main characters, Number 96 broke many boundaries. But not all of them were positive. Vivienne Garrett, who portrayed Rose Godolfus, broke her contract with the series after a plot line called for her character to \u201cenjoy\u201d a rape scene. The writers gave Garrett a classic soapy exit \u2013 a big wedding ceremony. The publicity surrounding the nuptials was massive. On the same day the wedding scene was filmed, the production company held a mock wedding reception at a hotel in Kings Cross. \u201cI was told all the journos and the media were going to be the guests,\u201d Garrett recalls. Straight after filming, still in costume, the cast were whisked to a reception. There were speeches, a bouquet toss and, as it was a Jewish wedding, even stomped glasses: \u201cI just thought \u2018What\u2019s this about?\u2019 We\u2019re blurring the lines of reality!\u2019 \u201d Because of its controversial subject matter, most children were forbidden from watching Number 96 but in Jewish homes around Australia whole families tuned in to watch the wedding. 2. Vicky and Simon by popular demand on A Country Practice (1983) The public wants what it wants, and sometimes it is up to a soap opera to give it to them \u2013 with a side of cute animals. The relationship between vet Vicky and doctor Simon on A Country Practice \u201cwas a situation where the nation was kind of involved\u201d, says Mercado. Although the writers were dancing around the golden couple\u2019s pairing, the audience was firm. Reportedly during a telethon which featured actors Penny Cook and Grant Dodwell \u201csomeone rang up and said \u2018We\u2019ll donate a $1,000 if Vicki and Simon kiss\u2019 \u201d, Mercado says. Although the wedding ceremony was later pipped by another A Country Practice storyline (Molly\u2019s death from leukaemia in 1984), at the time it was one of the most watched events in Australian television history. 1. Charlene and Scott on Neighbours (1987) There are soap opera weddings, and then there\u2019s Charlene and Scott \u2013 arguably one of the biggest moments in Australian television history. The culmination of Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan\u2019s on-screen romance remains one of the most-watched soap opera episodes in Australia, and pulled in almost 20m British viewers, making it the third-most-watched show of the year in the UK. It also made the cover of Time Magazine Australia, featured on postage stamps two decades later, and Charlene\u2019s puffy white and peach wedding dress remains immortalised in the collection of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Although the wedding was rumoured to have been sparked by complaints from conservative viewers, upset that the couple had moved in together and were \u201cliving in sin\u201d, Mercado suggests this controversy was a ploy by the writers who always \u201cknew they were already going to marry them off\u201d. Since then Neighbours has managed to recapture a bit of the magic, by reusing the church where Charlene and Scott wed (twice), re-airing footage of the ceremony, and even sending Margot Robbie\u2019s character Donna down the aisle to a cover of Charlene\u2019s wedding song, Suddenly, on the show\u2019s 6,000th episode. Then in 2018 the show featured its first gay wedding after the public had voted \u201cyes\u201d to marriage equality the year before. Bonus: the wedding that started Kath and Kim It may not be a soap, but it\u2019s still worth remembering that one of Australia\u2019s most famous comedies began with a wedding, on a sketch show that lasted only one season. From 1994 to 1995 Magda Szubanski, Jane Turner and Gina Riley chronicled the disastrous lead-up to Kim Day\u2019s wedding in a series of sketches on Big Girl\u2019s Blouse. It took seven years for the trio\u2019s genius creation to begin its second life, but luckily they gave the public far more time to \u201clook at moi\u201d when Kath and Kim returned to screens in 2002.",

      "body": "<p>For literally millions of years, the glorious songs of lyrebirds have rung out across the valleys of south-eastern Australia. Lyrebirds have an extraordinary vocal range and are famously accomplished mimics with their own lush, ringing calls mingled with impersonations on their avian neighbours.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/lyrebird-threatened-species-scale-bird-habitat-bushfires-emerges\">research from BirdLife Australia examining the impacts of the recent bushfires</a> is showing that an unprecedented number of those valleys are cloaked in silence today. No lyrebirds are likely to be calling. No whipbirds. Or kookaburras, cockatoos, currawongs. Or any of any of the birds that compose the rich soundtrack familiar to those of us who love visiting these areas.</p> <p>Looking at the known distribution of more than 100 birds occurring in the fire zone, based on tens of thousands of observations made by BirdLife Australia staff and thousands of volunteers over decades, the research has revealed that at least 19 birds have had more than 50% of their habitat affected, with 58 species having more than 30% affected. This is only for areas burnt to 7 January. With fires still going, further analysis may see even more birds added to the list.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/lyrebird-threatened-species-scale-bird-habitat-bushfires-emerges\">Lyrebird may join threatened species, as scale of bird habitat lost to bushfires emerges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Until now, all the major populations of lyrebirds have been doing fairly well. The most widely distributed is the familiar superb lyrebird (the one on the 10c coin). It has three subspecies \u2013 genetically distinct populations \u2013 imaginatively but accurately called the southern, central and northern superb lyrebirds and found along the Great Dividing Range from central Victoria, just into the southern Queensland. Albert\u2019s lyrebird is restricted to the subtropical rainforests and tall, wet forests of the Border Ranges along the Queensland-NSW border and has been one of the rare conservation success stories in Australia, with almost all of its remaining range now protected in conservation reserves.</p> <p>However, more than half of the known habitat supporting the northern and central superb lyrebirds has been affected by the fires and Albert\u2019s and southern superbs have seen over a third of their habitat scorched.</p> <p>Lyrebirds, despite appearances, are real survivors. Fossil records indicate that lyrebirds have been with us for more than 15 million years. Stories are emerging of lyrebirds surviving these raging bushfires by sheltering in wombat burrows and sitting in creeks as the flames roar overhead. And there are reports of lyrebirds being the only animal of any sort seen in charred remnants of once mighty forests, scratching among the still smoking ground in search of food. Long-time Mallacoota bird lover Bob Semmens has reported to BirdLife Australia that there are lyrebirds currently foraging in the few unburnt gardens around the town.</p> <p>BirdLife\u2019s researchers won\u2019t know for sure how likely it will be before the song of the lyrebird will return to much of their habitat until they can get people on the ground to gauge how severe the effects of the fires have been but the preliminary analysis is the stuff of nightmares. We could potentially see the list of our nationally threatened birds swell by over 25%, because not many birds are as adept as escaping infernos as the lyrebird.</p> <p>What is already clear is that of the 16 birds endemic to Kangaroo Island, 15 of them are in the 20 birds most impacted by the fires. Topping this tragic list is the tiny Kangaroo Island southern emu-wren, which weighs around seven grams and is a very poor flyer. More than 82% of the habitat in which it is known to occur has burnt. The heathland it lives in may soon recover but if the flames have been too fierce, there will no emu-wrens to repopulate it, a fate that befell its close relative, the Mallee emu-wren, which recently went extinct in South Australia due to a series of out-of-control fires that wiped out its last refuges.</p> <p>A coordinated and sustained conservation effort will be required to see the emu-wren and other birds hit by the fires to escape the same fate. The awful irony is that some of these affected birds only exist thanks to decades of concerted work by local communities, government agencies, conservation researchers and organisations. The Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo is a shining example, with numbers of this endearing bird rising from 150 to over 400 in the past two decades thanks to brilliant conservation work. This dreadful fire has knocked out around 65% of its habitat and we don\u2019t yet know what proportion of the population.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/26/australian-government-adviser-urges-threatened-species-overhaul-after-bushfires\">Australian government adviser urges threatened species overhaul after bushfires</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the short-term, this bird has desperate emergency needs, such as the conundrum of how to feed it. The glossy black is one of the parrot world\u2019s fussiest eaters, feeding only on the seed cones of drooping sheoak \u2013 a tree that\u2019s killed by fire. But for all birds affected, recovery after fires of such unparalleled enormity is going to take decades and enormous resources, a job that will be made all the more Herculean if we don\u2019t act to address the underlying threats such as further clearing of remaining habitat, feral predators and competitors, and the continued drying out of our landscape due to a hotter climate.</p> <p>From the enormous groundswell of support BirdLife Australia has been receiving, both from people wanting to donate to and support recovery efforts for birds, we know that the Australian community is up for the challenge. The question is, how committed are our leaders to ensuring that the song of the lyrebird and hundreds of other birds will continue to ring out?</p> <p><em>Sean Dooley is national public affairs manager of BirdLife Australia</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "For literally millions of years, the glorious songs of lyrebirds have rung out across the valleys of south-eastern Australia. Lyrebirds have an extraordinary vocal range and are famously accomplished mimics with their own lush, ringing calls mingled with impersonations on their avian neighbours. However, research from BirdLife Australia examining the impacts of the recent bushfires is showing that an unprecedented number of those valleys are cloaked in silence today. No lyrebirds are likely to be calling. No whipbirds. Or kookaburras, cockatoos, currawongs. Or any of any of the birds that compose the rich soundtrack familiar to those of us who love visiting these areas. Looking at the known distribution of more than 100 birds occurring in the fire zone, based on tens of thousands of observations made by BirdLife Australia staff and thousands of volunteers over decades, the research has revealed that at least 19 birds have had more than 50% of their habitat affected, with 58 species having more than 30% affected. This is only for areas burnt to 7 January. With fires still going, further analysis may see even more birds added to the list. Until now, all the major populations of lyrebirds have been doing fairly well. The most widely distributed is the familiar superb lyrebird (the one on the 10c coin). It has three subspecies \u2013 genetically distinct populations \u2013 imaginatively but accurately called the southern, central and northern superb lyrebirds and found along the Great Dividing Range from central Victoria, just into the southern Queensland. Albert\u2019s lyrebird is restricted to the subtropical rainforests and tall, wet forests of the Border Ranges along the Queensland-NSW border and has been one of the rare conservation success stories in Australia, with almost all of its remaining range now protected in conservation reserves. However, more than half of the known habitat supporting the northern and central superb lyrebirds has been affected by the fires and Albert\u2019s and southern superbs have seen over a third of their habitat scorched. Lyrebirds, despite appearances, are real survivors. Fossil records indicate that lyrebirds have been with us for more than 15 million years. Stories are emerging of lyrebirds surviving these raging bushfires by sheltering in wombat burrows and sitting in creeks as the flames roar overhead. And there are reports of lyrebirds being the only animal of any sort seen in charred remnants of once mighty forests, scratching among the still smoking ground in search of food. Long-time Mallacoota bird lover Bob Semmens has reported to BirdLife Australia that there are lyrebirds currently foraging in the few unburnt gardens around the town. BirdLife\u2019s researchers won\u2019t know for sure how likely it will be before the song of the lyrebird will return to much of their habitat until they can get people on the ground to gauge how severe the effects of the fires have been but the preliminary analysis is the stuff of nightmares. We could potentially see the list of our nationally threatened birds swell by over 25%, because not many birds are as adept as escaping infernos as the lyrebird. What is already clear is that of the 16 birds endemic to Kangaroo Island, 15 of them are in the 20 birds most impacted by the fires. Topping this tragic list is the tiny Kangaroo Island southern emu-wren, which weighs around seven grams and is a very poor flyer. More than 82% of the habitat in which it is known to occur has burnt. The heathland it lives in may soon recover but if the flames have been too fierce, there will no emu-wrens to repopulate it, a fate that befell its close relative, the Mallee emu-wren, which recently went extinct in South Australia due to a series of out-of-control fires that wiped out its last refuges. A coordinated and sustained conservation effort will be required to see the emu-wren and other birds hit by the fires to escape the same fate. The awful irony is that some of these affected birds only exist thanks to decades of concerted work by local communities, government agencies, conservation researchers and organisations. The Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo is a shining example, with numbers of this endearing bird rising from 150 to over 400 in the past two decades thanks to brilliant conservation work. This dreadful fire has knocked out around 65% of its habitat and we don\u2019t yet know what proportion of the population. In the short-term, this bird has desperate emergency needs, such as the conundrum of how to feed it. The glossy black is one of the parrot world\u2019s fussiest eaters, feeding only on the seed cones of drooping sheoak \u2013 a tree that\u2019s killed by fire. But for all birds affected, recovery after fires of such unparalleled enormity is going to take decades and enormous resources, a job that will be made all the more Herculean if we don\u2019t act to address the underlying threats such as further clearing of remaining habitat, feral predators and competitors, and the continued drying out of our landscape due to a hotter climate. From the enormous groundswell of support BirdLife Australia has been receiving, both from people wanting to donate to and support recovery efforts for birds, we know that the Australian community is up for the challenge. The question is, how committed are our leaders to ensuring that the song of the lyrebird and hundreds of other birds will continue to ring out?

Some people have struggled to see a connection between Australia Day and the current concerns over Australia\u2019s refusal to embrace climate change. The last Guardian article I wrote was met with countless people failing to understand how I could draw a connection to the colonial experiment that is Australia and the current situations that we find ourselves in. For me, however, they are intrinsically linked. For what single date better signifies all that is wrong with Australia than a country that blindly chooses to celebrate the worst of its own history? What date better paints a picture of a nation desperately clinging to an outdated colonial identity rather than embracing all that is special about the continent they now reside on and doing everything in its power to protect it? And indeed, what could be a better date to protest Australia\u2019s inaction on climate change, inaction on Indigenous rights, inaction on putting the rights of the people in front of corporate interests? Despite conservative commentators wilfully pretending that opposition to Australia Day is solely about a date in the calendar, for at least the last 82 years since the first official Day of Mourning was held in Sydney, 26 January has provided a platform for Indigenous peoples to call for change.

Change the Date has always been synonymous with Change the Nation, but as social media has brought this 80+ year-old debate into the mainstream, something seemed to have gotten lost in translation over the past few years, which is why many of us have abandoned the #Changethedate hashtag in favour of #Changethenation \u2013 to keep the conversation on track with what it has always been about. All that has changed this year with the fire season is that it has brought home, for many, the realities of a possible apocalyptic near-future for Australia if we do not change.

      "bodyText": "A senior adviser to the federal government on threatened species has backed calls for the creation of a national scientific monitoring system after the bushfire crisis to help fix Australia\u2019s \u201cvery uneven\u201d record in protecting endangered wildlife. Helene Marsh, chair of the national threatened species scientific committee and an emeritus professor of environmental science at James Cook University, said the scale of the ecological tragedy had made Australians more aware of the risks facing the country\u2019s unique animals and plants and provided an opportunity to improve conservation. With fires still burning, scientists warn it is too early to have a clear picture of the devastation, but preliminary government data suggests more than 100 threatened animal and plant species have lost at least half their habitat and more than 300 have lost more than 10%. The impact on most species not currently listed as threatened is yet to be assessed. Birdlife Australia estimates nearly 80 birds have lost at least a third of the area in which they live, and that the superb lyrebird may have plunged from being a common to a threatened species. Marsh said the threatened species committee planned to review the decision-making process for officially listing species as vulnerable or worse within the constraints of existing national environment laws. She said the protection offered to species after they were listed should also be reconsidered as the existing model of recovery planning had not worked. Fewer than 40% of nationally threatened species have recovery plans in place. She said she was encouraged by the level of goodwill between federal and state governments, scientists and conservationists following the fires, including the response by Sussan Ley, the federal environment minister, who has set up and met with an expert scientific panel to advise on what needed to be done. The federal government has allocated $50m in wildlife recovery funding, with a promise of more to come, and officials from across fire affected areas are due to meet on Tuesday to continue work on a national response. Marsh said the creation of a national scientific monitoring facility, proposed by fire scientists David Bowman and Ross Bradstock to fill critical gaps in bushfire knowledge, made some sense. She said it could include wildlife surveys. \u201cI\u2019ve been quite concerned about the way we monitor our biodiversity in Australia, it\u2019s a huge job, and I think if we are going to understand the impact of fires that is a very interesting idea that needs consideration,\u201d she said. Given not everything could be monitored, she said there would need to be clear priorities that would likely be defined by the 12m hectare bushfires. But she said it was important to consider \u201cbiodiversity arks\u201d, key areas that had avoided the fires, as well as burned country. Marsh said it should utilise technology, including remote sensing and drones, as well as on-ground field work by scientists, Indigenous rangers and possibly community groups and citizen scientists. \u201cI do believe that the importance of monitoring the impact of the fires will be a catalyst for doing this work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is very important that it be well designed and scientifically robust.\u201d While she backed the development of a national system, Marsh said monitoring the impact of the fires could not wait for a new system and needed to begin as soon as it was safe. An analysis by environment groups found the Coalition had cut funding for environmental programs, monitoring and staff by about 40% since being elected in 2013. Marsh said changes would be needed to the national environment laws, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity and Protection Act, which is being reviewed by businessman Graeme Samuel. Asked how successful the laws had been, she said the government\u2019s state of the environment report, which among other things found climate change was altering the structure and function of Australia\u2019s natural ecosystems and affecting heritage, economic activity and human wellbeing, \u201cspoke for itself\u201d. Marsh said the review of the laws should consider whether it was appropriate to adopt more advanced criteria used by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to assess whether an ecological community was threatened. Government ministers including Ley last year stressed the review would focus on cutting \u201cgreen tape\u201d. Scientists have expressed hope it may now address the impact of the fires and what was needed to avoiding an extinction crisis that scientists said was worsening before the devastating fire season. Scientists last year said three native Australian species had become extinct in the past decade and another 17 could follow in the next 20 years. More than 1,800 Australian plants and animals are listed as threatened with extinction. Scientists warned in a letter to the government before the fires that this was likely to be an underestimate.",

      "bodyText": "Live coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial continues on Monday\u2019s blog: Today, Trump\u2019s defense team began their case arguing against the president\u2019s removal from office. In just under two hours, they outlined their main points: White House counsel Pat Cipollone opened the defense by positioning impeachment as a referendum on the upcoming 2020 election. \u201cThey are asking you not only to overturn the results of the last election, but as I\u2019ve said before, they are asking you to remove president Trump from the ballot in an election that is occurring in approximately nine months.\u201d Mike Purpura, deputy counsel to the president, named six key facts pertinent to the case. He said each of these facts alone is \u201cenough to sink the Democrats case.\u201d Trump\u2019s defense frequently tried to cast doubts on the Democrats depiction of events by showing clips from the House impeachment inquiry which supported their case and asked why the Democrats didn\u2019t include those in their statements. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, brandished a copy of a section of the Mueller report in an effort to draw a parallel between that investigation and the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThis should never be allowed to happen again!\u201d is Donald Trump\u2019s first tweeted reaction to today\u2019s hearing. He went on to retweet supportive statements made by Republican representatives Steve Scalise, of Louisiana, and Bradley Byrne, of Alabama. Each side has 24 hours to make their opening arguments. Trump\u2019s team emphasized brevity in their first day and is set to present the bulk of their case on Monday and Tuesday. After these arguments, senators can ask questions of each side in writing. US supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, is presiding over the trial and will read the questions out loud. Following the question period, the Senate will vote on whether to continue the trial and allow the teams to subpoena witnesses or to end the trial with a vote on whether to convict or acquit the president. The view from Republicans in Congress: Now the House impeachment managers are speaking at a press conference. They are responding to \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d made by Trump\u2019s defense, lead prosecutor Adam Schiff says. \u201cThey don\u2019t contest the basic architecture of the scheme,\u201d Schiff said. This suggests the facts are overwhelming that the president tried to get Ukraine\u2019s government involved in the 2020 election, Schiff says. \u201cWe are meant to, I guess, believe from the presentation today that the call was all about burden sharing,\u201d Schiff says. \u201cAs if that was really the thrust of the call,\u201d Schiff said. Schiff says if the call was about burden sharing, it would make more sense for the president to speak to European leaders, and mention European leaders in calls, instead of people such as his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. In a press conference, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said Trump\u2019s defense team made a \u201ccompelling case\u201d for why the Senate should request witnesses and documents. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we have witnesses and documents here?\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president\u2019s counsel did a very good job - there are gaping holes in their testimony,\u201d Schumer said. He continued: We have been making the argument that we need witnesses, we need documents. We are making the argument it won\u2019t take very long to get them as part of a trial. Today, we thank the president\u2019s counsel for one thing: they made our case even stronger. Lead impeachment prosecutor, Adam Schiff, has shared his first thoughts on the president\u2019s defense. Trump\u2019s lawyers made Schiff a prominent character in their narrative, sharing video clips of his previous statements while he watched and listened nearby. In Schiff\u2019s closing statement on Friday, the Democratic congressmen pre-empted much of the Trump legal team\u2019s defense. Back to Cipollone, who promises this will only last \u201ca few more minutes.\u201d He puts on the screen three instances in which Trump invited Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to Washington, by phone. There was also a letter invitation, he says. \u201cImpeachment shouldn\u2019t be a shell game, they should give you the facts,\u201d Cipollone said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we have for today.\u201d In a speedy two hours, the first part of Trump\u2019s defense wraps and the Senate is adjourned. We will continue to have analysis and reaction in the live blog today. The trial continues Monday afternoon. Patrick Philbin, deputy counsel to the president, is here to speak about the issues of obstruction and due process. Philbin says the House did not follow procedure when it issued subpoenas and therefore the White House committed no wrongdoing by defying those subpoenas. Meanwhile, reports are coming in from reporters in the Senate chamber, who are able to see the Senate\u2019s reaction to the arguments. The Senate has limited the television broadcast to focus on the speakers, not the reaction in the room. Sekulow lists multiple instances in which the Trump White House withheld foreign aid from countries which weren\u2019t Ukraine. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, has taken over. He brandishes a copy of the Mueller report, highlighting that investigators did not find any overarching conspiracy between Trump\u2019s team and Russian operatives. The report did find 11 instances in which Trump or his campaign engaged in potential obstruction of justice and suggested Congress might prosecute these acts as crimes. \u201cThis, for that,\u201d Sekulow keeps repeating while waving a section of the 450-page report, in an effort to draw a parallel between that investigation and the impeachment inquiry. Purpura is repeatedly highlighting video clips from the House impeachment hearings, then asking why Democrats didn\u2019t share them. The clips he is sharing support the president\u2019s case and were usually prompted by Republican House members, similar to how Democrats shared video clips that supported their case and were prompted by Democratic House members. Mike Purpura, deputy counsel to the president, outlined six key facts pertinent to the case. He said each of these facts alone is \u201cenough to sink the Democrats case.\u201d The transcript (which the White House said is not verbatim) shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything. Ukrainians have said there was no quid pro quo. Ukraine did not know security assistance was paused until a month after the 25 July call. No Ukrainian investigation into Joe Biden took place. Ukraine received assistance without such an investigation. Trump has been a bigger supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor, Barack Obama. Cipollone rounds out his opening statement: \u201cThey are here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an American election in US history.\u201d Up next, Mike Purpura, deputy counsel to the president. He begins by showing video of lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff paraphrasing a White House transcript of the 25 July call between Trump and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Purpura says what Schiff is reading was fake, which is a well-trodden critique from the president\u2019s defenders. Schiff paraphrased a White House summary of the call, which was not verbatim, and reporters who analyzed Schiff\u2019s recounting of the transcript said he was accurate. White House counsel Pat Cipollone says today\u2019s argument should only take two to three hours and promises to be out by 1pm at the latest. He says the defense\u2019s case will make two points. The first appears to be that his argument will focus on the president not having done anything wrong. \u201cYou heard the house manager speak for nearly 24 hours over three days,\u201d Cipollone says. \u201cWe don\u2019t anticipate using that much time. We don\u2019t believe they have come anywhere close to meeting their burden for what they are asking you to do.\u201d \u201cIn fact,\u201d Cipollone says, today he will focus on facts. And once the Senate hears those facts, he says: \u201cYou will find the president did absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d Cipollone moves on to the second point: \u201cThey are asking you not only to overturn the results of the last election, but as I\u2019ve said before, they are asking you to remove president Trump from the ballot in an election that is occurring in approximately nine months.\u201d Cipollone then suggests ballots for the November election already exist, and will be torn up if the Senate votes for removal from office. Since each party hasn\u2019t formally named its candidate in the 2020 election, this is a rhetorical flourish which shows the president\u2019s legal team is ready to make politics a significant part of its defense. Minutes later, Cipollone returns to the idea that Democrats are asking to \u201ctear up the ballots\u201d by calling for impeachment. The Senate impeachment trial has begun its new phase, with the case moving to the president\u2019s legal team. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said today they would outline their argument to defend the president, with plans to deliver the brunt of their case in longer sessions on Monday and Tuesday. They are expected to argue that the president was justified in seeking the investigation because of a history of corruption involving the company and that he committed no crimes. Who are the people tasked with preventing Trump from becoming the first impeached president to be removed from office? From Floridians to a key figure in the Bill Clinton impeachment trial, a profile of the attorneys representing the president: Hello and good morning, At the top of the hour, Donald Trump\u2019s defense team will begin its case to argue the president did not commit impeachable offenses and should remain in office. Trump\u2019s team said today would feature a three-hour \u201coverview\u201d of their defense, which will continue next week.

Not one minute. \u201d</p> \n<p>Cipollone rounded out his opening remarks with the core of the defense team\u2019s argument: that Trump did not break any laws in an attempt to strong-arm Ukraine into investigating his political rival Joe Biden and that House Democrats have omitted key details to make their case.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou will find that the president did nothing wrong,\u201d Cipollone said. \u201cBut what we intend to do today is go through their record that they established in the House.

      "body": "<p>Historians will debate the reasons for the complacency that descended on the British in the first months of the 2020s. Had their government duped the nation into ignorant passivity? Were they really as stupid as they appeared to be? Nothing had been settled. The pain was yet to come. Yet they behaved as if they believed Boris Johnson when he said he could \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. And, as I\u2019m certain the historians of the future will say, believing Boris Johnson never ended well.</p> <p>A few causes of our torpor appear obvious. The Conservatives won a handsome majority. Brexit bored the public rigid. The opposition was hopeless. Journalists weren\u2019t doing their job. The prime minister was thus free to <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnsons-brexit-deal-set-to-become-law-11915217\" title=\"\">announce</a>: \u201cNow we can put the rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future\u201d, and not be met with derisive laughter.</p> <p>Yet the delusions that follow are anything but obvious. As the clock chimes 11 on Friday night, we can, apparently, build <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/24/hs2-cost-impossible-to-estimate-with-certainty-says-nao\" title=\"\">high-speed rail lines</a>, reinvigorate the north, bail out a regional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/17/government-accused-of-covering-up-true-terms-of-flybe-rescue-deal-ryanair-michael-oleary\" title=\"\">airline</a> and let a thousand bus services bloom. We can tear up our economic model without having the smallest idea what to put in its place.</p> <p>The listless acceptance extends to those who believe that leaving the European Union is an act of monumental folly. Brexit\u2019s inevitability, the possibility that we are in for another decade of rightwing rule, is leading opponents of the status quo to retreat into private life, as the defeated so often do. Perhaps they are almost grateful for the chance to concentrate on their friendships, family and love affairs: these are in the end what matter most to everyone except obsessives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Aren\u2019t you sick of an argument about a subject no one except a handful of zealots cared about before 2016?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On this reading, the country has not been wholly deceived by Johnson and his propagandists. The British are just exhausted. In a piece for the Parisian news magazine, <em>L\u2019Express</em>, the French journalist and historian Agn\u00e8s Poirier interviewed psychiatrists dealing with voters who had looked on appalled as Britain made a disastrous choice. They were \u201cdevastated, angry, depressed, betrayed and ashamed\u201d, as a <a href=\"https://www.bps.org.uk/blogs/european-semester-psychology-2018/existential-and-emotional-impact-brexit\" title=\"\">psychological study</a> of Remain supporters put it. Brexit allowed the old to enforce their worldview on the young and broke ties between the generations. \u201cMy patients talk about the impossibility of mentioning the subject in family, to avoid clashes. In extreme cases, they have cut ties,\u201d Dr Ian Martin, a London psychiatrist, said \u2013 a story I have heard several times myself.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the fear that kills you but the hope,\u201d runs the cliche. And now all hope of a second referendum or a change of government has gone, a kind of liberation follows. You can just sigh, move on and patch up differences. What else is there to do?</p> <p>Perhaps many will be relieved. Poirier repeats the echoingly grim phrase the French socialist L\u00e9on Blum used to describe the decision by France and Britain to allow Hitler to dismember Czechoslovakia at the Munich conference of 1938: a \u201c<em>l\u00e2che soulagement</em>\u201d \u2013 a cowardly relief. Selling out Czechoslovakia was shameful, but Blum, who had campaigned for peace, could tell himself that at least it avoided war in Europe. Do you feel a <em>l\u00e2che soulagement</em> of your own? Aren\u2019t you sick of an argument about a subject no one except a handful of zealots cared about before 2016?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The millions who think they can now avoid the bitterness of 2016-19 will find that it has just been postponed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wouldn\u2019t it be more truly British to come together, let bygones be bygones, and make the best of it? I don\u2019t see how you can if you are one of the three million <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50003563\" title=\"\">EU nationals in Britain</a> or 1.5 million Britons in the EU who have seen their sense of who they are and where they belong torn to shreds. But if you face no immediate stresses, the temptation to walk away is seductive.</p> <p>The Munich agreement did not avoid war, it merely postponed it for a year. Likewise, the millions who think they can now avoid the bitterness of 2016-19 will find that it, too, has just been postponed. You may not be interested in Brexit but Brexit is interested in you.</p> <p>The hard break the government is proposing as the only way to leave the EU without following EU law will be a direct attack on the pharmaceutical, chemical, aerospace, food processing, farming, fishing and car industries. Businesses that rely on the frictionless movement of goods will suffer. The absence of regulatory checks and arguments about the source of components and applicable tax rates is essential for their health, just as the absence of border checks on perishable food is essential for fresh food and fish exports. Hundreds of thousands of jobs and everyone\u2019s living standards are at stake. The Food and Drink Federation said last week that the Johnson administration\u2019s policies sounded like the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51157933\" title=\"\">death knell</a>\u201d for frictionless trade with the EU and were likely to cause food prices to rise.</p> <p>You can tell we are in a state that borders on the catatonic when Sajid Javid responded by telling the <em>Financial Times</em> that some businesses would indeed suffer. It was a welcome outbreak of honesty from a dishonest administration. But what an admission from a chancellor of the exchequer charged with protecting the economy.</p> <p>As telling was the indifference with which his dereliction of duty was greeted. The liberal elite, the chattering classes, the remoaners, call them what you will, once worried about the fate of car workers. Every serious study of the consequences of Brexit has shown that it will hit the old manufacturing regions of the north-east, Wales and Midlands hardest. London will be all right, as London always is. Yet at the moment they need support, they will be met with indifference.

      "bodyText": "Historians will debate the reasons for the complacency that descended on the British in the first months of the 2020s. Had their government duped the nation into ignorant passivity? Were they really as stupid as they appeared to be? Nothing had been settled. The pain was yet to come. Yet they behaved as if they believed Boris Johnson when he said he could \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. And, as I\u2019m certain the historians of the future will say, believing Boris Johnson never ended well. A few causes of our torpor appear obvious. The Conservatives won a handsome majority. Brexit bored the public rigid. The opposition was hopeless. Journalists weren\u2019t doing their job. The prime minister was thus free to announce: \u201cNow we can put the rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future\u201d, and not be met with derisive laughter. Yet the delusions that follow are anything but obvious. As the clock chimes 11 on Friday night, we can, apparently, build high-speed rail lines, reinvigorate the north, bail out a regional airline and let a thousand bus services bloom. We can tear up our economic model without having the smallest idea what to put in its place. The listless acceptance extends to those who believe that leaving the European Union is an act of monumental folly. Brexit\u2019s inevitability, the possibility that we are in for another decade of rightwing rule, is leading opponents of the status quo to retreat into private life, as the defeated so often do. Perhaps they are almost grateful for the chance to concentrate on their friendships, family and love affairs: these are in the end what matter most to everyone except obsessives. On this reading, the country has not been wholly deceived by Johnson and his propagandists. The British are just exhausted. In a piece for the Parisian news magazine, L\u2019Express, the French journalist and historian Agn\u00e8s Poirier interviewed psychiatrists dealing with voters who had looked on appalled as Britain made a disastrous choice. They were \u201cdevastated, angry, depressed, betrayed and ashamed\u201d, as a psychological study of Remain supporters put it. Brexit allowed the old to enforce their worldview on the young and broke ties between the generations. \u201cMy patients talk about the impossibility of mentioning the subject in family, to avoid clashes. In extreme cases, they have cut ties,\u201d Dr Ian Martin, a London psychiatrist, said \u2013 a story I have heard several times myself. \u201cIt\u2019s not the fear that kills you but the hope,\u201d runs the cliche. And now all hope of a second referendum or a change of government has gone, a kind of liberation follows. You can just sigh, move on and patch up differences. What else is there to do? Perhaps many will be relieved. Poirier repeats the echoingly grim phrase the French socialist L\u00e9on Blum used to describe the decision by France and Britain to allow Hitler to dismember Czechoslovakia at the Munich conference of 1938: a \u201cl\u00e2che soulagement\u201d \u2013 a cowardly relief. Selling out Czechoslovakia was shameful, but Blum, who had campaigned for peace, could tell himself that at least it avoided war in Europe. Do you feel a l\u00e2che soulagement of your own? Aren\u2019t you sick of an argument about a subject no one except a handful of zealots cared about before 2016? Wouldn\u2019t it be more truly British to come together, let bygones be bygones, and make the best of it? I don\u2019t see how you can if you are one of the three million EU nationals in Britain or 1.5 million Britons in the EU who have seen their sense of who they are and where they belong torn to shreds. But if you face no immediate stresses, the temptation to walk away is seductive. The Munich agreement did not avoid war, it merely postponed it for a year. Likewise, the millions who think they can now avoid the bitterness of 2016-19 will find that it, too, has just been postponed. You may not be interested in Brexit but Brexit is interested in you. The hard break the government is proposing as the only way to leave the EU without following EU law will be a direct attack on the pharmaceutical, chemical, aerospace, food processing, farming, fishing and car industries. Businesses that rely on the frictionless movement of goods will suffer. The absence of regulatory checks and arguments about the source of components and applicable tax rates is essential for their health, just as the absence of border checks on perishable food is essential for fresh food and fish exports. Hundreds of thousands of jobs and everyone\u2019s living standards are at stake. The Food and Drink Federation said last week that the Johnson administration\u2019s policies sounded like the \u201cdeath knell\u201d for frictionless trade with the EU and were likely to cause food prices to rise. You can tell we are in a state that borders on the catatonic when Sajid Javid responded by telling the Financial Times that some businesses would indeed suffer. It was a welcome outbreak of honesty from a dishonest administration. But what an admission from a chancellor of the exchequer charged with protecting the economy. As telling was the indifference with which his dereliction of duty was greeted. The liberal elite, the chattering classes, the remoaners, call them what you will, once worried about the fate of car workers. Every serious study of the consequences of Brexit has shown that it will hit the old manufacturing regions of the north-east, Wales and Midlands hardest. London will be all right, as London always is. Yet at the moment they need support, they will be met with indifference. They will hear educated voices say that they voted for Brexit in 2016 and then voted for Johnson in 2019. They were warned and chose not to listen. I fear that the most damaging effect of the languid complacency that has infected the national mood is the collapse of any notion of solidarity. The most characteristic gesture of Brexit Britain will be a shrug of the shoulders. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>On an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience this week, Rogan told New York Times columnist Bari Weiss that he was going to vote for Bernie Sanders.

He has also invited people like the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who runs InfoWars, on his show. But Rogan also invites his share of leftist firebrands: the journalist Abby Martin went on a few times to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O51yryBeNuY\">rally support</a> for the Palestinian cause, and the progressive activist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HWh52wdUmY\">Kyle Kulinski</a> has been on several times to talk about things like the plight of Chelsea Manning, drone strikes and the shadow wars in Africa.</p> <p>Because he is so widely influential, Rogan claims that every major Democratic presidential candidate has tried to be invited on his show.

Some, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jljacobson/status/1220507059747201024\">like Jodi Jacobson</a>, a progressive and the former editor of Rewire News, demanded that Sanders \u201cnot accept\u201d the endorsement.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll be closing this liveblog shortly. Thanks for joining us. Here\u2019s what you missed if you are just catching up. Forty-one people in China have died from coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. 62-year-old doctor Liang Wudong died from the virus in Wuhan after treating patients. More than 1,370 cases have been confirmed worldwide, the vast majority in China, and others predominantly across Asia. However, the virus reached Europe yesterday, with three confirmed cases in France, and has also been reported in Australia and the US. In total, 14 countries have been affected. The World Health Organization has not declared a crisis, but is monitoring the situation. In China, 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have now raised their public health alert to level 1, the highest level. China announced it had ordered nationwide measures to identify and immediately isolate suspected cases of a deadly virus on trains, aeroplanes and buses. It is also building two new hospitals to deal with the crisis. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has said the response level has been raised from \u201cserious\u201d to \u201cemergency\u201d, the highest level. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued a statement warning that more cases in the EU are likely. In the UK, 31 people were tested and the results were negative. The government is trying to track down 2,000 people who arrived from Wuhan in recent weeks. The US began an operation to evacuate its citizens and diplomats from Wuhan. Here\u2019s the latest full report from my colleagues Rebecca Ratcliffe and Wu Pei Lin as well as an explainer about what Coronvirus is and another about how it has spread. I spoke to a British academic who returned from China this week and said that no one from the UK government has tried to contact him regarding the coronavirus outbreak. Health officials have teamed up with Border Force agents and airlines to try to track down about 2,000 people who have flown to the UK from Wuhan, the area worst affected by the outbreak. Prof Martin Dove, who works for Queen Mary College London and Wuhan University of Technology, had been working in Wuhan from 3-12 January before heading to other parts of China and flying home on Wednesday. After reading that Public Health England wanted to trace all those who had arrived back to the UK from Wuhan in the past 14 days, the physics professor tried to email PHE on various addresses and even emailed the chief medical officer Chris Whitty, but says he has not heard back from anyone. Dove told me that although he did not feel unwell, he would like to rule himself out and he believed the government could be doing more to contact those in his position. He said: \u201cIf they want to track us down, why don\u2019t they make it easier for us to contact them?\u201d Read the full story here: The five people suspected of having coronavirus in Scotland have tested negative, the Scottish government has said. On Thursday, five patients were confirmed as being tested for the infection, and ministers have now announced they have been given the all-clear. Health Protection Scotland has urged travellers returning from Wuhan who become unwell within a fortnight from a sore throat, cough or breathing difficulties to call their GP or NHS 24. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said on Friday: \u201cScotland is well prepared for these types of outbreaks \u2013 we have a proven track record of dealing with challenging health issues and the UK was one of the first countries in the world to develop a test for the new virus. \u201cI am being kept fully informed about the precautionary steps being taken, including timely updates on the patients who are currently being tested.\u201d China has confirmed that it is dealing with a total of 1,372 cases of coronavirus nationally. So far, 39 have been discharged. The number of those affected internationally has surpassed 1,400, but the death toll remains at 41. According to Tom Cheshire, Sky News Asia correspondent, the number has increased from 40 cases of infection 10 days ago. In case you missed it, have a listen to yesterday\u2019s Science Weekly podcast \u2013 The Wuhan Coronavirus: what we know and don\u2019t know. The Guardian\u2019s science correspondent Hannah Devlin talks to Prof Ian Jones about the nature of the virus, and to Dr Rosalind Eggo about how scientists model the spread of novel viruses. Starbucks has announced that it will close all outlets in Hubei province for the duration of the week-long lunar new year holiday. It follows a similar announcement by McDonald\u2019s, which will close branches in five cities in Hubei. Here\u2019s the latest map showing where cases have been confirmed around the world. Over 30 people have now been tested for coronavirus in the UK, the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England have said. As of Saturday afternoon, some 31 tests have now concluded, all of which were confirmed as negative for the virus. \u201cThere are currently no confirmed cases in the UK or of UK citizens abroad, and the risk to the public is low,\u201d a statement said. \u201cThe government is monitoring the situation closely and will continue to work with the World Health Organization (WHO) and international community,\u201d it added. It promised to announce any cases in the UK \u201cif and when\u201d it is confirmed. What to do if you think you are at risk If you have visited Wuhan and develop a fever, cough or have difficulty breathing within 14 days of returning, government guidelines recommend people seek medical attention. \u201cIn the UK, please stay indoors and avoid contact with others where possible, call your GP or ring 111 informing them of your symptoms and your recent travel to the city.\u201d The majority of deaths from the virus so far have been those aged between 60 and 89, according to William Yang, the east Asia correspondent for the German news outlet DW. According to the figures, no one under 30 has died from the virus yet. In China, 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have now raised their public health alert to level 1, the highest level, according to Global Times. This enables measures such as quarantining. Sichuan province has announced a ban on group gatherings. Individuals are not allowed to organise gatherings and restaurants are being prevented from hosting them. Anyone who had prior reservations has been told to cancel. In Hubei province, where the virus originated, all 72 train stations have been closed down. Workers in protective suits are checking the temperature of those entering Beijing\u2019s central railway, and some railway services have been suspended in the eastern Yangtze River Delta region. Chinese tourism continues to be affected by the spread of the virus. All domestic and foreign tour group operations are to be suspended from Monday. The move follows the closure of Shanghai\u2019s Disneyland, and all tourist sites in the popular Sanya city. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has held a special government meeting to address the spread of the virus. The president warned of a \u201cgrave situation\u201d at a meeting with the politburo on the lunar new year public holiday, state television reported. He also said the virus was \u201caccelerating its speed\u201d. According to the TV report, resources and experts will be channelled to designated hospitals to tackle the virus. Supplies to Hubei province will be guaranteed and cost won\u2019t be a hindrance. Forty-one people in China have died from coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. This is up from 26 a day earlier. At least 17 cities in Hubei have been locked down, and around 28 provinces have issued the highest emergency response ranking possible, which enables measures including quarantines. There is virtually no travel being allowed into or out of Wuhan, and Beijing has suspended inter-province travel. More than 1,280 cases have been confirmed worldwide, the vast majority in China, and others predominantly across Asia. However, the virus reached Europe yesterday, with three confirmed cases in France, and has also been reported in Australia and the US. In total, 14 countries have been affected. In the UK, 14 people were tested and the results were negative. The government is trying to track down 2,000 people who arrived from Wuban in recent weeks. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says more cases in the EU are likely. Hong Kong announced this morning that it would raise its response from \u2018serious\u2019 to \u2018emergency\u2019, the highest ranking. School holidays will be extended for another two weeks, and a marathon has been cancelled. The World Health Organization has not declared a crisis, but is monitoring the situation. China is building two new hospitals to tackle the crisis, the first in 10 days and another in two weeks. Beijing now has five confirmed cases of coronavirus, but two of those had no connection with the province of Hubei. This appears to be the first time the virus has spread without having a direct link to Hubei, indicating that the virus is now being transmitted person-to-person within the capital. Footage from the BBC\u2019s China correspondent, Stephen McDonell, shows the deserted streets of Hubei, the province where the virus originated. The lockdown has now been expanded to another 16 cities, according to Associated Press. This brings the total to 17 cities, including Wuhan, affecting 50 million people \u2013 more than the population of New York, London, Paris and Moscow combined. The cities of Yichang, Suizhou and Jingzhou were the latest added to the list on Friday evening and Saturday. There are several different figures circulating, so I\u2019ll update you as and when I can. Beijing has suspended all inter-province buses to try to limit the spread of the virus. It is not yet known when the services will resume. China cut off trains, planes and other links to Wuhan on Wednesday, and transport within the city has also been suspended. The US is beginning an operation to evacuate uts citizens and diplomats from Wuhan, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has said. There are around 1,000 US citizens in the city and the embassy is in the process of contacting them to arrange seats on a plane back to the US. Plans are in place for the consulate to close temporarily, the newspaper said. There are only 230 seats on the plane, according to the WSJ report, and those on board will have to pay the costs entailed. US medical personnel will be on board to treat suspected cases of the coronavirus, and any unfilled seats may be offered to non-US citizens. Washington was given approval for the operation from China\u2019s foreign ministry and other government agencies following negotiations in recent days, the WSJ said. It is not yet known where the plane will land. The central politburo of the Communist party has set up a working group to tackle the spread of the virus, according to Global Times, China\u2019s national English language newspaper. Symptoms may not show until a week after infection Symptoms of coronavirus may not manifest until up to a week after contracting the virus, Dr Adam Kucharski, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told Sky News. Most symptoms begin to appear between three and six days after infection. It is not yet known whether the virus can be spread by symptomless carriers. Kucharski also confirmed that older people with pre-existing health conditions were at greater risk of the virus, but that the exact risk to younger people in good health was not known. Global Times is reporting that 26 Chinese provinces have now declared a level 1 emergency \u2013 the highest level \u2013 allowing them to introduce measures including quarantines. The issue is unfolding very quickly, so it\u2019s worth noting that figures around the number of areas with travel restrictions and severity alerts are varied, ranging from 22 to 28. A total of 1,287 people are now confirmed to have been infected in China. In Hong Kong, 122 people are being tested for the virus, with five confirmed cases. Coronavirus has flu-like symptoms, which can develop into severe respiratory problems. The current outbreak is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus, not previously found in humans. The virus can be transmitted between humans and animals, making it harder to contain. Other strains of coronavirus are not as dangerous \u2013 the common cold is one. Authorities have said that the current strain of the virus originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, which has seen the most severe outbreak of coronavirus. It is thought the market was selling wildlife illegally and has now been shut down. Hu Yinghai, the deputy director general of the civil affairs department in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, appealed this morning for masks and protective suits. \u201cWe are steadily pushing forward the disease control and prevention ... But right now we are facing an extremely severe public health crisis,\u201d he told a news briefing. Vehicles carrying emergency supplies and medical staff for Wuhan would be exempted from tolls and given traffic priority, China\u2019s transportation ministry said on Saturday. More than 400 military doctors arrived in Wuhan on Friday night, including those experience tackling Ebola. The city, home to 11 million people, is on lockdown, with residents unable to leave. Taxis have been assigned to neighbourhood committees to help those who need to travel immediately. Virus most dangerous for older people Coronavirus is more likely to affect older or middle-aged people, especially those who have had diseases before, according to Dr Nathalie MacDermott, a clinical research fellow in infectious diseases at Imperial College London. For younger people, the virus \u201cmay be similar to having the flu\u201d, she told Sky News this morning. MacDermott also said the UK was well prepared to deal with the virus, and already had tests in place. Wuhan, where the virus originated, is to ban all cars from the downtown area. Only vehicles with a transport pass, or those being used by people working for government services, will be allowed to travel. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has issued a statement following the news that the virus has reached Europe, with three confirmed cases in France. It said the development was \u201cnot unexpected\u201d but \u201cthe fact that these cases were identified, proves that detection and confirmation of this novel virus is working in France, showing a high level of preparedness to prevent and control possible infections\u201d. It said: \u201cMost EU countries have plans and measures in place to contain this kind of infection and Europe has well-equipped laboratories that can confirm probable cases, in addition to hospitals that are prepared to treat patients accordingly.\u201d It added that more cases in Europe were likely. Last night, authorities in England set up a public health hub at Heathrow airport, in terminal four. The hub is staffed by teams of seven clinicians working on rotation, who will support those flying in from China who feel unwell. In a statement, Public Health England said its priority was to distribute information to those arriving from China. \u201cMost people who develop symptoms will get them after leaving the airport and so our priority is providing UK residents and travellers with the latest information to make sure they know what to do if they experience symptoms,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe NHS and PHE have an established plan to respond to someone who becomes unwell,\u201d it added. The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, said in a statement last night that the risk to the UK remains low, but that there \u201cmay well be cases in the UK at some point\u201d. \u201cThe UK is well prepared for these types of incidents, with excellent readiness against infectious diseases,\u201d he said. Chinese state media are reporting that a second hospital, with a capacity of 1,300 beds, will be built to tackle the virus. Construction has begun and is scheduled to be completed in around two weeks. Tourism across China has been affected by the virus. Shanghai\u2019s Disneyland resort will be closed from Saturday, and the popular destination of Sanya city has shut down all tourist sites to limit the possible spread. Haikou city, the capital of the Hainan province, has started a two-week medical observation period for all tourists from Hubei, the region where Wuhan is located. Here\u2019s a brief update on the cases worldwide so far: Thailand and Hong Kong each have five reported cases, Australia has four, and France, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan have three each. Vietnam, South Korea and the US have two reported cases, and Nepal has one. In the UK, 14 people have been tested for the virus but all came back negative. North Korea blocked all arrivals from foreigners on Wednesday to prevent the virus spreading to its population. Australia now has four confirmed cases of the virus, one in Melbourne and three in New South Wales. All four people had recently visited China. The three men in New South Wales, aged 43, 45, and 53, had arrived directly from Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. The confirmed case in Melbourne is of a Chinese man, who flew over from China. He is said to be in a stable condition. The Guardian\u2019s Ben Doherty has more information. China\u2019s ministry of finance and its National Health Commission are allocating a special fund for treatment and prevention of the virus. They\u2019re also offering subsidies for medical staff tackling the illness. Eighteen cities in China have suspended public transport. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has said the response level has been raised from \u201cserious\u201d to \u201cemergency\u201d, the highest level. A marathon has been cancelled, and new year celebrations scaled back. Primary and secondary school students will be given an extra two weeks holiday to avoid the virus spreading in schools. Lam also said trains and planes from Wuhan would be blocked. She said she would be personally chairing an interdepartmental committee to enable a faster response to the spread of the virus. \u201cWe will not be frugal about the resources needed,\u201d she said. This is Molly, taking over the blog in London. I\u2019ll be reporting on developments in the virus and its spread as they unfold today. The Hubei health commission is giving a press conference. A provincial official has said the situation is very severe and medical supplies are tight. He called for more medical supplies, such as masks and protective suits, from both domestic and overseas providers. These are some of the other main points from the briefing: 67 hospitals have opened special emergency rooms for patients with fevers. 11 medical staff have so far developed a fever. Three have been cured. The rest are under watch. Non-essential vehicles will be banned from the Wuhan city centre from 26 January. Chinese traditional medicine would be used alongside Western medicine in the treatment of coronavirus patients. The People\u2019s Daily has released a photograph of Liang Wudong, the doctor who died in Wuhan from the virus. Here\u2019s a what we know so far about the spreading coronavirus. A 62-year-old doctor, Liang Wudong, has died from the virus in Wuhan after treating patients. Reports say a second doctor Jiang Jijun also died from a heart attack after becoming exhausted from attending to patients. Chinese authorities confirmed on Saturday that 41 people had died from the virus and over 1,300 have been infected globally. 56 million people in 18 provinces are now subject to travel restrictions. China has ordered nationwide measures to identify and immediately isolate suspected cases of a deadly virus on trains, aeroplanes and buses. Shanghai has shut all cinemas until 30 January to try to stop the spread of the virus China\u2019s Haikou city, the capital of the southern island province of Hainan, will start a 14-day centralised medical observation for tourists from the central Hubei province 1,200 military medical personnel have been sent to Wuhan to help with the outbreak, according to state media. Australia reported it\u2019s first confirmed case of the virus \u2013 a man in his 50s who had returned from China and had visited Wuhan. Malaysia reported a third case of the virus on Saturday. Japan confirmed its third case. In the UK, 2,000 travellers who have arrived recently from Wuhan are being sought. Fourteen people tested negative for the virus. 12 countries outside China have confirmed cases. The race is on to build a new hospital in Wuhan to treat patients infected with the virus. Here is a timelapse of the work so far: There are reports on the Global Times that a second doctor has died. It says Jiang Jijun died from exhaustion from treating patients. We\u2019ve updated our explainer on where the virus has spread to: This from Agence France-Presse: China has ordered nationwide measures to identify and immediately isolate suspected cases of a deadly virus on trains, aeroplanes and buses, as the death toll and number of patients has skyrocketed. Inspection stations will be set up and passengers with suspected pneumonia must be \u201cimmediately transported\u201d to a medical centre, the National Health Commission said in a statement. The isolation of suspected cases must be followed by disinfection of the train, plane or bus. The statement said \u201call departments of transportation\u201d must \u201cstrictly\u201d introduce prevention and control measures including screening measures in airports, railway stations, bus stations and ports. A statement from Japan\u2019s health ministry said the new patient was a woman in her 30s who arrived in the country on 18 January with no symptoms. She developed a cough and fever on the 21st. The statement said she had not visited the seafood market in Wuhan. To bring our numbers up to date - 56 million people are now subject to restrictions on their movement as authorities expanded travel bans in central Hubei province, now affecting 18 cities. Japan has reportedly confirmed its third case of the coronavirus. One doctor is reportedly infected in Beijing. More signs that new year\u2019s celebrations are off and many people are staying away from public places: Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison has released an update on the virus: Chinese news website Caixin has a snapshot of what reporting on the outbreak in Wuhan during Lunar new year is like. In the piece Gao Yu describes rumours flying around the hospitals, including that patients were attacking doctors. None of these things were true. Overall, the city still operates in an orderly fashion. But shortages of medical devices and the fact that most local medical staff are incredibly overloaded are indeed severe problems. And most worryingly of all is the continuous spread of the virus... Back in our hotel, we found protective gear waiting for us kindly donated by people we don\u2019t even know, sent from around the country. The three of us are the only customers of this hotel. They keep operating just for us, and put a small gift of fruit in our room - it\u2019s the new year after all.\u201d The scene in Wuhan: The Global Times reports that 22 provinces, home to 1.1 billion people, have declared a level 1 public health emergency. The Times of India reports that 12 people who have returned to India from China and Hong Kong have been quarantined as a precaution. Three, including a Briton, are in Mumbai, and nine in Kerala. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news reports that North Korea has stepped up its efforts to prevent the virus entering the country. A flight from Beijing to Pyongyang has been cancelled, travel to China has been restricted and the North\u2019s cabinet Minju Choson called on people to take extra care of personal hygiene, it said. The alarming spread of coronavirus is on the front pages of many Saturday papers around the world: Here is our full report by Michael Standaert in Sichuan on the death of a doctor who was treating patients in Wuhan: Lunar new year celebrations have been subdued as a result of the widespread lockdowns. With many restaurants, markets and parks closed, public gatherings banned and public transport suspended, many people have chosen to stay home. Wang Feng, a 40-year-old resident of Wuhan, told Reuters: \u201cUsually we celebrate as a family. Now, because of the virus I\u2019m not even visiting my parents.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll be great just to be able to make it through (the outbreak).\u201d Images of the start of construction of a 1,000-bed hospital to handle cases of coronavirus in Wuhan show a hive of activity. The facility is due to be completed by 3 February. China undertook a similar project after the Sars outbreak. The government mouthpiece that is the People\u2019s Daily clearly endorses Donald Trump\u2019s message that China is working hard to contain the virus and \u201cit will all work out well\u201d. CGTN, China\u2019s official state broadcaster, now says more than 1,200 medical staff are being sent to Wuhan. Reuters is reporting that Starbucks is closing all of its outlets in Hubei province during the week-long Lunar new year holiday. Here is our latest news wrap by Ben Doherty on the situation in Australia, where a man in his 50s in Melbourne has become the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus, with two further \u201cprobable infections\u201d being treated in New South Wales. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far about the spreading coronavirus. A 62-year-old doctor, Liang Wudong, has died in Wuhan after treating patients Chinese authorities confirmed on Saturday that 41 people had died from the virus and over 1,200 had been infected Shanghai has shut all cinemas until 30 January to try to stop the spread of the virus China\u2019s Haikou city, the capital of the southern island province of Hainan, will start a 14-day centralised medical observation for tourists from the central Hubei province 450 military medical personnel have been sent to Wuhan to help with the outbreak, according to state media, state media has said, according to Agence France-Presse. Australia reported it\u2019s first confirmed case of the virus \u2013 a man in his 50s who had returned from China and had visited Wuhan Malaysia reported a third case of the virus on Saturday In the UK, 2,000 travellers who have arrived recently from Wuhan are being sought. Fourteen people tested negative for the virus. 12 countries outside China have confirmed cases I\u2019m getting a bit more information on the new case of the virus diagnosed in Malaysia, taking the total in that country to three. The health minister, Dzulkefly Ahmad, said the three individuals infected were Chinese nationals and related to the 66-year-old man that was confirmed by Singapore health authorities to have tested positive for the virus. The infected individuals were a 65-year-old woman, who is the wife of the man detected with the virus in Singapore, and their two grandsons, aged 11 and 2, Dzulkefly said. The three have been admitted to Sungai Buloh hospital in Kuala Lumpur for treatment and were considered in stable conditions, the minister said at a news conference. In a separate statement, Malaysia Airports said it has heightened screening of all passengers and crew arriving from China at gateway airports across the country to minimise the potential spread of the virus. Confirmed coronavirus cases in China and internationally A total of 41 people have now died from the coronavirus, according to official Chinese figures. It\u2019s not clear whether the 62-year-old doctor in Wuhan, who died while treating the outbreak, is included in that figure. The National Health Commission reported a jump in the number of people infected with the virus to 1,287. The latest tally came from 29 provinces across China, including 237 patients in serious condition. Internationally, here\u2019s what we know about cases confirmed outside of China. China has reported 1,287 cases of coronavirus Australia confirmed a man in his 50s tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday after returning to Melbourne from Wuhan. Malaysia has confirmed 3 cases of the virus In France, three people have fallen ill with the virus \u2013 the disease\u2019s first appearance in Europe The United States reported its second case, involving a Chicago woman in her 60s who was hospitalised in isolation after returning from China Two cases confirmed in Vietnam Three cases in Singapore As of Friday night, five people had been diagnosed with the virus in Hong Kong, according to the South China Morning Post On Friday South Korea\u2019s government confirmed the second case of a coronavirus that originated in China, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said. Japan \u2013 a destination for many lunar new year holiday makers \u2013 has confirmed 2 cases Thailand\u2019s public health ministry has confirmed five cases. Nepal has one infection Taiwan has reported three cases and Macao two Malaysia has just reported its third case of coronavirus. Australia reported its first case on Saturday. I\u2019ll bring you a rundown of where cases are internationally shortly. China\u2019s Global Times, state media\u2019s tabloid outlet, has tweeted images of empty streets in Wuhan, including the city\u2019s busiest commercial street. It has also tweeted footage of the race to build the new 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan to treat patients. Chinese state media is reporting medical staff from around China are flying to Wuhan to help combat the outbreak of coronavirus. CGTN said a medical team of 135 experts from Guangdong province were among them the medics flying out. \u201cThey include a group of 24 doctors and nurses from Nanfang Hospital, who had been at the forefront of the battle against the SARs epidemic in 2003,\u201d the broadcaster said. Chinese state media has posted an update on the number of cases of coronavirus. It\u2019s missing the Australian case diagnosed on Saturday. The Reuters news agency is reporting that China\u2019s financial hub, Shanghai, has shut down all cinemas during the Lunar New Year holidays, which last until 30 January. They are quoting Liberation Daily online channel. I\u2019ll bring you more on this when i have it. China has stepped up its repsonse to the crisis by sending 450 military medical personnel to Wuhan, state media has said, according to Agence France-Presse. The medics, who arrived by aircraft late on Friday, have experience in flighting Sars and Ebola, the statement said. They will be dispatched to hospitals with large numbers of infected patients, according to the official Xinhua news agency. There are a great many social media posts about the coronavirus, including of footage said to be shot in hospitals in Wuhan which have been grappling with a flood of patients and a lack of supplies. Some of the videos show frantic people in masks lined up for examinations, and some report complaints that family members had been turned away at hospitals that were at capacity. The videos are hard to verify but we do know that authorities in Wuhan and elsewhere put out calls for medicine, disinfection equipment, masks, goggles, gowns and other protective gear. It\u2019s also pretty clear that people in the city are taking whatever precautions they can to avoid infection. Just while I\u2019m still looking at CGTN, the network is reporting that the first coronavirus patient in China\u2019s Zhejiang province as been cured. The Chinese state broadcaster CGTN has also been showing footage of the race to build a new hospital to accomodate the growing number of cases of coronavirus. You can see footage of the build on their tweet below. The official twitter feed of China Global Television Network (CGTN), formerly known as CCTV, said: \u201cLiang Wudong, a doctor at Hubei Xinhua Hospital who had been at the front line of the #CoronavirusOutbreak battle in Wuhan, dies from the virus at age 62.\u201d There are reports emerging that a doctor treating patients in Wuhan has died from coronavirus. Chinese state media has named the doctor as 62-year-old Liang Wudong. I\u2019ll bring you more details as soon as I have them. The Chinese ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, has said Beijing is co-operating with the World Health Organization over the outbreak of the virus. The WHO declared the new coronavirus an \u201cemergency in China\u201d this week but has stopped short of declaring it of international concern. In Hubei province, where the outbreak is believed to have begun, health authorities said on Saturday there were 658 patients affected by the virus in medical care, 57 of whom were critically ill. As promised, here\u2019s some more of what the Australian PM, Scott Morrison said about the country\u2019s first diagnosed case of coronavirus. Morrison said a confirmed diagnoses in the country had been anticipated. \u201cThe Australian Government, of course, has been taking this issue incredibly seriously. We have activated the necessary precautions and procedures that are in place,\u201d he said. Chief medical officers in all states and territories met today he said, to discuss the outbreak. \u201cWhat I want to assure Australians about is the preparedness and the plans and the capabilities are in place here in Australia to deal with issues of this nature. We have the people, we have all of the procedures that are now swinging into place to ensure that we can provide the protection to Australians. Now, that said, across the country, even as we speak, our border authorities and biosecurity authorities will be ensuring that those flights that are coming from China will be met by our officials and there will be appropriate information that is being provided to those alighting passengers.\u201d Morrison confirmed that Australia\u2019s travel advisory had been changed to recommend people do no travel to Hubei province at all. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has just given a press conference about the confirmed case of coronavirus in Melbourne, Australia\u2019s first confirmed. I\u2019ll bring you the details of what he said shortly, but the overall message was for Australian\u2019s to \u201cgo about their normal business\u201d. In China\u2019s Haikou city, the capital of the southern island province of Hainan, will start a 14-day centralised medical observation for tourists from the central Hubei province, the local government in Haikou has announced. Tourists from Hubei, especially from Wuhan city, are not allowed to leave the hotel where the medical observation will be held during the 14-day period, it said. Hubei has confirmed 729 cases of the new coronavirus, with 39 deaths as of 24 January, the provincial health authorities said. Earlier the chief medical office in Australian state of New south Wales, Dr Kerry Chant, said the suspected patients in the country were in isolation and did not pose a risk of transmitting the virus. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging people who have come back from Wuhan, or who have been in contact with confirmed cases in China or in other countries, to please seek care if you develop any symptoms of fever, sore throat, pneumonia, a cough or respiratory symptoms of any sort,\u201d she said. Chant said testing currently takes about six hours but that time frame will likely shrink in the future. You can read our full coverage of the Australian situation here. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer said about another 12 people were being tested in Australia today for the virus. The man diagnosed with the virus is in his 50s and sought medical advice after he fell ill once he was in Melbourne. Murphy said he wore a face mask to the hospital where he reported his symptoms. He arrived in Melbourne on flight CZ321 last Sunday 19 January \u2013 a China Southern Airlines Flight No CZ321 from Guangzhou. Australian authorities are contacting people on that flight. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, is giving a news conference, after a case of coronavirus was confirmed in Melbourne. He says there is \u201cno evidence this virus is being transmitted in Australia\u201d. He has asked that anyone who has travelled from China who develops flu-like symptoms to see their doctor and get checked out. \u201cAt this stage there is no risk to the general Australian community,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cThere are potentially others like this person (diagnosed in Melbourne)... who was well when he travelled.\u201d He confirmed the man diagnosed had visited Wuhan province, but had come from a direct flight from Guangzhou to Melbourne. In the United Kingdom, the 14 people who were tested for coronavirus did not in fact have it. But UK health officials have teamed up with Border Force agents and airlines to try to track down around 2,000 people who have recently flown into the UK from Wuhan. China\u2019s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, says the government in Beijing is determined to curb the spread of the virus. Health officials have teamed up with Border Force agents and airlines to try to track down around 2,000 people who have recently flown into the UK from Wuhan, the Chinese province at the centre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak. As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread, Chinese authorities in Wuhan are rushing to build a new 1,000-bed hospital in the city to deal with the rising influx of patients. To speed construction, the hospital is being built with prefabricated buildings around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers, set in gardens by a lake on the outskirts of the city. You can read the full story of the hospital build here, but in the mean time, here are some amazing images of the construction. Officials in the Australia say the 50-year-old man arrived in Australia on Sunday. He entered Australia on China Southern Airlines flight number CZ321 and had spent the intervening time with family in Melbourne. The man developed symptoms of pneumonia and presented to a GP on Thursday. He was then put into isolation. Authorities said there may be other people on the plane who were incubating the virus and called for other people on the flight to come forward for testing. A man in Australia has the coronavirus, officials have said. The man arrived in Melbourne from the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou about a week ago, authorities said. Health officials in New South Wales said on Saturday morning that five people were being tested for the coronavirus. Two other people have been discharged after returning negative results on Friday. Another two people in Queensland are also being assessed for the virus. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said the government was advising people not to travel to and from Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. A flight arrived in Sydney direct from Wuhan on Thursday before the Chinese city\u2019s airport was closed. Here\u2019s the full story from our reporter in Sydney, Ben Doherty. Welcome to our live coverage of the Sars-like coronavirus outbreak. To start is off, these are the main developments in the last few hours: China said on Saturday morning that the death toll has risen to 41 with 1,287 affected. Thirteen cities with a population of 36 million people are in lockdown as the government tries to stop the virus from spreading as China enters the lunar new year holiday. Chinese state TV said the authorities were going to take stricter and more targeted measures to curb the spread. The virus, which began in the central city of Wuhan, has now spread to much of east and south-east Asia, including South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam. Three cases have been recorded in France and the health minister said more were expected In the UK, 2,000 travellers who have arrived recently from Wuhan are being sought. Fourteen people tested negative for the virus. Five people are being tested in the Australian state of New South Wales.

      "bodyText": "A British academic who returned from China this week has said that no one from the UK government has tried to contact him regarding the coronavirus outbreak. Health officials have teamed up with Border Force agents and airlines to try to track down about 2,000 people who have flown to the UK from Wuhan, the area worst affected by the outbreak. Prof Martin Dove, who works for Queen Mary College London and Wuhan University of Technology, had been working in Wuhan from 3-12 January before heading to other parts of China and flying home on Wednesday. After reading that Public Health England wanted to trace all those who had arrived back to the UK from Wuhan in the past 14 days, the physics professor tried to email PHE on various addresses and even emailed the chief medical officer Chris Whitty, but says he has not heard back from anyone.

      "body": "<p>Tracey Thorn began her career as a singer and musician, before becoming best known as half of Everything But the Girl, with her lifelong partner, Ben Watt. She then became a solo artist, and a writer of three bestselling books: her 2013 memoir <em>Bedsit Disco Queen</em>, 2016\u2019s <em>Naked </em><em>at </em><em>the Albert Hall</em> and <em>Another Planet</em>, published last year, which traces her years growing up in London\u2019s suburbs, and is out in paperback on 6 February.</p> <p><strong>How does writing about </strong><strong>the 1970s world of </strong><em><strong>Another Planet</strong></em><strong> </strong><strong>feel now?</strong><br>My own kids can\u2019t imagine how we ever survived when I tell them about staying in all evening waiting for a phone call from someone, who you\u2019d then arrange to meet under a clock tower in a nearby town, only to have the bus cancelled and not be able to get there. The thing that strikes me now is how locally rooted our lives were. Without the internet, we had no access to other people in other places, so we did a lot of dreaming and a lot of fantasising. The rest of the time, we just tried to avoid dying of boredom.</p> <p><strong>Your diaries fill the book. They\u2019re hilariously unpoetic: about clothes you failed to buy, </strong><em><strong>Coronation Street</strong></em><strong> episodes, unsuitable boys. What surprised you about them?</strong><br>How dishonest they are in places. Given that I was only writing them for myself, I didn\u2019t often take the opportunity to express my true feelings. Instead, I lied, and put on a brave face. \u201cNever fancied him anyway,\u201d I\u2019d write when a boy dumped me. I\u2019d leave out things that had gone wrong, or been difficult.

It\u2019s a record of a woman\u2019s life, detailing the things that often get glossed over in songs - things like body image, and going on the pill, and the realities of being up all night feeding babies, and the fact that even once you\u2019re older, and a <em>mum</em>, and supposedly the embodiment of everything that\u2019s safe and cosy, you don\u2019t lose your desire for excitement and euphoria, which for me is often to be found on the dance floor with a glass in my hand.</p> <p><strong>Which books about suburbia have you enjoyed?</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/zadie-smith-on-the-buddha-of-suburbia\" title=\"\">Hanif Kureishi\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/zadie-smith-on-the-buddha-of-suburbia\" title=\"\">The Buddha of Suburbia</a> </em>is amazing.

      "bodyText": "Tracey Thorn began her career as a singer and musician, before becoming best known as half of Everything But the Girl, with her lifelong partner, Ben Watt. She then became a solo artist, and a writer of three bestselling books: her 2013 memoir Bedsit Disco Queen, 2016\u2019s Naked at the Albert Hall and Another Planet, published last year, which traces her years growing up in London\u2019s suburbs, and is out in paperback on 6 February. How does writing about the 1970s world of Another Planet feel now? My own kids can\u2019t imagine how we ever survived when I tell them about staying in all evening waiting for a phone call from someone, who you\u2019d then arrange to meet under a clock tower in a nearby town, only to have the bus cancelled and not be able to get there. The thing that strikes me now is how locally rooted our lives were. Without the internet, we had no access to other people in other places, so we did a lot of dreaming and a lot of fantasising. The rest of the time, we just tried to avoid dying of boredom. Your diaries fill the book. They\u2019re hilariously unpoetic: about clothes you failed to buy, Coronation Street episodes, unsuitable boys. What surprised you about them? How dishonest they are in places. Given that I was only writing them for myself, I didn\u2019t often take the opportunity to express my true feelings. Instead, I lied, and put on a brave face. \u201cNever fancied him anyway,\u201d I\u2019d write when a boy dumped me. I\u2019d leave out things that had gone wrong, or been difficult. I think it was partly an exercise in defiance, a refusal to be defeated by life\u2019s adversities. So in that sense, my diary was a bit of a self-help manual, written by me, for me. The book is also about your parents, and how wildly their lives and expectations differed from yours. You mention your father saying \u201cI never knew Tracey was so into music\u201d after you wrote your first memoir Bedsit Disco Queen. What was it like to trawl those memories? My dad barely features in my diaries, as I think we were quite distant at that time, which perhaps goes some way to explaining how little he knew or understood me. We weren\u2019t connecting, and I think he lost sight of who I really was. As for my mum, we had been very close, and then fell out badly when I rebelled against all the rules and conventions. Some of the diary entries I found very painful to read. Accounts of ugly rows. Tears and shouting. The casual way in which I mention that she has been put on Valium by the doctor. Another Planet celebrates female musicians that offered you a way out of ordinary life. How have the memoirs of several you mention \u2013 like Viv Albertine and Chrissie Hynde \u2013 inspired you? It\u2019s been fantastic to hear the true life stories from those women. So often the story of rock\u2019n\u2019roll is told from a male perspective. So often it feels like men own music. And I still get as angry and frustrated about that as I ever did. Reading those women\u2019s accounts of their lives has reminded me how much they paved the way back then. And history too often erases the women, in all art forms. Every single published story of a female artist goes a small way towards redressing the balance, and is another one saved from the fire. You write about pop stars that emerged from the boredom of suburbia, like David Bowie and Siouxsie Sioux. Do we need more boredom? No, I would never impose boredom on anyone. Life is short and it\u2019s a shame to spend some of it feeling trapped and thwarted. I know that it can be an inspiration to some people, and spur you on to make things happen, but at the same time it can also just drag you down. Sometimes it crushed our imaginative spirit. Sometimes it made us reckless, and for young girls that was risky. We\u2019d do anything to escape being bored, and that wasn\u2019t always good for us.

Which books about suburbia have you enjoyed? Hanif Kureishi\u2019s The Buddha of Suburbia is amazing. Also, when I had just finished writing Another Planet a book was published by John Grindrod called Outskirts: Living Life on the Edge of the Green Belt. I panicked and asked my publisher to read it for me, fearing that the book I had just written was going to be an exact copy of this one.

Dependency by Tove Ditlevsen, which is the third part of her Copenhagen Trilogy. She was born in 1917, a working-class girl in Copenhagen, and grew up longing to be a writer.

In a sharply-worded statement issued by the state department, Pompeo accused the reporter, Mary Louise Kelly, of lying to him and being part of an \u201cunhinged\u201d media conspiracy \u201cin a quest to hurt President Trump and this administration\u201d. The bizarre final line of the brief statement \u2013 \u201cIt is worth noting that Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine\u201d \u2013 appears to suggest that Pompeo believes Kelly identified a different country when he asked her to point out Ukraine on an unmarked map produced by aides. The claim contradicts the experienced foreign correspondent and radio host\u2019s own recollection of the encounter, in which she said she had no trouble identifying Ukraine, after which Pompeo put the map away and insisted: \u201cPeople will hear about this.\u201d The release of the statement further suggests that the politician, who has a notoriously short fuse, was stung by media coverage of the aftermath of his interview with Kelly, which ended prematurely when Pompeo refused to answer questions about Ukraine. Kelly said Pompeo then called her into a separate room and attempted to browbeat her, asking \u201cDo you think Americans care about Ukraine?\u201d and launching into a foul-mouthed tirade. The state department statement, however, seeks to shift blame to Kelly. \u201cIt is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency,\u201d it said, claiming Kelly had lied to Pompeo twice, first in setting up the interview and secondly by breaching an apparent agreement to keep the contents of the post-interview conversation off the record. \u201cIt is no wonder the American people distrust many in the media when they consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity,\u201d it read. NPR has stood by its reporter. \u201cPompeo proceeded to shout his displeasure at being questioned about Ukraine,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cHe used repeated expletives.\u201d In an interview with NPR on Friday, Kelly said Pompeo had shouted at her \u201cfor about the same amount of time as the interview itself\u201d.

Javid has so far resisted calls to ditch his version of the tax, although he has said it would be lifted once an international solution to taxing big tech companies was agreed. Going ahead with the levy is likely to provoke retaliation from the US, most likely in the form of tariffs on cars.</p> <p>Mnuchin also reiterated concerns about the UK\u2019s use of Huawei technology, due to be confirmed this week. He warned that it raised concerns about security and privacy. \u201cIf you look at the role of technology, it is critical that we have infrastructure that is protected,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have important relationships, and I think what\u2019s clear is for the role of government and the role of national security issues and the role of defence, we want to make sure our infrastructures are protected.</p> <p>\u201cAs more and more things are connected to the network and to the grid, these national security issues go beyond the traditional aspects and go into various different aspects. I think the real issue for us is making sure that the networks and infrastructure are properly protected.\u201d</p> <p>The lobbying from the Trump regime will continue this week when Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, meets the prime minister and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary.</p> <p>The skirmishes could make it harder for Britain to secure a comprehensive trade deal with the US. However, Mnuchin said he was \u201cquite optimistic\u201d a deal could be done this year and that US-UK trade would increase. He said the US was \u201cprepared to dedicate a lot of resources\u201d to securing a post-Brexit trade deal.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK and US have very similar economies with a big focus on services, and I think this will be a very important relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is going back to the president during the campaign. He said, post-Brexit, they\u2019ll be at the top of the list.\u201d</p>",

Speaking at Chatham House, in London, Mnuchin revealed that he had raised his concerns about the proposed digital services tax, which would mean a 2% levy being applied to sales of big tech firms, during a meeting at 11 Downing Street. \u201cWe believe that the [digital services tax] is a discriminatory tax,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d He added that such a tax contained \u201cviolations to our tax treaties\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re working through that and I think we have a good outcome of trying to give some room now in 2020 to continue these discussions,\u201d he said. The UK has become isolated over the issue of a digital services tax after France announced it would drop its plan for a 3% levy on the revenues of large technology companies. Javid has so far resisted calls to ditch his version of the tax, although he has said it would be lifted once an international solution to taxing big tech companies was agreed. Going ahead with the levy is likely to provoke retaliation from the US, most likely in the form of tariffs on cars. Mnuchin also reiterated concerns about the UK\u2019s use of Huawei technology, due to be confirmed this week. He warned that it raised concerns about security and privacy. \u201cIf you look at the role of technology, it is critical that we have infrastructure that is protected,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have important relationships, and I think what\u2019s clear is for the role of government and the role of national security issues and the role of defence, we want to make sure our infrastructures are protected. \u201cAs more and more things are connected to the network and to the grid, these national security issues go beyond the traditional aspects and go into various different aspects. I think the real issue for us is making sure that the networks and infrastructure are properly protected.\u201d The lobbying from the Trump regime will continue this week when Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, meets the prime minister and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary. The skirmishes could make it harder for Britain to secure a comprehensive trade deal with the US. However, Mnuchin said he was \u201cquite optimistic\u201d a deal could be done this year and that US-UK trade would increase. He said the US was \u201cprepared to dedicate a lot of resources\u201d to securing a post-Brexit trade deal. \u201cThe UK and US have very similar economies with a big focus on services, and I think this will be a very important relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is going back to the president during the campaign. He said, post-Brexit, they\u2019ll be at the top of the list.\u201d",

Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire) Southampton v Tottenham: Christian Eriksen has been left out Tottenham\u2019s squad, despite travelling with the team. Reports in Italy suggest a deal had been agreed to sell him to Inter for a fee of around \u00a315m. Harry Winks has recovered from an ankle injury and starts, while Gedson Fernandes makes his full debut. Troy Parrott is not in Tottenham\u2019s match-day squad. Southampton recall in-form striker Danny Ings after he was rested in midweek against Crystal Palace. Meanwhile in Scotland: Jermain Defoe has agreed to join Rangers on a permanent deal in the summer. The 37-year-old striker, who has been on loan from Bournemouth this season, has signed a pre-contract agreement with the Ibrox club for the 2020/21 campaign. Brentford v Leicester: They\u2019re trailing by a goal, but Brentford have Leicester under the cosh at Griffin Park, where they\u2019ve just hit the woodwork in their search for an equaliser. Scott Murray has the latest ... Good news for Rep of Ireland fans: Jose Mourinho has suggested that Tottenham\u2019s 17-year-old Irish striker Troy Parrott could get a run-out in Tottenham\u2019s games against Southampton. \u201cHe is ready to work with us every day like he is doing,\u201d said Mourinho, of a player who has been restricted to just two appearances this season. \u201cHe trains with the group, after training he has a special programme of individual development of his qualities as a striker and this club takes very good care of the players. That is the only thing I can say. If he has to play with us, he will. He will do his best, he will show his good qualities, he will show his fragilities because at this moment he is a 17-year-old kid with fragilities in his game. But in this moment I cannot tell you, it is possible he is selected for this game.\u201d Brentford v Leicester City: Brendan Rodgers brought Leicester City to play in what could be the last ever FA Cup tie played in Griffin Park in today\u2019s early kick-off. Both he and his opposite Thomas Frank made nine changes each ahead of this game, suggesting their priorities lie elsewhere. Brentford are due to move in to their well appointed and imaginatively titled 17,800 capacity New Stadium in the summer. It\u2019s Premier League ready, but it remains to be seen whether the Bees, currently fifth in the Championship, will be playing top flight football in their first season at their new home. It\u2019s half-time at Griffin Park, where Brentford trail by a Kelechi Iheanacho goal scored in the third minute. Despite the early setback, Brentford have played their way into the game and are giving their Premier League opponents a run for their money. Coventry City v Birmingham City: Coventry are thriving under Mark Robins and St Andrew\u2019s is sold out for today\u2019s derby but the future is still worrying for fans, writes Ben Fisher. Liverpool news: The Premier League leaders travel to New Meadow tomorrow to play Shrewsbury Town and Jurgen Klopp has hinted he may use the FA Cup tie against the League One side to give Fabinho, Dejan Lovren and Jo\u00ebl Matip their first starts of the year. Read on ... A total of eight of the fourth round\u2019s 16 ties kick off at 3pm, with no shortage of interesting matches for us to keep across. Flying high in League One, despite being homeless and operating on a shoestring budget, Coventry City play host to their landlords, Birmingham City, in one of the more intriguing games of the round. At Turf Moor, Burnley entertain Norwich in one of two all Premier League affairs being played this afternoon, while Southampton host Tottenham Hotspur in the other. Seventh in League One, Portsmouth are the lowest placed side in action today and are sure to attract the usual full house to Fratton Park for their match against Barnsley, from the Championship but just nine places above their hosts in the league ladder. We\u2019ll bring you team news and build-up ahead of kick-off, followed by reports on all the goals and other talking points as the action unfolds around the grounds. Don\u2019t touch that dial.",

He took the ball wide around Bartosz Bialkowski, but his shot was cleared off the line by the prescient James Brown. Otherwise the game congealed quietly. Millwall were busy, Jayson Molumby an artful presence in central midfield. Up front the largely immobile Matt Smith roamed hopefully, more diplodocus than raptor. As half-time approached Phil Jagielka headed over right in front of goal from a left wing corner and raged at the referee, Anthony Taylor, about some perceived shirt-holding, much to the amusement of the Cold Blow Lane end. No VAR here. The second half picked up where the first had quietly died, enlivened by more urgency from the visitors. Some neat passing triangles on the left ended with Callum Robinson stabbing just wide, the ball deflected off a Millwall leg. Something was stirring. It turned out to be a Sheffield United goal, made by Sharp\u2019s sniping decoy run across the face of the defence. Space opened up in front of Besic, who sensed it, moved forward and then had time to curl a wonderful dipping shot over Bialkowski and into the far corner. It was Besic\u2019s first goal for the club and his first for anyone since October 2018. It was deserved too, culmination of a spell where the visitors finally found their rhythms, shifting positions, overlapping in unexpected areas, and producing those inventive patterns that have marked Chris Wilder\u2019s team. Rowett threw on Bradshaw and Wallace for the final 20 minutes. It made little difference. Some fine buildup made space for Norwood to drive low and hard into the corner with six minutes remaining.",

      "bodyText": "On Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s last visit here he railed at everything from ball boys to backroom staff but on this occasion his prime source of frustration stemmed not from Southampton but rather the protracted transfer saga surrounding Christian Eriksen, who is close to sealing a \u20ac20m move to Internazionale. Mourinho pointed the finger at the Serie A club before shrugging his shoulders at the manner in which fixtures are piling up for Tottenham Hotspur after having to settle for a replay. Before kick-off Mourinho bemoaned his side\u2019s congested schedule and, after Sofiane Boufal cancelled out a wonderfully crafted Son Heung-min opener, the Portuguese has another game to add to the list. Son struck after a magical weaving run by Giovani Lo Celso, which appeared to pave Spurs\u2019 passage to the fifth round \u2013 but they face a replay after Boufal lashed home inside the box from a cutback by Danny Ings.

      "bodyText": "The new head of the UK\u2019s independent press regulator has been criticised for providing legal assistance to an authoritarian regime notorious for the arbitrary arrests of journalists, shutting down of newspapers and state censorship. Lord Faulks QC, who became chair of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) this month, was among a number of the judiciary hired in 2018 to help run a commercial court in Kazakhstan under the authoritarian leadership of the then president, Nursultan Nazarbayev. Critics say the central Asian republic is plagued by corruption and human rights abuses and, in sharp contrast to Ipso\u2019s ambition to \u201cmaintain freedom of expression for the press\u201d, is classified as among the worst countries in protecting the media from interference. The latest assessment by Reporters without Borders ranked Kazakhstan 158 out of 180 countries, chastising its government for jailing journalists, controlling the internet and presiding over a \u201cheritage of censorship\u201d. Human Rights Watch, in its recent annual update, cited \u201c54 detentions, arrests, convictions, or limits on the freedom of journalists\u201d between January and September 2019. Hugh Williamson, director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Europe and central Asia division, said it was important that Faulks, a peer and former justice minister who was appointed a justice at a commercial court in Kazakhstan\u2019s capital, Nur-Sultan, understood that accepting such a role meant he risked legitimising the regime. \u201cKazakhstan imposes severe limits on freedom of expression. We would expect him to be aware of the dangers of his role being used to legitimise an authoritarian government,\u201d said Williamson. Steve Goodrich, senior research manager at Transparency International UK, which campaigns against corruption, echoed the concerns. \u201cAlthough some silks might see opportunities for reform when an autocrat asks for their assistance, they should be cautious that their work does not merely serve to launder the reputation of a corrupt and repressive regime,\u201d he said. In 2018, along with eight other judges and senior lawyers from the UK, Faulks began helping to run the Astana international financial centre court, which refers to the capital\u2019s previous name. It is not clear if the 69-year-old, who served as justice minister for three years from 2013, is still working for the Kazakh authorities. When his role as chair of Ipso was first announced last year, Faulks said: \u201cThe freedom of the press is a crucial part of our democracy.\u201d It is also not known how much Faulks was paid for his work which is understood to have involved five visits a year. When former prime minister Tony Blair began advising Kazakhstan\u2019s president, leaked documents revealed he wanted more than \u00a35m a year to advise Nazarbayev through his consulting business. Williamson said: \u201cHe is likely to be getting lucrative consultancy fees for this work. Kazakhstan is very keen on attracting senior international figures to polish its image.\u201d Other notable figures among the eight-strong team of the judiciary include the former most senior judge in England, Lord Woolf, who was appointed head of the Kazakhstan court. Williamson also said the court appeared not to be an attempt to raise legal standards in a country where last year\u2019s successor to Nazarbayev, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has made little difference. \u201cWe have very serious concerns about the independence of the judiciary and the courts system. Woolf and the other British judges are presiding over an island of high legal standards in a sea of much lower legal standards in a country where there\u2019s no clear independent judiciary,\u201d said Williamson. Analysis from Reporters Without Borders, which noted press freedom in Kazakhstan is declining, found that while most of the major opposition national newspapers were banned in 2013, the remaining few \u201care collapsing under the impact of judicial proceedings\u201d. The Human Rights Watch report also highlighted direct attacks against the press, citing eight incidents including during a press conference in July last year hosted by a human rights group in which five journalists had equipment damaged or stolen.

My first memory of police brutality was when they killed this young man named Amadou Diallo [in 1999], an African immigrant living in the Bronx. He was killed with 41 shots when he reached for his wallet. He had just moved here, trying to make a better life for himself, but all they saw was a black man who was a threat.

While it does have some history (Hampton Court Palace is just across the Thames), it also bears the scars of 20th-century arterial roads.</p> <p>The university\u2019s vice-chancellor, Steven Spier, says that half the students at Kingston are the first in their family to attend university. \u201cUniversity is about moving you into a new space.

The value that you put in contemporary work means that you have a belief in the future.\u201d As with all competitors in the now intense market of higher education, the new building is doubtless also about raising Kingston\u2019s marketing profile, but that\u2019s not a point Spier stresses.

Rather than, as billed, riotous subversive snapshots of the \u201creal\u201d UK, it came across as Dick Emery for haters. A lurid yet monotonously repetitive monster\u2019s ball of fat-suited grotesques, dragged-up harridans, welfare-ghouls and coarse stereotypes that oozed judgment and malice from every laboured premise, wrung-dry catchphrase and soulless payoff.</p> <p>This was a pageant of the anti-aspirational \u2013 characters that viewers could feel smug about <em>not</em> being. Gormless office workers \u2013 \u201ccomputer says no\u201d. Fake-disabled Lou \u2013 so brave to call out the multitudes of fake disabled.

Certainly, it\u2019s no justification for empowering bullies to feel they suddenly had a legitimate cultural moment to hang their bile on. Nor does it excuse what came across as less a valid creative process than a forensic study of \u201clittle\u201d people\u2019s lives, as observed, one presumed, from the smug seat-belted comfort and safety of a gratis black cab bound for Broadcasting House. That sense of a rock being gingerly lifted to examine the sub-humanity pathetically wriggling beneath. \u201cSee that, Matt, it\u2019s comedy gold \u2013 take notes!\u201d</p> <p>They said it themselves \u2013 \u201ccruel\u201d, but this was a highly selective cruelty.

      "bodyText": "Little Britain is returning after a 12-year break, following a one-off Little Brexit episode for Radio 4 last year. Creators David Walliams and Matt Lucas seem to be hinting that they will now endeavour to be more \u201cpolitically correct\u201d, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a different time\u2026 tolerances change\u201d, and \u201cWe made a crueller comedy than [we\u2019d] do now\u201d. A different time? I\u2019m not sure. Some of us were repelled by Little Britain the first time around. A lot of comedy is destined to date badly, but Little Britain went one better and felt dated from the start. Rather than, as billed, riotous subversive snapshots of the \u201creal\u201d UK, it came across as Dick Emery for haters. A lurid yet monotonously repetitive monster\u2019s ball of fat-suited grotesques, dragged-up harridans, welfare-ghouls and coarse stereotypes that oozed judgment and malice from every laboured premise, wrung-dry catchphrase and soulless payoff. This was a pageant of the anti-aspirational \u2013 characters that viewers could feel smug about not being. Gormless office workers \u2013 \u201ccomputer says no\u201d. Fake-disabled Lou \u2013 so brave to call out the multitudes of fake disabled. Mail-order bride, Ting Tong \u2013 what\u2019s funnier than foreigners? And of course Vicky \u201cyeah, but, no but\u201d Pollard \u2013 the shell-suited Widow Twankey of barely concealed prejudice. At that time, young single mothers were among the most scapegoated groups in society. Bravo to Walliams and Lucas for spotting the LOLs to be had from that. While Little Britain targets generally took their lampooning well, I\u2019d argue that\u2019s to their own credit, not the makers\u2019. Certainly, it\u2019s no justification for empowering bullies to feel they suddenly had a legitimate cultural moment to hang their bile on. Nor does it excuse what came across as less a valid creative process than a forensic study of \u201clittle\u201d people\u2019s lives, as observed, one presumed, from the smug seat-belted comfort and safety of a gratis black cab bound for Broadcasting House. That sense of a rock being gingerly lifted to examine the sub-humanity pathetically wriggling beneath. \u201cSee that, Matt, it\u2019s comedy gold \u2013 take notes!\u201d They said it themselves \u2013 \u201ccruel\u201d, but this was a highly selective cruelty. While sometimes comedy screws up on taste levels, here it was empathy that was found wanting: I\u2019m not saying that comedians should hang nightly from microphone stands, weeping for the poor, but even outright venom requires a modicum of perspective and soul. This was my problem with Little Britain \u2013 Walliams and Lucas always seemed a tad overfond of punching down. I\u2019d have thought that one of the tricks of great comedy is to punch up, at least across, not down \u2013 way-yyy down \u2013 at those already struggling. This isn\u2019t about censorship, or gagging or neutering humour, it\u2019s about not lunging straight for the lowest common denominator, going for those who have no chance of fighting back. So, let\u2019s welcome the new, improved Little Britain, but forget all the disingenuous guff about \u201cdifferent times\u201d.

But also because there\u2019s a subset of English cricket supporters who, I suspect, have been looking forward to being proved right about this. But it\u2019s easy to rewrite history - for about the first year he was back in the team, he was superb. One of the biggest single factors in England\u2019s 2018 win over India and very good against SL later that year too. I think it\u2019s probably time for Foakes - I feel like Buttler\u2019s lost confidence in his defensive technique which partly explains that shot earlier.

As for Hick, he played (off the top of my head) in 65 Tests, scoring 3,383 runs at 31.32, earning him a place in a different side - the What Actually Was XI. Now Tufnell is a different matter. He played 42 times for England (121 wickets at 37.68), but how different that might have been if he\u2019d had a single captain who trusted him. Also, stick SF Barnes in there, and put Graeme Pollock and Barry Richards in your World XI.\u201d</p> <p>Millings, shut your mouth and send me a comedy XI.

      "bodyText": "Vic Marks\u2019 match report has arrived, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company - night! England will have to work exceptionally hard to mess this up. They are in total control after a brilliant second half of the day. At one stage, when England were 318 for nine, the match was nicely poised. Then Mark Wood and Stuart Broad larruped 82 in just 8.2 overs before the bowlers squeezed the life out of South Africa with a relentless performance. South Africa could only manage 88 runs in 41.5 overs, and they lost six wickets as well. Three of them went to Wood, who is having a helluva time right now, while Chris Woakes bowled beautifully and deserved more than one wicket. England end a brilliant day with another wicket. Wood jumps wide on the crease and squares Nortje up, with Denly taking a smart catch in the gully. South Africa are in disarray, it\u2019s true, but England bowled with ferocious intent after tea. Woakes and Wood, in particular, were brilliant. \u201cNever mind Wood\u2019s bowling figures,\u201d says Tom Adam, \u201che\u2019s averaging 77 with the bat this series!!\u201d 41st over: South Africa 87-5 (de Kock 31, Nortje 6) There should be time for two more overs. Stokes continues to de Kock, who helps a poor delivery round the corner for four more. He is South Africa\u2019s best batsman by a mile, and is just ahead of Stokes as the leading run-scorer in the series. 40th over: South Africa 82-5 (de Kock 26, Nortje 6) In his last two and a bit appearances, Mark Wood has shaved seven runs off his Test bowling average. It was 41.73, it\u2019s now 34.82 - and it almost drops to 34.00 when Nortje is beaten outside off stump. Wood is bowling really sharply, with everything between 89-93 mph in that over. 39th over: South Africa 81-5 (de Kock 25, Nortje 6) Nortje does extremely well to repel a couple of really nasty lifters from Stokes, who is also now hitting 90mph. England are all over South Africa like a cheap metaphor. 38th over: South Africa 78-5 (de Kock 24, Nortje 4) This has been a ruthless bowling performance from England. Anrich Nortje, who doesn\u2019t deserve this, comes in as nightwatchman and flicks his first ball for four. It\u2019s been such a miserable series for South Africa but they have at least discovered a gem in Nortje. Another one gone! Bavuma edges a sharp delivery from Wood to second slip, where Stokes takes a smart low catch. The umpires go upstairs to check, with a soft signal of out, and replays confirm it was a clean take. 37th over: South Africa 74-4 (de Kock 24, Bavuma 6) Stokes replaces Broad, whose figures of 9-3-13-0 are slightly flattering. He tries to tempt de Kock with a few fuller deliveries angled across him; de Kock declines the offer. 36th over: South Africa 74-4 (de Kock 24, Bavuma 6) Mark Wood replaces Chris Woakes. Quinton de Kock is beaten, chasing a very wide half-volley, and then gets off strike with a single to fine leg. There\u2019s just over half an hour\u2019s play remaining. 35th over: South Africa 73-4 (de Kock 23, Bavuma 6) Bavuma is beaten, chasing a wide one from Broad. If South Africa lose any more wickets before the close they will struggle to draw this match, never mind win it. 34th over: South Africa 70-4 (de Kock 21, Bavuma 5) 33rd over: South Africa 70-4 (de Kock 21, Bavuma 5) Broad, who hasn\u2019t been at his best today, goes wider on the crease to beat de Kock with an extravagant leg-cutter. That was beautifully bowled. It feels like there has been a play-and-miss in almost every over of this innings. \u201cCan I select myself in a What-Might-Have-Been XI (RH Medium-Fast)?\u201d asks Matt Dony. \u201cHad things panned out slightly differently, growing up in different circumstances in a different place with a different level of ability, who knows? Sliding doors, and all that...\u201d You really should be a philosophy teacher. 32nd over: South Africa 69-4 (de Kock 21, Bavuma 4) South Africa are in all sorts. Their only hope is to counter-attack and try to unsettle England\u2019s bowlers, who currently have complete control. The best/only man for that job is de Kock, who drives Woakes delightfully through mid-off for four. He has 21 from 20 balls; the rest have scored 48 from 172. \u201cIt must be annoying for some to see Root doing good captaining,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cA bit too much pleasure is taken writing people off. Buttler seems next in the firing line.\u201d Bloodlust is the new empathy. 31st over: South Africa 63-4 (de Kock 16, Bavuma 3) There\u2019s a whiff of Joe Denly* about Bavuma\u2019s Test career. He looks an accomplished player, very neat and tidy, yet he averages 31 and has only one century from 39 Tests. * this, coincidentally, is also the title of my upcoming memoir about writing OBOs for a living 30th over: South Africa 63-4 (de Kock 16, Bavuma 3) The recalled Temba Bavuma square drives his first ball sweetly for three. Chris Woakes gets the wicket he deserves. He shaped one back sharply to Faf du Plessis, who was hit high on the pad and given out LBW by Rod Tucker. I thought it looked high, and du Plessis reviewed almost straight away, but it was just Umpire\u2019s Call. du Plessis, who was batting with intense determination, has gone for 3 from 29 balls. That ball from Woakes came back a long way; I\u2019m not sure there was much he could have done. 29th over: South Africa 60-3 (du Plessis 3, de Kock 16) Broad replaces Curran. An attempted yorker to de Kock is flicked crisply through midwicket for four. As usual, he is making batting look very easy. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cHas the jury reached a decision on Joe Root\u2019s captaincy, yet?\u201d Ach, I was really enjoying a couple of Tests without talking about Root\u2019s captaincy. My feeling, since you didn\u2019t ask, is that he\u2019s not a natural captain and will never really understand it, even though he has been better in this series. The last couple of victories and especially the emergence of a young side deserve to buy him more time. England might even win all four series this year (SA and SL away, WI and Pak home). But then they play India away and home (both five-Test series) before going to Australia. I suspect that, at some point during those 14 Tests in 2021, matters will come to a head. 28th over: South Africa 56-3 (du Plessis 3, de Kock 12) Chris Woakes replaces Ben Stokes, who bowled a relatively loose spell of 4-0-19-1. Not much happens, and that\u2019s drinks. This is what we\u2019ve been waiting for: Mac Millings\u2019 What Might Have Been XI. Farokh Engineer-miss Mark Regretbatch Cyril Washout Dud-ley Nourse Derek Also-randall Kusal Mendisappointment Hardik Flash-in-the-Pandya What Might Have Ben Foakes Derek Underachieverwood Sanjay not with a Bangar but a Victor Trumper Don Flopley OBO: Alternative Timeline de Lisle 27th over: South Africa 56-3 (du Plessis 3, de Kock 12) Quinton de Kock back cuts Curran for four more. It looks like he has decided to hit his team out of trouble, which makes sense in the circumstances - not least because a similar approach effectively won South Africa the first Test. \u201cI\u2019d like to suggest Graham Onions for your XI,\u201d says Scott Roberts. \u201cI felt so sorry for him that his international career was so cut short by injury, as in his pomp he had a beautiful action, sending down pitched up 90mph beauties from very tight to the stumps, zipping either way off the deck. He could/should have matched Philander\u2019s international record. Also worthy of a mention is Chris Tremlett, whose career was also hugely curtailed due to injury. At his best he must have been a nightmare to face. Poor lads.\u201d Yes, both are excellent shouts. I\u2019m not sure Onions would have matched Philander, whose record is extraordinary, but in a different era I\u2019d have fancied him to take 152 wickets at 29.82. Also, imagine him nipping it both ways off the bowler-friendly Test pitches we have seen in the last 3-4 years. 26th over: South Africa 49-3 (du Plessis 2, de Kock 6) de Kock gets his first boundary with a sumptuous cover drive off Stokes. His timing is quite something. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Eva Maaten. \u201cI am sure you\u2019re familiar from the Sky coverage with pictures of happy groups of South African fans singing traditional songs - today, one such group is situated straight behind us and while the atmosphere is indeed electric, it feels a bit like one is watching the cricket as a silent movie - nothing can be heard but the singing. I think, I prefer them slightly further away from me... all great fun, though. \u201cOn the topic of Buttler: I really feel for him, he seems an intelligent perfectionist which means one he can be his own worst enemy in situations when you should simply trust your instincts and go with the flow.\u201d Tell me about it rofl. 25th over: South Africa 43-3 (du Plessis 2, de Kock 0) Faf du Plessis, who has started watchfully, defends throughout another maiden from Curran. du Plessis knows that, if he doesn\u2019t make a century, South Africa will almost certainly lose the series and he will probably lose his job. It\u2019s a great life being an international sportsman. 24th over: South Africa 43-3 (du Plessis 2, de Kock 0) Quinton de Kock, promoted to No5, is greeted by a nasty lifter from Stokes that hits him on the glove. This pitch is starting to look a little uneven. That Elgar dismissal, meanwhile, was almost surreal. Stokes looked embarrassed that such a bad delivery had taken a wicket. Elgar stood still for ages, trying to work out what the hell he had just done. This is one of the softest dismissals imaginable. Elgar waves his bat at a short, wide delivery from Stokes and loops it straight to Woakes at point. \u201cNo way,\u201d says Mark Nicholas on commentary. \u201cNo way. Of all the men in all the world, Dean Elgar has presented England with his wicket.\u201d 23rd over: South Africa 42-2 (Elgar 26, du Plessis 1) The ball is doing more than enough to keep England\u2019s seamers interested. Sam Curran beats Elgar with a sharp lifter to complete another fine over; he has figures of 5-2-4-1. \u201cOK then,\u201d says Felix Wood. \u201cHere we go. Hameed; Knight; Trott; Hick; Root; Taylor; Buttler; Tudor; Jones; Finn; Panesar.\u201d It\u2019s interesting that a few of you have mentioned Knight. I thought he was a marvellous ODI opener, almost criminally underrated in fact. But though he was a little unlucky to be dropped in 1997, he never felt like a lost Test batsman. 22nd over: South Africa 41-2 (Elgar 26, du Plessis 0) Elgar edges Stokes between third slip and gully for four. He is beaten later in the over, fishing instinctively outside off stump. It feels like another wicket could fall at any moment. \u201cMy humble contribution,\u201d says Romeo. \u201cMilburn, Jones A, Romeo (in batting guise), Smith E (so we could fully appreciate his genius), Donald A, Jesty, Kieswetter, Sainsbury, Chapple (aka HSA), Shepherd, Romeo (in bowling guise).\u201d Chapple is an interesting one. It seemed certain he\u2019d play Test cricket after that incredible series against India A in 1994-95. 21st over: South Africa 37-2 (Elgar 22, du Plessis 0) This has been an excellent bowling performance from England, and South Africa are in a deal of trouble now. Sam Curran replaces Mark Wood, who is hooked despite taking the wicket of Pieter Malan. I think that\u2019s fair enough after a five-over spell, however tempting it must have been to give him one more. And it\u2019s another good decision from Joe Root, because Rassie van der Dussen has gone for a duck! He curtain-railed a good-length delivery from Curran to the right of second slip, where Stokes took a nonchalant and vaguely brilliant two-handed catch. 20th over: South Africa 37-1 (Elgar 22, van der Dussen 0) Woakes off, Stokes on. His second ball to Elgar is too straight and fizzed through midwicket for four; the fifth is steered to third man for another boundary. \u201cThe struggles of Buttler make me really sad,\u201d says Phil Harrison. \u201cPartly because I love watching him and am convinced there\u2019s a Test player in there somewhere. But also because there\u2019s a subset of English cricket supporters who, I suspect, have been looking forward to being proved right about this. But it\u2019s easy to rewrite history - for about the first year he was back in the team, he was superb. One of the biggest single factors in England\u2019s 2018 win over India and very good against SL later that year too. I think it\u2019s probably time for Foakes - I feel like Buttler\u2019s lost confidence in his defensive technique which partly explains that shot earlier. But my overriding feeling is disappointment about what might have been.\u201d Yes, same here. He was extremely good against India in 2018 and decent against Sri Lanka and West Indies the following winter - but on reflection, I think that, even when he was doing so well, he had made an uneasy peace with himself about his Test-match tempo. He then played in the Ashes when mentally shattered, had a few soft dismissals and started to overthink his batting again. 19th over: South Africa 29-1 (Elgar 13, van der Dussen 0) That was a sizzling delivery from Wood to dismiss Malan: 94mph, perfect line and length and with just enough movement to find the edge. Wood is given a fifth over, which is fair enough given how menacing he looked in this fourth. And what a good decision it was! He has picked up the wicket of Pieter Malan, who edged a beautiful delivery through to Buttler. It was very close to a no-ball, but Wood just landed behind the line. Ben Stokes update As expected, he has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee and given one demerit point for yesterday\u2019s contretemps with a South African fan. 18th over: South Africa 28-0 (Elgar 13, Malan 15) Although England would have liked a wicket or two with the new ball, the scoring rate is such that they will feel pretty relaxed. They have bowled pretty well, with excellent discipline, and Woakes (6-3-7-0) has been the pick of the attack. He beats Malan with a fine full-length delivery that straightens past the edge. England went up for caught behind without success. The noise that got them excited was bat on pad. 17th over: South Africa 26-0 (Elgar 12, Malan 14) Malan gets his first boundary, slapping Wood up and over the slips for four. He was hit on the chest by the previous delivery. Wood\u2019s rhythm is much better now, and later in the over Elgar inside-edges a very sharp delivery for four. It brushed the fingertips of Buttler, diving low to his right, but I doubt even Ben Foakes\u2019 No1 fan would call that a chance. \u201cBob,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cNot a bad shout, that XI, but I have a couple of questions. I get why you\u2019ve got Trescothick in there, but he did play (from memory) 76 Tests, scoring a little under 6,000 at a little under 44, so does he really count? As for Hick, he played (off the top of my head) in 65 Tests, scoring 3,383 runs at 31.32, earning him a place in a different side - the What Actually Was XI. Now Tufnell is a different matter. He played 42 times for England (121 wickets at 37.68), but how different that might have been if he\u2019d had a single captain who trusted him. Also, stick SF Barnes in there, and put Graeme Pollock and Barry Richards in your World XI.\u201d Millings, shut your mouth and send me a comedy XI. (Okay, I think Trescothick counts because he missed at least five years of Test cricket, and in a different culture could have been selected just for home Tests; Hick because I wonder what would have happened had he started against, say, New Zealand rather than an affronted Curtly Ambrose.) 16th over: South Africa 17-0 (Elgar 8, Malan 9) Oh my. The ball after being edged for the first boundary of the innings, Woakes beats Elgar with a brutish lifter. Then he does it again to complete a superb over. \u201cAlas,\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201cI fear Moeen for Tufnell in that XI.\u201d Really? I think Moeen has overachieved in his Test career, certainly with the ball. I suppose we\u2019ll never know what would have happened had he not been the designated utliity batsman, though I don\u2019t think he would have averaged more than 32-35. 15th over: South Africa 13-0 (Elgar 4, Malan 9) Wood suddenly jumps wide of the crease to beat Malan with a lovely delivery that straightens sharply off the pitch. It\u2019s another maiden, the seventh of the innings, already. Here\u2019s Richard Firth\u2019s WMHB XI: \u201cKnight, Stewart (because if he had just been left to be an opener, he would have been amazing), Hick, Fairbrother, Crawley, Ramprakash, Buttler, Headley, S.Jones, Bicknell, Tufnell.\u201d Stewart is a good shout \u2013 from memory he scored 2943 runs at 45.98 when he opened the batting and didn\u2019t keep wicket. 14th over: South Africa 13-0 (Elgar 4, Malan 9) \u201cNot to be too maudlin,\u201d says Felix Wood, \u201cbut Ben Hollioake probably deserves a spot in the What Might Have Been XI.\u201d In a one-day team, almost certainly, although I never thought he\u2019d make it in Test cricket. That sounds a bit callous, I realise, but there\u2019s no room for sentiment when you\u2019re picking a hypothetical sentimental XI! 13th over: South Africa 13-0 (Elgar 4, Malan 9) Malan, falling over to the off side, inside-edges Wood behind square for a couple. Nothing else to report. Wood\u2019s pace, since you asked, didn\u2019t appear in that over. It felt like he was in the high 80s. \u201cIf Buttler is dropped for the Sri Lanka Tests, does it mark the swiftest unravelling of a coach\u2019s legacy in history?\u201d asks Gary Naylor. \u201cIt will be, in Tests anyway, as if Trevor Bayliss never happened. Some of us are not entirely displeased with that.\u201d I know what you mean, but wasn\u2019t Bayliss one of Foakes\u2019 biggest fans in the England set up? I do agree that, for whatever reason, the Gerrard/Lampard era of English cricket finally seems to be coming to an end. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed this series immensely, even if Buttler seems destined to join Hameed in my team of what might have been,\u201d says Felix Wood. \u201cPresumably South Africa\u2019s best chance here is to put England\u2019s fragile attack into their fifth spells and then cash in and post 600?\u201d Oh go on then, here\u2019s my What Might Have Been England XI (off the top of my head, since I started watching Test cricket in 1988): Hameed, Trescothick, Lathwell, Hick, Ramprakash, Maynard, Buttler (wk), Headley, S Jones, Finn, Tufnell. 12th over: South Africa 11-0 (Elgar 4, Malan 7) That\u2019s tea. It was a session of two distinct segments. England biffed 100 from 16.2 overs, including a last-wicket partnership of 82 in 8.2 between Mark Wood and Stuart Broad. Then South Africa\u2019s openers calmed everything down by adopting the oldfangled method of leaving as many deliveries as possible. See you in 15 minutes for the evening session. 11th over: South Africa 10-0 (Elgar 4, Malan 6) Mark Wood replaces Stuart Broad, who bowled an adequate spell of 5-2-5-0. His first over looks a little stiff, although the speedgun has him peaking at 91mph. Two singles from it. \u201cThat England scorecard - featuring the lowest highest score in a total of 400+ - might be my favourite since this beauty,\u201d says Tom Bowtell. \u201cEngland scored 304 in the second innings with no fifties and the highest score being Harmison\u2019s 42 at number 11.\u201d Was Harmison\u2019s really the highest score? Morally? But yes, I love scorecards like that. The one burned on my brain is England\u2019s second innings at Trinidad in 1986. Go on, extras lad! 10th over: South Africa 8-0 (Elgar 3, Malan 5) Woakes beats Malan with a fine delivery. He has started well, with a fullish length and a soup\u00e7on of outswing. Jeez I love that word. South Africa are going nowhere at the moment, though I doubt that will bother two openers as temperamentally sound as Elgar and Malan. 9th over: South Africa 8-0 (Elgar 3, Malan 5) Broad continues, in fact, and tempts Elgar into a loose stroke well wide of off stump. The ball whistles past the edge through to Buttler. \u201cI\u2019m an unabashed Foakes Fan,\u201d says Stephen Brown. \u201cIn terms of your point about Ed Smith having the reflected glory of Buttler\u2019s 2018; Jos didn\u2019t have the gloves in most (any?) of those games. Surely selectors might be tempted to regain that glory by taking the gloves off him and giving them to Foakes?\u201d Yes you\u2019re right, he played as a batsman, but I still don\u2019t think it will be an easy decision to leave him out \u2013 especially as the next time Buttler is dropped will probably be the last. Nobody wants to die wondering about his Test career. But my feeling is that, barring a good spell in 2018, he has never quite got his head round how to bat in first-class cricket. 8th over: South Africa 6-0 (Elgar 2, Malan 4) Chris Woakes comes on for Sam Curran, who bowled a good spell of 3-1-3-0 and might switch ends to replace Broad. His first over, to Malan, is a decent range-finder. A maiden. 7th over: South Africa 6-0 (Elgar 2, Malan 4) Malan, tempted into the drive by a fuller delivery from Broad, drags the ball back onto his pads. It\u2019s been a quiet start to the innings - a bit of movement, especially for Curran, but it\u2019s not exactly going off alarming. 6th over: South Africa 5-0 (Elgar 2, Malan 3) The South African openers, Elgar in particular, are playing as little as possible. Curran gives him plenty of opportunity to shoulder arms in that over. 5th over: South Africa 4-0 (Elgar 2, Malan 2) A good over from Broad, who found a better line from round the wicket. His last delivery jagged back to cut Elgar in half; that could easily have found the inside edge and gone back onto the stumps. \u201cMany thanks to Ian Forth for the Georgics (over 65),\u201d says Stuart Middleton. \u201cThe piling of Pelion upon Ossa also appears in The Odyssey (XI.315-16) where the giants Otos and Ephialtes threaten war against the gods \u2018and were minded to pile Ossa on Olympos, and above Ossa/ Pelion of the trembling leaves, to climb the sky.\u2019 (trans. Richmond Lattimore).\u201d 4th over: South Africa 2-0 (Elgar 1, Malan 1) Malan shoulders arms to a ball that jags back to hit him on the thigh pad. It was a very safe leave on length. The movement is encouraging, though, and later in the over Malan digs out a lovely inswinging yorker. With the new ball swinging Curran looks a threat, and if Broad has one more poor over I would replace him with Woakes. 3rd over: South Africa 2-0 (Elgar 1, Malan 1) Another maiden from Broad, with Elgar able to leave almost everything. He hasn\u2019t started brilliantly. \u201cRegarding Ben Foakes and The Ongoing Argument, I guess that if your keeper is only going to score 20 runs, whoever you pick, you might as well pick the best keeper,\u201d says David Horn. \u201cI think whoever gets the gloves in Sri Lanka will be quite revealing of Ed Smith\u2019s flexibility of thought, as much as anything else.\u201d I think it should be Foakes, but I suspect Buttler will be given one more series. Ed Smith enjoyed the reflected glory of Buttler\u2019s success in 2018, so it won\u2019t be easy to leave him out. 2nd over: South Africa 2-0 (Elgar 1, Malan 1) Curran\u2019s first ball, wide of Malan\u2019s off stump, curves encouragingly through to the keeper. His fifth is even better, zipping slightly the other way to beat Malan\u2019s crooked defensive grope. That\u2019s an excellent start. \u201cHelllo,\u201d writes Vigasini Senthil. \u201cI absolutely love following Guardian for live cricket matches. I started watching cricket from last May (starting with the World Cup) and was hooked. Being a typical Indian cricket fan, I don\u2019t know how I switched lanes to England. During the finals, I spent half of the matches at my prayer room. I still vividly remember myself saying to God about how I would stop watching cricket if England didn\u2019t win the World Cup. (I still can\u2019t believe I did this). When they did win, I was way more than happy and a tiny bit emotional too. Now I never miss any T20s, ODIs or Tests. Getting to watch England play (let alone win) makes me so, so happy. Seems like I came at the right time. I\u2019m 15 years old btw.\u201d If this isn\u2019t the sweetest email we\u2019ll receive all year, I don\u2019t know what is. 1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Elgar 0, Malan 0) Stuart Broad will open the bowling, on the ground where he demolished South Africa to win the 2015-16 series. He starts with a quiet over to Elgar, a maiden. It looks like Sam Curran will share the new ball. It\u2019ll be interesting to see who takes the new ball for England. I\u2019d go with Woakes and Broad, since you didn\u2019t ask, although it\u2019s also tempting to give it to Mark Wood while he\u2019s still high on his own batting. Let\u2019s look at those two innings in all their statistical glory: Wood 35*, 39 balls, 2x4, 3x6 Broad 43, 28 balls, 2x4, 4x6 Nothing will ever make up for the pain of Dave Richardson and Paul Adams\u2019 10th-wicket partnership at Cape Town in 1996, but that still felt pretty good. It has probably finished South Africa off in the series. There have been 15,330 partnerships of fifty or more in Test cricket. At 9.82 runs per over, that was the 11th fastest. Broad holes out to deep square leg to end a riotous tenth-wicket partnership of 82 in just 8.2 overs. 98th over: England 396-9 (Wood 35, Broad 39) Thanks Tanya, hello everyone. The fun continues after the drinks break, with Hendricks disappearing for another 19! Broad pulled his fourth six over midwicket, Wood lashed his second over extra cover. South Africa\u2019s bowling in the last half hour has been execrable at best. 97th over: England 377-9 (Broad 31, Wood 28) Paterson, stocky, with a Maradona-Aguero-esque low centre of gravity, trundles in and England\u2019s flair boys only manage a couple. That\u2019s drinks, and time for me to hand over to Rob Smyth. Thanks for all the messages this morning, ta-rah! 96th over: England 374-9 (Broad 29, Wood 27) Hendricks finds some control, but they still knock three singles and a wide from the over. You can feel the frustration oozing out of every South African bowler. Broad can\u2019t bat. But yet here he is. Some wise thoughts from Nat Godden: \u201cIt may be hard to precisely measure the Boycott boredom factor (though he was widely regarded as peerless in that area), but those of us with long memories might wonder how these two compare in respect of batting partners run out (for which Sir G was also rather well-known). The figures must be there somewhere. I\u2019d bring that to the equation. \u201cBroad and Wood, what a warming partnership, please keep brightening our (London, grey, gloomy) day!\u201d 95th over: England 370-9 (Broad 27, Wood 26) With legs miles away from bat, Broad thwacks the off-cutter straight back off Paterson\u2019s head for six and that\u2019s the fifty partnership off 27 balls. It\u2019s Bambi on steroids. 94th over: England 361-9 (Broad 20, Wood 25) Faf spares Nortje\u2019s figures, but spoils Hendricks\u2019. Four, Four, Six as Wood goes big and bootiful over third man, straight and square leg. I think this might be a job for Philander. The partnership is 44 off 24 balls! 93rd over: England 347-9 (Broad 14, Wood 10) Well, fancy that. Broad dispatches Paterson for two sixes. Arms and legs slightly wild, but over the ball goes, this way and that. Thanks very much and Faf looks cross. On the telly, they\u2019re blaming the altitude. 92nd over: England 333-9 (Broad 6, Wood 10) . From nowhere, Broad rediscovers his mojo, purring through the covers off the back foot for four. Off Nortje. Nortje! Thank you, Chris Howell, \u201cAlmost certainly the \u2018batsman\u2019 with the worst conversion of fifties to hundreds will be a bowler who could bat a bit, played a load of matches, but never made a hundred. Without looking, it\u2019s probably someone like Warne. Amongst batsmen, the one who comes to mind for this is former NZ captain Stephen Fleming, who made 9 centuries and 46 fifties in 111 tests, averaging just over 40.\u201d 91st over: England 328-9 (Broad 1, Wood 10) Wood takes one look at his teammate quivering in the face of Paterson and slog-swings the ball for six. Axe chop. 90th over: England 318-9 (Broad 0, Wood 1) Rapid stuff from Nortje, including one that surprises Woakes, rearing up from near his toes and ricocheting from glove to leg, before the 91mph wicket-taking ball. Nortje has a broad smile as he is mobbed by his teammates and wanders off to the boundary, floppy hat on head. A superb catch by du Plessis falling with both hands to his right at second slip and grasping on. Woakes prodded at one that jumped. And just rewards for Nortje, South Africa\u2019s bowler of the series. 89th over: England 315-8 (Woakes 30, Wood 1) Wood somehow survives a beauty from Philander. Back to Lord\u2019s and that MCC pass fraud: 88th over: England 316-8 (Woakes 30, Wood 1) Woakes gets to play the Buttler role, but with less pressure. Which is silly really - why does being a bowler let you off the hook more than being the wicketkeeper? At least the bowler gets a rest. Woakes clips Nortje off his pads for four; Wood evades a bounce by crouching low, rabbit style Brian Poole has the numbers: \u201cRoot is closing in on Boycott\u2019s total Test runs but: Boycott 22 hundreds 42 fifties Root 17 hundreds 46 fifties Maybe Root should keep in mind what the score would like if two wickets fell quickly (as can always happen) a la Boycott?\u201d I would argue that Root has brought more pleasure. But what price joy? 87th over: England 310-8 (Woakes 25, Wood 0) Ooof, by inches, the ball flies short of Faf at second slip off the bat off Wood. 85th over: England 309-8 (Woakes 24, Wood 0) It doesn\u2019t give me any pleasure to write this but in six innings this series, Buttler has not passed 30. However the man many mention in dispatches, Ben Foakes, didn\u2019t have a great season for Surrey last summer - averaging 26. Nortje bowls a rapid maiden. 84th over: England 309-8 (Woakes 24, Wood 0) Reward for Philander in his last Test; not the shot that will give Buttler back his batting bounce. Pressure, what pressure? Buttler has a wretched hoik and Elgar catches him in the covers, one that billows high into the air and lands over his shoulder. 83rd over: England 307-7 (Woakes 24, Buttler 18) Nortje is hauled back into the attack after his mammoth effort this mornin. Faf using him, as Root has used Archer. The burden of being the best. Five dots then a wristy ruffle to the boundary by Woakes . 82nd over: England 300-7 (Woakes 20, Buttler 18) Philander with the still-new ball, England nurdle three from it. David Hindle is feeling schoolmasterly: \u201cNasser Hussain getting to grips with Root. Changing the way he plays after he reaches 50. Show him a video of before and after, from all his failures to convert. Sounds good. For me, Root\u2019s problem is that he thinks he\u2019s better than he actually is. If he could rein it in appropriately, like all the other batsmen in the world who get the hundreds and average over 50, who knows what might happen?\u201d I\u2019m not sure he thinks he\u2019s better than he is. Does he? I feel like it\u2019s more of a mental tick, that he\u2019ll get over. I don\u2019t know which batsman in history converted fewest fifties to hundreds proportionately, but he must still have a pretty good average. Is a hundred worth double a fifty or, because of its significance, more than that? So many emails! Apologies in advance if I don\u2019t get round to yours. \u201cThanks for the mention,\u201d writes Daniel Forman (over 62). \u201c I should dedicate it to the late Ian Ackland Snow who was one of my companions that day and whose birthday it would have been this week had he not passed away tragically early last year. Ian was a late convert to cricket who got more into the game because his son Ben became obsessed around 2005. He got himself to a decent village standard so that they could spend more quality time playing together. I always find the way it allows parents and kids to play on the same side one of the great and under appreciated pleasures of recreational cricket. Anyway, rest in peace Ackers and happy birthday.\u201d That\u2019s lovely. Here\u2019s to you Ackers. Woakes and Buttler stroll back out. Will it be 320 all out or a lofty 450? Philander has the ball. The first hour belonged to the glorious batting off Pope and Root, the second hour to the persistence of Nortje. The next hour could decide the Test. Time for a quick stretch before anyone else piles Pelion upon Ossa. See you soon. 81st over: England 300-7 (Woakes 19, Buttler 16) Hendricks has the last over before lunch. Woakes goes to cover drive but gets an outside edge and the new ball flies to the backward point boundary. And another one, Buttler this time, who gets an edge that flies a broadsheet wide of second slip. In its short life, the new ball has proved expensive for South Africa. And that is lunch. 81st over: England 291-7 (Woakes 14, Buttler 12) After three deliveries with the old ball, Pretorius takes the new ball, and immediately Woakes shuffle pulls him through mid-wicket for four. 80th over: England 283-7 (Woakes 7, Buttler 11) England playing for lunch, scuffle a couple from Hendricks. \u201cAlways eat fruit when blagging your way in to somewhere you\u2019re not supposed to be, \u201cwrites Mark Hooper. \u201cSecurity always wave through people eating fruit.\u201d Pretending you have issues with a contact lens works quite well too. 79th over: England 281-7 (Woakes 6, Buttler 10) Buttle watchful, Pretorius accurate. Who will break first? A maiden. 78th over: England 281-7 (Woakes 6, Buttler 10) With the second new ball just two overs away, Nortje gets a (brief?) rest. Faf summons Hendricks, and Woakes dispatches a half-volley through mid-off for four. \u201cNo disrespect to Sam Curran, writes Matthew Doherty, but how comes he comes in before Woakes?\u201d Good question, though they both have their moments. Style before substance? 77th over: England 275-7 (Woakes 1, Buttler 9) Buttler eyes up Pretorius and with stout thigh urges the ball down to long-leg for four. 76th over: England 271-7 (Woakes 1, Buttler 5) The hat-trick ball passes without incident as Woakes ignores it. What tactics now I wonder? Robert Lewis has the purple swagger of a SW19 blag, \u201cI used to blag my way into the Wimbledon tennis players bar when I sold ice creams at the championships. Easier in those days, almost no security. I\u2019d like to say that I was hoping to meet Anna Kournikova. but Im afraid to say it was a bit longer ago, and so it was Sue Barker.\u201d 75th over: England 269-7 (Woakes 0, Buttler 4) Buttler survies a Pretorius maiden. Phil Russel writes: If the gods were piling up the mountains to get to heaven then maybe it wasn\u2019t because they were making things harder for themselves but because they like a challenge? Trying to think of the cricket equivalent - guess it is Ben Stokes batting left-handed because it is too easy for him otherwise. Maybe England throwing in a cheeky collapse from what looks likes an impregnable position? 74th over: England 269-7 (Woakes 0, Buttler 4) Nortje stranded on that hat-trick ball actually till the next over. He now has career-best figures of 4-91 - on the hunt for his first Test five-fer. England have suffered a mini-moment, something Jos Buttler is wearily familiar with. Curran flashes at his first ball outside off stump and de Kock snaffles it. Thanks very much. And Nortje is on a hat-trick! Root drives at one close to his stumps, and this time Nortje, into his seventh over on the trot, gets his man, neatly caught by de Kock. A delighted bowler and a relieved du Plessis join a happy huddle. 73rd over: England 265-5 (Root 55, Buttler 4) Just one off Pretorius as England take a breather. 72nd over: England 264-5 (Root 54, Buttler 4) Oh gosh. Head in hands emjoi. Nortje steams in, Root drives with an open face and the ball flies towards Faf du Plessis at a kind of second/third slip, but the ball slips into his grasp and, somehow, imperceptibly, slips out again. Much wringing of hands. Morning Tanya, writes David Horn. \u201cAs sad as I am to not be able to witness another Pope century, I\u2019ve got high hopes for Buttler this innings. It felt that in the last test, it was too perfectly set up for him. Runs on the board, license to attack, play your natural game, etc. I always think he\u2019s better - in test matches - when he has to think a bit more. Here, he\u2019s got runs on the board - but not so many as we\u2019re out of sight - he has to support his captain, play himself in, and just think a little bit more. I think we\u2019ll see a classic Buttler innings today. (I\u2019m crossing things to prevent mockers, obvs, but y\u2019know, we\u2019re not a superstitious bunch - we\u2019ll be fine).\u201d I\u2019m absolving myself from all blame for this one David. This one is yours. 71st over: England 263-5 (Root 53, Buttler 4) Buttler faces three balls from Pretorius. Leaves a couple and shoulders arms to another. It\u2019s making me nervous. C\u2019mon Jos. A rugby blag to join the collection. 70th over: England 262-5 (Root 52, Buttler 4)What a shame for Ollie Pope, he played like a dream. Buttler gets off the mark by creaming Nortje through the covers. The King is dead, long live the king! On the sofa next to me, my son has stolen my phone and is creating my personal emoji. \u201c A big nose and facial hair.\u201d Neville Cardus never had to deal with this. No! The very first ball after drinks is a cracker and Pope dithers, managing only to get an edge onto his stumps which explode in relief. 69th over: England 258-4 (Root 52, Pope 56) Just one run to Pope off Pretorius, thank god of small mercies. Drinks? It must be drinks. England going at an easy just-over-4.5 an over in the first hour. 68th over: England 257-4 (Root 52, Pope 54) I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t see a ball of the over, I was too busy reading your emails. Ok, a last word on Pelion upon Ossa - it seems Virgil was quoting Homer - over to you John Starbuck. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a classical education to work out this one, just access to Brewer\u2019s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, which states: \u201c\u2018Heaping (or piling) Pelion upon Ossa is taken from Homer\u2019s Odyssey, meaning adding difficulty to difficulty, or embarrassment to embarrassment .... When the giants tried to scale Olympus (Heaven) they placed Mount Pelion upon Mount Ossa, two peaks in Thessaly, for a scaling ladder.\u2019\u201d 67th over: England 254-4 (Root 51, Pope 53) A tap to mid-on and Root raises his bat after a charming fifty; master and apprentice slap gloves in the middle. South Africa rue four leg byes. England laidback and on top. 66th over: England 247-4 (Root 49, Pope 52) Joe Root steals from the Ollie Pope playbook, leans back and ramps Nortje down to third man for four. And that\u2019s after pulling him earlier in the over for another boundary. Leaks springing up all over HMS South Africa. 65th over: England 237-4 (Root 40, Pope 51) Paterson is toothless, Root slides him through backward point for four. Ossa on Pellion part XI: All yours OBOers. Ian Forth: Shakespeare though is quoting Virgil in the Georgics:-\u201cImponere Pelio Ossam Scilicet, atque Ossae frondosum involvere Olympum.\u201d Which translates as\u201cIn sooth...to pile Ossa on Pelion and roll leaf-crowned Olympus on Ossa.\u201d 64th over: England 232-4 (Root 35, Pope 51) A change of tactics from South Africa, who fancy they can bounce England out - a fly slip comes in and sure enough Nortje boom-bounces Pope first ball, which he whips away. And then, the most dreamy pull, if you can imagine such a thing, all soft angles, down to the boundary to bring up his fifty. Gorgeous. Root then top-edges but the ball falls safely. 63rd over: England 223-4 (Root 33, Pope 45) A double change as Paterson replaces Hendricks and it\u2019s a maiden. To all those who\u2019ve pointed out that Pelion upon Ossa comes from Hamlet, thank you! 62nd over: England 223-4 (Root 33, Pope 45) Nortje replaces Philander and metaphorically rolls up his sleeves. He sends down a swift one third ball, and Pope does well to avoid edging it. But, this boy laughs in the face of snorters, and next ball pings Nortje through the onside for four. More blagging rights! 61st over: England 216-4 (Root 31, Pope 40) Pope outscoring his captain this morning, though not without the odd small hiccup. He cracks Hendricks to third man, where Paterson fails to spot the ball and it goes through for four. 60th over: England 208-4 (Root 28, Pope 35) Philander solidly reliable this morning, on a length, thundering in. A maiden. David Gaskell emails in. \u201cSeneca said \u201c Anger is brief insanity\u201d. Or maybe it was Minnie Caldwell in the snug at the Rovers Return.\u201d I feel a bit out of my depth with this Corrie talk. It never graced my TV growing up - it was all Dynasty/The Colbys. Cristal didn\u2019t talk cricket much, though I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have had a soft spot for England\u2019s Blake Carrington, David Gower. 59th over: England 208-4 (Root 28, Pope 35) Another moment of Pope gorgeousness as he shapes his bat at an angle to please geometrists and sends Hendricks\u2019 ball skimming back down to the point boundary. A slight hiccup between the wickets but Pope beats Bavuma\u2019s thrown home. 58th over: England 202-4 (Root 27, Pope 30) Philander fining a good line this morning, nipping the ball in to Pope, who scrambles a couple off his pads, and that\u2019s the England 200. Some chaps off pitch relax in a hot tub. It looks a bit of a squeeze. I once read a report about faecal matter in jacuzzis and hot tubs and it put me off for life. 57th over: England 199-4 (Root 27, Pope 27) A snorting lifter from Hendricks, that Root rocks back and avoids gracefully. A maiden. \u201cMorning Tanya! \u201cMorning Daniel Silverstone! \u201cLooking forward to an interesting day\u2019s play. \u201cJust wanted to chip in regarding Nasser\u2019s defence of Stokes and Nick Hoult\u2019s tweet about England staff being abused yesterday... it\u2019s not acceptable behaviour, no, but I hope we\u2019re not kidding ourselves that it doesn\u2019t happen here in England too... \u201cI was sat this summer on the upper deck at Old Trafford for the Ashes test, and some of the so-called banter shouted across to the Aussie balcony to their coaching staff and players was totally out of order and over the top. It\u2019s probably something that needs addressing all over the place...\u201d 56th over: England 199-4 (Root 27, Pope 27) Ollie Pope leans backwards as if he\u2019s going to take the scythe to the long grass and cuts Philander through gully for four. The ball skips away over the green outfield. From rainy Venice, Nicholas writes, \u201cPiling Pelion upon Ossa? I remember Howard Hodgkin saying the same thing about his art to Susan Sontag, which prompted me to try and locate paints with these names in order to improve my work. Serves me right for not paying more attention during my 4 years of Greek at school!\u201d But what a lovely fruitless search! There\u2019s a gem of a play right there. 55th over: England 195-4 (Root 27, Pope 23) Hendricks finishes off his over from yesterday. Root\u2019s feet get in a bit of tangle early on, but a couple come from a laid-back cut over point. Adam Collins isn\u2019t the only blagger on the OBO, \u201cHi Tanya,\u201d writes Zaph Mann, \u201cI\u2019m still stranded in The Empire of The Senseless (Mekons) but seeing Adam Collin\u2019s comment brought to mind my only time I ever saw England live - The Oval - Gower times - after the morning session, watching how people came and went I hung about the members stand and wedged myself between two portly members and engaged in conversation - sure enough I floated in with them - -I then had to adopt the strut of a lawyer (Mark E. Smith) and went up to the top tier and persuaded a camera man to let me look through the -then incredible-zoom lens at Gower. Heaven. Now it\u2019s all vicarious.\u201d And the players are out in the middle... From somewhere not in front of the television, Dave Summerfield taps away, \u201cI\u2019m not watching Sky at the moment. If I were, it sounds I\u2019d be taking issue with Nasser. I know he likes defending Rabada, but surely the in-your-face celebration is the kind of inflammatory act that feeds aggressive spectator behaviour ? I guess Nasser is saying that cricketers are human and that you can\u2019t expect them to hide their emotions. Stokes was provoked. Root only provoked by refusing to be out (up to that point).\u201d To be fair, I don\u2019t think was particularly defending Rabada, just saying he shouldn\u2019t have been punished so harshly . He was almost more exercised by football fans screaming abuse at Raheem Sterling - and he wasn\u2019t talking racist abuse - just the general abuse that people seem to feel is a right when they buy a ticket. He\u2019s right, the combination of a sports ticket and alcohol seems to make people behave in a way they would never consider otherwise. Play due to start at 845 GMT Session 1: 8:45-10:45 Session 2: 11:25-1:40 Session 3: 2:00-4:00 From Nairobi, Tim writes: Full disclosure right off the top-- I\u2019m originally from the US and only started watching cricket about 6 months ago towards the end of the group stage of the World Cup. My girlfriend went back to Canada for all of July and day after day of World Cup Cricket was pefect to fill the void... By the end of the Super Over I was hooked and watching the Ashes just cemented cricket as my 3rd favorite sport (behind the real football and ice hockey). What a time to start following English Cricket eh? I now watch every Test/ODI/T20 I can fit in to my schedule-- the honeymoon phase is lovely isn\u2019t it? All of that preface is to say I likely have no idea what I\u2019m talking about but figured I\u2019d chime in. This seems like the perfect time for a young guy like Pope to really make a name for himself and solidify his place in the squad. A century in your last innings to take control of the Test and now a chance for a big partnership here with the captain to stabilize the ship and possibly seal the series for England...that to me seems like it could have perennial member of the squad written all over it. Too right Tim. And hope you\u2019re ok, difficult times for Kenya at the moment - plagues of locusts of biblical proportions. My old mucker Adam Collins is incredulous about the tale of the little red book fraud... Jail for that? In 2009, I blagged into the Lord\u2019s members. It was the second day of the Ashes Test and I had a suit on. At lunch, the Queen was being presented to the players so the stewards were distracted. Walking in like we were meant to be there, it turned into quite the afternoon on the tonk when we up in one of the dining rooms by the tea interval, tucking into wine we didn\u2019t pay for. Lock me up! Lock me up! Naughty Adam. But jail does seem a little harsh...perhaps the judge is still on the waiting list. Three left-handed openers (Knight, Cook, Burns) chew the fat. Cook points out that because there wasn\u2019t social media and instant judgement when he first started in Test cricket, \u201cI had a year\u2019s grace while people tried to work me out, then I struggled, then I really understood my game.\u201d \u201cHi Tanya,\u201d writes Ian Forth. Morning Ian! \u201cI wonder which \u2018classic mountain\u2019 Sir Alastair Cook had in mind. Table Mountain, I suspect. When I was young I used to watch Coronation Street with my mum. One night Ken Barlow, supping his pint in the Rover\u2019s Return, commented on a character facing a sequence of difficulties that fate was \u201cpiling Pelion upon Ossa\u201d. Annie Walker, the landlady, smiled approvingly and they exchanged knowing looks. I don\u2019t want to come over all Boris Johnson, but it is hard to imagine such a phrase getting past the script editor today.\u201d Ian, I\u2019ll run that past Vic Marks who did classics at University... A passionate defence of Stokes and Rabada by Nasser on Sky who puzzles over why people turn up at football and cricket match to scream abuse at the pros: \u201cWhy would you pay good money to abuse someone you admire?Why would you abuse someone doing something you can only dream of doing?\u201d A little diversion - who knew that you could buy a fake MCC membership card off Ebay? (a link to the original Bournemouth Echo story.) So please send me your Saturday morning ponderings over a coffee, or perhaps before a parkrun. Apparently Ben Stokes had a meeting with the match referee this morning , but no news yet. Sir Alastair Cook calls it, \u201ca classic mountain out of a molehill.\u201d This is pretty depressing ...ah, we\u2019re on at The Wanderers - it is overcast and has been raining, but isn\u2019t any more. The covers have been taken off and there will be an inspection at 8am - the pitch is a bit damp where it has sweated under the covers. Best guess is a 9am GMT start. In the studio, Rory Burns is in the hot seat with SirAlastair. Poor Rory is being asked how well the openers are batting, then has to listen to Atherton waxing lyrical about Crawley and Sibley: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an England opening pair looking so good here.\u201d I\u2019ve stumbled downstairs to find the television has already been taken over by Sydney Sixers v Melbourne Renegades. While we wait for news from Jo\u2019burg, a bit of reading. This was the interview with Kevin Pietersen where he said England needed to treat Jofra Archer better, here is Vic on yesterday\u2019s play and here is the Stokes mea culpa. Good morning Johannesburg, Ed Sheeran and anyone else in the frame for some Saturday morning cricket. By the time you read this, Ben Stokes will have spent a long night of the soul chewing over his \u201cfoul-mouthed altercation\u201d with the mouthy glasses wearing fan he invited outside, after having a thrash at Nortje and being caught for two. Thoughtfully, Sky replayed the incident for the benefit of their viewers, so the match referee will have had plenty of time for a good look - and the look isn\u2019t great if we\u2019re honest. How big Stokes\u2019 punishment, will be down to the whim of the ref - for reference, Kagiso Rabada got a demerit for his too-close-for-comfort celebration after dismissing Root at Port Elizabeth, and Jos Buttler was handed a demerit and fined 15 per cent of his match fee for chucking some abuse at Vernon Philander at Cape Town. Aside from that, England finished the day in jaunty enough spirits after a wonderful opening partnership - of 100+ for the first time in a first-innings for over a decade - between Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley, followed by a small but perfectly formed collapse, followed by Root and Pope handing out cocoa-dusted chocolate truffles to finish a rain and light-affected day. South Africa\u2019s bowlers were cock-eyed after losing the toss until after tea, when line and length regrouped. And it all starts again at 8am. See you then.",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has called an emergency government meeting, telling officials the country is facing a \u201cgrave situation\u201d as the new coronavirus is \u201caccelerating its spread\u201d. More than 50 million people are spending China\u2019s most important holiday under lockdown as the country expands its travel restrictions in an attempt to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. Officials confirmed on Sunday that the death toll from the viral outbreak had reached 54 and that well in excess of 1,200 further people had been affected. A doctor treating people infected with the virus was among those who died. Liang Wudong, 62, died on Saturday morning, state media said, and it was also reported by the Chinese Global Times website that another doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan died of a heart attack later in the day. In Beijing, five new cases have been confirmed, according to Chinese National Radio, including two patients who had not recently travelled to Hubei, the centre of the outbreak. In all previous cases in the capital, patients had reportedly visited the province. The virus is now confirmed to have reached Australia and Malaysia, while France confirmed on Friday that three people there had the virus. Both France and the US plan to evacuate citizens trapped in Wuhan, the Hubei city where the outbreak began. The Foreign Office advised late on Saturday against all travel to Hubei province because of the outbreak, adding: \u201cIf you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so.\u201d Hong Kong, which has confirmed five cases of the illness, declared the outbreak an emergency on Saturday, and said it would keep primary and secondary schools closed for two more weeks after the holiday. A growing number of airports around the world have introduced screening to identify those affected, although the effectiveness of such measures has been questioned. An article published in the Lancet, based on a family that had recently visited Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, suggested it was possible to have the disease while not experiencing any symptoms. Across China, the lunar new year holiday has been overshadowed by travel blocks imposed on at least 17 cities, and the cancellation of major festive events. In an effort to stop the disease from spreading further, part of the Great Wall was closed, and Beijing\u2019s temple fairs, a new year tradition, have been cancelled. Shanghai Disneyland also announced it would close indefinitely. It is feared the lunar new year, when hundreds of millions of people go on holiday or to visit relatives, could fuel the spread of the virus across China and abroad. So far, 29 provinces and cities in China have been affected, and further cases had been reported in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Macao, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The US reported its second case. In Wuhan, restrictions were tightened on Saturday, with officials banning most vehicles from the roads. Train stations, airports and railway stations had all been shut since the lockdown began on Thursday morning. The city was facing shortages of beds, testing kits and other supplies, and 450 military medical staff arrived late on Friday to help treat patients, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The ministry of commerce was overseeing an operation to supply more than 2m masks and other products from elsewhere in the country, Xinhua said. Footage on social media, apparently taken inside the city\u2019s hospitals, appeared to show staff breaking down and long queues of residents waiting to be assessed. Patients told the Guardian that people had been turned away by hospitals and that their relatives had been unable to get a test to find out if they had the virus. It was announced on Saturday that a second hospital was to be built to treat coronavirus patients. Work has already begun to build a 1,000-bed hospital in 10 days.

      "body": "<p>Dr Rachel Clarke worked as a television documentary-maker before deciding \u2013 as a GP\u2019s daughter, this was always on the cards \u2013 to study medicine. She now specialises in palliative care, partly because it is centred on the patient rather than on any disease. It is impossible to overstate the qualities that make Clarke a first-rate doctor: sympathetic intelligence, kindness, a sense of humour. And she is one of those crucial people who will not settle for second best.</p> <p>She champions her patients and turns a critical eye on the politicians failing the NHS. A regular <a href=\"https://twitter.com/doctor_oxford?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">hell-raiser on Twitter</a>, she works at Katharine House, a hospice in Oxfordshire. Her first bestselling book, <em>Your Life in My Hands</em>, was about junior doctors (she got involved in the government dispute). Her new memoir, <em>Dear Life</em>, is about how the end of life can be best approached. It is an important, moving and unexpectedly uplifting book and doubles as a farewell to her father, whose death from cancer, in 2017, brought her professional life into new focus.</p> <p><strong>Has working at a hospice changed your attitude to dying?</strong><br>Working close to death has shaped my relationship with life. We all know we are a spark, a little flash in the pan and will be obliterated before we know it. We know that, we ignore it, we live our life in spite of it. We squander this incredibly precious commodity \u2013 the time slipping through our fingers \u2013 from the moment we are born. The most powerful thing I come away from the hospice with every single day is the realisation that every moment matters. Genuinely, I couldn\u2019t give a damn about wrinkles or middle age or putting on weight or my first grey hairs or reading specs \u2013 these are reasons to celebrate. I am so lucky I have them.</p> <p><strong>Your father, a </strong><strong>GP, inspired you \u2013 what was memorable about him?</strong><br>I always had that feeling of him as a colossus I could turn to, no matter what the problem.

      "bodyText": "Dr Rachel Clarke worked as a television documentary-maker before deciding \u2013 as a GP\u2019s daughter, this was always on the cards \u2013 to study medicine. She now specialises in palliative care, partly because it is centred on the patient rather than on any disease. It is impossible to overstate the qualities that make Clarke a first-rate doctor: sympathetic intelligence, kindness, a sense of humour. And she is one of those crucial people who will not settle for second best. She champions her patients and turns a critical eye on the politicians failing the NHS. A regular hell-raiser on Twitter, she works at Katharine House, a hospice in Oxfordshire. Her first bestselling book, Your Life in My Hands, was about junior doctors (she got involved in the government dispute). Her new memoir, Dear Life, is about how the end of life can be best approached. It is an important, moving and unexpectedly uplifting book and doubles as a farewell to her father, whose death from cancer, in 2017, brought her professional life into new focus. Has working at a hospice changed your attitude to dying? Working close to death has shaped my relationship with life. We all know we are a spark, a little flash in the pan and will be obliterated before we know it. We know that, we ignore it, we live our life in spite of it. We squander this incredibly precious commodity \u2013 the time slipping through our fingers \u2013 from the moment we are born. The most powerful thing I come away from the hospice with every single day is the realisation that every moment matters. Genuinely, I couldn\u2019t give a damn about wrinkles or middle age or putting on weight or my first grey hairs or reading specs \u2013 these are reasons to celebrate. I am so lucky I have them. Your father, a GP, inspired you \u2013 what was memorable about him? I always had that feeling of him as a colossus I could turn to, no matter what the problem. When he was four or five weeks away from death and very frail, he saw how filthy my car windscreen was when I\u2019d driven to see him and \u2013 apologies because it might make me cry \u2013 all of a sudden, our roles flipped. I\u2019d been caring for him.

      "body": "<p>Way back in May 2011, Eric Schmidt, who was then the executive chairman of Google, said that the rapid development of facial recognition technology had been one of the things that had surprised him most in a long career as a computer scientist. But its \u201csurprising accuracy\u201d was \u201cvery concerning\u201d. Questioned about this, he said that a database using facial recognition technology was unlikely to be a service that the company would create, but went on to say that \u201csome company \u2026 is going to cross that line\u201d.</p> <p>As it happens, Dr Schmidt was being economical with the <em>actualit\u00e9</em>, as the MP Alan Clark used to say. He must surely have known that a few months earlier Facebook had announced that it was using facial recognition in the US to suggest names while tagging photos. And some time after Schmidt spoke, Google itself launched a facial recognition feature in its own ill-fated social network, Google+. It was called Find My Face and it scanned photos from users and their friends to identify recognisable faces. Four years later, as the tech analyst Ben Thompson points out, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud released face-recognition APIs, followed by Amazon Web Services with its Rekognition service in 2016. So it turns out that lots of companies \u2013 including Schmidt\u2019s own \u2013 had crossed the facial recognition red line.</p> <p>All of which makes one wonder why there was such a fuss the other week when the <em>New York Times</em> published a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html\" title=\"\">big expos\u00e9</a> of Clearview AI, a tiny company based in New York. \u201cThe secretive company that might end privacy as we know it\u201d, read the breathless headline over the story about a start-up that helps law-enforcement authorities to match photos of unknown people to their online images. Was it because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/google-peter-thiel-yellow-peril-racism-tech\" title=\"\">Peter Thiel</a> \u2013 the creepy billionaire geek from central casting \u2013 had been an early investor? Or because Hoan Ton-That, the ingenious co-founder of Clearview, had once, like Thiel, been traduced by Gawker? Or because the other co-founder was a guy who used to work for Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer? Or was it simply because the article revealed to an astonished \u2013 and hopefully alarmed \u2013 lay public the extent of the capabilities of facial recognition technology? After all, what it suggests is that if you have ever had your photograph published online then the cops (and presumably any other Clearview client) can find and identify you.</p> <p>For me, the most noteworthy thing about Clearview AI is that it\u2019s such a small outfit. Essentially, Ton-That created it by hiring two hackers. One was charged with building software for \u201cscraping\u201d images from online sources. (This sounds painful, but really it\u2019s just automated browsing and data-extraction: there are dozens of tools for doing this available online.) The software then scraped several billion images from across the web \u2013 from employment sites, news sites, educational sites and social networks including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram. The other programmer was charged with creating a facial recognition algorithm, which they probably did by building on software published in academic papers. The result was a system that was simplicity itself to use \u2013 upload a photo and in many cases you get a name.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/facerec-zip/giv-3902ACVhTqLxB5j4/\" data-alt=\"How facial recognition works\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/facerec-zip/giv-3902ACVhTqLxB5j4/\">How facial recognition works</a> </figure>  <p>Clearview began by marketing the system to law-enforcement authorities. According to the <em>NYT</em> report, many of their 600 customers love it. In February 2019, the Indiana state police solved a case within 20 minutes of using the system. There was a fight in a park that ended with one man shooting another in the stomach. A bystander recorded the crime on a phone, so the police had a still of the gunman\u2019s face to run through Clearview\u2019s app. They immediately got a match: the man had appeared in a video on social media, and his name was included in a caption on the video. Bingo!</p> <p>You can see why this stuff is catnip for cops. So why has it taken so long to surface? One reason might be that all social media sites have rules that prohibit scraping. So maybe entrepreneurs were put off by that. Clearview wasn\u2019t, perhaps because it had a lawyer who knew about the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-linkedin-profiles/microsofts-linkedin-loses-appeal-over-access-to-user-profiles-idUSKCN1VU21W\" title=\"\">recent case</a> in which LinkedIn tried and failed to block and sue scrapers. The judge said that not only could it not sue, but also that it\u2019s not even allowed to try to block scraping by any technical means.</p> <p>Ultimately, the lesson of Clearview is that when a digital technology is developed, it rapidly becomes commodified. Once upon a time, this stuff was the province of big corporations. Now it can be exploited by small fry. And on a shoestring budget. One of the co-founders paid for server costs and basic expenses. Mr Ton-That lived on credit-card debt.

      "bodyText": "Way back in May 2011, Eric Schmidt, who was then the executive chairman of Google, said that the rapid development of facial recognition technology had been one of the things that had surprised him most in a long career as a computer scientist. But its \u201csurprising accuracy\u201d was \u201cvery concerning\u201d. Questioned about this, he said that a database using facial recognition technology was unlikely to be a service that the company would create, but went on to say that \u201csome company \u2026 is going to cross that line\u201d. As it happens, Dr Schmidt was being economical with the actualit\u00e9, as the MP Alan Clark used to say. He must surely have known that a few months earlier Facebook had announced that it was using facial recognition in the US to suggest names while tagging photos. And some time after Schmidt spoke, Google itself launched a facial recognition feature in its own ill-fated social network, Google+. It was called Find My Face and it scanned photos from users and their friends to identify recognisable faces. Four years later, as the tech analyst Ben Thompson points out, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud released face-recognition APIs, followed by Amazon Web Services with its Rekognition service in 2016. So it turns out that lots of companies \u2013 including Schmidt\u2019s own \u2013 had crossed the facial recognition red line. All of which makes one wonder why there was such a fuss the other week when the New York Times published a big expos\u00e9 of Clearview AI, a tiny company based in New York. \u201cThe secretive company that might end privacy as we know it\u201d, read the breathless headline over the story about a start-up that helps law-enforcement authorities to match photos of unknown people to their online images. Was it because Peter Thiel \u2013 the creepy billionaire geek from central casting \u2013 had been an early investor? Or because Hoan Ton-That, the ingenious co-founder of Clearview, had once, like Thiel, been traduced by Gawker? Or because the other co-founder was a guy who used to work for Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer? Or was it simply because the article revealed to an astonished \u2013 and hopefully alarmed \u2013 lay public the extent of the capabilities of facial recognition technology? After all, what it suggests is that if you have ever had your photograph published online then the cops (and presumably any other Clearview client) can find and identify you. For me, the most noteworthy thing about Clearview AI is that it\u2019s such a small outfit. Essentially, Ton-That created it by hiring two hackers. One was charged with building software for \u201cscraping\u201d images from online sources. (This sounds painful, but really it\u2019s just automated browsing and data-extraction: there are dozens of tools for doing this available online.) The software then scraped several billion images from across the web \u2013 from employment sites, news sites, educational sites and social networks including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram. The other programmer was charged with creating a facial recognition algorithm, which they probably did by building on software published in academic papers. The result was a system that was simplicity itself to use \u2013 upload a photo and in many cases you get a name. Clearview began by marketing the system to law-enforcement authorities. According to the NYT report, many of their 600 customers love it. In February 2019, the Indiana state police solved a case within 20 minutes of using the system. There was a fight in a park that ended with one man shooting another in the stomach. A bystander recorded the crime on a phone, so the police had a still of the gunman\u2019s face to run through Clearview\u2019s app. They immediately got a match: the man had appeared in a video on social media, and his name was included in a caption on the video. Bingo! You can see why this stuff is catnip for cops. So why has it taken so long to surface? One reason might be that all social media sites have rules that prohibit scraping. So maybe entrepreneurs were put off by that. Clearview wasn\u2019t, perhaps because it had a lawyer who knew about the recent case in which LinkedIn tried and failed to block and sue scrapers. The judge said that not only could it not sue, but also that it\u2019s not even allowed to try to block scraping by any technical means. Ultimately, the lesson of Clearview is that when a digital technology is developed, it rapidly becomes commodified. Once upon a time, this stuff was the province of big corporations. Now it can be exploited by small fry. And on a shoestring budget. One of the co-founders paid for server costs and basic expenses. Mr Ton-That lived on credit-card debt. And everyone worked from home. \u201cDemocracy dies in darkness\u201d goes the motto of the Washington Post. \u201cPrivacy dies in a hacker\u2019s bedroom\u201d might now be more appropriate.

      "body": "<p>A small Greek island, its wooded hills woven with timeless secrets, would make a welcome contrast to the carnage of first world war trenches. But if <em>1917</em> director Sir Sam Mendes now has a holiday isle near Athens in his sights, it is as the location of his next project, and not as a sunny destination before he is feted at Bafta and Oscar ceremonies next month.</p> <p>Mendes and his partners at Neal Street Productions are to make a major television adaptation of <em>The Magus</em>, the mysterious and much-loved novel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnfowles\" title=\"\">John Fowles</a>. \u201cLike many people, I read and loved it as a teenager,\u201d Mendes said this weekend, as he unveiled his latest plans to the <em>Observer</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/archive-zip/giv-390246mG0Xv7u8ne/\" > <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/archive-zip/giv-390246mG0Xv7u8ne/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The director believes the twisting, layered plot of the 1965 bestseller will be suited to television. Fowles wrote the book, which was made into a film in 1968, after teaching English at a school on Spetses, and it tells the story of the enigmatic and reclusive resident of an island villa who controls the lives of those who come into his orbit. \u201cThere are lots of modern classics like this one which were compressed into movies in the past and perhaps lost something by squeezing them, instead of telling them over several hours,\u201d said Mendes.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole raft of good books that fall into that category and now we are in a position where we can tell it differently.\u201d</p> <p>Inside the Covent Garden offices Mendes shares with three partner producers, there is no question of taking a rest after the run of hits they have enjoyed. Between them, Mendes, Nick Brown, Caro Newling and Dame Pippa Harris are also responsible for staging Stefano Massini\u2019s acclaimed theatrical event, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/13/the-lehman-trilogy-review-lyttelton-sam-mendes\" title=\"\">The Lehman Trilogy</a></em>. And <em>1917</em>, which this weekend has reached a box office figure of almost \u00a322m in just a fortnight, received its clutch of Oscar nominations in the same week that their BBC One television show <em>Call the Midwife</em> racked up top viewing figures of seven million and their outlandish Jez Butterworth-scripted show <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/07/britannia-season-two-review-the-roman-romp-so-radical-it-must-be-revered\" title=\"\">Britannia</a></em> announced a third season on Sky. Now, in addition to developing <em>The Magus</em>, the Neal Street quartet is to bring a musical version of the cherished 1983 film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/11/scotland-local-hero-musical-bill-forsyth-john-crowley-david-greig-mark-knopfler\" title=\"\">Local Hero</a></em> to the Old Vic theatre this summer. The partners are also making a comic thriller series for television set in London\u2019s financial markets. Called <em>Prophets</em> and written by Krysty Wilson-Cairns, the acclaimed 32-year-old Scot who co-wrote <em>1917</em> with Mendes, it deals with the shady and high-stakes business of predictive investing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d24a9d066eac962fafc20a261726100a7797b810\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d24a9d066eac962fafc20a261726100a7797b810/247_412_5667_3402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spetses. off the Aegean coast, is the setting for John Fowles\u2019s 1965 novel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spetses. off the Aegean coast, is the setting for John Fowles\u2019s 1965 novel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Harding/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is a world that really exists, but is quite hidden,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money to be made working out where tornadoes are going to hit next and the likelihood of an earthquake, or even which CEO is likeliest to drop dead.\u201d Wilson-Cairns, a mathematician, was inspired by memories of time she spent as an intern in an actuarial company \u2013 before being thrown out for asking innocently if they would be warning the potential victims of an upcoming disaster. \u201cOur series will focus on predicting individual deaths, rather than disasters,\u201d explained Brown.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much private health information out there now and it is not such a big step for someone in a firm like that to think \u2018actually, I really need this person to die now\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson-Cairns honed her darkly humorous idea in her trailer during the making of <em>1917</em>, said Harris: \u201cKrysty is a very witty writer, and the hit TV shows <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/22/little-women-female-friendships-top-billing-tv-shows-plays-films\" title=\"\">Killing Eve</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/10/breath-of-fresh-heir-how-succession-became-the-must-watch-tv-of-the-year\" title=\"\">Succession</a></em> have proved you do not always need to have likeable protagonists.\u201d</p> <p>Mendes did not draw on his co-writer\u2019s full comedic powers for <em>1917</em>, he admitted, adding that he now sees Wilson-Cairns as a test case for the company\u2019s handling of an emerging talent. \u201cShe shows how cross-pollination from TV to film can really work.\u201d</p> <p>Among other talents working in the loose Neal Street stable are Butterworth, John Logan, who wrote Mendes\u2019s first Bond film, <em>Skyfall</em>, and the playwright David Greig, who is working on the new <em>Local Hero</em> musical alongside Dire Straits\u2019s Mark Knopfler and the film\u2019s original director, Bill Forsyth. \u201cWe had a short run in Edinburgh and it was good that we did it there first, because they would have been most critical of any faults in Scotland, where the film is regarded as a national treasure,\u201d said Newling, the theatrical impresario of the team.</p> <p>\u201cMark has written 19 new songs for the show and has become quite an intuitive theatre animal. He wants to revisit some of his music for London.\u201d</p> <p>Mendes has frequently stepped between stage and film work, but said he still thinks of theatre as home. \u201cI felt like theatre would always be there for me, but I\u2019ve never felt that way about film,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, there are some great film-makers who have sometimes struggled to get something made. So I have been relieved in many ways, as well as pleased, by the great reception for <em>1917</em>. It\u2019s been a decade since I made a movie that was not part of a franchise \u2013 and even back then <em>Revolutionary Road</em> was based on a well-known book.\u201d</p> <p>He and Harris originally looked into making <em>The Magus </em>several years ago, but gave up when it appeared too legally complex.

      "bodyText": "A small Greek island, its wooded hills woven with timeless secrets, would make a welcome contrast to the carnage of first world war trenches. But if 1917 director Sir Sam Mendes now has a holiday isle near Athens in his sights, it is as the location of his next project, and not as a sunny destination before he is feted at Bafta and Oscar ceremonies next month. Mendes and his partners at Neal Street Productions are to make a major television adaptation of The Magus, the mysterious and much-loved novel by John Fowles. \u201cLike many people, I read and loved it as a teenager,\u201d Mendes said this weekend, as he unveiled his latest plans to the Observer. The director believes the twisting, layered plot of the 1965 bestseller will be suited to television. Fowles wrote the book, which was made into a film in 1968, after teaching English at a school on Spetses, and it tells the story of the enigmatic and reclusive resident of an island villa who controls the lives of those who come into his orbit. \u201cThere are lots of modern classics like this one which were compressed into movies in the past and perhaps lost something by squeezing them, instead of telling them over several hours,\u201d said Mendes. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole raft of good books that fall into that category and now we are in a position where we can tell it differently.\u201d Inside the Covent Garden offices Mendes shares with three partner producers, there is no question of taking a rest after the run of hits they have enjoyed. Between them, Mendes, Nick Brown, Caro Newling and Dame Pippa Harris are also responsible for staging Stefano Massini\u2019s acclaimed theatrical event, The Lehman Trilogy. And 1917, which this weekend has reached a box office figure of almost \u00a322m in just a fortnight, received its clutch of Oscar nominations in the same week that their BBC One television show Call the Midwife racked up top viewing figures of seven million and their outlandish Jez Butterworth-scripted show Britannia announced a third season on Sky. Now, in addition to developing The Magus, the Neal Street quartet is to bring a musical version of the cherished 1983 film Local Hero to the Old Vic theatre this summer. The partners are also making a comic thriller series for television set in London\u2019s financial markets. Called Prophets and written by Krysty Wilson-Cairns, the acclaimed 32-year-old Scot who co-wrote 1917 with Mendes, it deals with the shady and high-stakes business of predictive investing. \u201cIt is a world that really exists, but is quite hidden,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money to be made working out where tornadoes are going to hit next and the likelihood of an earthquake, or even which CEO is likeliest to drop dead.\u201d Wilson-Cairns, a mathematician, was inspired by memories of time she spent as an intern in an actuarial company \u2013 before being thrown out for asking innocently if they would be warning the potential victims of an upcoming disaster. \u201cOur series will focus on predicting individual deaths, rather than disasters,\u201d explained Brown. \u201cThere\u2019s so much private health information out there now and it is not such a big step for someone in a firm like that to think \u2018actually, I really need this person to die now\u2019.\u201d Wilson-Cairns honed her darkly humorous idea in her trailer during the making of 1917, said Harris: \u201cKrysty is a very witty writer, and the hit TV shows Killing Eve and Succession have proved you do not always need to have likeable protagonists.\u201d Mendes did not draw on his co-writer\u2019s full comedic powers for 1917, he admitted, adding that he now sees Wilson-Cairns as a test case for the company\u2019s handling of an emerging talent. \u201cShe shows how cross-pollination from TV to film can really work.\u201d Among other talents working in the loose Neal Street stable are Butterworth, John Logan, who wrote Mendes\u2019s first Bond film, Skyfall, and the playwright David Greig, who is working on the new Local Hero musical alongside Dire Straits\u2019s Mark Knopfler and the film\u2019s original director, Bill Forsyth. \u201cWe had a short run in Edinburgh and it was good that we did it there first, because they would have been most critical of any faults in Scotland, where the film is regarded as a national treasure,\u201d said Newling, the theatrical impresario of the team. \u201cMark has written 19 new songs for the show and has become quite an intuitive theatre animal. He wants to revisit some of his music for London.\u201d Mendes has frequently stepped between stage and film work, but said he still thinks of theatre as home. \u201cI felt like theatre would always be there for me, but I\u2019ve never felt that way about film,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, there are some great film-makers who have sometimes struggled to get something made. So I have been relieved in many ways, as well as pleased, by the great reception for 1917. It\u2019s been a decade since I made a movie that was not part of a franchise \u2013 and even back then Revolutionary Road was based on a well-known book.\u201d He and Harris originally looked into making The Magus several years ago, but gave up when it appeared too legally complex. But while making the Bond films they met Ian Fleming\u2019s great-nephew, Robert Lacock, who had the rights to Fowles\u2019s book. They have since developed the project with him, bringing in screenwriter Tom Edge, best known for the film Judy and the BBC One detective series Strike. Mendes regards himself as \u201ca pretty benevolent hands-off kind of producer\u201d. He aims to be closely involved at the beginning of both new television projects, he said, before stepping back to let them \u201cpolice themselves\u201d. \u201cIn terms of helping to get the first stages of these shows right, I am really eager to see Prophets through, and The Magus too, although it is more Pippa\u2019s project.\u201d Further off, Neal Street is looking at the possibility of making a feature-film version of Call the Midwife, the TV show that gave the company financial stability, and of The Lehman Trilogy. If there is one secret behind these successes, Mendes suspects it is the shared rule of only making scripted drama that they all care about. \u201cWe have had moments when we wondered what we were doing, but we stuck to our plan,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least one of us has to be totally committed to a project. There is no cynicism about any of the choices we make.\u201d",

It was 2am, and everyone in the attractive cobbled street where he lives in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, had been jolted awake by a giant explosion. \u201cThe blinds shot up because of the pressure, and straightaway there was a small crowd of neighbours outside,\u201d the 40-year-old wine merchant told the Observer a week after the blast. The damage was still there to see: the door to his backyard had been blown off, his downstairs windows shattered, and his Volvo written off. Where the bomb had been planted in front of the house next door, there was a chunk of wall missing. You might expect such a powerful explosion to be unusual in a middle-class district in otherwise safe, well-organised Sweden. But this bombing in November was one of three in the city in the space of 24 hours. According to data released this month by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, there were 257 crimes involving explosives in the country last year, a 60% rise on 2018. Gangland shootings are also shockingly high, with 320 reported last year, 41 of them fatal. As recently as Tuesday, there were twin explosions in two apartment buildings in a Stockholm suburb. The last blast in Malm\u00f6 was on 10 January. \u201cThese explosions in public places are a serious problem specific to Sweden,\u201d Linda Staaf, the head of the Swedish National Police\u2019s intelligence service, told the Observer. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal to see these kinds of explosions in a country without a war.\u201d The wave of bombings and shootings is boosting the populist Sweden Democrats and the centre-right opposition, and weighing down on the Social Democrat-led government. \u201cPeople are being forced to flee their homes in the middle of the night because of bomb attacks,\u201d Ulf Kristersson, leader of the opposition Moderate party wrote in Aftonbladet after Tuesday\u2019s blasts, before accusing prime minister Stefan L\u00f6fven of \u201crefusing even to admit the connection between failed integration and growing gang criminality\u201d. But Mattias Sigfridsson, deputy chief of Malm\u00f6\u2019s police, claims that more than five years after the blasts began in 2014, police in the city are now starting to get a grip on the problem. \u201cSince we\u2019ve been working so hard on this issue, it\u2019s been going down in Malm\u00f6,\u201d he said. In response to the blasts that rocked Geor\u00e9n\u2019s street, police launched a national effort called Operation Hoarfrost. \u201cWe have sent police from all over Sweden to Malm\u00f6 and Sk\u00e5ne,\u201d said Staaf, who was appointed the operation\u2019s deputy incident commander. \u201cThere are more police on the streets, more police investigating the crimes.

I was more taken by the fact that she carries one of her cats (it didn\u2019t look roomy enough for two) <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/1970976/taylor-swift-cat-robe/\" title=\"\">on to an plane</a> in a ventilated backpack with a bubble window, like she lives in a 1970s cartoon about space.</p> <p>But it was a moment from a montage, when a pundit declares Swift to be too skinny, that became the focus. It was followed by an interview with <em>Variety</em> about a past <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/music/news/taylor-swift-eating-disorder-netflix-documentary-miss-americana-1203478047/\" title=\"\">eating disorder</a>; understandably, she said it was an uncomfortable topic for her to discuss.</p> <p>\u201cMy relationship with food was exactly the same psychology I applied to everything else in my life: if I was given a pat on the head, I registered that as good. If I was given a punishment, I registered that as bad,\u201d she said. The pats on the head were being able to fit into tiny sample sizes on photoshoots; the punishments were magazine covers speculating about whether or not she was pregnant. It took its toll, and led to a period of starvation and compulsive exercise. Another successful pop star appeared on another magazine cover this week. <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lizzo-cover-story-interview-truth-hurts-grammys-937009/\" title=\"\">Lizzo</a>, shot by David LaChapelle as a heavenly apparition for <em>Rolling Stone,</em> appeared under the coverline, \u201cLizzo: How She Conquered The World\u201d. The piece, all about her rise to superstardom, briefly touched on the strange period in December when her body became a topic of public discussion, or consumption, after she was filmed twerking at a basketball game in a dress that showed her thong. The writer noted that Lizzo seemed \u201ca touch exhausted talking about her body, which is fair\u201d.</p> <p>It must be exhausting.

      "bodyText": "It says a lot about the level of stardom to which Taylor Swift has ascended that a mere trailer for a documentary about her became international news. When the clip of Miss Americana appeared, the initial line that emerged was that Swift would be finally talking about what made her finally talk about politics. I was more taken by the fact that she carries one of her cats (it didn\u2019t look roomy enough for two) on to an plane in a ventilated backpack with a bubble window, like she lives in a 1970s cartoon about space. But it was a moment from a montage, when a pundit declares Swift to be too skinny, that became the focus. It was followed by an interview with Variety about a past eating disorder; understandably, she said it was an uncomfortable topic for her to discuss. \u201cMy relationship with food was exactly the same psychology I applied to everything else in my life: if I was given a pat on the head, I registered that as good. If I was given a punishment, I registered that as bad,\u201d she said. The pats on the head were being able to fit into tiny sample sizes on photoshoots; the punishments were magazine covers speculating about whether or not she was pregnant. It took its toll, and led to a period of starvation and compulsive exercise. Another successful pop star appeared on another magazine cover this week. Lizzo, shot by David LaChapelle as a heavenly apparition for Rolling Stone, appeared under the coverline, \u201cLizzo: How She Conquered The World\u201d. The piece, all about her rise to superstardom, briefly touched on the strange period in December when her body became a topic of public discussion, or consumption, after she was filmed twerking at a basketball game in a dress that showed her thong. The writer noted that Lizzo seemed \u201ca touch exhausted talking about her body, which is fair\u201d. It must be exhausting. Famous or not, women\u2019s bodies are under constant scrutiny, from countless sources, and the only thing that shifts is the scale of it. As my colleague Eva Wiseman wrote in this paper this month, even the \u201cbody positivity\u201d movement demands the undoing of a lifetime of pressure to be a certain way. It\u2019s fine, and admirable, to say all women\u2019s bodies are beautiful, yet how can we expect women to believe that when we are constantly being told otherwise? Lana Wilson, who directed Miss Americana, pointed out just how common it is for women to hear either \u201cyou look skinny\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ve gained weight\u201d, and she really got at the simple truth of it: \u201cYou can\u2019t win either way.\u201d James Corden: hands-free driving is easy if you\u2019re on tow There was much fuss last week over a candid snapshot of James Corden and Justin Bieber, filming another Carpool Karaoke in Los Angeles. For the uninitiated, Carpool Karaoke is a brilliant segment on Corden\u2019s US talkshow that does big business online. He invites famous musicians along for a drive, then sings their songs with them, all the while conducting an interview that digs surprisingly deep. It works because most people feel relaxed in the car, and know that it is a cocoon, a safe space, particularly for top-of-the-lungs singing, with apologies to anyone who\u2019s ever heard me trying to hit the high note in A Case of You, because car windows are not as soundproof as you start to believe. In a picture widely shared on Twitter, Corden and Bieber are in the car, but the car is on a trailer, being towed, which means Corden is not driving it. \u201cThis is why I have trust issues,\u201d said the Twitter user who posted it. Corden\u2019s producer, Ben Winston, was quick to respond, saying they only use a rig to film stunts: \u201cThis has occurred only maybe 4 times in 50 or so carpools!\u201d Corden shared a snap of himself with Samuel L Jackson in a studio, in front of a green screen, with Corden holding a steering wheel: \u201cGuys, we don\u2019t even use a real car.\u201d There are moments when you realise you\u2019re getting on a bit. Trying to get on board with Love Island at this late stage. Feeling a joy bordering on ecstasy when you are asked for ID trying to buy wine. Picking up a jumper in a youthful clothes shop and wondering why, oh why, do they always cut the bottom off?

Brad Pitt, BFFs with Jen is the perfect role Brad Pitt left a trail of news titbits in his wake last week, all tasty, snackable morsels. He turned down the part of Neo in The Matrix! Leonardo DiCaprio has a pet name for him, and it is \u201cLover\u201d, which makes the two of them sound like the Hollywood Gavin and Smithy! But none was enough to quieten the orchestra of excitement that greeted pictures of him and his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston at the Screen Actors Guild awards, not just occupying the same air space but actually interacting in it. The decades of tabloid front-page frothing over their former relationship picked up enough fuel for another few years of creative speculation.

She\u2019s speaking for the people. She has a passion for the millennials.

A passionate discourse on healthcare and the case for comprehensive public insurance, a cause at the heart of Sanders campaign, then gave way to a rousing appeal to build a movement to transform \u201ca nation in decline\u201d.</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez disparaged the Democratic leadership in Congress as fearful of any radical policies that might cost votes and called on supporters to \u201ccome together and organise\u201d to repeated cheers.</p> <p>But through it all, even as Sanders picture stared down on her, his name did not once cross the congresswoman\u2019s lips.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"741ebaefeb0caee5e5dc0b7ede82271c9d88dee6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/741ebaefeb0caee5e5dc0b7ede82271c9d88dee6/0_0_3272_2181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Bernie Sanders Friday Iowa City, Iowa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Bernie Sanders Friday Iowa City, Iowa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sue Ogrocki/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ocasio-Cortez has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/19/bernie-sanders-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-new-york-rally\">unstinting in her support</a> of Sanders\u2019 presidential bid but Friday\u2019s rally will only reinforce the perception that his campaign also provides her with a platform to push a more visionary agenda. That in turn has fueled media speculation about the extent of the 30 year-old\u2019s ambitions, and the possibility she might run for the White House herself in 2024 \u2013 should Trump win a second term.</p> <p>Whatever her plans, the congresswoman will not have been discouraged by the reception in Iowa City, where she was greeted with an enthusiasm bordering on adulation.</p> <p>Jonathan Katz, a high school math teacher from New York City who travelled to Iowa to canvass for Sanders, was at the rally specifically to see Ocasio-Cortez.</p> <p>\u201cWhen she showed the courage after Bernie\u2019s heart attack to say \u2018I\u2019m going to be supporting Bernie\u2019, my respect went up 1,000%. Because here\u2019s someone at Bernie\u2019s most difficult moment in the campaign saying \u2018I\u2019m with you Bernie\u2019,\u201d said Katz.</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s backing has meant more than throwing her weight behind Sanders\u2019 positions.

I think a lot of people are drawn to her who may not otherwise have been interested in politics, and that helps Bernie.</p> <p>\u201cI really hope she continues on the politics. She\u2019s a force to be reckoned with. I really think she\u2019s going to do great things for the people, for we the people.

For some of Sanders supporters, she offers a vision beyond his presidential campaign. </p> <p>Wendy Stevenson, a librarian who caucused for Sanders four years ago, came to the rally with her 11-year-old daughter, Estelle, who wanted to see Ocasio-Cortez after watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/28/knock-down-the-house-review-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-doc-brings-down-the-house\">a Netflix documentary about her</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI love her vision. I love her guts to go in first term as a representative and propose the Green New Deal. It changes the way our economy will work. It\u2019s exciting. You need that kind of energy and ideas out there. And she\u2019s not scared to challenge the establishment. Even the Democrats, she\u2019s pushing them further than they feel comfortable going. I love having that voice,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But for all that, Stevenson is not sure on where Ocasio-Cortez should set her sights. For now she wants to see her remain in Congress, where she thinks she could rise to great heights and have real power and influence over the policies that matter most.</p> <p>\u201cI hope she\u2019ll be a powerful future politician that can change the way things are done. I feel like she really feels strongly about representing her people in her district. She\u2019s still young. I\u2019m excited that things are moving further to the left with a lot more fresh ideas. I really hope she is the future.\u201d</p>",

She was in Iowa City for real star of the show, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cShe\u2019s speaking for us. She\u2019s speaking for the people. She has a passion for the millennials. She\u2019s speaking for everyone in America who doesn\u2019t have a voice,\u201d said Springmeier, a millennial herself who is unable to work because of a disability. With the Vermont senator trapped in Washington DC by the impeachment hearings, Ocasio-Cortez was fronting for him at the University of Iowa on Friday evening in the last days before the Iowa Democratic caucuses. Much of the crowd had already made up its mind to back Sanders, which was just as well because the New York congresswoman gave a 26-minute speech without once mentioning the man she was ostensibly there to promote. A passionate discourse on healthcare and the case for comprehensive public insurance, a cause at the heart of Sanders campaign, then gave way to a rousing appeal to build a movement to transform \u201ca nation in decline\u201d. Ocasio-Cortez disparaged the Democratic leadership in Congress as fearful of any radical policies that might cost votes and called on supporters to \u201ccome together and organise\u201d to repeated cheers. But through it all, even as Sanders picture stared down on her, his name did not once cross the congresswoman\u2019s lips. Ocasio-Cortez has been unstinting in her support of Sanders\u2019 presidential bid but Friday\u2019s rally will only reinforce the perception that his campaign also provides her with a platform to push a more visionary agenda. That in turn has fueled media speculation about the extent of the 30 year-old\u2019s ambitions, and the possibility she might run for the White House herself in 2024 \u2013 should Trump win a second term. Whatever her plans, the congresswoman will not have been discouraged by the reception in Iowa City, where she was greeted with an enthusiasm bordering on adulation. Jonathan Katz, a high school math teacher from New York City who travelled to Iowa to canvass for Sanders, was at the rally specifically to see Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cWhen she showed the courage after Bernie\u2019s heart attack to say \u2018I\u2019m going to be supporting Bernie\u2019, my respect went up 1,000%. Because here\u2019s someone at Bernie\u2019s most difficult moment in the campaign saying \u2018I\u2019m with you Bernie\u2019,\u201d said Katz. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s backing has meant more than throwing her weight behind Sanders\u2019 positions. She has amplified some of them, not least on the environment with her push for a Green New Deal, and injected a much greater diversity of voices into the Vermont senator\u2019s campaign, which he has frankly admitted were lacking in his 2016 run. \u201cShe\u2019s been very important to Bernie, bringing people in, especially young people,\u201d said Springmeier. \u201cShe\u2019s helped bring in minorities, bring some light to the fact that they don\u2019t really have a voice. I think a lot of people are drawn to her who may not otherwise have been interested in politics, and that helps Bernie. \u201cI really hope she continues on the politics. She\u2019s a force to be reckoned with. I really think she\u2019s going to do great things for the people, for we the people. She\u2019s working in the establishment but I think she\u2019s going to be speaking for us.\u201d If Ocasio-Cortez has reinforced the Sanders campaign, it\u2019s clear she can also draw from that enhanced strength. For some of Sanders supporters, she offers a vision beyond his presidential campaign. Wendy Stevenson, a librarian who caucused for Sanders four years ago, came to the rally with her 11-year-old daughter, Estelle, who wanted to see Ocasio-Cortez after watching a Netflix documentary about her. \u201cI love her vision. I love her guts to go in first term as a representative and propose the Green New Deal. It changes the way our economy will work. It\u2019s exciting. You need that kind of energy and ideas out there. And she\u2019s not scared to challenge the establishment. Even the Democrats, she\u2019s pushing them further than they feel comfortable going. I love having that voice,\u201d she said. But for all that, Stevenson is not sure on where Ocasio-Cortez should set her sights. For now she wants to see her remain in Congress, where she thinks she could rise to great heights and have real power and influence over the policies that matter most. \u201cI hope she\u2019ll be a powerful future politician that can change the way things are done. I feel like she really feels strongly about representing her people in her district. She\u2019s still young. I\u2019m excited that things are moving further to the left with a lot more fresh ideas. I really hope she is the future.\u201d",

The entrepreneur and investor is also co-founder of the <a href=\"https://su.org/\" title=\"\">Singularity University</a>, a Silicon Valley-based nonprofit offering education in futurology. His new book, <a href=\"https://www.diamandis.com/blog/future-is-faster-than-you-think\" title=\"\"><em>The Future Is Faster Than You Think</em></a>, argues that the already rapid pace of technological innovation is about to get a whole lot quicker.</p> <p><strong>Do you think people are worried about where technology is going to take us?</strong><br>I can palpably feel how fast things are changing and that the rate of change is accelerating, and I have picked up a growing amount of fear coming from people who don\u2019t understand where the world is going. And that is not good when you\u2019re trying to solve problems. This book is about giving people a roadmap for where things are going over the next decade so they have less fear and more anticipation. Because, yes, in the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to reinvent every industry on this planet, but the change is one that is for the benefit of masses, whether it\u2019s in longevity or food or banking.</p> <p><strong>You say </strong><strong>in the next </strong><strong>decade we\u2019</strong><strong>ll experience more </strong><strong>progress than</strong><strong> in the past 100 years. Wh</strong><strong>y? </strong><br>Computation is the foundation. Be it classical or quantum computing, as it becomes faster and cheaper lots of technologies that use it also become more capable. For example, communication networks, sensors, robotics, augmented and virtual reality, blockchain, and AI are all exponentially improving. But they are also being interweaved and converging: for example AI with robotics. And that\u2019s getting even faster because the number of people with access to technology is increasing, so we are able to solve more problems. There\u2019s also more capital available than ever before which means more crazy ideas being funded, which in turn leads to more breakthroughs. And the cost of doing things is also getting cheaper: the number of experiments going on in the \u201cSilicon Valley garage\u201d is exploding.</p> <p><strong>You sketch out the impacts of these converging technologies on various aspects of our lives over the next decade, from what we will eat to how we will entertain ourselves to transport. </strong><strong>So how will we </strong><strong>be getting around in 2030?</strong><br>Car ownership will be a thing of the past. You\u2019ll turn your garage into a spare bedroom and your driveway into a rose garden. After breakfast in the morning you will walk towards the front door of your house. Your AI will know your schedule, it will see you moving and it will have an autonomous electric car waiting for you. It will know you didn\u2019t get much sleep last night, so it will have pulled a car with a bed in the back so you can sleep on your way to work. Your commute time will be yours.</p> <p><strong>What about shopping?</strong><br>Repeat purchases will also be done by your AI, which you will give permission to measure and see everything. To shop for clothes, you will enter a VR shopping mall where you can conjure up a VR fashion show of 100 of your avatars wearing different outfits, to decide what you like. There will be a digital twin for every piece of clothing you own already, so you can see how it would meld with your wardrobe. And if you decide you want something, it will be produced specifically to your size, because you will have a body file of exactly your proportions.</p> <p><strong>This all-knowing AI sounds scary.</strong><br>Think of it from this perspective.

They might try to look up the film on their phones and, while they are at it, will show me a cat video trending on Twitter.</p> <p>It\u2019s rare that people don\u2019t interrupt and shift conversation to themselves. Bad listeners are not necessarily bad or boorish people. You\u2019re likely to have a dear friend, family member, or maybe a romantic partner who is a bad listener. Perhaps you, yourself, are not the best listener. And you could be forgiven. In many ways, we have been conditioned not to listen.</p> <p>Schools and universities have courses in debate, rhetoric and elocution, but rarely classes that teach listening. You can get a doctorate in speech communication and join Toastmasters International to perfect your speaking skills, but who strives for excellence in listening? Social media has given everyone a virtual megaphone to broadcast every thought, as well as the means to filter out contrary views. Online and in person, it\u2019s all about defining yourself and shaping the narrative. The very image of success and power today is someone prowling around a stage with a microphone.</p> <p>The cacophony of modern life discourages listening. Noise levels in restaurants make diners strain to hear one another. Offices are open design so every keyboard click, telephone call and post-lunch belch make for a constant racket. Traffic noise on city streets, piped music in shops and the bean grinder at your local coffeehouse exceed the volume of normal conversation by as much as 30 decibels and can even cause hearing loss. All this when listening is arguably more valuable than speaking. Wars have been fought, fortunes lost and friendships wrecked for lack of listening. The American president Calvin Coolidge said: \u201cNo man ever listened himself out of a job.\u201d It is by listening that we connect, comprehend, co-operate, empathise and develop as human beings. It\u2019s fundamental to any meaningful relationship \u2013 personal, professional or political.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Earbuds provide our own curated sound bubbles</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m a listener by profession but I\u2019m also a listener by nature. Perhaps it comes from growing up in Texas, a state known for its raconteurs. I was surrounded by colourful relatives and neighbours who knew how to tell a good tale \u2013 some taller than others. I learned early on that listening to the same story told by multiple sources got you closer to the truth.</p> <p>But today people resist listening to one another. They find face-to-face encounters trying and phone calls intrusive, preferring text and wordless emojis. Many people refuse to listen to opposing views, shouting down or walking out on speakers who challenge their thinking. If people are listening to anything, it\u2019s probably through earbuds, safe inside their own curated sound bubbles.</p> <p>In the course of researching my book, I asked people on five continents, \u201cWho listens to you?\u201d and the response was usually a long, awkward pause. Even those who were married and claimed vast networks of friends struggled to come up with someone who they felt truly listened to and understood them. It\u2019s fuelling what public health officials are calling a worldwide epidemic of loneliness, which increases the risk of premature death as much as obesity and alcoholism combined. Indeed, studies link loneliness with heart disease, stroke, dementia and poor immune function.</p> <p>Research indicates great swaths of the populations in the United States and the United Kingdom do not have meaningful in-person social interactions, such as an extended conversation with a friend, on a daily basis. Many report feeling isolated and left out even in the company of other people. Indeed, the UK was moved to appoint a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/16/may-appoints-minister-tackle-loneliness-issues-raised-jo-cox\" title=\"\">minister for loneliness</a>\u201d to help its estimated nine million citizens who often or always feel lonely.</p> <p>To combat loneliness people are told to \u201cGet out there!\u201d Join a club, take up a sport, volunteer, invite people to dinner, get involved at church, or just start a conversation. But that\u2019s not practical advice when people feel lonely in the presence of others. How do you connect with people once you\u2019re \u201cout there\u201d and \u201cface-to-face\u201d? Truly listening to someone is a skill many seem to have forgotten or perhaps never learned in the first place.</p> <p><em><strong>After a couple</strong></em> of years studying the neuroscience, psychology and sociology of listening, as well as consulting some of the best listeners out there (including a CIA agent, focus group moderator, radio producer, priest, bartender and top furniture salesmen), I learned that listening goes beyond just hearing what people say. It\u2019s also paying attention to how they say it and what they do while they are saying it, in what context, and how what they say resonates within you.</p> <p>Listening is not about simply holding your peace while someone else holds forth. Quite the opposite. A lot of listening has to do with how you respond \u2013 the degree to which you elicit clear expression of another\u2019s thoughts and, in the process, crystallise your own. It starts with an openness and willingness to truly follow another person\u2019s story without presumption or getting sidetracked by what\u2019s going on in your own head. This can be a problem for smart people whose galloping thoughts may race ahead of the speaker\u2019s words, often in the wrong direction. People with higher IQs also tend to be more neurotic and self-conscious, which means worry and anxiety may hijack their attention.</p> <p><em><strong>Good listeners ask</strong></em> good questions. One of the most valuable lessons I learned as a journalist is that everyone is interesting if you ask the right questions. If someone seems dull or uninteresting, it\u2019s on you. Good questions don\u2019t have a hidden agenda of fixing, saving, advising, convincing or correcting. They don\u2019t begin with \u201cDon\u2019t you think\u2026?\u201d or \u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree\u2026?\u201d and they definitely don\u2019t end with \u201cRight?\u201d The idea is to explore the speaker\u2019s point of view, not to sway it.</p> <p>Also avoid asking appraising questions like \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d and \u201cWhat part of town do you live in?\u201d and \u201cAre you married?\u201d These are not honest attempts to get to know people so much as rank them in the social hierarchy. It makes people reflexively defensive and is likely to reduce the conversation to a self-promoting elevator pitch or CV recitation. The kinds of conversations that make you long for the company of your dog.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve learned everyone is interesting if you ask the right questions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, ask about their interests. Try to find out what excites or annoys them \u2013 their simple pleasures and what keeps them up at night. Ask expansive questions such as, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best gift you ever received?\u201d and \u201cIf you could live anywhere in the world, where would you live?\u201d Listening to people in this way is also how to bridge differences and find common ground. Once you find out someone has struggled with an illness, cannot resist chocolate, hums Queen\u2019s Bohemian Rhapsody when nervous, or has a room in their house dedicated to their yo-yo collection, it\u2019s hard to reduce them to a political position or ideological stance.</p> <p>You might not agree with them, but you gain understanding about their background and influences, which is essential to reaching compromise, or, at the very least, maintaining a peaceful coexistence. Moreover, listening to others makes it more likely that they will listen to you. This is in part because it\u2019s human nature to return courtesies, but also because you learn people\u2019s values and motivations. With this you\u2019ll be better able to craft a message that resonates.</p> <p>Listening is a skill and, like any skill, it degrades if you don\u2019t do it enough. It takes awareness, motivation and practice. While some may have more natural ability and others may have to try harder, everyone will benefit from the effort. The more people you listen to, the more aspects of humanity you will recognise and the better your judgements, instincts and intuitions. We are, each of us, what we attend to in life. To listen poorly, selectively, or not at all, is to limit your understanding of the world and deprive yourself of becoming the best you can be.</p> <p><em>You\u2019re Not Listening by Kate Murphy</em><em> is published by Harvill Secker, Vintage at \u00a316.99.

Traffic noise on city streets, piped music in shops and the bean grinder at your local coffeehouse exceed the volume of normal conversation by as much as 30 decibels and can even cause hearing loss. All this when listening is arguably more valuable than speaking. Wars have been fought, fortunes lost and friendships wrecked for lack of listening. The American president Calvin Coolidge said: \u201cNo man ever listened himself out of a job.\u201d It is by listening that we connect, comprehend, co-operate, empathise and develop as human beings. It\u2019s fundamental to any meaningful relationship \u2013 personal, professional or political. I\u2019m a listener by profession but I\u2019m also a listener by nature. Perhaps it comes from growing up in Texas, a state known for its raconteurs. I was surrounded by colourful relatives and neighbours who knew how to tell a good tale \u2013 some taller than others. I learned early on that listening to the same story told by multiple sources got you closer to the truth. But today people resist listening to one another. They find face-to-face encounters trying and phone calls intrusive, preferring text and wordless emojis. Many people refuse to listen to opposing views, shouting down or walking out on speakers who challenge their thinking. If people are listening to anything, it\u2019s probably through earbuds, safe inside their own curated sound bubbles. In the course of researching my book, I asked people on five continents, \u201cWho listens to you?\u201d and the response was usually a long, awkward pause. Even those who were married and claimed vast networks of friends struggled to come up with someone who they felt truly listened to and understood them. It\u2019s fuelling what public health officials are calling a worldwide epidemic of loneliness, which increases the risk of premature death as much as obesity and alcoholism combined. Indeed, studies link loneliness with heart disease, stroke, dementia and poor immune function. Research indicates great swaths of the populations in the United States and the United Kingdom do not have meaningful in-person social interactions, such as an extended conversation with a friend, on a daily basis. Many report feeling isolated and left out even in the company of other people. Indeed, the UK was moved to appoint a \u201cminister for loneliness\u201d to help its estimated nine million citizens who often or always feel lonely. To combat loneliness people are told to \u201cGet out there!\u201d Join a club, take up a sport, volunteer, invite people to dinner, get involved at church, or just start a conversation. But that\u2019s not practical advice when people feel lonely in the presence of others. How do you connect with people once you\u2019re \u201cout there\u201d and \u201cface-to-face\u201d? Truly listening to someone is a skill many seem to have forgotten or perhaps never learned in the first place. After a couple of years studying the neuroscience, psychology and sociology of listening, as well as consulting some of the best listeners out there (including a CIA agent, focus group moderator, radio producer, priest, bartender and top furniture salesmen), I learned that listening goes beyond just hearing what people say. It\u2019s also paying attention to how they say it and what they do while they are saying it, in what context, and how what they say resonates within you. Listening is not about simply holding your peace while someone else holds forth. Quite the opposite. A lot of listening has to do with how you respond \u2013 the degree to which you elicit clear expression of another\u2019s thoughts and, in the process, crystallise your own. It starts with an openness and willingness to truly follow another person\u2019s story without presumption or getting sidetracked by what\u2019s going on in your own head. This can be a problem for smart people whose galloping thoughts may race ahead of the speaker\u2019s words, often in the wrong direction. People with higher IQs also tend to be more neurotic and self-conscious, which means worry and anxiety may hijack their attention. Good listeners ask good questions. One of the most valuable lessons I learned as a journalist is that everyone is interesting if you ask the right questions. If someone seems dull or uninteresting, it\u2019s on you. Good questions don\u2019t have a hidden agenda of fixing, saving, advising, convincing or correcting. They don\u2019t begin with \u201cDon\u2019t you think\u2026?\u201d or \u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree\u2026?\u201d and they definitely don\u2019t end with \u201cRight?\u201d The idea is to explore the speaker\u2019s point of view, not to sway it. Also avoid asking appraising questions like \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d and \u201cWhat part of town do you live in?\u201d and \u201cAre you married?\u201d These are not honest attempts to get to know people so much as rank them in the social hierarchy. It makes people reflexively defensive and is likely to reduce the conversation to a self-promoting elevator pitch or CV recitation. The kinds of conversations that make you long for the company of your dog. Instead, ask about their interests. Try to find out what excites or annoys them \u2013 their simple pleasures and what keeps them up at night. Ask expansive questions such as, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best gift you ever received?\u201d and \u201cIf you could live anywhere in the world, where would you live?\u201d Listening to people in this way is also how to bridge differences and find common ground. Once you find out someone has struggled with an illness, cannot resist chocolate, hums Queen\u2019s Bohemian Rhapsody when nervous, or has a room in their house dedicated to their yo-yo collection, it\u2019s hard to reduce them to a political position or ideological stance. You might not agree with them, but you gain understanding about their background and influences, which is essential to reaching compromise, or, at the very least, maintaining a peaceful coexistence. Moreover, listening to others makes it more likely that they will listen to you. This is in part because it\u2019s human nature to return courtesies, but also because you learn people\u2019s values and motivations. With this you\u2019ll be better able to craft a message that resonates. Listening is a skill and, like any skill, it degrades if you don\u2019t do it enough. It takes awareness, motivation and practice. While some may have more natural ability and others may have to try harder, everyone will benefit from the effort. The more people you listen to, the more aspects of humanity you will recognise and the better your judgements, instincts and intuitions. We are, each of us, what we attend to in life. To listen poorly, selectively, or not at all, is to limit your understanding of the world and deprive yourself of becoming the best you can be.

      "bodyText": "No word from Thomas Frank, as the BBC close it all down, so that\u2019s your lot. Off to the report you go ... and many thanks for reading this MBM. Brendan Rodgers speaks to the BBC. \u201cIt was a very good result for us. The objective was to get through. We started very well, played with a nice control. The first 20 to 25 minutes were very good, but we didn\u2019t have precision in our final pass and let Brentford into the game. But they\u2019re a good side, they play well, you know you\u2019ll have to defend. A good win that gets us into the next round.\u201d For the first ten minutes, a rout looked on the cards. Brentford began very nervously indeed. But they rallied, and were the better team in the second half. Their second string can be very proud of their efforts against one of the best squads in the country. \u201cWe are happy to go through to the next round,\u201d Leicester match-winner Kelechi Iheanacho says. \u201cWe worked really hard to the end, a lot of pressure from them. I was a bit nervous because they kept coming, but we defended well and in the end we got the win.\u201d Leicester weren\u2019t great in that second half. But they\u2019ve held firm, and their early efforts were enough. The Foxes go through to the fifth round; the Bees have played FA Cup football at Griffin Park for the very last time. 90 min +2: Marcondes finds a second wind and dribbles down the right. But Fuchs is on hand to put a stop to his gallop. 90 min +1: Yearwood tries to drive Brentford forward, but his fizzed pass towards Marcondes pings off the tired attacker. 90 min: There will be three added minutes. 88 min: Maddison slides one down the right for Justin, who shuttles the ball on for Albrighton. He\u2019s in plenty of space, but with the hosts light at the back, hoicks a dreadful cross deep into the stand. 87 min: Not from this corner, no. Racic has another whack at goal, but this one isn\u2019t so graceful, and the ball flies harmlessly into the crowd behind. 86 min: Racic sprays a pass down the left for Henry, whose low cross is hacked out for a corner by Soyuncu. Can Brentford find the equaliser their second-half efforts deserve? 84 min: Racic meets Marcondes\u2019s corner from the right with a sensational volley. It\u2019s heading in, but Ward tips over magnificently. And from the next corner, Henry hooks in from the left, Mbeumo coming in from the other side and slamming home! Griffin Park erupts. But the flag goes up, correctly, for offside. 83 min: Marcondes crosses from the left. Fuchs ducks under it, in order to let the ball out for a goal kick. But the referee thinks he\u2019s taken a touch and awards a corner. From which ... 82 min: A last throw of the dice by Thomas Frank. Valencia is replaced by Mbeumo. 81 min: Not a lot going on. It\u2019s very flat. Leicester will be happy enough as the clock ticks down. 79 min: Another corner for Leicester, Maddison to take out on the right. It leads to a shanked long-range effort by Praet. Henry launches a quick counter, creaming a pass down the left that initially looks to have sprung Dervisoglu clear. But the flag correctly pops up for offside. 78 min: Albrighton\u2019s corner is a non-event. Then Gray is replaced by Maddison. It\u2019s fair to say the rhythm of this match has been totally broken. 77 min: Thompson can\u2019t continue. A power bar can\u2019t restore his energy levels. Henry comes on in his stead. 76 min: Before the corner can be taken, Thompson is treated for cramp. 75 min: So having said that, Perez feeds Justin down the right. The wing back beats Thompson, checks back, and curls a shot towards the bottom left. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner. 73 min: Leicester ping it around at high speed in the middle of the park, but don\u2019t go anywhere. Their early domination seems a long time ago. 71 min: A nice dummy by the newcomer Dewsbury-Hall sends Praet into acres down the left. Praet\u2019s pullback finds Choudhury, who instead of shooting from the edge of the area passes to nobody in particular. Brentford clear. 70 min: Yearwood bustles down the middle and slips a pass wide right for Dasilva, who blooters a witless effort deep into the stand. Not sure whether that was an attempt at a cross or a shot. Either way: no. 68 min: Leicester replace their goalscorer Iheanacho with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, making his senior debut. 66 min: Scrappy again. There\u2019s been a strange ebb and flow to this match. 64 min: This is a great cup tie now. Marcondes nearly latches onto a long pass, but Ward comes right to the edge of his area to clear. Brentford are asking some serious questions now. 62 min: Brentford hit the post! Marcondes, out on the left, curls the ball low into the mixer. It evades everyone, and bounces off the bottom of the right-hand stick. The ball rolls back across the face of goal, but Fuchs is on hand to clear, skilfully so with Valencia lurking. 61 min: Yearwood embarks on an Andy Robertsonesque closing-down spree. He forces Leicester all the way back to Ward, who slices clear. That got the crowd going, if nothing else. 59 min: A chance to try again from pretty much the same spot, as Perez clatters into the back of Valencia. Da Silva takes, looping towards the back post. Racic rises highest, but can only head the ball straight up into the air, allowing Ward to step in. The keeper doesn\u2019t claim, but only because he\u2019s fouled by Racic. Pressure off. 57 min: Marcondes tries a trick play, shaping to hoick the ball into the mixer but slipping a pass down the left. It\u2019s intended for Zamburek, but it\u2019s a real clanker, and is easily snaffled by Iheanacho. What a waste. 56 min: Dervisoglu spins out of a tight spot in balletic fashion. A lovely piece of skill. Leicester are suddenly on the back foot, and Gray is panicked into clipping Zamburek from behind. A free kick out on the left. Brentford load the box. 54 min: Zamburek loses control of both legs, the ball clattering between them in the slapstick style. A moment that would be perfectly soundtracked by a xylophone trill. That allows Perez to tear up the other end and win a corner. Albrighton takes, sending the ball towards nobody in particular. 52 min: One of those scrappy periods. 50 min: Dervisoglu, out on the right, loops a glorious diagonal pass towards Valencia, who enters the Leicester box before screaming a rising shot across the face of goal and wide. He should at least have hit the target. A great chance gone by. 49 min: Acres of space for Perez, who slips the ball right for Iheanacho. The ball\u2019s shuttled on to Justin, who reaches the byline and slaps a low cross straight into the hands of Daniels. For a second there, Brentford were opened up. Justin should have done better. 48 min: Marcondes hits it deep. Too deep. 47 min: Valencia again dribbles down the right, slipping Roerslev in on the overlap. Roerslev wins a corner, which Marcondes will take. 46 min: Brentford are immediately on the attack, Valencia forcing a throw deep in Leicester territory on the right. The ball\u2019s flung straight to a blue shirt, and Leicester clear. Still, an early statement of intent by the home side. And we\u2019re back! Brentford get the ball rolling for the second half. One change for the home side: Mokotjo isn\u2019t able to continue, on account of that knock late in the first half, so he\u2019s replaced by Dasilva. Half-time entertainment. A reminder that more than one Thomas Frank is available. There\u2019s just time for Marcondes to send a dipping effort over the bar from 25 yards. And that\u2019s that for the first half. Brentford, after an incredibly shaky start, would have taken this scoreline after four minutes; they\u2019d have snatched your hand off, in fact. But they\u2019ve since gathered themselves. They\u2019re still right in this tie. More soon! 45 min: Mokotjo comes off worst in a 50-50 with Morgan. He\u2019s limping a bit. Fortunately the whistle will be blown in 60 seconds. 44 min: Mokotjo floats a diagonal ball into the Leicester box from the right. Marcondes springs the Leicester trap, but the ball\u2019s a little bit too high and it skims off the top of his head. Then Leicester go straight up the other end and nearly make it two, Perez slamming a shot straight at Daniels, Gray recycling the ball for Albrighton to head over. End-to-end fun. 42 min: Gray sashays in from the left and one-twos with Perez. He thinks about shooting, but instead opts to feed Justin down the inside-right. He overhits the pass and it\u2019s a goal kick. A sad end to a lovely move. 40 min: Marcondes takes. Jeanvier, racing in, can\u2019t quite get a head on it. Marcondes comes again, playing Valencia in down the right, but the flag goes up for offside. Brentford are beginning to threaten Leicester. Just a little, but small acorns and all that. 39 min: Thompson works his way down the inside left and sends a bobbling shot towards the bottom right. It\u2019s probably going wide, but Ward takes no risks and fingertips it out for a corner. 37 min: Fuchs finds Gray on the edge of the area with a searching ball from the left. Gray\u2019s shot is blocked. Leicester come again, Praet dropping a shoulder to make space down the left, then looking to plant a worldie of a curler into the top right. He gets it all wrong, and the ball goes sailing off into the stand again. 35 min: An aimless hoof into the crowd is caught by a punter in a Norway bobble hat. He smiles quite a lot. A fan of Egil Olsen, perhaps. 33 min: Albrighton strips Yearwood and strides towards the Brentford box, before sending a low drive inches wide of the left-hand post. Not sure Daniels was getting there. Leicester so close to doubling their lead. 32 min: Dervisoglu spins his way down the inside-left channel. He\u2019s rather clumsily clipped by Morgan, just to the left of the D. But there\u2019ll be no free kick in a dangerous position, because the ref waves play on. 30 min: Daniels takes a heavy touch when dealing with a backpass, and is nearly robbed by the ever-buzzing Perez. He boots away, just in time. 28 min: Justin dribbles down the right and from a tight spot chips into the mixer. Perez rises to head, six yards out, but sends the ball away in the wrong direction. Valencia hacks clear. 27 min: Ward punches the corner clear with great feeling. After a fast start, this match has fallen a little flat. Not that Brentford will mind, as they slowly work their way back into it and enjoy a little possession. 26 min: More uneventful fare. Then Zamburek suddenly threatens to turn Morgan down the left, and earns a corner off the Leicester captain. 24 min: The game turns a little scrappy. In the technical areas, both managers do quite a lot of shouting, chewing gum and gesticulating. More when we have it. 22 min: Zamburek falls asleep and lets Choudhury steal the ball with great ease. Choudhury makes to break down the right, and is tugged back by Zamburek. Just a free kick, though the referee could well have booked the Brentford midfielder for his cynicism. 20 min: But Brentford come again. They seem to have finally found their feet. First Zamburek has a crack from distance, then Dervisoglu tries a curler towards the top left. It\u2019s well wide, but at least Leicester are being asked a few questions now. 19 min: Gray passes straight to Roerslev. What a nonsense. Brentford launch a quick counter, Zamburek tearing down the right. The problem is, nobody in red and white has kept up with him. He\u2019s forced to turn tail. 18 min: Gray takes the free kick himself. His old foe Yearwood deflects it over the bar for a corner. From which ... 17 min: Gray shuffles in from the left and is crudely brought down by Yearwood. This is a free kick in a very dangerous position, just to the left of the D. 16 min: Suddenly Brentford spring into life! Roerslev drops a shoulder down the right to sail past Fuchs. His cross finds Marcondes, coming in from the left. Marcondes sends a rising shot towards the top left ... but just wide. The side netting ripples, and that\u2019s something for the home fans to cheer, and their team to build on. Much better. 15 min: Iheanacho rasps a shot goalwards from a tight angle on the left. Daniels isn\u2019t to be beaten at his near post. 14 min: A lull, which will suit Brentford as they battle to get some sort of foothold in this game. Moves of more than two passes remain at a premium for the home side. 12 min: Brentford launch it upfield, and Zamburek battles for a high ball with Justin. The pair clash in mid-air, and Justin lands awkwardly, no fault of his opponent. Just winded, and he\u2019s good to go after a brief pause. 11 min: Iheanacho, Albrighton and Gray combine well down the inside-left channel. A one-two nearly comes off on the edge of the box, but the ball flies out for a goal kick. Leicester look dangerous every time they go forward. Brentford continue to look extremely jittery. 10 min: More room for Perez down the left. He slips Albrighton into the box on the overlap, but in doing so is clipped from behind by Yearwood, who is fortunate not to go in the book. Brentford are fortunate the ref blows up for a free kick instead of letting Albrighton continue on his way. The set piece is wasted by Gray, who shoots into the side netting from a tight angle. 8 min: Perez dances down the left and pulls a ball back for Praet, who looks in the mood this afternoon. From the left of the D, the midfielder launches a shot goalwards. Jeanvier does well to get in the road to block. 6 min: So down goes the volume at Griffin Park. Fans worried at all the changes made by Thomas Frank consider the terrain stretching out in front of them. This shadow Brentford selection have looked shaky from the get-go. They need to clear their heads quickly. Can you say a goal has been coming after just over three minutes? Yes. And here it is. Praet, in the centre circle, plays a stunning defence-splitting pass towards Albrighton down the right. Albrighton fizzes a low first-time cross into the box, and Iheanacho slaps the sitter into the net from six yards. 2 min: And now a scare for Leicester, as Ward faffs around with the ball at his feet, and is nearly stripped of possession by Dervisoglu. Fortunately for the keeper, he\u2019s clumsily bowled over, and the whistle grants him a reprieve. Somewhere, in a parallel universe, it\u2019s 1-1 after one minute and 20 seconds. And we\u2019re off! Leicester get the ball rolling. Praet launches it long. The ball breaks to Iheanacho, to the right of the D. He slips the ball down the channel for Perez, who is onside and clear in the box! Perez rounds Daniels, and is about to tap home on the 12-second mark when Racic nips in to toe-poke clear. What a start that would have been! The teams are out! Brentford wear their red and white stripes, while Leicester sport their first-choice blue. Plenty of noise at Griffin Park, a proper FA Cup atmosphere. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! And now a word with Thomas Frank. \u201cOur confidence is high. We know confidence in life and football is so important if you want to create something special ... or some magical moments, as we call it here, the last season at Griffin Park. So we hope with a sell-out and a top Premiership side, we are definitely ready for it. We like to show what we are all about, and put the best possible side out there, but we also need to think that we are going into a three-game week. We have a pretty big game coming up on Tuesday. But if you ask me whether I want to win today or Tuesday, I say yes and yes! Leicester is a very interesting opponent, but this could also be our last FA Cup game here so everyone is a little bit buzzing.\u201d A chat with Brendan Rodgers. \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously picked a strong team, like we\u2019ve done in all the cup competitions. The value for us is the momentum, and obviously we want to win. Today is going to be a really tough day for us, Brentford have done really well in the Championship this season, and play a really good level of football with good ideas. It\u2019s going to be a huge test. We are trying to keep the intensity, it\u2019s no different to over Christmas when I made [similar changes] for a Premier League game. It\u2019s not just the cups. I trust in all the players.\u201d He then drifts off into a nostalgic reverie, having coached at Griffin Park during his time with the youth team at Chelsea. Let\u2019s leave him to enjoy his memories. Other beverages are available. Vodka and Red Bull, for example. Or whisky. Or tea. This punter has opted for a cup of PG Tips, and with good reason: it\u2019s the taste. Full marks for the retro DIY rosette, by the way. Are they coming back into fashion? Hope so. A quick tab before the match. Time for a pint, as well? Yes, why not. It\u2019s OK, it\u2019s socially acceptable, it\u2019s gone 12. Both teams mix it up for the FA Cup. Then give it a good old shake. The only Brentford players to retain their place from the goalless Championship draw with Huddersfield last weekend: Julian Jeanvier and Kamohelo Mokotjo. Bryan Mbeumo is on the bench, but fellow strikers Ollie Watkins and Said Benrahma aren\u2019t in the squad, the latter due to the death of his father. A similar story for Leicester. Only two of their players remain from the starting XI sent out to thrash West Ham on Wednesday night: Caglar Soyuncu and Ayoze Perez. Kasper Schmeichel, Youri Tielemans, James Maddison and Harvey Barnes drop to the bench. Jamie Vardy misses out altogether on account of his glute injury. Brentford: Daniels, Roerslev Rasmussen, Luca Racic, Jeanvier, Thompson, Marcondes, Yearwood, Mokotjo, Zamburek, Dervisoglu, Valencia. Subs: Henry, Pinnock, Norgaard, Gunnarsson, Da Silva, Mbeumo, Hammar. Leicester City: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Soyuncu, Fuchs, Praet, Choudhury, Gray, Perez, Albrighton, Iheanacho. Subs: Schmeichel, Evans, Tielemans, Maddison, Barnes, Ricardo Pereira, Dewsbury-Hall. Referee: Chris Kavanagh (Lancashire). Two fine teams have been drawn together for this FA Cup fourth-round tie. Brentford are one of the country\u2019s in-form sides, having won six of their last nine, drawing two of the other three. They\u2019re fifth in the Championship. Leicester, meanwhile, are flying high in the Premier League, and their manager, formerly of Parkhead, is 31 matches unbeaten in domestic cups. Whether Thomas Frank or Brendan Rodgers will field those fine teams is, however, a moot point. Leicester have a huge midlands derby coming up on Tuesday night, battling Aston Villa in the hope of reaching the League Cup final. Brentford meanwhile have a big game against Nottingham Forest coming up on the same evening, with a return to the top flight for the first time since 1947 very much the priority. Both bosses have therefore strongly hinted at making a few rotations. The magic of the modern FA Cup, right there. But both clubs dream of victory nevertheless. This could potentially be Brentford\u2019s last FA Cup tie at Griffin Park, as they leave the old place in the summer. Leicester also have history on their mind; the last time these two played in the FA Cup was 1949, the Foxes winning 3-1 and going on to reach the final. A sign? Neither club has won the cup. That 1949 final was one of four unsuccessful visits to Wembley for Leicester; they also lost finals in 1961, 1963 and 1969. An unwanted Buffalo Bills style record, there. Brentford\u2019s FA Cup highlights are comparatively modest: four quarter-final appearances, the last against Liverpool in 1989, another the aforementioned game with Leicester in 1949. Could this be Brentford\u2019s year? Or Leicester\u2019s at last? It\u2019s got to be somebody\u2019s. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.45pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>Griffin Park\u2019s last Cup tie and a sign of changing times, in more senses than one. For Brentford, a chance to blaze their club\u2019s impressive development by knocking out one of the country\u2019s best teams in front of a national television audience; a chance to etch one more memory in the fading chronicle of their grand old ground before a move to Kew Bridge this summer. It was an opportunity they passed up, in favour of keeping some fresh legs for their Championship game against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday.</p> <p>For the rest of us it was a salutary lesson in just where this competition now sits in the order of things. There was certainly no lack of buzz, particularly in the dying minutes, as Brentford strained for an equaliser, roared on by a packed crowd.

      "bodyText": "Griffin Park\u2019s last Cup tie and a sign of changing times, in more senses than one. For Brentford, a chance to blaze their club\u2019s impressive development by knocking out one of the country\u2019s best teams in front of a national television audience; a chance to etch one more memory in the fading chronicle of their grand old ground before a move to Kew Bridge this summer. It was an opportunity they passed up, in favour of keeping some fresh legs for their Championship game against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday. For the rest of us it was a salutary lesson in just where this competition now sits in the order of things. There was certainly no lack of buzz, particularly in the dying minutes, as Brentford strained for an equaliser, roared on by a packed crowd. There was no lack of effort or passion from the makeshift Bees XI, who after going an early goal down hounded and pressed Leicester and might even have snatched a replay at the death. You just wondered how much better a spectacle this might have been if Brentford had sent a proper team out. Brendan Rodgers, for his part, named a reasonably strong lineup. Perhaps this is why he has not lost any of his last 32 domestic cup games, a run that stretches back to 2015 with three different clubs. Rodgers played to win. Brentford\u2019s Thomas Frank, on the other hand, openly admitted he played not to draw. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how we can have replays,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the FA Cup, I love the tradition and the culture, but replays are killing the tournament a little bit.\u201d The result was nine changes: Kamohelo Mokotjo and Julian Jeanvier the only first-team regulars, the rest boasting nine league starts this season between them.

But after publication of the first volume of the book, covering the March sisters\u2019 childhood, Alcott was flooded with letters from fans demanding to know whom the little women had married. In rebellion, Alcott \u201cmade a funny match\u201d for Jo, forgoing the obvious choice of Laurie in favour of Professor Bhaer, a middle-aged German, \u201cneither rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is called fascinating, imposing, or brilliant\u201d.</p> <p>Gerwig reworks this disappointing ending by conflating Jo\u2019s fate with Alcott\u2019s.

      "bodyText": "Greta Gerwig\u2019s film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s 1868 classic Little Women begins with an adult Jo March entering the smoke-filled, man-filled offices of a New York publisher in hopes of selling a story. \u201cIf the main character\u2019s a girl make sure she\u2019s married by the end,\u201d the editor decrees. \u201cOr dead, either way.\u201d Alcott herself never married and thought that Jo \u201cshould have remained a literary spinster\u201d. But after publication of the first volume of the book, covering the March sisters\u2019 childhood, Alcott was flooded with letters from fans demanding to know whom the little women had married. In rebellion, Alcott \u201cmade a funny match\u201d for Jo, forgoing the obvious choice of Laurie in favour of Professor Bhaer, a middle-aged German, \u201cneither rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is called fascinating, imposing, or brilliant\u201d. Gerwig reworks this disappointing ending by conflating Jo\u2019s fate with Alcott\u2019s. In the film, we see Jo negotiating the terms of a book deal. She agrees to marrying off her heroine to get the book published but won\u2019t sell her off cheaply, negotiating the percentage of royalties and keeping the copyright, as Alcott did.

      "body": "<p>There are, apparently, seven people on stage, making what sounds like eastern Mediterranean rave music. The lighting (of which there is little) and the dry ice (more copious) help to wrap Black Country, New Road in a haze of unreality.</p> <p>Through the fog, the outline of a violin and the shape of a saxophone are visible; some silhouetted figures stand, some crouch. Eventually, one of the guitarists in BCNR begins intoning something. He builds to a holler and the band plunge into a lacerating workout, drawn mostly from early 90s post-hardcore punk. Beer flies past. Out of the anguish and feedback there eventually emerges the sweetest of melodies, on which violin and sax double up and keyboards provide icy atmospherics.</p> <p>Most of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/05/20-for-2020-rising-stars-unmissable-things\" title=\"\">Black Country, New Road</a>\u2019s tracks follow this pattern of resisting pattern, developing over several minutes; breaking down, pulling back together \u2013 a study in tension and release held to account by a fantastically able drummer. While the constituent parts of this mesmerising din are easily picked out \u2013 gnarly math-rock, like that of BCNR\u2019s fellow travellers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/22/one-to-watch-black-midi-schlagenheim-most-exciting-new-guitar-band-in-britain\" title=\"\">Black Midi</a>, contemporary classical, jazz, klezmer \u2013 the effrontery of having all this music, all at once, feels genuinely daring. It also feels, thrillingly, like it might even take off this year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Isaac Wood's lyrics are studded with trashy pop culture references and curdled tales of bad sex</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Only two singles old, and still considering label options for their forthcoming debut album, BCNR sound both charmingly vestigial and utterly of the moment. <a href=\"https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/black-country-new-road/athen-s-france\" title=\"\">Their debut single</a> only came out this time last year but the old band they most patently resemble is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/01/spiderland-slint-album-reinvented-rock\" title=\"\">Slint</a>, a 90s US outfit whose mysterious, emotional excursions remain a byword for self-effacing intensity, if not large bank balances. There is another bit of backstory. Black Country, New Road is meant to suggest a \u201cgood way out of a bad place\u201d, according to vocalist Isaac Wood. You suspect it refers in part to the demise of their pre-BCNR outfit Nervous Conditions, <a href=\"https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/nervous-conditions-split-following-sexual-assault-allegations-against-front\" title=\"\">who disbanded in 2018</a> after their original singer was accused of sexual assault.</p> <p>Black Country, New Road\u2019s thoughtful, idiosyncratic fusions first gained traction thanks to a tenure at a London pub venue called the Windmill in Brixton, crucible of Fat White Family and many others. (In late December, BCNR joined forces on stage with Black Midi for a Black Midi, New Road special, where the conjoined bands played Wham! and Mariah Carey covers.)</p> <p>Although BCNR are largely instrumental, their <a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/27546-black-country-new-road-interview\" title=\"\">coverage thus far</a> has tended to focus on the words of guitarist Wood. When his lyrics are present, they are highly writerly \u2013 full of elliptical narratives and changing perspectives \u2013 but are also studded with trashy pop culture references and curdled tales of bad sex. Wood told one interviewer recently that he was a virgin; an element of playing with the band\u2019s public persona may be at work here. (\u201cFuck me like you mean it this time, Isaac!\u201d runs one of Wood\u2019s lyrics.) The chorus of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAZhzi9cpkc\" title=\"\">Sunglasses</a>, their best-known tune, is a perfectly turned Gen-Z rallying cry. \u201cI\u2019m more than adequate!\u201d shouts Wood. \u201cLeave Kanye out of this! Leave your sertraline in the cabinet!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAZhzi9cpkc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UAZhzi9cpkc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAZhzi9cpkc\">Watch the video for Sunglasses by Black Country, New Road.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>By contrast, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs0M47tE4rs\" title=\"\">Athen\u2019s, France</a> (the possessive is intentional) tells the tale of failed intimacy with an Ariana Grande fan; the lyrics quote <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sfYpolGCu8\" title=\"\">Phoebe Bridgers\u2019s Motion Sickness</a>. The unreleased, but well-gigged Wet Sheets follows a dream Wood\u2019s narrator has about Charli XCX taking a Svengali-like interest in his work. There are songs about fires at science fairs, and feeling out of step with the world. \u201cEverybody\u2019s coming up, I guess I\u2019m late to the party,\u201d notes Wood, several minutes into Opus, another pell-mell eastern Med bop.</p> <p>Manchester audiences in particular appreciate these sorts of well-turned non sequiturs, and the spirit of the Fall lurks just offstage. More obscurely, there is the little-known 90s British outfit <a href=\"https://joeyfat.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">Joeyfat</a>, who originally adapted the Slint sound to a more arch British tone. And BCNR are audibly British \u2013 they hail from Cambridge, largely, and most have known one another since secondary school. \u201cI become her father,\u201d runs one of Wood\u2019s scenarios, \u201cAnd complain of mediocre theatre in the daytime\u201a and ice in single malt whisky at night/ Of rising skirt hems\u201a lowering IQs, and things just aren\u2019t built like they used to be.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThe absolute pinnacle of British engineering!\u201d</p> <p>All these antecedents are moot, however, because the overall feeling at these two excellent gigs \u2013 the first in Yes\u2019s Pink Room, and a second, after-hours set in the basement because the Pink Room sold out very quickly \u2013 resembles that of contemporary London jazz nights out, where a moshpit shouting along to a sax line is standard practice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de50f7227402d42ece3ea94635a7a3b22797b2e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de50f7227402d42ece3ea94635a7a3b22797b2e3/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Country, New Road\u2019s Isaac Wood at Yes, Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Country, New Road\u2019s Isaac Wood at Yes, Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it is, the four men and three women making this racket barely move around, even as crowdsurfers are held aloft by the basement audience. Such is the squeeze that at least four members of BCNR \u2013 violin player Georgia Ellery, bassist Tyler Hyde, guitarist Luke Mark and Wood \u2013 all play side-on to the crowd, their physical limitations adding to the tension. They have two-and-a-half front-people: all the way over to the left, Wood resists the role. It falls to sax player Lewis Evans to provide a focal point. Ellery is at the front too, surveying the crowd coolly. There are cries of \u201cTyler!\u201d \u2013 Hyde, daughter of Underworld\u2019s Karl, studies at Manchester\u2019s art school, while a significant proportion of her bandmates have done time at the Guildhall School in London.</p> <p>These are, ultimately, 21-year-olds making music for other 21-year-olds, for whom genre is a superseded hang-up. Bucking the culture of instant gratification, however, BCNR\u2019s union of styles and emotions works. Irresolute and open-ended, it is somehow triumphal, a full-court press of dread and beauty, positively rewarding close attention and resisting easy analysis. Are you meant to dance, or rend your clothing at the ineffable nihilism of the endless scroll?</p>",

Through the fog, the outline of a violin and the shape of a saxophone are visible; some silhouetted figures stand, some crouch. Eventually, one of the guitarists in BCNR begins intoning something. He builds to a holler and the band plunge into a lacerating workout, drawn mostly from early 90s post-hardcore punk. Beer flies past. Out of the anguish and feedback there eventually emerges the sweetest of melodies, on which violin and sax double up and keyboards provide icy atmospherics. Most of Black Country, New Road\u2019s tracks follow this pattern of resisting pattern, developing over several minutes; breaking down, pulling back together \u2013 a study in tension and release held to account by a fantastically able drummer. While the constituent parts of this mesmerising din are easily picked out \u2013 gnarly math-rock, like that of BCNR\u2019s fellow travellers Black Midi, contemporary classical, jazz, klezmer \u2013 the effrontery of having all this music, all at once, feels genuinely daring. It also feels, thrillingly, like it might even take off this year. Only two singles old, and still considering label options for their forthcoming debut album, BCNR sound both charmingly vestigial and utterly of the moment. Their debut single only came out this time last year but the old band they most patently resemble is Slint, a 90s US outfit whose mysterious, emotional excursions remain a byword for self-effacing intensity, if not large bank balances. There is another bit of backstory. Black Country, New Road is meant to suggest a \u201cgood way out of a bad place\u201d, according to vocalist Isaac Wood. You suspect it refers in part to the demise of their pre-BCNR outfit Nervous Conditions, who disbanded in 2018 after their original singer was accused of sexual assault. Black Country, New Road\u2019s thoughtful, idiosyncratic fusions first gained traction thanks to a tenure at a London pub venue called the Windmill in Brixton, crucible of Fat White Family and many others. (In late December, BCNR joined forces on stage with Black Midi for a Black Midi, New Road special, where the conjoined bands played Wham! and Mariah Carey covers.) Although BCNR are largely instrumental, their coverage thus far has tended to focus on the words of guitarist Wood. When his lyrics are present, they are highly writerly \u2013 full of elliptical narratives and changing perspectives \u2013 but are also studded with trashy pop culture references and curdled tales of bad sex. Wood told one interviewer recently that he was a virgin; an element of playing with the band\u2019s public persona may be at work here. (\u201cFuck me like you mean it this time, Isaac!\u201d runs one of Wood\u2019s lyrics.) The chorus of Sunglasses, their best-known tune, is a perfectly turned Gen-Z rallying cry. \u201cI\u2019m more than adequate!\u201d shouts Wood. \u201cLeave Kanye out of this! Leave your sertraline in the cabinet!\u201d By contrast, Athen\u2019s, France (the possessive is intentional) tells the tale of failed intimacy with an Ariana Grande fan; the lyrics quote Phoebe Bridgers\u2019s Motion Sickness. The unreleased, but well-gigged Wet Sheets follows a dream Wood\u2019s narrator has about Charli XCX taking a Svengali-like interest in his work. There are songs about fires at science fairs, and feeling out of step with the world. \u201cEverybody\u2019s coming up, I guess I\u2019m late to the party,\u201d notes Wood, several minutes into Opus, another pell-mell eastern Med bop. Manchester audiences in particular appreciate these sorts of well-turned non sequiturs, and the spirit of the Fall lurks just offstage. More obscurely, there is the little-known 90s British outfit Joeyfat, who originally adapted the Slint sound to a more arch British tone. And BCNR are audibly British \u2013 they hail from Cambridge, largely, and most have known one another since secondary school. \u201cI become her father,\u201d runs one of Wood\u2019s scenarios, \u201cAnd complain of mediocre theatre in the daytime\u201a and ice in single malt whisky at night/ Of rising skirt hems\u201a lowering IQs, and things just aren\u2019t built like they used to be.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThe absolute pinnacle of British engineering!\u201d All these antecedents are moot, however, because the overall feeling at these two excellent gigs \u2013 the first in Yes\u2019s Pink Room, and a second, after-hours set in the basement because the Pink Room sold out very quickly \u2013 resembles that of contemporary London jazz nights out, where a moshpit shouting along to a sax line is standard practice. As it is, the four men and three women making this racket barely move around, even as crowdsurfers are held aloft by the basement audience. Such is the squeeze that at least four members of BCNR \u2013 violin player Georgia Ellery, bassist Tyler Hyde, guitarist Luke Mark and Wood \u2013 all play side-on to the crowd, their physical limitations adding to the tension. They have two-and-a-half front-people: all the way over to the left, Wood resists the role. It falls to sax player Lewis Evans to provide a focal point. Ellery is at the front too, surveying the crowd coolly. There are cries of \u201cTyler!\u201d \u2013 Hyde, daughter of Underworld\u2019s Karl, studies at Manchester\u2019s art school, while a significant proportion of her bandmates have done time at the Guildhall School in London. These are, ultimately, 21-year-olds making music for other 21-year-olds, for whom genre is a superseded hang-up. Bucking the culture of instant gratification, however, BCNR\u2019s union of styles and emotions works. Irresolute and open-ended, it is somehow triumphal, a full-court press of dread and beauty, positively rewarding close attention and resisting easy analysis. Are you meant to dance, or rend your clothing at the ineffable nihilism of the endless scroll?",

Welcome to another evening of Australian Open tennis as the final third round matches are completed. Absolutely nothing will come close to the carnage and drama of yesterday\u2019s action, which saw Naomi Osaka fall to 15 year old Coco Gauff, Serena Williams upset by Wang Qiang, Stefanos Tsitsipas thoroughly beaten by Milos Raonic before Roger Federer barely survived a 5th set tiebreak against John Millman. However, there are some very interesting matches in store.</p> <p>Rod Laver Arena\u2019s night session will begin with a curious battle between 5th seed Elina Svitolina and two-time slam champion Garbine Muguruza. Muguruza is unseeded after a dire 2019 in which her ranking tumbled and she struggled to find any of the form that propelled her to victories at Roland Garros in 2016 and Wimbledon in 2017. She starts this year with a new coach, 1994 Wimbledon champ Conchita Martinez, and there have been some encouraging signs. This should reveal a lot about where Muguruza\u2019s game is as she looks to return to the top 20 and beyond.</p> <p>Daniil Medvedev will follow against young Australian Alexei Popyrin. After 2019 ended with people certain that a new young slam champion would arrive in the new year, the first events of this new season have been a reality check. Medvedev has probably looked the best and he will be looking to continue his momentum and put himself in the position to compete for the title. Popyrin will have the opportunity to test out his game against a top player and in front of a home crowd. He should relish it.</p> <p>On Margaret Court Arena, 7th seed Alexander Zverev will face 2009 semi-finalist Fernando Verdasco and he will be looking to gain some momentum after a positive first few rounds in Melbourne. 9th seed and perennial dark horse Kiki Bertens will follow against Zarina Diyas.</p> <p>And then there is Melbourne Arena, where Nick Kyrgios returns to his favourite court for a match against Karen Khachanov of Russia. This is, of course, a rematch of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDd--pVW96w\">that match</a> in Cincinnati that lead to Kyrgios being put on probation. But Kyrgios is playing well in Melbourne and he looks comfortable. The Australian has reached only one slam fourth round since 2016 and this seems like a good opportunity to do so again. Let\u2019s see.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-25T07:15:54.445Z\">at 7.15am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Finally, here is Russell Jackson on Nick Kyrgios\u2019 incredible victory. Thanks for following another crazy night finish. Until tomorrow. Another crazy day of tennis comes to an end. Here is our coverage so far: Here is the women\u2019s fourth round draw. Despite six of the top ten players falling over two incredible days, five slam champions remain: Here is the full (and spectacular) men\u2019s fourth round lineup: Finally, Kyrgios on his opponent, Karen Khachanov, who had already won a fifth set tiebreak in his previous round just to make it to Kyrgios: He\u2019s an absolute warrior. He\u2019s a young kid; he\u2019s younger than me by a year so he\u2019s gonna have an unbelievable career. He\u2019s going to be one to do some special things, that\u2019s for sure. But, man, two back to back 4 hours is not easy. He\u2019s an amazing player. He\u2019s won some amazing titles already so it\u2019s the beginning for him. Kyrgios on his physical condition and on recovering after holding match points in the third and fourth tiebreaks: I just landed on my serve and I felt something. I got some physio. But, man, this is epic. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. Honestly, my legs feel about 40 kilos each. I was losing it mentally a little. Obviously it wasn\u2019t easy. Losing the third and the fourth after holding match points. Honestly my support team and you guys just willed me over the line. I thought I was going to lose, honestly. Nick Kyrgios is in total disbelief here, shaking his head side to side with every syllable: Man, it was crazy. I don\u2019t even know what to say right now. That was insane. I\u2019ve got no words for how I\u2019m feeling right now. None of that would have happened without my team - they supported me the whole time. But you guys were unbelievable. Eventually, he stopped speaking and just stared silently at Jim Courier, the interviewer, still shaking his head. Just incredible. Kyrgios started well and led *4-3 in the third set, yet Khachanov fought so impressively to dig out the break and the two tiebreaks. In the end, the only thing that really separated them was Kyrgios\u2019 boldness, reflected in the backhand he drilled down the line at 7-8* in the final set tiebreak to scupper the mini-break before snatching victory. It was so, so difficult, but Kyrgios finally gets the fourth round against Nadal on home soil that he undoubtedly has been craving. Incredible. Kyrgios reaches the fourth round of the Australian Open for the third time. He will face Rafael Nadal. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) 6-6 (*9-8) Karen Khachanov: Match point Kyrgios! Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) 6-6 (8-8*) Karen Khachanov: Astonishing. After a long rally, Kyrgios steps in and crushes a backhand down the line winner to scupper the mini-break. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) 6-6 (7-8*) Karen Khachanov: Khachanov snatches the decisive mini-break with a brilliant crosscourt forehand. He now has two serves to win it! Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) 6-6 (6-6*) Karen Khachanov: Still there is nothing to separate these two. Khachanov crushed a backhand crosscourt to win his fourth consecutive point for *4-3. Kyrgios snatched the mini-break back with a booming forehand crosscourt winner for 4-4. Khachanov edged ahead at 5-4 with a great overhead, but Kyrgios responded with two brilliant serving points for 6-5. At 6-5, the Russian crushed an unreturned serve to level the tiebreak. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) 6-6 (*3-3) Karen Khachanov: All level at the break, After looking like he could run a marathon throughout the regular set, Khachanov opened with two poor errors to hand over the first mini-break. Kyrgios extended his lead to 3-0* with a glorious half-volley drop shot after a serve and volley. Khachanov fought back to 2-3* with two big serves in succession. At 3-2, Kyrgios sent a backhand well wide to hand back the mini-break. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) 6-6 Karen Khachanov: Kyrgios made it clear that he was not going to drop his serve here when he opened the game with a 213kmh second serve ace down the T. He did not. After a fourth love hold in a row, a 10 point tiebreak will decide this great battle. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) *5-6 Karen Khachanov: Khachanov slams down another love hold to inch to within a game of victory again. He has lost only three point on his serve in this set and now Kyrgios has to serve to stay in the match for a second time. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) 5-5* Karen Khachanov: One game away from defeat, Kyrgios puts together one of his best holds of the set. He finished the love hold with a brilliant curling forehand crosscourt winner from behind the baseline, followed by a huge ace out wide. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) *4-5 Karen Khachanov: Khachanov breezes through another love game and he has now won 15 points in a row with huge serving and relentless aggression behind his first shot after the serve. However, he should not have won the 15th point. Kyrgios had two easy opportunities to put the ball away but he instead attempted two tweeners, followed by a dropshot into the net. He went for the highlight reel and failed badly. Now he has to serve to stay in the Australian Open. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) 4-4* Karen Khachanov: Goodness, a huge opportunity missed for the Russian. From 40-0, Khachanov dragged Kyrgios back to deuce and landed his return, only to miss a routine backhand well wide. It was a criminal error on a huge point and he knows it. So does Kyrgios and he made the Russian pay for his mistake, immediately slamming down an ace to hold. 9th seed Kiki Bertens is through. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) *3-4 Karen Khachanov: Karen Khachanov rolls through another love hold and he has now won 11 straight service points. After dispatching an overhead after a brilliant backhand down-the-line at 30-0, he finished with his second ace of the game. This is still extremely tight and could go either way but Khachanov seems to be in the zone right now. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) 3-3* Karen Khachanov: Kyrgios holds quickly to level the final set at 3-3, sealed with two successive aces. Kyrgios is now on 28 aces for the match. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) *2-3 Karen Khachanov: Kyrgios\u2019 service game at 1-2 was certainly an adventure. At 15-0 Khachanov pulled out a successful tweener. After putting away his volley to end the point, the Australian applauded his opponent. When he got to 40-0, Kyrgios joined the fun with an underarm serve that Khachanov easily dispatched. Then at 40-15, Kyrgios walked to the other side of the net to hand the Russian a towel and help him wipe some bird poo off the floor. Finally, he held for 2-2 with a big service winner. No such drama for Khachanov, who quickly held to love for 3-2 with some huge serving. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-7(7) *1-2 Karen Khachanov: Khachanov comes through the first tough hold of the final set, digging himself out of a 15-30 hole after dumping a tired backhand into the net at 15-15. He responded at 15-30 with a big serve and forehand down-the-line winner followed and a nice foray to the net, finishing with a tidy volley winner. With a forehand error from Kyrgios, Khachanov moved ahead 2-1. Danger averted. As that tiebreak was concluding, 4th seed Daniil Medvedev eased into the fourth round with a 6-4 6-3 6-2 win over Alexei Popyrin. The backstage cameras just caught him watching his compatriot on the screens. He faces a tough battle with Stan Wawrinka next. What a nervy, nervy tiebreak that was. Both players wobbled and served poorly on some important points, but Khachanov has been exceptional in the final two sets whenever he has needed to be. A well deserved fifth set for the Russian after some fighting back brilliantly over the past couple of hours. Khachanov may hold the momentum, but Kyrgios is still right there. A tight final set to come. After a long rally, a Kyrgios forehand flies wide to hand over the set. We\u2019re going to five sets! Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-6 (*7-8) Karen Khachanov. After a solid overhead from Khachanov at 5-5, Nick Kyrgios saved set point at 6-5 to with a service winner. At 6-6, Kyrgios swept into the net after a big forehand, dispatching a forehand volley to bring up match point. Kyrgios dumped a backhand passing shot into the net on set point and Khachanov found an ace to bring up a second set point. Nick Kyrgios 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-6 (*4-4) Karen Khachanov. Tense moments. After four points on serve, Kyrgios handed the first mini-break to Khachanov on a platter with a weak double fault for 3-2 to the Russian. The Australian responded well by forcing a forehand error from Khachanov with a solid down-the-line backhand. At 3-3, Kyrgios landed a great backhand down the line return to move up *4-3. Kyrgios then dumped a nervy forehand into the net for 4-4. Khachanov holds serve to force a fourth set tiebreak: Kyrgios leads 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 6-6. Kyrgios did his very best to pressure the Russian, crunching a crosscourt backhand winner for 40-30. However, Khachanov found a huge first serve down the T to hold once more. Both players are playing very well and this will be a tough, tough tiebreak. Kyrgios holds for 6-5* in the fourth set. After a brilliant love hold from Khachanov to keep the pressure on the Aussie\u2019s shoulders, Kyrgios responded with an excellent hold of his own. He closed it out to 15 with a sickly sweet lob, followed by a brilliant service winner that, according to Khachanov\u2019s hawk eye challenge, barely touched the line. Khachanov will serve to stay in the match for a second time. Kyrgios held serve for 5-4* in the fourth set with two spectacular aces, but more notably, the drama has arrived. Early in the game, Kyrgios attempted to finish a brilliant point with a tweener and he failed spectacularly, hurting himself in the process. As Kyrgios looked after his bleeding hand, the umpire didn\u2019t see the injury so he gave Kyrgios a time violation. Cue plenty of arguing and the Australian brandishing his bloody towel and bleeding hand to the umpire. It was clearly a misunderstanding and thankfully Kyrgios returned to the baseline without any further issues. Karen Khachanov levels Nick Kyrgios in the fourth set: 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) *4-4 to Kyrgios. Both men are finally playing well at once and it is quite glorious. With Kyrgios snapping at his heels and desperately attempting to push him to deuce, Khachanov pulled off an exceptional high backhand overhead over his left shoulder to seal the hold at 40-30. Nick Kyrgios saves two break points to edge ahead 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 4-3*. The tension is rising and so is the quality of tennis. Khachanov came up with a miraculous three points - a great forehand return followed by two backhand winners - to bring up two break points. Kyrgios responded with one of his most absurd shots of the tournament. On the first break point, Khachanov crushed a forehand crosscourt, dragging Kyrgios wide. Most players would struggle to deal with the pace of the shot, but not Kyrgios. He used his racquet strings as a cushion and redirected it as perfect drop shot off a 90 miles per hour forehand. Then he banged down a few big serves to hold. Current scores: Rod Laver Arena: Daniil Medvedev leads Alexei Popyrin 6-4 6-3 and is a set from the fourth round. Margaret Court Arena: Kiki Bertens has started brilliantly and is up 6-2 on Zarina Diyas. Melbourne Arena: Nick Kyrgios and Karen Khachanov are still on serve in the fourth set, with the score 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6) 3-2*. Khachanov currently has the trainer out for his right arm. Khachanov deserves so much credit for how he turned the fourth set around. Against an unpredictable, vocal opponent and a crowd cheering hard for his demise, he was down two sets and a break and playing a rancid match. Kyrgios\u2019 concentration may have lapsed a little as the finish line neared but the Russian broke back at 3-4 with three spectacular shots. He then put immense pressure on Kyrgios\u2019 serve in the final game before the tiebreak and he played the big points perfectly on his serve. Momentum is so fickle in tennis and now it is firmly behind him. At the very least he should force Kyrgios to elevate his own game in order to win this match. Karen Khachanov saves match point to push Nick Kyrgios into a fourth set. Kyrgios leads 6-2 7-6(5) 6-7(6). What a topsy-turvy tiebreak that was. Khachanov burst into the lead at *5-3, only for Kyrgios to win three straight points to bring up match point. Khachanov found a big service winner to scupper the match point and then dispatched an awkward overhead to bring up set point. With a wild Kyrgios forehand error, we\u2019re heading to four. Nick Kyrgios and Karen Khachanov are off to another tiebreak: 6-2 7-6(5) 6-6: Goodness, that service game was tough. Kyrgios led 30-0 before being dragged back to 30-30 with a gorgeous Khachanov passing shot. Kyrgios produced a wonderful drop shot at 30-30 and then when he was pushed back to deuce, he came up with a sublime angled drop volley before holding with a booming ace. The tension is building and he is starting to mutter between points and complain, but he responded to the pressure beautifully there. Sascha Zverev is into the second week of a slam without dropping a single set. Considering he is well known for dragging himself into unnecessarily long 5 set matches, this is very notable. After his horrific first week of the year at the ATP Cup, in which he lost three matches and served dozens of double faults, nobody is really talking about Zverev despite the fact that he is clearly playing well. He will face the in-form Andrey Rublev in the fourth round and we will know just how well he is playing if he can come through that tricky encounter. Finally, Khachanov is stepping up and showing what he can do. Out of nowhere the Russian has won three games in a row, including a run of 11 points of 12 to move up 5-4* in the third. Although the Aussie finished with a clownish drop shot into the net, Khachanov broke with an exceptional return game. He crushed a backhand down the line winner, struck a lovely a drop shot winner and then he sent backhand return flying past Kyrgios. Great work. Nick Kyrgios is inching closer to the fourth round. He consolidated the break with a vicious 155kmh forehand down-the-line winner followed by a service winner to hold. Khachanov then threw down a love hold of his own for 6-2 7-6(5) *4-3. Two games away. Nick Kyrgios breaks serve in the third set to move ahead 6-2 7-6(5) *3-2. More accurately, Khachanov just broke himself. A horrendous game from the Russian filled with errors. At 0-30, he shanked a routine backhand wide to give up three break points and then he served his second double fault of the game to hand it over on a platter. One more comment on that violent performance from Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza: Muguruza finished with 84% (21/25) first serves won. 31 winners and 9 unforced errors. 87% (14/16) net points won. 53% receiving points won. In the second set, poor Svitolina hit 10 winners and 8 unforced errors with 72% first serves in. She won two games. Other scores: 7th seed Alexander Zverev leads Fernando Verdasco 6-2 6-2 2-3 on Margaret Court Arena. 4th seed Daniil Medvedev and Alexei Popyrin are just getting started on Rod Laver Arena. The Aussie leads 1-0*. Nick Kyrigos takes an impressive 6-2 7-6(5) lead on Karen Khachanov. In a tiebreak filled with great serving and vicious third shots behind the serve, the outcome was defined by two points: A delicate drop shot from Kyrgios behind his serve at 4-4 and then a long point at 5-5 where Kyrgios remained calm, moved Khachanov from side to side and drew out the error. Kyrgios closed it out with a booming unreturned serve. Extremely mature play from the Aussie to move to within a set of Rafael Nadal. With a 115mph ace out wide, Khachanov sends the second set into a tiebreak with a love hold. The Russian cannot afford to lose this. Nick Kyrgios slams down a couple of huge serves to secure his 10th consecutive point on serve, moving ahead 6-2 6-5*. Khachanov will serve for a second set tiebreak. 2019 was a tough, tough year for Muguruza as she fell out of the top 30 and played far below the standard set in her rise to number one and two slam titles. At the end of the season, she split with her coach and hired Conchita Martinez. Here she has announced her arrival in the season with an astonishing performance. Needless to say, she is a contender for this title. The eternal question with Muguruza is whether she can sustain this level consistently. History tells us that she could destroy the field en route to her third slam title or she could hit 90 errors in the next round and lose badly. Who knows? Over on Melbourne Arena, Khachanov\u2019s level has risen significantly but the set is still on serve. Kyrgios leads 6-2 4-3*. Elina Svitolina\u2019s epic hold turned out to just be a brief distraction. Muguruza immediately returned to hitting winners at will, easing through another hold before breaking with another absurd flurry of winners. Some stats: Muguruza is currently on 28 winners and 8 unforced errors (she had 4 errors until 6-2 3-1). She has won 90% of first serve points (19/21). She is on 87% for net points (13/15). She has captured 54% (28/52) of return points. This may just be the performance of the week. 6-1 5-2. Elina Svitolina hasn\u2019t been able to do much today because she has simply been hit off the court, but she just pulled out an astonishing hold. In an endless deuce game at 6-1 3-1, Muguruza generated 5 break points. Svitolina saved the break points with 2 backhand winners, 2 forehand winners and 1 point ending forehand. She is far from the biggest hitter, but with her back to the wall she hit out like her life depended on it. This level from Garbine Muguruza is quite incredible. She nabbed the first break at 1-1 with a touch of pure genius, dinking a delicate defensive lob over Svitolina\u2019s head during a long point before eventually finishing with an even lovelier dropshot winner. She is now prowling at 6-1 3-1*, pounding the ball and looking for a second break. Nick Kyrgios saves break point to hold for 6-2 2-1*. That was Khachanov\u2019s first proper assault on Kyrgios\u2019 serve, taking advantage of a couple of missed first serves to generate his first break point at 30-40. How did Kyrgios respond? He threw in a serve and volley, producing two sweet backhand volleys to scupper the break point. With some great serving, he pulled out a really good hold. One of the most impressive things about Garbine Muguruza\u2019s game is her constant willingness to move forward to the net and finish points in the forecourt. This is an era where most players only go to the net to shake hands and she is far from a natural at the net, but she always puts herself in the position to make volleys and she is often successful there. She just hit an absolutely gorgeous drop volley to hold for 6-1 1-1*. Nick Kyrgios is flowing right now. With a lovely drop shot to lob combination followed by a blinding ace down the T, Kyrgios holds for 6-2 1-0*. This match could get away from Khachanov very quickly if he isn\u2019t careful here. Nick Kyrgios nabs a second break to take the first set 6-2 on Karen Khachanov. Kyrgios may still be wincing and walking gingerly between points, but after the medical timeout, he was consistent and he moved pretty well as he soaked up Khachanov\u2019s immense pace. Across the net, Khachanov\u2019s rhythm may have been arrested by the injury break but he is just making life hard for himself in general. Too many wild unforced errors today and his level in the first set wasn\u2019t good enough. Alexander Zverev is also cruising. He leads Fernando Verdasco *4-1 with a double break. Over on Rod Laver Arena, the big question was going into this match was what level Muguruza is currently playing at. It\u2019s fair to say that the level is fairly high! She just completely obliterated the fifth seed Svitolina 6-1 in the opening set. The Spaniard lost only 1 point on her first serve, crushing 11 winners with only 3(!) unforced errors. She has been relentlessly aggressive, smashing her backhand and moving into the net whenever she can. It is pleasing to see Muguruza looking like the two-time slam champion and world number one she is. Nick Kyrgios grinds out a hold to consolidate his break for 5-2*, but he has called the trainer and is struggling with his left hamstring. The Australian was grimacing and looked far more preoccupied with his hamstring as he was dragged to deuce. With a burst of energy he spectacularly salvaged the service game, crushing a brilliant running crosscourt forehand at deuce and then dismounting with a slick angled dropshot. The trainer is on and he is now having a medical timeout. Nick Kyrgios makes the first move on Melbourne Arena, breaking Khachanov for *4-2. Sloppy play from the Russian who dumped a forehand into the net at deuce. The break point was a long, cagey and slow rally until Kyrgios changed it up with a drop shot. The drop shot wasn\u2019t great, but the Russian chased it down and sent his backhand well long. John Isner retires down 6-4 *4-1 to Stan Wawrinka, sending the Swiss through to the fourth round. No confirmation on the injury but Isner was in long discussion with the doctor after falling down a double break. Nick Kyrgios just smashed down 3 aces to hold for 2-1 in 46 seconds. The crowd is already rowdy, the Aussie\u2019s arm is already firing. We\u2019re in for a good one. Garbine Muguruza and Elina Svitolina are also starting now. This head-to-head is a lot more extensive, with Svitolina leading 6-4. Muguruza won their last meeting in Wuhan last year, with Svitolina leading 2-1 in 2019. This match up is also clearer. Muguruza will be the player hitting with more risks, controlling the points and moving forward to finish points as quickly as she can. The big question is how many unforced errors Svitolina\u2019s stellar defence can draw from her. Nick Kyrgios and Karen Khachanov are on court. They have only faced each other once before, in that infamous Cincinnati match the Russian eventually won 6-7(3) 7-6(4) 6-2. It is difficult to take much from that match, except that Khachanov showed impressive focus to see out the win with so many distractions. There is little doubt that this match will rest on who serves best. In the rallies, Kyrgios will look to disrupt Khachanov at every opportunity with his variety and unpredictability. Kyrgios arrives in better form after two solid performances. By contrast, Khachanov barely survived No 78 Mikael Ymer in a final set tiebreak on Thursday. Let\u2019s see. Over on Court 3, 15th seed Stan Wawrinka is up 5-3* on 19th seed John Isner. There were rumors today that Wawrinka would under the weather but so far so good for the Swiss. So what has happened so far today? The women have continued yesterday\u2019s run of top 10 defeats with two further top 10 upsets. 2nd seed Karolina Pliskova was ousted 7-6(4) 7-6(3) by the talented and seasoned Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, seeded 30th. 6th seed Belinda Bencic, who memorably reached the US Open semis last year after upsetting defending champion Naomi Osaka, was destroyed by a zoning Anett Kontaveit 6-0 6-1 in just 49 minutes. Simona Halep and Angelique Kerber had no such problems and happily moved into the fourth round. In the men\u2019s draw, Rafael Nadal eased past Pablo Carreno Busta 6-1 6-2 6-4 and Dominic Thiem came through a potentially tricky four set match against Taylor Fritz of the United States. The in-form Andrey Rublev, seeded 17th, marched on after beating 11th seed David Goffin. 10th seed Gael Monfils saw off Ernests Gulbis in straight sets. Hello! Welcome to another evening of Australian Open tennis as the final third round matches are completed. Absolutely nothing will come close to the carnage and drama of yesterday\u2019s action, which saw Naomi Osaka fall to 15 year old Coco Gauff, Serena Williams upset by Wang Qiang, Stefanos Tsitsipas thoroughly beaten by Milos Raonic before Roger Federer barely survived a 5th set tiebreak against John Millman. However, there are some very interesting matches in store. Rod Laver Arena\u2019s night session will begin with a curious battle between 5th seed Elina Svitolina and two-time slam champion Garbine Muguruza. Muguruza is unseeded after a dire 2019 in which her ranking tumbled and she struggled to find any of the form that propelled her to victories at Roland Garros in 2016 and Wimbledon in 2017. She starts this year with a new coach, 1994 Wimbledon champ Conchita Martinez, and there have been some encouraging signs. This should reveal a lot about where Muguruza\u2019s game is as she looks to return to the top 20 and beyond. Daniil Medvedev will follow against young Australian Alexei Popyrin. After 2019 ended with people certain that a new young slam champion would arrive in the new year, the first events of this new season have been a reality check. Medvedev has probably looked the best and he will be looking to continue his momentum and put himself in the position to compete for the title. Popyrin will have the opportunity to test out his game against a top player and in front of a home crowd. He should relish it. On Margaret Court Arena, 7th seed Alexander Zverev will face 2009 semi-finalist Fernando Verdasco and he will be looking to gain some momentum after a positive first few rounds in Melbourne. 9th seed and perennial dark horse Kiki Bertens will follow against Zarina Diyas. And then there is Melbourne Arena, where Nick Kyrgios returns to his favourite court for a match against Karen Khachanov of Russia. This is, of course, a rematch of that match in Cincinnati that lead to Kyrgios being put on probation. But Kyrgios is playing well in Melbourne and he looks comfortable. The Australian has reached only one slam fourth round since 2016 and this seems like a good opportunity to do so again. Let\u2019s see.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson \u201creiterated the need\u201d for the suspect charged with causing the death of Harry Dunn to return to the UK during a phone call with Donald Trump, according to a Downing Street spokeswoman. Dunn, 19, died after a crash outside a US military base in Croughton, Northamptonshire, on 27 August 2019. Anne Sacoolas was charged with causing his death by dangerous driving in December but she left the UK days later when the US government claimed she had diplomatic immunity. Sacoolas is the wife of an intelligence officer who was based in Croughton, and the issue has ignited international controversy. The US informed the Home Office late on Thursday that it had rejected the extradition request, a decision which has been condemned by politicians and Dunn\u2019s grieving family. In a phone call with the US president on Friday, the prime minister raised the topic and spoke of the need to secure justice for the teenager\u2019s family. \u201cHe reiterated the need for the individual involved to return to the UK,\u201d a Downing Street spokeswoman said. Andrea Leadsom, who is the constituency MP for the Dunn family, held talks on Friday with the US ambassador to Britain, Woody Johnson, the commander of RAF Croughton, Col Bridget McNamara, and the chief constable of Northamptonshire police. She also met Dunn\u2019s family on Friday, the day after she had informed them of the US secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u2019s decision to refuse the extradition request. Leadsom said she had expressed her disappointment on their behalf during the talks with the US ambassador. She said the prime minister was \u201cvery much on the side of the family in their desire to see justice done\u201d. Leadsom said: \u201cAll of us in government are working to that end.\u201d A spokesman for the US state department said the request had been rejected because it would nullify the invocation of diplomatic immunity and set an extraordinarily troubling precedent. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said the move \u201camounts to a denial of justice\u201d. The Foreign Office maintains the suspect had diplomatic immunity, which has been disputed by the family, but Raab said he would look to \u201cresolve the issue\u201d surrounding any immunity given to staff at the RAF Croughton base. Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, has vowed to keep fighting for justice despite Pompeo\u2019s decision. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter when, whether it\u2019s this administration or the next.

      "bodyText": "The villagers walk down the grassy landing strip, past the wooden hut housing the health post and into the thick forest, pointing out the seedlings they planted along the way. For these Ye\u2019kwana indigenous men, the skinny saplings, less than a metre high, aren\u2019t just baby cacao trees but green shoots of hope in a land scarred by the violence, pollution and destruction wrought by illegal gold prospecting. That hope is chocolate. \u201cWe want to plant and develop income for the community,\u201d says J\u00falio Ye\u2019kwana, 39, president of the Ye\u2019kwana people\u2019s Wanasseduume association, which came up with the idea. \u201cAnd it is not destructive for the forest.\u201d In the last two years, thousands of Theobroma cacao trees have been planted near Waik\u00e1s and other villages in the remote Yanomami indigenous reserve. The saplings were planted within the forest because cacao likes shade, an idea borrowed from agroforestry techniques successfully used for cacao elsewhere in the Amazon. Villagers hope that within a few years rich, organic chocolate will be produced from the golden cacao fruit these trees bear. The project \u2013 run by the reserve\u2019s indigenous associations Wanasseduume and Hutukara with Brazilian non-profit group Instituto Socioambiental (ISA) \u2013 is ambitious, but experts say it is based on a potential commercial reality. Located in the far north of the Brazilian Amazon, Yanomami is Brazil\u2019s biggest indigenous reserve, spread over 9.6 million hectares (23.7m acres). But its wild, mountainous forests are overrun by an estimated 20,000 wildcat goldminers, called garimpeiros. Ye\u2019kwana and Yanomami indigenous leaders called for the garimpeiros to be expelled with a letter and group photo later shared by actor Leonardo DiCaprio. But the country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has claimed that indigenous people really yearn for white society\u2019s consumer lifestyles, said the Yanomami reserve is too big for its population and may be sued for racism by the Brazilian Indigenous People\u2019s Association after comments during a Facebook Live broadcast this week. \u201cThe indigenous changed, they are evolving,\u201d he said. \u201cIndigenous are increasingly becoming human beings just like us.\u201d \u201cThe president says indigenous people are poor. We are not poor. Nobody goes hungry here,\u201d says J\u00falio Ye\u2019kwana. \u201cWe eat for free.\u201d The Guardian was invited to visit by the Hutukara Yanomami Association, founded by Davi Kopenawa, a leader and shaman who fought to create the reserve with photographer Claudia Andujar and non-profit group Survival International. Five villages from both tribes are participating in the cacao project. Cacao trees are native in this area, but around 3,000 new seedlings have been planted to boost production, with 7,000 expected by the end of 2021. Edmilson Estev\u00e3o shins up a mature cacao tree to bring down some of the heavy yellow fruit. Inside each thick shell is a sticky cluster of seeds, packed in a sweet, delicious, pale paste. These are dried and roasted to make chocolate. \u201cOne tree like this can bear up to 20 fruit,\u201d says Estev\u00e3o, 33, who was raised in Waik\u00e1s and works for Wanasseduume. These mature trees were planted more than a decade ago by Luiz Ye\u2019kwana. He was murdered by garimpeiros after refusing to transport them upriver, villagers say. Violence is a recurrent problem around garimpeiros, as becomes graphically evident the next day. Outside the health post, two garimpeiros are wrapping a dead body in a tarpaulin. The dead man was known as Eduardo at Tatuz\u00e3o, the illegal gold mining camp two hours\u2019 boat ride upstream. But everybody uses an alias there. The nurse who fought to save his life discovered that his real name was Ralf Cabral and he was 21. The garimpeiros say he shot himself. His eyes are wide open, he is dressed in black football shorts, and there is a bandage over the bullet hole in his chest. \u201cHe\u2019s been here for five months, and now he\u2019s done this,\u201d says Manoel dos Santos, 49, wrapping Cabral\u2019s body. \u201cI have no idea why.\u201d The health post was built by the Brazilian government to serve the village\u2019s 150 Ye\u2019kwana people, but also handles hundreds of garimpeiro cases each year, including miscarriages, malaria, snake bites, broken limbs, knife and gunshot wounds. \u201cIt\u2019s a war here,\u201d says Giselle Dornellas, 33, the nurse who kept Cabral alive for 12 hours. Garimpo gold is seductive and buys televisions and phones. Four villagers work as boat pilots, others deliver food, and even the village community centre was built with garimpo money. But the cacao project will offer an alternative, says its coordinator, ISA anthropologist Moreno Saraiva. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build another possible future,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will take five years, but if we don\u2019t do this now there will never be another alternative.\u201d The project was inspired by another ISA project that since 2016 has produced edible mushrooms in other Yanomami villages. On paper the cacao project makes sense. Most of the world\u2019s cacao production is in Africa, but the plant is native to the Amazon and was domesticated in South America 4,000 years ago. The Aztecs used the beans as money. And a Spanish map from 1775 called the Yanomami area the \u201cPais de los cacaguales\u201d \u2013 or \u201cCacao Land\u201d. \u201cYou have a traditional and well-spread presence of native cocoa trees,\u201d says food researcher Roberto Smeraldi, vice-president of the At\u00e1 Institute founded by Alex Atala \u2013 the Michelin starred Brazilian chef renowned for using ingredients from the Amazon. Smeraldi recruited C\u00e9sar de Mendes, a chocolate specialist based near the Amazon city of Bel\u00e9m for the cacao project. ISA and the indigenous associations organised well-attended workshops with de Mendes in Waik\u00e1s in 2018 and 2019 to show villagers how cacao seeds are processed to make chocolate. Fruit from mature Yanomami cacao trees was used to produce a trial run. A thousand 50g bars of the bitter, delicious Yanomami chocolate quickly sold out at an event in S\u00e3o Paulo last December, despite a \u00a39.20 price tag. Customers were happy to pay to compensate for the destruction caused by garimpo, de Mendes says. Profits went to both indigenous associations. \u201cI am not being much of a businessman, I am being more an activist,\u201d de Mendes says. \u201cWe are selling to an aware public.\u201d He learned his trade from his grandmother, who made her own chocolate in an Amazon riverside community, and singles out the Yanomami chocolate\u2019s notes of almond oil and flowers, light acidity and sweetness. \u201cThese give this cacao its own personality,\u201d he says. Smeraldi argues that the Yanomami cacao\u2019s origins in this isolated jungle could make its genetic properties attractive to the world cacao industry, which is vulnerable to climate change and blights such as the witches\u2019 broom fungus which ravaged cacao plantations in the state of Bahia three decades ago. And the chocolate\u2019s strong, persistent taste could find its niche in the booming, specialist chocolate market, he says. Distinct fruits and flavours are increasingly sought out, as happened with wine when customers graduated from ordering \u201cred\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d to specific grapes and countries. \u201cIt is a product of high complexity,\u201d Smeraldi says. According to a report from Research and Markets, the global premium chocolate market is growing at nearly 10% a year, and demand for organic, dark and \u201cclean label\u201d chocolate is a key market trend. In Ecuador, Kichwa indigenous people have been producing their own organic Kallari chocolate, sold worldwide, since 2007. But Bolsonaro\u2019s government is heading in the opposite direction.

      "body": "<p>Sweltering heat, a crowded Manhattan tenement of people failing to mind each other\u2019s business, Kurt Weill\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.operanorth.co.uk/whats-on/street-scene/\" title=\"\">Street Scene</a></strong> (1946) bristles with discontent. Opera North\u2019s new production \u2013 the company\u2019s latest foray into musical theatre in general, Weill in particular \u2013 arrests from the start, holding its grip to the last. This isn\u2019t always the case with this sprawling \u201cBroadway opera\u201d, which dates, self-evidently, from Weill\u2019s period in American exile.</p> <p>In those years, from 1935 until his death in 1950, the German composer became as fervent a New Yorker as he had been a Berliner. <em>Street Scene</em>\u2019s amalgam of rich, often guttural and jazzy orchestration, natural-voice singing that teeters on operatic, and a populous ensemble cast \u2013 some 30 named roles \u2013 challenges anyone trying to stage it. The story, of immigration old and new, social hardship and stale love, can lose focus. Impassioned aria and slick jitterbug sit alongside like lion and lamb.</p> <p>That range of musical expression, persuasively conducted by the Weill expert James Holmes, is part of the work\u2019s appeal. The versatile orchestra of Opera North sounds as at home in the work\u2019s bluesy, operatic sonorities as in Wagner or Mozart. Matthew Eberhardt, who notched up a memorable success with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/15/osud-trouble-in-tahiti-review-opera-north-mariinsky-orchestra-valery-gergiev-cadogan-hall\" title=\"\">Trouble in Tahiti</a></em> in Opera North\u2019s 2017 Little Greats series, comes close to solving many of the work\u2019s problems. First, the dramatic hierarchy of characters is laid out deftly. With six families, several children (outstanding in their chorus, Catch Me If You Can), and many cameos, we know exactly who to watch, who to fear. Francis O\u2019Connor\u2019s sets (lighting by Howard Hudson) feature a staircase, doors and landings, providing fluidity of movement as well as a sense of imprisonment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This fiery young Russian directs from the harpsichord, crouched and compact like a champion jockey</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Among the work\u2019s standout numbers, Lonely House was beautifully delivered by the tenor Alex Banfield playing Sam Kaplan, the young Jewish trainee lawyer in love with Rose Maurrant (in an excellent, nuanced performance by Gillene Butterfield). These two singers belong to Opera North\u2019s chorus, whose skilful members between them take on the ensemble roles.</p> <p>Two company regulars, the soprano Giselle Allen and the bass-baritone Robert Hayward \u2013 last seen together in <em>Tosca</em> in 2018 \u2013 play the central couple, Anna and Frank Maurrant. When Hayward, always thoughtful and probing, sang Let Things Be Like They Always Was, he conveyed a regret that resonates beyond the slim offerings of the text (Elmer Rice\u2019s book for <em>Street Scene</em> is based on his 1929 play, with lyrics by Langston Hughes).</p> <p>Allen, too, hinted at greater complexities than apparent on paper, as the wife craving love who turns elsewhere and suffers fatally. Christopher Turner as the Italian Lippo Fiorentino led a cheerful Ice Cream chorus, and Rodney Vubya and Michelle Andrews, trained in musical theatre, mustered a lively, jitterbugging Moon Faced, Starry Eyed. That song has been stuck in my head all week, though as yet the footwork has eluded me. Catch <em>Street Scene </em>in Leeds, or on tour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea934ba05b5ddeff75aa72a7e8e28fc1ef9cd2e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea934ba05b5ddeff75aa72a7e8e28fc1ef9cd2e1/0_114_3543_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rodney Vubya and Michelle Andrews in Street Scene.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rodney Vubya and Michelle Andrews in Street Scene.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Clive Barda/ArenaPAL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <strong>Scottish Chamber Orchestra</strong>\u2019s first \u201cbaroque week\u201d with its new principal conductor and harpsichordist extraordinaire, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PvjTUJf2sI&amp;feature=emb_title\" title=\"\">Maxim Emelyanychev</a>, also set feet tapping. The focus was on dance, by Lully, Telemann, Rameau and Bach, and its cultural importance in the 17th and 18th centuries. None of the repertoire, except Bach\u2019s Suite No 4 in D, was especially familiar, but Emelyanychev teased his audience into appreciating the wit and invention of this music. This fiery young Russian directs from the harpsichord, crouched and compact like a champion jockey, occasionally racing a whip-arm in encouragement or restraint.</p> <p>Telemann\u2019s \u201cAlster\u201d suite, with its four belching horns and a crazed, sour-tuned \u201cconcerto of frogs and crows\u201d, highlighted the anarchic tendencies of a composer sometimes thought dull. Trumpets fanfare the start (Bach) and the end (Rameau\u2019s <em>Les Indes Galantes</em> suite). In between, Lully\u2019s music for Moli\u00e8re\u2019s <em>Le Bourgeois gentilhomme</em>, first presented at the court of Louis XIV in 1670, supplied pomp and exuberance. How the Sun King must have enjoyed that Turkish march that ends the suite, complete with a madly dinging percussion instrument like a hat-stand with bells on (called a Turkish crescent, or a <a href=\"https://www.rct.uk/collection/74399/turkish-crescent\" title=\"\">jingling Johnny</a>).</p> <p>If that wasn\u2019t enough, in the interval Emelyanychev stood among the crowd, playing a cornett and leading a handful of his brilliant musicians in two more dances: a pavan (by Thoinot Arbeau) and an anonymous tourdion, a drummer beating a processional pulse. This combination of bodhr\u00e1n-style drum and dotted rhythms sounded as much like Scottish folk as French baroque. \u201cYou can dance,\u201d invited Maxim, removing the cornett from his mouth between notes with just time to utter the words. The audience started swaying. All seemed set for a ceilidh. Wild things are in store for this orchestra and its charismatic conductor, whose contract has already been extended to 2025. Don\u2019t miss him, or them.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PvjTUJf2sI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3PvjTUJf2sI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PvjTUJf2sI\">Watch the SCO\u2019s Introducing Maxim Emelyanychev video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Street Scene </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<em><br>SCO/Emelyanychev </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.operanorth.co.uk/whats-on/street-scene/\">Street Scene</a> is at Leeds Grand theatre until 28 February, then touring to Newcastle, Salford Quays and Nottingham until 20 March</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Sweltering heat, a crowded Manhattan tenement of people failing to mind each other\u2019s business, Kurt Weill\u2019s Street Scene (1946) bristles with discontent. Opera North\u2019s new production \u2013 the company\u2019s latest foray into musical theatre in general, Weill in particular \u2013 arrests from the start, holding its grip to the last. This isn\u2019t always the case with this sprawling \u201cBroadway opera\u201d, which dates, self-evidently, from Weill\u2019s period in American exile. In those years, from 1935 until his death in 1950, the German composer became as fervent a New Yorker as he had been a Berliner. Street Scene\u2019s amalgam of rich, often guttural and jazzy orchestration, natural-voice singing that teeters on operatic, and a populous ensemble cast \u2013 some 30 named roles \u2013 challenges anyone trying to stage it. The story, of immigration old and new, social hardship and stale love, can lose focus. Impassioned aria and slick jitterbug sit alongside like lion and lamb. That range of musical expression, persuasively conducted by the Weill expert James Holmes, is part of the work\u2019s appeal. The versatile orchestra of Opera North sounds as at home in the work\u2019s bluesy, operatic sonorities as in Wagner or Mozart. Matthew Eberhardt, who notched up a memorable success with Trouble in Tahiti in Opera North\u2019s 2017 Little Greats series, comes close to solving many of the work\u2019s problems. First, the dramatic hierarchy of characters is laid out deftly. With six families, several children (outstanding in their chorus, Catch Me If You Can), and many cameos, we know exactly who to watch, who to fear. Francis O\u2019Connor\u2019s sets (lighting by Howard Hudson) feature a staircase, doors and landings, providing fluidity of movement as well as a sense of imprisonment. Among the work\u2019s standout numbers, Lonely House was beautifully delivered by the tenor Alex Banfield playing Sam Kaplan, the young Jewish trainee lawyer in love with Rose Maurrant (in an excellent, nuanced performance by Gillene Butterfield). These two singers belong to Opera North\u2019s chorus, whose skilful members between them take on the ensemble roles. Two company regulars, the soprano Giselle Allen and the bass-baritone Robert Hayward \u2013 last seen together in Tosca in 2018 \u2013 play the central couple, Anna and Frank Maurrant. When Hayward, always thoughtful and probing, sang Let Things Be Like They Always Was, he conveyed a regret that resonates beyond the slim offerings of the text (Elmer Rice\u2019s book for Street Scene is based on his 1929 play, with lyrics by Langston Hughes). Allen, too, hinted at greater complexities than apparent on paper, as the wife craving love who turns elsewhere and suffers fatally. Christopher Turner as the Italian Lippo Fiorentino led a cheerful Ice Cream chorus, and Rodney Vubya and Michelle Andrews, trained in musical theatre, mustered a lively, jitterbugging Moon Faced, Starry Eyed. That song has been stuck in my head all week, though as yet the footwork has eluded me. Catch Street Scene in Leeds, or on tour. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra\u2019s first \u201cbaroque week\u201d with its new principal conductor and harpsichordist extraordinaire, Maxim Emelyanychev, also set feet tapping. The focus was on dance, by Lully, Telemann, Rameau and Bach, and its cultural importance in the 17th and 18th centuries. None of the repertoire, except Bach\u2019s Suite No 4 in D, was especially familiar, but Emelyanychev teased his audience into appreciating the wit and invention of this music. This fiery young Russian directs from the harpsichord, crouched and compact like a champion jockey, occasionally racing a whip-arm in encouragement or restraint. Telemann\u2019s \u201cAlster\u201d suite, with its four belching horns and a crazed, sour-tuned \u201cconcerto of frogs and crows\u201d, highlighted the anarchic tendencies of a composer sometimes thought dull. Trumpets fanfare the start (Bach) and the end (Rameau\u2019s Les Indes Galantes suite). In between, Lully\u2019s music for Moli\u00e8re\u2019s Le Bourgeois gentilhomme, first presented at the court of Louis XIV in 1670, supplied pomp and exuberance. How the Sun King must have enjoyed that Turkish march that ends the suite, complete with a madly dinging percussion instrument like a hat-stand with bells on (called a Turkish crescent, or a jingling Johnny). If that wasn\u2019t enough, in the interval Emelyanychev stood among the crowd, playing a cornett and leading a handful of his brilliant musicians in two more dances: a pavan (by Thoinot Arbeau) and an anonymous tourdion, a drummer beating a processional pulse. This combination of bodhr\u00e1n-style drum and dotted rhythms sounded as much like Scottish folk as French baroque. \u201cYou can dance,\u201d invited Maxim, removing the cornett from his mouth between notes with just time to utter the words. The audience started swaying. All seemed set for a ceilidh. Wild things are in store for this orchestra and its charismatic conductor, whose contract has already been extended to 2025. Don\u2019t miss him, or them. Star ratings (out of five) Street Scene \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 SCO/Emelyanychev \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Street Scene is at Leeds Grand theatre until 28 February, then touring to Newcastle, Salford Quays and Nottingham until 20 March",

It\u2019s an opportunity to feel it, to smell it, to taste it. What would it look like if that was us every Sunday?\u201d</p> <p>In 2018 the FA opened bidding for places in the fully professional Women\u2019s Super League and semi-professional Championship, and there were hopes that the chance to jump in towards the top would prompt big clubs, and specifically Manchester United, to join the increasingly profitable and marketable game.</p> <p>Like United, Southampton had scrapped their women\u2019s team in 2005, though in their case it coincided with the relegation of the men\u2019s team from the Premier League. Both relaunched a senior side for the 2018-19 season and bid for the Championship. United were granted a licence by the FA that meant they flew straight into the second tier. But Southampton missed out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/24/manchester-united-manchester-city-women\">Mary Earps a big noise as Manchester United prepare for City showdown | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some speculated over whether the will to stick to their club\u2019s launch would still be there should they have to climb from the fifth tier, but just after they were deemed to have not met the entry criteria for the Championship, they appointed the former England international Spacey-Cale as manager. Poaching the 91-capped forward from the FA was a statement move.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I came in we had just lost the opportunity for a licence,\u201d she says. \u201cThe club did appeal, but they were straight away saying that whatever happens we want to have this programme, we want a successful women\u2019s team as part of Southampton football club.\u201d </p> <p>Like United, in their first season Southampton FC won promotion \u2013 and they are on course for another, as they are unbeaten in the National League Division One, South West. \u201cFor me, there was never any scepticism and even if there was then that\u2019s certainly in the past, because what the club has done shows how much they support what we want to achieve here,\u201d Spacey-Cale says of the perception that some clubs may be frustrated at their entry as big-spenders in the lower leagues.</p> <p>\u201cOther clubs have gone through this. When there wasn\u2019t a lot of money for the women\u2019s game, other clubs have shut down teams and now they\u2019re coming back. Charlton are back in the Championship, Fulham have a team again, Man United did, and are now in the WSL.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that you can\u2019t control but you can look to the future and be positive about it.

We want to feel that every week next year, so promotion is key. And now we\u2019ve got an opportunity to go up a level and play a team that got promoted out of that last year.\u201d</p> <p>Closest to Southampton FC in the league, confusingly, are another Southampton team \u2013 Southampton Women\u2019s FC, who are eight-times FA Cup winners and have also reached the last 32 of the competition. They play against the Championship side Crystal Palace on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s great is that the two teams from Southampton are showing what Hampshire is all about,\u201d says Spacey-Cale diplomatically. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic hotbed of talent for women\u2019s football. Our aim is to be promoted, and to do that we have to win the league. It\u2019s one team that goes up, so that\u2019s our aim.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When fourth-tier Southampton FC welcome Championship side Coventry United to St Mary\u2019s in the FA Cup on Sunday they will get a taste of the professionalism they are aiming for. \u201cThis challenge is a huge part of our learning,\u201d says their manager, Marieanne Spacey-Cale. \u201cThe physicality of a Super League or Championship team gives us a chance to test where we are. It\u2019s an opportunity to feel it, to smell it, to taste it. What would it look like if that was us every Sunday?\u201d In 2018 the FA opened bidding for places in the fully professional Women\u2019s Super League and semi-professional Championship, and there were hopes that the chance to jump in towards the top would prompt big clubs, and specifically Manchester United, to join the increasingly profitable and marketable game. Like United, Southampton had scrapped their women\u2019s team in 2005, though in their case it coincided with the relegation of the men\u2019s team from the Premier League. Both relaunched a senior side for the 2018-19 season and bid for the Championship. United were granted a licence by the FA that meant they flew straight into the second tier. But Southampton missed out. Some speculated over whether the will to stick to their club\u2019s launch would still be there should they have to climb from the fifth tier, but just after they were deemed to have not met the entry criteria for the Championship, they appointed the former England international Spacey-Cale as manager. Poaching the 91-capped forward from the FA was a statement move. \u201cWhen I came in we had just lost the opportunity for a licence,\u201d she says. \u201cThe club did appeal, but they were straight away saying that whatever happens we want to have this programme, we want a successful women\u2019s team as part of Southampton football club.\u201d Like United, in their first season Southampton FC won promotion \u2013 and they are on course for another, as they are unbeaten in the National League Division One, South West. \u201cFor me, there was never any scepticism and even if there was then that\u2019s certainly in the past, because what the club has done shows how much they support what we want to achieve here,\u201d Spacey-Cale says of the perception that some clubs may be frustrated at their entry as big-spenders in the lower leagues. \u201cOther clubs have gone through this. When there wasn\u2019t a lot of money for the women\u2019s game, other clubs have shut down teams and now they\u2019re coming back. Charlton are back in the Championship, Fulham have a team again, Man United did, and are now in the WSL. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation that you can\u2019t control but you can look to the future and be positive about it. There\u2019s an appetite for the women\u2019s game now and we want to be a part of that now and for the future.\u201d On arrival, Spacey-Cale was given a \u201cblank piece of paper\u201d to mould Southampton FC\u2019s new programme. \u201cI\u2019m a very positive person so if I didn\u2019t believe we had an opportunity to climb through the leagues then I might not be sitting here today,\u201d says the 53-year-old. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a young squad, a tier one Regional Talent Club that is transitioning players through from the under-16s to the development squad and some into the first team, so we\u2019ve got real clear pathways and not having a Championship licence has given us the opportunity to build that. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got a real sustainable pathway fully supported by the club that says that you can come into Southampton as a nine-year-old and hopefully one day be playing in the Super League.\u201d Continuing their FA Cup run would be a bonus, but the focus is on the league and getting to a position where they, like Coventry United and other tier one and two clubs, are entering at the fourth round instead of battling their way to it. \u201cTier three we\u2019ve played and beaten in the last couple of rounds. We want to feel that every week next year, so promotion is key. And now we\u2019ve got an opportunity to go up a level and play a team that got promoted out of that last year.\u201d Closest to Southampton FC in the league, confusingly, are another Southampton team \u2013 Southampton Women\u2019s FC, who are eight-times FA Cup winners and have also reached the last 32 of the competition. They play against the Championship side Crystal Palace on Sunday. \u201cWhat\u2019s great is that the two teams from Southampton are showing what Hampshire is all about,\u201d says Spacey-Cale diplomatically. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic hotbed of talent for women\u2019s football. Our aim is to be promoted, and to do that we have to win the league. It\u2019s one team that goes up, so that\u2019s our aim.\u201d",

In the <strong>A-League</strong>, Brisbane visit Central Coast later this afternoon before high-flying Melbourne City tackle Perth. And in the <strong>W-League</strong>, Adelaide United host Western Sydney tonight. So, yeah, we have a full plate of sporting action on which to gorge. Have something to say?

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll leave it there therefore for Sportwatch - thanks as always for your company. A great result in the W-League for Adelaide, who booked their first win of the season against the high-flying Wanderers, which was perhaps the chief upset of the day. In the Big Bash the Stars had a worrying capitulation under the forensic Heat of Brisbane, for whom AB de Villiers finally put on the masterclass we all know he\u2019s capable of producing. Steve Smith edged the battle of the Runout-Gate protagonists once again, with his 66* seeing home the Sixers, despite Aaron Finch\u2019s 109 off 68 seven-six innings for the Renegades. Just one goal in 180 minutes of A-League action, but in the context of the season, how crucial could Corey Brown\u2019s deflected effort prove for the Roar and the Mariners\u2019 respective seasons? It\u2019s the former who pinch the points in Gosford, while Melbourne City and Perth\u2019s draw does nobody any favours except for runaway ladder leaders Sydney in the battle of second v third. And that\u2019s Sportwatch! Until tomorrow. Hug your children. So that\u2019s the end of the A-League, W-League, Big Bash and sundry. It\u2019s very delicately poised over at the Australian Open where Karen Khachanov is battling deep in the forth to stay alive against Nick Kyrgios. Don\u2019t miss a second of that one - here, on our dedicated Australian Open liveblog: A huge 10-15 minutes coming up in the career of one Nick Kyrgios, you\u2019d imagine - with a potential date with Rafael Nadal awaiting the winner of this match. It\u2019s pretty hard to lose interest in a T20 match, but watching the insipid fashion in which the Stars closed that one out you have to say it was a relief for everyone when that final wicket fell. All out for 115 off 17.4 overs - failing 71 short - or one AB de Villiers short - that was the exact score the South African struck as he returned to form in blistering fashion. The Heat grab a crucial two points - the two they left on the field last weekend against the Renegades - and it all sets up a fascinating last few games, starting with tomorrow\u2019s double header as to who books the final knockout places from here. Big Bash - 9/105 (16), Hinchcliffe 6*, Hussain 5* They\u2019re dribbling it in at this stage, overs of four or five, a few dots, nothing hitting or clearing the rope. Does net run rate come into the finals equation at this stage? If you\u2019re watching Shane K Warne run the various permutations of who wins and who needs to win from here, frankly, it\u2019s like watching a tap-dancing bear. A good leg spin bowler, our Warnie. Let\u2019s leave it at that. Big Bash - 8/95 (14), Hinchcliffe 2*, Lamichhane 1* Ach, this is finishing with a whimper. Hardly the form of a table-topping side; definitely not what you want to carry into the finals knockouts. Credit the bowling, with Rahman getting a few wickets, but they\u2019ve really lost it between the ears, the Stars. And here\u2019s the match report from that earlier Big Bash clash between the Sixers and the Renegades, and in a touch of poetry it was those two Steve Smith and Aaron Finch going up against each other: Big Bash - 6/85 (12), Larkin 16*, Hinchliffe 1* 103 off 48 runs is the equation. It\u2019s the type of close to the innings needed that the Heat managed; but the difference was Brisbane had AB de Villiers and Marnus Labuschagne, and the Stars have, well, Larkin and Hinchliffe. You can never call it in Big Bash - but hey, watch this: I\u2019m calling it. Heat home at a canter. Australian Open: Khachanov wins third set in a tie-break! Nick Kyrgios passes up a first match point with a weak return in the tram tracks, before Khachanov was exceptionally fortunate framing an overhead smash that lands in! He gets the mini-break on the serve of Kyrgios, and it\u2019s the Russian who pumps the first - he\u2019s back in this one: 6-2, 7-6, 6-7! Shades of Kyrgios v Simon: we\u2019re going to a fourth set. Big Bash - Stars 4/71 (9), Larkin 11*, Maddinson 1* Oh my. It\u2019s another big double-wicket over for the Heat. Sure, that\u2019s Big Bash, you say. But when you see it\u2019s the names Maxwell and Handscomb back in the pavilion you have to say: ouch. A two-ball innings from the skipper who was deceived by Mitchell Swepson for one; before the man most likely to hold the innings, Handscomb, went via the runout for 27 off 18. Big blow this - and surely it\u2019s Heat\u2019s game to lose from here. (Which given last week\u2019s 10-wicket collapse against the Renegades, you have to say you can\u2019t necessarily rule out). It finishes a point a piece, in a result that favours neither side, but gives premiership runaways Sydney FC even more breathing room ahead of the league\u2019s second and third placed teams. A sixth clean sheet in seven games for the Glory who already bring to a halt a six-game winning streak. They\u2019re now the form team in the competition, and the only side likely to stop Sydney FC, despite sitting 12 points behind the Sky Blues. The draw a fair result on balance of play. Nobody quite did enough to win it, but nor did either side deserve to lose it. A Daniel Elder penalty correctly overturned by VAR the only big talking point. They were cruising for almost the full regulation 90, but the Wanderers made for some very nervous last few minutes. Sam Staab with an 88th minute consolation goal; but a few minutes into added-time Amy Harrison\u2019s corner really put the cat amongst the pigeons. A scramble in the box with the ball ricocheting everywhere - the official verdict being own goal to Lais dos Santos Araujo. But, the Reds held on. A first win of the W-League season, but what a hammer blow to Wanderers\u2019 premiership hopes. A great win for Ivan Karlovic\u2019s players - can the Reds build from this confidence? So, let\u2019s try and stay with the A-League a little as we enter the final 10 of this one. 80 min: A second sub of the game for Tony Popovic as Dane Ingham comes on for Joel Chianese; Franjic for Meredith was his first change. Harrison Delbridge with an opportunity from the corner - but the big City defender throws his head back in frustration as his headed effort fails to force a save. Big Bash - Stars 2/36 (5), Larkin 2*, Handscomb 3* It\u2019s a big third over from the top-line quick, Pattinson who dismisses both Stoinis and Gotch; how crucial could that prove? Still some batting to come mind - Handscomb, Maddinson, Maxwell etc. This could slow the runrate though, and then suddenly the scoreboard pressure of that late innings uptick from de Villiers will really start to tell. It\u2019s still 3-0 in the W-League with about 20 minutes left to run. What a result this could prove for Adelaide, and one which will presumably hand the premiers plate to Melbourne City for another season. A big slip up from Wanderers. There\u2019s about 20 to run in the A-League where we\u2019re still 0-0 between City and Perth, but not through want of trying. Adrian Luna with an opportunity from the set piece, before Castro gets an effort on target, but it\u2019s well-held from Dean Bouzanis in the City goal. Big Bash - Stars 0/28 (2), Stoinis 16*, Gotch 4* Two fours and a six off Matt Renshaw\u2019s opening over - they went to spin early the Heat but Marcus Stoinis gave it short shrift. A better over follows from James Pattinson who gets a few dots, but Seb Gotch does get one away to the boundary, just six off it. A-League - 55 min: Hello! We\u2019ve got a whistle for a penalty, as Fornaroli goes down courtesy a pretty agricultural swipe from Brillante! BUT, we\u2019re going upstairs. VAR wants a big, hard, long look at this one. Was Bruno in an offside position? Was there a handball in the lead up? What is love? Baby don\u2019t hurt me. No penalty. Another interminable wait, but at least VAR has come up with what appears the correct decision on this occasion. It remains 0-0. And here\u2019s the story on Ash Barty\u2019s Young Australian of the Year award: Big Bash - End of Innings, Heat 5/186 (20), de Villiers 71, Labuschagne 24* Wowee. What an end to that. De Villiers has absolutely gone BANG at the close there. Poor old Dilbar Hussain has gone for about 22 off that last over - sent over the rope three times. They put on something like 70 off 30 balls at the end, de Villiers and Labuschagne - and what looked like a chaseable total has suddenly turned quite imposing. Is that the knock that puts Heat into the finals? For the neutral you\u2019d have to say, you\u2019d hope so. Who wants a Big Bash finals without AB de Villiers and Chris Lynn. A-League: Melbourne City 0-0 Perth Glory - Half-time So we\u2019re all square still in Melbourne, with chances at a premium. Jamie Maclaren with an early chance spurned, but the five-man backline of Perth Glory has largely blunted the attack threat of one of the league\u2019s most entertaining sides. Jack Hendry, on debut for City in defence, has also made himself an imposing presence - but it\u2019s not just tackles and headers, he\u2019s looked composed on the ball too when needed. Big forty-five to come. A draw will only really be celebrated by Sydney FC who would extend their lead to 10+ points at the top of the table. Perth will stay patient, but you imagine City will look to push on as this one unfolds. Stay tuned. News just coming in from the Australia Day awards as well. Your Young Australian of the Year for 2020 is ... *drumroll* Ash Barty. Start the party - what a worthy winner; and what an incredible year for such a humble, hard-working legend. Gee, there\u2019s some sport flying round today. A quick round-the-grounds. A hell of a result coming through from the W-League. We\u2019re at half-time in Adelaide and its the Lady Reds 3-0 to the good. Which is the team bottom, and which is the team fighting for the title? The Wanderers very much second best despite their lion\u2019s share of possession. Not a single shot on target fashioned, and goals to Chelsea Dawber and a brace to Mallory Weber to send the home faithful into raptures. Please, please, please let them hang on. Alternatively, a 4-3 thriller could be exciting viewing. Big Bash - 3/93 (13), Renshaw 7*, de Villiers 10* And with the wicket on Lynn, you\u2019d have to say this one\u2019s swinging the way of the Stars. The big hitting Lynn goes for 34 off 31 - again, not really his usual strike rate. Still so much experience if they can stem the fall of wickets and fly from here, the Heat. Key few overs and then a big explosion at the end and they can keep the pressure on the Stars. 140-150 could be the total; 160 if they\u2019re really lucky. The word from the sideline is that it\u2019s tough batting conditions out there, so no 200+ wicket this. Big news elsewhere from the city on the Yarra, where the women\u2019s singles draw has really opened up with the shock exit of second seed and World No 2, Karolina Pliskova: So, plenty of live sporting action kicking round, so I\u2019m going to manfully step back from Kyrgios watch and redirect you to our man Tumaini Carayol for that: There\u2019s also live Test cricket action as England and South Africa go nose-to-nose. Just don\u2019t anyone call Ben Stokes Ed Sheeran or there will be (more) trouble: And for those of you who love your sport mixed with a hint of thuggery - a kick down memory lane, as Rob Smyth commemorates 25 years since Eric Cantona\u2019s infamous Selhurst Park kung-fu kick out at a fan. Would you believe I remember watching this live as a child. Massive Eric fan. You\u2019d have to say, violence aside, it really did only ever add to his remarkable aura. A-League - 10 min: We\u2019re ten minutes gone from Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, where it\u2019s the home side that have started with a bit more attacking purpose. A few decent efforts on goal fashioned, but nothing to have overly exerted the ever-green Liam Reddy in the Perth goals. Both January new signings, the Spaniard Markel Susaeta and the Scot Jack Hendry have started for City. Be interesting to see how they fare today. Australian Open - Kyrgios takes first set, 6-2! Injury, what injury? He moves a lot more freely after the remedial massage, and comes out and breaks Khachanov for a second time. A nice bonus that, meaning he\u2019ll start the second set on his serve. He\u2019s prowling with a bit more swagger - lets see if Nick can put together a good 20-30 next minutes and take control of this match. Big Bash - - 2/59 (8), Lynn 16*, De Villiers 1* Cutting goes, he\u2019s holed out in the deep, Nick Maddison takes the catch, and it\u2019s Zampa who grabs a second wicket. 22 off 22. It\u2019s not nothing, but in this modern game you focus more on the deliveries absorbed than the runs scored - especially knowing the batting depth the Heat have behind them. De Villiers sees out the Zampa over with a clever shot for one. What can these two build. Australian Open - Kyrgios takes medical timeout He\u2019s leading 5-2 but its the home hero who\u2019s grimacing as he receives some massage to the problematic buttocks region. Karen Khachanov looks a little miffed, but he takes the opportunity to gather his thoughts and reflect on his slow start, by his standards. Now he\u2019s up pacing deep in the back court, shuffling back and forth, idly bouncing a ball, awaiting his chance to serve again. We\u2019re also underway in the W-League, where it\u2019s the bottom-placed Adelaide United playing host to the high-flying Western Sydney. 0-0 after six minutes, we\u2019ll try and stay across any goals from that one as well. Australian Open - Kyrgios grabs first break! 4-2 There it is! A fair ripple of applause around Melbourne Arena, and a fist pump for the Australian. He\u2019s managed a few double faults, but otherwise the serve is going okay and he pounces all over Khachanov\u2019s shorter serve to fire a return winner. Some concern in his coaching box though, he\u2019s grabbed a few times at his left buttocks - and it\u2019s not some kind of literal cheekiness - it could be a possible muscle strain. Kyrgios fans do not want to see this. Big Bash - Heat 1/39 (4), Cutting 18*, Lynn 2* It was a fast start from Heazlett, as we\u2019ve come to expect, but it\u2019s the spinner Adam Zampa who picks him up second over - clean bowled for 18. As mentioned, plenty of batting to come though, so this one still balanced nicely. To the tennis. We\u2019re on serve 2-2 between Kyrgios and Khachanov, while in the women\u2019s draw the clash between Gabbie Muguruza and Elina Svitolina has just started. On the Margaret Court Arena its Fernando Verdasco v Alexander Zverev; both those are just in their opening service games. Wawrinka has powered to a 6-4, 4-1 lead against Isner on court 3, so looking comfortable so far for the 2014 winner. There is of course a later fixture in the A-League as Melbourne City plays host to Perth Glory. 2nd v 3rd - it\u2019s a really tantalising clash, and a real contrast of styles: the attacking verve of the Frenchman Erik Mombaerts vs the defensive structure of Tony Popovic\u2019s Glory (with a fair sprinkling of Spanish-speaking flair up front with Diego Castro and Bruno Fornaroli). A big win for Glory could see them leapfrog City and become the only side likely to run down Sydney FC. But they\u2019ll be thinking of getting a mental edge with finals around the corner. And we\u2019re just underway in the late Big Bash clash, where the Heat have won the toss and elected to bat. Heazlett and Cutting opening for them, with Chris Lynn down to third. Then AB de Villiers, Renshaw and Labuschagne for batting, if you don\u2019t mind. Crunch game for the Heat - they need to secure the two competition points, but as we know - few tougher sides than Melbourne Stars this year. Great match up. Okay, our Nick (if you didn\u2019t get the memo, we\u2019ve universally reclaimed him in Australia after his recent ATP Cup and Bushfire appeal efforts) is on court at the Australian Open, warming up. The nearly 2m tall Russian, Karen Khachanov, is the opponent. He\u2019s done it the hard way so far in Australia, fighting through nine sets in contrast to Kyrgios 2x straight set wins (with a mandatory one-set meltdown against Simon) thus far. He is ranked 16th in the world, so no easy beat. It\u2019s the classic banana skin fixture for Kyrgios. There\u2019s so much expectation riding on a Kyrgios-Nadal fourth round showdown, that many people will just be hoping this match away. Kachanov will however have other plans. And would you believe it - a team that many had ranked a strugglers earlier in the season has now grabbed its third win in a five-game unbeaten streak. Wellington coach Ufuk Talay said \u201cGod was on their side\u201d last week when the Roar ended the Phoenix\u2019s own unbeaten run - but has Robbie Fowler found the magic formula up in Brisbane? They leap into the six, God\u2019s gallopers. Can they push on and really make a late season tilt at taking some big scalps come finals time? A-League - Goal! Central Coast 0-1 Brisbane (Brown) 87 min: Ach, would you believe it. It\u2019s like NostraParkus predicted (see last post) - they\u2019ve been full huff and all puff, the Mariners - and right at the death, they\u2019ve copped what could be the winner in an absolute sucker punch - a deflected goal from a hopeful cross! When your luck is out, your luck is out. Corey Brown - a man reborn since his return this month from an unhappy spell at Melbourne Victory - is the goalscorer for the Roar. His cross, flicking the heels of the unwitting Lewis Miller, wrong-foots the otherwise excellent Mark Birighitti in the Mariners goal, and trickles in. Mariners coach Alen Stajcic is steaming out the ears. What a kick in the teeth. And as Steve Smith accelerated it was in the end quite comfortable for the men in pink, with the Sixers running down that big total with eight balls to spare. 5-175 off 20 from the Renegades, you thought that would be a tough total, but on a decent batting track Josh Philippe and Steve Smith make quick work of it - 61 off 42 and 66* off 40 their scores, with Daniel Hughes finishing with a useful 19* off 14 up the other end. Spare a thought for Smith\u2019s national team runout buddy - Finch hit 109 of 68 to start the Renegades\u2019 innings - but just like against India, his old pal Smith had him caught short in the end. They finish the season bottom of the table, by some distance, the Renegades, while the Sixers move temporarily to second spot. Now at the Australian Open we\u2019re not too far away from Nick Kyrgios o\u2019clock (unless I\u2019ve got my times horribly mixed) in his third round clash with Russia\u2019s Karen Khachanov. On court three it\u2019s Stan Wawrinka (why am I suddenly thinking about Kokkinakis, having segued from NK to our Stan) in action with big serving American John Isner. We\u2019re on serve 2-2 in the first set, but a decent little game underway, with the Swiss sniffing around an early break. Big Bash - Sixers 3/153 (17), Smith 54*, Hughes 9* 23 needed of 18 is the equation, as Steve Smith ferrets about the crease in imposing fashion - ever nervous, ever fiddly, ever ruthless. If you missed it by the way, there was a terrific piece from our colleague Jonathan Howcroft on the Smith-Finch runout calamity. No doubt Smith has exorcised that here though, he looks, ominously for Renegades fans, \u201cin a mood\u201d. A thumping six first delivery from Richardson, and they finish with 15 off the over. 8 needed off 12, they\u2019ll end up doing it easily, the Sixers. A-League - 69 min: Central Coast 0-0 Brisbane Roar We\u2019re still locked up in Gosford, but not for a want of trying. It\u2019s been the home side on top this second stanza, laying siege to the visitors\u2019 goal, but they\u2019ve only come as close as the post. A frenetic sequence involving Murray, the Serbian Milan Duric and Tommy Oar finishes with a whacking of Jamie Young\u2019s upright, to the squeals of the home fans. No luck for their skipper, Oar, against his old side - he still continues to hunt his first goal in Mariners yellow. And as we speak, its another spectacular save by Young, who tips Murray\u2019s effort over the crossbar. It\u2019s one of these where having gone so close on so many occasions but not found the knockout punch, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Roar went up the other end and pinched one. But first - a quick spin round the grounds to see what\u2019s live. We\u2019ve A-League, Big Bash and ongoing tennis. No doubt some Bball, and there\u2019s W-League action on the horizon too. Hi all! Greetings to thee and thine. Thanks Scott, comprehensive as always. I hope I can keep it at the lofty standards you\u2019ve set; if not a contender in that category than definitely top three. What sporting stuff are you into today? Shoot us an email or tweet to join the chat. I\u2019m keen to hear about some hockey, equestrian; whatever else floats your boat. And that\u2019s where my involvement in this undoubtedly award-winning Sportwatch blog comes to an end. It\u2019ll win an award - likely in the \u2018Best Sportwatch on Saturday, January 25\u2019 category - because the man I\u2019m handing over to, Richard Parkin, knows his onions. All yours, Parko! A-League: HT: Central Coast 0-0 Brisbane Brilliant keeping from Birighitti, a disallowed goal for the Roar through an offside ruling, no goals and plenty of perspiration, but not a lot of inspiration, sums up this first half. BBL: Sydney Sixers 71-1 (8 overs) v Melbourne Renegades 175-5 First, the bad news for the Sixers: Vince was run out for 22. Now the good news: Steve Smith is now in, and he and Josh Philippe (39 from 27) are setting the foundation for a good old-fashioned crack at this victory target. When I say Vince was run out, he was run out like this. Unlucky. Australian Open: Around the courts ... Women\u2019s 16th seed Elise Mertens has a fight on her hands at Melbourne Arena against Catherine Bellis, ranked No 600 in the world. Mertens blitzed the first set 6-1 but Bellis found something to take the second in a tie-break. Another seed has fallen in the women\u2019s singles, with Iga Swiatek beating 19th seed Donna Vekic, 7-5 6-3. In the women\u2019s doubles, Kristina Mladenovic and Timea Babos knocked off Ashleigh Barty and Julia Goerges, 7-5 6-4. And, as you know, Rafa did as Rafa does. A-League: 30 mins: Central Coast 0-0 Brisbane Inman is released by McDonald. He shimmies and shakes, drops a defender on his backside and is one-on-one with the keeper. He pulls the trigger but is denied by Birighitti, the Mariners shot stopper with the best reflexes in the game. Wonderful save. BBL: Sydney Sixers 17-0 (2 overs) v Melbourne Renegades 175-5 A bright start from the Sixers, who need to score at about 8.5 an over to win ... and they\u2019re scoring at 8.5 an over. I\u2019d say they\u2019re on target. Philippe and Vince would\u2019ve watched Finch do his thing and licked their lips. Let\u2019s see if they can emulate the Australia ODI skipper. A dominant performance from the world No 1. That\u2019s 18 matches in a row he\u2019s won against his fellow Spaniard. I bet Carreno Busta punched the air in delight when he saw Nadal lurking on the same side of the draw. Unlike in the women\u2019s draw, most of the big guns are still standing in the men\u2019s. You know, not enough is made of how thoroughly decent and humble Nadal appears to be. He\u2019s either a very good actor, or he is in fact thoroughly decent and humble. A-League: 12 mins: Central Coast 0-0 Brisbane It\u2019s hot in Gosford, humid as all hell. The players look like they\u2019ve been out there for an hour, not a dozen minutes. Brisbane have enjoyed the better of the opening exchanges, but no goals yet. Did I mention it was hot in Gosford? BBL: Melbourne Renegades 175-5 (20 overs) v Sydney Sixers Finch did get out in the end. On the penultimate ball of the innings, caught in the deep for 109 from 68 balls. He gave the Sixers a chance or two - as if that needs saying when a century is scored in a T20 game - but this was classic Aaron Finch: brutal, confrontational, uncompromising. Curran returned 3-27 for the Sixers, whom you wouldn\u2019t outright dismiss as a winning chance despite the big target they\u2019ll be chasing. Their batting line-up has been bolstered by one Steve Smith, after all. A-League: Moving right along to football - I told you there was lots on today - and we are barely moments away from the encounter between Central Coast and Brisbane in Gosford. A win here for Robbie\u2019s Roar will make things interesting in terms of the finals. BBL: Melbourne Renegades 140-3 (17 overs) v Sydney Sixers Finch is still there, unbeaten on 85 from 57 balls. Besides being run out by Steve Smith, this is simply what the big man does. The Renegades are on for a big score here. Yes, it\u2019s all too late for the reigning champs. But in some ways it\u2019s better late than never. Not many ways, but some. Australian Open: Anett Kontaveit beat Belinda Bencic (6-0 6-1) Let\u2019s go, Freddie. Loosen those tonsils. Give us another rendition of \u2018Another One Bites The Dust\u2019. I know, I know, Freddie\u2019s gone. And so is the women\u2019s sixth seed Bencic, who was blown off Margaret Court Arena by Estonia\u2019s Kontaveit, the 28th seed. At 18, Kontaveit is an elderly stateswoman when compared to Coco Gauff. But might this tournament come to be seen as a changing of the guard in the women\u2019s game? The teens are rising. Watch your back, Ashleigh. Australian Open: 2nd set: Rafael Nadal 6-1 6-2 Pablo Carreno Busta Easy as you like for Rafa. Nadal holds to love to serve out for the second set against a man with whom he has plenty in common. Nadal\u2019s freakish tennis ability, however, is not among these things. I have two young sons. Every now and then, the words \u2018totes awks\u2019 will come scuttling out of their mouths. I\u2019ll admit, as a fully paid-up member of the Gen-X club I didn\u2019t have a clue what they were saying at first. But I get it now. On Monday, Tennis Australia will commemorate the 50th anniversary of Margaret Court winning the Grand Slam. Totes awks. BBL: Melbourne Renegades 74-2 (10 overs) v Sydney Sixers The Sixers won the toss, inserted the Renegades, and then looked on as Aaron Finch and everyone\u2019s favourite \u2018Dutchman\u2019 Tom Cooper hit them to all parts. The Renegades were going at well over 10 an over inside the first four, but the Tom Curran got rid of Cooper for 24 (from 10 balls) and soon followed up with the wicket of Nathan McSweeney. Finch is still out there, unbeaten on 37 from 30 balls, and they might be on for a good score at the SCG. Just in case you\u2019ve been living under a rock, bed-ridden with no access to wi-fi, or just not that interested, here\u2019s what happened in the tennis yesterday. Australian Open: A whip around the courts ... Women\u2019s fourth seed Simona Halep, who must fancy her chances of going very deep given the carnage around her, was a 6-1 6-4 winner over Yulia Putintseva. Angelique Kerber, champion here in 2016, was pushed by Italy\u2019s Camila Giorgi before prevailing 6-2 7-6 (4) 6-3. Gael Monfils, the men\u2019s 10th seed, is into the second week courtesy of a 7-6 (2) 6-4 6-3 win over Ernests Gulbis. On Rod Laver Arena, men\u2019s top seed Rafael Nadal has just taken the first set, 6-1, against countryman Pablo Carreno Busta. Men\u2019s fifth seed, Dominic Thiem, is two sets to the good against Taylor Fritz and seemingly racing towards victory. Australian Open: My, the veritable book was turned up, chewed, spat out and buried yesterday. Some big names fell by the wayside: Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams, almost Roger Federer. And already today another one has bit the dust: Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the women\u2019s 30th seed, has beaten the No 2 seed, Karolina Pliskova, in straight sets, 7-6 (4) 7-6 (3). Pliskova was previously unbeaten in 2020, having won the season-opening Brisbane International and then two more matches in Melbourne. Big, big shock. Upsets galore. I can feel the mercury rising from here. Hello and welcome to Sportwatch on this very busy Saturday of sport. There\u2019s lots in store, most notably day six of the Australian Open at Melbourne Park. Friday was a memorable day, full of surprises, and chances are there will be more in store today. [Spoiler alert: there has already been a surprise result today]. But wait, there\u2019s more. With the Big Bash League finals just around the corner, we have two games today - starting with the Sixers hosting the Renegades in Sydney this afternoon, followed by the table-topping Stars against the Heat this evening. In the A-League, Brisbane visit Central Coast later this afternoon before high-flying Melbourne City tackle Perth. And in the W-League, Adelaide United host Western Sydney tonight. So, yeah, we have a full plate of sporting action on which to gorge. Have something to say? Get in touch on email or tweet @scott_heinrich.",

      "bodyText": "Four men, all of whom have direct connections to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the global coronavirus pandemic, have been confirmed as carrying the deadly virus in Australia. A man in his 50s in Melbourne became the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus in Australia on Saturday morning, with three other cases confirmed in New South Wales late on Saturday. Eleven countries have now confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), 41 people have died and more than 1,000 have been infected. Victoria\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said the man in Melbourne, a Chinese national, arrived at Tullamarine airport at 9am on Sunday 19 January on China Southern Airlines Flight No CZ321 from Guangzhou. He had previously been in Wuhan. The man tested positive for coronavirus early on Saturday morning. He had visited a GP on Thursday and went to the Monash medical centre at Clayton on Friday, where he was put into isolation. The man showed no symptoms while travelling, \u201cso may not have been contagious\u201d at the time, Mikakos said. But \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d health officials were contacting everybody who was on that flight. \u201cThere is no reason for alarm in the general community,\u201d Mikakos said. \u201cWe have strict protocols that are in place in terms of how we deal with these infectious disease outbreaks.\u201d Mikakos said the first infected man and his family \u201cdid everything right\u201d. \u201cHe exhibited no symptoms on the flight and when he did experience some symptoms of illness they contacted the GP on Thursday, they called ahead and he was double-masked when he presented to the GP clinic. \u201cHe was not confirmed to have coronavirus by the GP. The family contacted the Monash medical centre on Friday, they called ahead of time and again he was masked before he turned up at [emergency] and immediately put into isolation.\u201d The three other confirmed Australian cases, all in New South Wales, involve men aged between 30 and 60. Two had visited Wuhan in recent weeks, the other had direct contact with a confirmed case from Wuhan while in China. A man in his 50s arrived in Sydney from Wuhan on China Eastern flight MU749 on 20 January. He developed symptoms that night and subsequently saw a doctor. Another man, who is in his 30s, arrived in Sydney from China on 6 January. He did not develop symptoms until 15 January and saw his GP. He did not visit Wuhan but had contact with a person from the city diagnosed with coronavirus. A third man, in his 40s, arrived in Sydney on 18 January after being in Wuhan. He did not develop symptoms until 24 January and presented to hospital on the same day. All three men were diagnosed with novel coronavirus on Saturday 25 January. All three are currently in isolation in NSW hospitals. A total of 18 people have been tested for the virus in NSW, with 12 of those given the all-clear. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, urged anyone with symptoms to come forward as soon as they felt unwell. \u201cIt is important people feel confident contacting their GP or local emergency department,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should also call ahead to speak to their GP or emergency department. If the GP considers novel coronavirus testing is needed they will be referred to the emergency department for testing.\u201d Nine people in Queensland have returned negative results for coronavirus, with authorities on Saturday still waiting on results from another possible case. Four people in South Australia were also being tested but authorities said it was unlikely they actually had the virus, with a man also being checked in a Hobart hospital. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said the man in Melbourne confirmed as having coronavirus had visited Wuhan province but had come to Australia on a direct flight from Guangzhou to Melbourne. He said \u201cthere are potentially others like this person ... who was well when he travelled\u201d, but that there was \u201cno evidence this virus is being transmitted in Australia\u201d. \u201cAt this stage there is no risk to the general Australian community,\u201d Murphy said. But he said there was significant potential for more cases in Australia. \u201cThere are other cases being tested each day. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we have further confirmed cases.\u201d Murphy said that anyone who had travelled from China who developed flu-like symptoms should see their doctor. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, announced the Australian government had raised its travel advice for Hubei province in central China to level four \u2013 the highest level. \u201cWe now advise you: do not travel to and from Hubei province\u201d, the government advised. Payne said: \u201cChinese authorities have restricted travel in at least five Hubei cities. Australians going there may not be able to leave until restrictions are lifted.\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said a confirmed case of coronavirus had been anticipated by the Australian government and the issue was being addressed \u201cincredibly seriously\u201d. \u201cI want to assure Australians that our officials, our medical experts, our clinicians, our border security officials and agencies, our biosecurity professionals are all working closely together at both a commonwealth and state level,\u201d he said. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has listed the virus as having \u201cpandemic potential\u201d. This allows for enhanced border protection measures. Globally, efforts to contain the deadly new coronavirus have been stepped up, and the first cases have been reported in Europe. China has widened restrictions on movement, expanding its unprecedented lockdown during the country\u2019s new year holiday period to 13 cities, covering at least 36 million people. Late on Friday, authorities confirmed a further 15 deaths and 180 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of fatalities to 41 people and more than 1,000 people affected. Cases have been reported in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, the United States, Thailand and Vietnam. On Friday, the first cases were reported in Europe with France saying it had identified three cases. The World Health Organisation has stopped short of declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern but called on the international community to work co-operatively to fight the spread of the virus. There is an emerging suspicion in China that officials may be downplaying the number of cases recorded over recent weeks, recalling the government\u2019s reluctance to disclose the full scale of the 2002-03 Sars outbreak, which killed almost 800 people. Videos circulating on Weibo and other social media, reportedly from Hubei hospitals, show crowded waiting rooms and distressed and overwhelmed medical staff. Patients have reported being turned away from hospitals, which have been inundated with people who fear they have the virus. Health facilities in Wuhan are reportedly running out of beds and diagnostic kits for patients who present with fever-like symptoms, which could mean many are unsure if they have the virus. Initial symptoms of coronavirus are similar to those of a cold and flu, and include a cough or fever. Most of the people who have died in the outbreak have been older men but on Friday Chinese authorities confirmed a 36-year-old man had died, the youngest fatality so far.",

      "bodyText": "Instagram may well have changed the way you garden, even if you don\u2019t have an account. From the plants you buy \u2013 and where you buy them \u2013 to the gardens you visit, the platform has driven a profound change in the tastes and habits of even established gardeners, not to mention encouraging a new generation of green fingers. Plants have been inspiring artists for hundreds of years, so they are well suited to the photo app. A younger generation (urban, cash-strapped, Insta-obsessed and renting) are driving houseplant sales, sharing pictures of their plant babies instead of the human ones they can\u2019t afford. From the dramatic structure of mother-in-law\u2019s tongue to blousy tea roses, you can say a lot about your taste through the species you share. Connecting with nature reduces stress, much needed in these chaotic times; even bursts of online greenery, amid Instagram\u2019s sometimes frantic commercialism, are a tonic. Certain plants look better on Instagram than others: anything with unusual leaf shapes and textures, such as the Chinese money plant, (Pilea peperomioides), trailing hearts (Ceropegia woodii), and the swiss cheese plant (Monstera deliciosa); anything especially oversized, variegated or brightly coloured, such as the hot-pink patterned leaves of philodendron \u2018Pink Princess\u2019; and anything that would fill a maximalist display, such as spider plants and string-of-pearls (see @thesill, @cultivatedbychristin, @graceandthorn, @littleandlush for inspiration).

He was convicted of possessing 28 pieces of child pornography and committing up to 30 sexual assaults.</p> <p>On an internet forum in 2015, after being released from prison, Bester wrote that his crime was \u201cawesome\u201d. The paedophile was then convicted a second time as a result, and for sharing further child exploitation material.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email\">Saved for Later: sign-up for Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe majority of men in Australia envy me,\u201d Bester wrote in 2015. \u201cI was 59, she was 15 going on 25 \u2026 It was awesome.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, Arndt interviewed Bester following both convictions, in a YouTube video titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-12/bettina-arndt-interviews-nicolaas-bester/11399466\">Feminists persecute disgraced teacher</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOver the years I\u2019ve talked to many male teachers about sexually provocative behaviour from female students,\u201d Arndt said. \u201cSensible teachers of course run a mile from these girls, but the teachers are still really vulnerable because they can easily be subject to false accusations if they reject or offend the young woman in question.\u201d</p> <p>She added that young women needed to \u201cbehave sensibly and not exploit their seductive power to ruin the lives of men\u201d.</p> <p>In response to Bester\u2019s comments that his crime was \u201cawesome\u201d, Arndt laughed and said it was \u201cpretty stupid\u201d but that \u201cI can imagine how easily this happens\u201d.</p> <p>Arndt first rose to prominence as a sex therapist and the editor and publisher of sex education magazine Forum, starting in 1973. In later years she authored the book #MenToo, about discrimination against men, and launched a university speaking tour about the \u201cfake rape crisis\u201d.</p> <p>In 2018 the woman Bester abused, Grace Tame, criticised Arndt for being \u201cwilling to support\u201d the paedophile, \u201ctrivialising\u201d his crime and \u201claughing off\u201d his offending.</p> <p>Segments of the interview were also aired on current affairs show 60 Minutes that year.</p> <p>Under Tasmanian state law, Bester had been able to speak about his conviction, but Tame had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/19/tasmania-sex-assault-gag-law-to-face-overhaul-early-next-year\">prevented from sharing her story</a>, or being identified, until the law was overturned this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/60Mins/status/1061531592982618112\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After Nicolaas Bester was released from jail, he took part in an interview with sex therapist Bettina Arndt, portraying himself as the victim.

I\u2019m also working hard to get our national suicide policies to properly address why six out of the eight people killing themselves every day are male.

      "bodyText": "The controversial writer and media commentator Bettina Arndt has been recognised in this year\u2019s Australia Day honours list for services \u201cto gender equity through advocacy for men\u201d. The journalist, author and sex therapist was made a Member of the Order of Australia on Sunday \u2013 the third-highest rank under Australia\u2019s civic honours system. In 2018, Arndt was criticised by sex abuse survivors for conducting a 17-minute interview with convicted paedophile Nicolaas Bester in which she described the behaviour of female students as \u201csexually provocative\u201d. Bester had been jailed for grooming and repeatedly raping his 15-year-old student when he was a 58-year-old teacher in Tasmania. He was convicted of possessing 28 pieces of child pornography and committing up to 30 sexual assaults. On an internet forum in 2015, after being released from prison, Bester wrote that his crime was \u201cawesome\u201d. The paedophile was then convicted a second time as a result, and for sharing further child exploitation material. \u201cThe majority of men in Australia envy me,\u201d Bester wrote in 2015. \u201cI was 59, she was 15 going on 25 \u2026 It was awesome.\u201d In 2017, Arndt interviewed Bester following both convictions, in a YouTube video titled \u201cFeminists persecute disgraced teacher\u201d. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve talked to many male teachers about sexually provocative behaviour from female students,\u201d Arndt said. \u201cSensible teachers of course run a mile from these girls, but the teachers are still really vulnerable because they can easily be subject to false accusations if they reject or offend the young woman in question.\u201d She added that young women needed to \u201cbehave sensibly and not exploit their seductive power to ruin the lives of men\u201d. In response to Bester\u2019s comments that his crime was \u201cawesome\u201d, Arndt laughed and said it was \u201cpretty stupid\u201d but that \u201cI can imagine how easily this happens\u201d. Arndt first rose to prominence as a sex therapist and the editor and publisher of sex education magazine Forum, starting in 1973. In later years she authored the book #MenToo, about discrimination against men, and launched a university speaking tour about the \u201cfake rape crisis\u201d. In 2018 the woman Bester abused, Grace Tame, criticised Arndt for being \u201cwilling to support\u201d the paedophile, \u201ctrivialising\u201d his crime and \u201claughing off\u201d his offending. Segments of the interview were also aired on current affairs show 60 Minutes that year. Under Tasmanian state law, Bester had been able to speak about his conviction, but Tame had been prevented from sharing her story, or being identified, until the law was overturned this year. \u201cMs Arndt never reached out to me in the pursuit of balanced journalism; never heard my side of the story; was not present at any stage of the abuse; did not attend any of the court hearings; yet confidently labelled me a \u2018provocative\u2019 teenager who used her \u2018seductive powers\u2019 to ruin a man\u2019s life,\u201d Tame told news.com.au in 2018. \u201cThat she is so willing to support a twice-convicted offender, trivialise the details of his heinous crimes and even laugh off aspects of his offending is quite disturbing.\u201d Arndt issued an apology in 2018 for the tone of the interview and said it had been selectively edited. \u201cI conducted the interview not because I condone his past behaviour but because I am concerned about vigilante justice,\u201d she wrote on her website. \u201cI apologise to those I have offended by the relaxed tone of the interview, particularly in the segments of the interview shown by 60 Minutes which were carefully selected to damage my reputation. \u201cI find it difficult not to get along with people who are willing to have an honest conversation with me, even those who have made grave errors in their lives.\u201d Arndt told Guardian Australia on Friday that she was \u201cdelighted\u201d to be on the honours list and that focus on her interview with Bester \u201cmisrepresented\u201d her more than 45-year career. \u201cIt is very encouraging to receive this acknowledgement of my work,\u201d she said. \u201cMy campus tour last year was pretty successful in drawing attention to the illegal campus kangaroo courts. I\u2019m also working hard to get our national suicide policies to properly address why six out of the eight people killing themselves every day are male. And to get proper support for the one in three male victims of domestic violence.\u201d \u201cIf people are unhappy about my receiving an award because of the Bester issue, I suggest they acquaint themselves with the background to the video,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps they should think about why this issue is being used to misrepresent my very long career. After all, I\u2019ve been out in the media for over 45 years promoting all sorts of controversial issues, seeking fair treatment for both men and women.\u201d Arndt said her supporters had lodged complaints to the Press Council over previous reports of her interview with Bester due to \u201cmedia manipulation\u201d. \u201cThe quiet Australians aren\u2019t happy about the constant male-bashing in our society and I\u2019m working to try to change that.\u201d Arndt was recognised for her \u201csignificant service to the community as a social commentator\u201d, the awards council said. She has written for newspapers including the Australian, the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald. She was president of the Royal Women\u2019s Hospital Foundation in 1999 and has been a member of the national advisory committee on ageing, the family law pathways advisory group and the child support review ministerial reference group. According to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Arndt has also been an \u201conline dating coach\u201d from 2001 to 2017 and a contributor to \u201cJordan Peterson\u2019s thinkspot\u201d since 2019. Arndt is also the author of What Men Want: In Bed (2010), The Bettina Arndt Guide to Lovemaking for Men (1982), The Bettina Arndt Guide to Lovemaking for Women (1980-1984), The Bettina Arndt Guide to Lovemaking (1982) and #Men Too (2018).

      "bodyText": "The comedian Tim Minchin, Kath &amp; Kim co-creater Jane Turner and three former Liberal premiers are among the recipients on an Australia Day honours list that is 41.6% women. At age 19, the LGBTQ+ activist Georgie Stone is this year\u2019s youngest honours recipient, receiving the medal of the Order of Australia alongside her mother, Rebekah Robertson, for their work as a mother-daughter team for transgender youth and parents. The oldest recipient, at 97, is Colin Hamley, a second world war veterans\u2019 advocate and former prisoner of war, who also received an OAM. Hamley told Guardian Australia it was \u201cmarvellous\u201d to be recognised, and praised his youngest counterpart, Stone, as \u201cremarkable\u201d. The 2019 Australia Day honours set a record for female representation, with 37.5% of recipients being women. That then rose to 40% for the Queen\u2019s birthday honours list in June 2019. The awards have had a historical imbalance of only 33% women receiving honours since they were founded in 1975. This year, 41.6% of those recognised were women, up 1.6% from the 2019 Queen\u2019s birthday honours, but below 50% parity. In a statement, the governor general, David Hurley, said this was \u201cpart of a long-term, positive trend that [he] would like to continue\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a diverse list \u2013 with the percentage of women recipients in the Order of Australia above 41% \u2013 but could be even more so,\u201d he said. Multiple Liberal politicians received honours this year: former Queensland premier Campbell Newman, former New South Wales premier Barry O\u2019Farrell, former Victorian premier Ted Baillieu and former immigration minister Amanda Vanstone. Margaret Beazley, the current governor of NSW and former president of the NSW court of appeal, was made a companion of the Order of Australia (AC) \u2013 the highest civilian award in the honours system. Larissa Behrendt, a law professor and the first Indigenous woman to graduate from Harvard University, was made an officer of the Order of Australia (AO). Behrendt was recognised for her contribution to the law, Indigenous education and the arts. The academic has won literary awards for her 2004 fiction book, Home, and an Australian Directors Guild award for her 2018 documentary, After the Apology. The actor Hugo Weaving, musician Keith Urban and cricketer Ian Healy also joined her as officers. The actor Rachel Griffiths, Strictly Ballroom star Paul Mercurio, director and actor Rachael Maza, INXS co-founder Andrew Farris and the first Indigenous director of the Sydney festival, Wesley Enoch, were all made members of the Order of Australia (AM). Turner, the co-creator of Kath &amp; Kim and an actor on the sketch show the D-Generation, received the medal of the Order of Australia (OAM). Stone told Guardian Australia she was \u201creally surprised\u201d but pleased to be the youngest recipient on this year\u2019s list. \u201cIt was an incredible honour. It always feels good to be acknowledged, and to be 19 and be acknowledged, it was really lovely \u2013 and a bit overwhelming.\u201d She paid tribute to her mother, the actor and author Rebekah Robertson, who founded the transgender support group Transcend. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of her. I\u2019m really glad she has been acknowledged as well because I would not be able to be here and do what I am doing without her support. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely a team but I am glad that she has been acknowledged for the work she has done herself. She started the first ever parents-led support group for parents of trans people in Australia.\u201d Hamley, 97, said he was \u201cvery honoured to receive this decoration\u201d. \u201cSomebody told me I was the oldest one. It feels marvellous, it feels very satisfying and for all the work I have put in over the years.\u201d He also praised Stone\u2019s achievements and wished her good luck. \u201cThat\u2019s remarkable, at that age,\u201d he said. He said he had not yet told his grandchildren but was \u201csure\u201d they would be proud. \u201cThey don\u2019t really know yet. I haven\u2019t disclosed to anyone really. The only one I have disclosed it to is the person who sent in the nomination in the first place \u2013 Jenny Davidson \u2013 who is the secretary of our veterans association.\u201d Stone said she hoped the representation of young people and women would continue to increase. \u201cIt\u2019s great that it is improving, but what is exciting is the prospect that it is going to keep improving as well.

      "body": "<p>Mary Beard is standing on a chair, chiselling the fig leaf off a large classical statue in Crawford Art Gallery in Cork. \u201cGod this is quite exciting. My hand is taut with the nerves of it all,\u201d she says, though what lies beneath the familiar modesty motif turns out to be something of a disappointment. The statue, cast in plaster from an original in the Vatican collection, has suffered \u201ca limited castration\u201d, with the result that the fig leaf \u2013 probably added in the 19th century to spare the blushes of Irish art lovers \u2013 had nothing much to hide. \u201cThere\u2019s something really ironic about these things that were meant to stop you seeing things,\u201d Beard reflects, \u201cwhen what they end up doing is saying: \u2018Look at what you can\u2019t see.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Her outing to Cork comes midway through the first episode of <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/visualarts/bbctwo#heading-mary-beards-shock-of-the-nude-wt-2-x-60\" title=\"\">Shock of the Nude</a></em>, a two-part BBC Two series which sets out to interrogate western art\u2019s obsession with the naked body. The Cambridge classics professor has already marvelled at the marble musculature of Michelangelo\u2019s <em>David</em> and tried her hand at a life-drawing hen party (\u201cHe\u2019s got very good bum cheeks,\u201d enthuses one of the group). These scenes are a subversion of Beard\u2019s central thesis: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can talk about the nude unless you talk about male desire.\u201d Given the dominance of the male gaze, the programmes ask, how is a woman to find her own perspective?</p> <p>One of the challenges of the subject, Beard admits, was how to place herself as the presenter. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting position to find yourself in, because you\u2019re having to present views to people with your clothes on about what it\u2019s like not to have your clothes on.\u201d She is not afraid to share her own emotional responses. \u201cIn my fantasies,\u201d she says of Titian\u2019s <em>Venus of Urbino</em>, a reclining nude with her hand lingering suggestively over her genitals, \u201cI\u2019m with this naked lady and we\u2019re both giggling at these blokes who are leering at us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dd4eb27e9aa3dd6a7f4849f2043a4f999985433\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dd4eb27e9aa3dd6a7f4849f2043a4f999985433/0_112_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Beard in the BBC2 TV series Shock of the Nude.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Beard in the BBC2 series <em>Shock of the Nude</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polly Alderton/BBC/Lion Television Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the brickbats that Beard has suffered over the years, this challenge to the usual formalities of art scholarship is both pointed and brave. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to be a bit resilient about this,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a team effort. We\u2019ve said what we set out to say and if you get some crap on Twitter, as I\u2019m sure we will, that was not our intention.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years Beard has repeatedly faced down the misogyny of the media \u2013 both conventional and social. \u201cThis is what 57-year-old women look like, deal with it,\u201d she told the critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/aa-gill\" title=\"\">AA Gill</a> after he criticised her appearance in her 2012 television series, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/apr/17/meet-the-romans-mary-beard\" title=\"\">Meet </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/apr/17/meet-the-romans-mary-beard\" title=\"\">the Romans</a></em>. Discovering that she had been largely edited out of the American version of the landmark 2018 series <em>Civili</em><em>sations</em>, which she presented alongside Simon Schama and David Olusoga, she wryly responded: \u201cIt looks to me that mine were more substantially edited than the others\u2019\u2026 I wonder why that was? I always try and stick up for elderly ladies with grey hair.\u201d</p> <p>The relevance of this very personal history, in the context of a film about the nude, is underlined in an interview with the artist Jemima Stehli, who in 2000 created a provocative set of photographs of herself stripping in front of a series of male curators and critics, to whom she had given control of the camera. One regular response, Stehli tells Beard, was \u201cWould you do this if you didn\u2019t have a body like this?\u201d</p> <p>Against the intransigence of the male gaze, Beard pits her own, shifting perspective. \u201cI was brought up with 1970s feminism, when the object of the male gaze was seen as a part of male appropriation of women, and there\u2019s a lot going for that position. But as I\u2019ve got older I\u2019ve begun to think: \u2018What do I do? Am I not supposed to engage with it? Step one is to see the sexual politics, but can we go beyond this? What happens with women artists? Is it just a case of exalting male desire?\u2019 But I like looking at these things and I have no intention of stopping. I think there\u2019s room for hope.\u201d</p> <p>Beard\u2019s story begins in Greece, in the 4th century BC, where a sculptor called Praxiteles became the first to carve a statue of a naked woman: \u201cIt was shockingly new and close to unacceptable.\u201d So intoxicating was the image of Aphrodite, \u201cwho we rather coyly call the goddess of love when she\u2019s really the goddess of sex\u201d, that one young man was reported to have driven himself mad by attempting to make love to her. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the story is true or not \u2013 \u201cit was their way of trying to talk about it\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"340c14798c4053443e19eed82a7c34c72f1218c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/340c14798c4053443e19eed82a7c34c72f1218c0/0_0_4092_5814/704.jpg\" alt=\"Susanna and the Elders by Artemisia Gentileschi (c1610).\" width=\"704\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Susanna and the Elders</em> by Artemisia Gentileschi (c1610).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GL Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before Praxiteles, she says, the nude was the preserve of men and represented an ideal of citizenship, embodying moral and elite virtue in figures whose genitals \u201cwere often noticeably small\u201d. She is too scrupulous a scholar to suggest that Praxiteles\u2019s Aphrodite changed all that. \u201cIt\u2019s been very hard to document the change in the viewing of the male nude, but the logic has to be that once you have sexualised the female naked form it\u2019s going to reflect back on the male one.\u201d</p> <p>By the time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/michelangelo\" title=\"\">Mich</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/michelangelo\" title=\"\">elangelo</a> unveiled his <em>David</em> in early 16th-century Florence, the male nude had been routinely sexualised, occupying \u201cthe blurry space where art meets erotica\u201d and causing such anxiety that David himself was pelted with stones and fitted with a brass modesty belt. A brief detour into traditional African art \u2013 where the naked body is an expression of community or ritual \u2013 demonstrates the fetishistic weirdness of this western tradition, the disconnect between art and real life. \u201cWe say Jesus is naked, but we don\u2019t say nude. And what about the bodies of the elderly or anatomical models. Are they nude?\u201d Beard asks. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the naked body is the unclothed body and the nude is the naked body in art \u2013 clothed in its nudity.\u201d</p> <p>The programmes are partly a canter through the ruses that have been used through history to keep art and pornography apart. Both location and language play a part in this: if it\u2019s in a gallery, preferably in a gold frame, it\u2019s art. If it has a mythological subject it\u2019s art, even if \u2013 as in the case of John William Waterhouse\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/the-pre-raphaelites\" title=\"\">pre-Raphaelite</a> painting <em>Hylas and the Nymphs</em> \u2013 the myth itself has long lost its significance, leaving a flotilla of pubescent girls with titillatingly budding breasts.</p> <p><em>Hylas and the Nymphs </em>became the centre of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-hylas-and-the-nymphs-not-censorship\" title=\"\">a minor scandal</a> two years ago when it was publicly removed from the wall of Manchester Art Gallery by the artist Sonia Boyce. The outcry \u2013 which even spilled into the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/02/banning-artworks-such-as-hylas-and-the-nymphs-is-a-long-slippery-slope\" title=\"\">letters page</a> \u2013 was quite unfair, says Beard. The painting was never intended to be permanently censored. Its removal was in a tradition of a feminist performance that has become a way of forcing people to question what they are looking at, how and why.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Just think how differently we would look at it if it was called, say, Jeanette\u2019s Pussy'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She cites a far more radical intervention in 2014, when the performance artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/18/naked-artist-deborah-de-robertis-decries-hypocrisy-paris-gallery-arrest\" title=\"\">Deborah de Robertis</a> sat down and exposed her naked crotch in front of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/courbet\" title=\"\">Gustave Courbet</a>\u2019s breathtakingly explicit <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/25/origin-of-gustave-courbet-scandalous-painting-revealed\" title=\"\">L\u2019Origine du Monde</a></em> in Paris\u2019s Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, repeatedly chanting \u201c<em>Je suis l\u2019origine. Je suis toutes les femmes. Tu ne m\u2019as pas </em><em>vue </em>... \u201d The performance is not shown, or even alluded to, in the series, though Courbet\u2019s painting itself is displayed in a closeup that powerfully exposes the dissemblance of context. On the gallery wall it is an acceptable work of art; in reproduction, it is a crotch-shot by another name, which remains so shocking that a teacher had his Facebook account terminated when he posted it. \u201cJust think how differently we would look at it if it was called, say, Jeanette\u2019s Pussy,\u201d says Beard, who argues that the painting contains its own critique. \u201cWhat I think Courbet was doing was exposing so many other of those European nudes for exactly what they are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01162e911e3a719c7472af34dcb9e7ac6b2608d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01162e911e3a719c7472af34dcb9e7ac6b2608d1/0_380_5440_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A detail from Venus of Urbino by Titian (c1534).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail from Venus of Urbino by Titian (c1534).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: World History Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Courbet\u2019s hyperreal pictorial form of truth-telling is not unlike Beard\u2019s own. One of the great popularisers of the last decade, she has a plain-talking style which has no truck with academic jargon. \u201cIn some ways we take the nude absolutely for granted. We know it has been the centre of modern art training for hundreds of years but we can also be shocked by it and a bit of vernacular helps,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not a posh male art historian. They\u2019ve done good things on this stuff, but I think it\u2019s good for a woman presenter to do this. I don\u2019t want people only to talk in terms of tits and bums and willies \u2013 that would be unedifying \u2013 but we need to have a range of repertoire.\u201d</p> <p>Her feminist viewpoint is particularly pertinent in the case of Susanna and the Elders, a biblical story of embattled virtue that was painted several times by the early 17th-century artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/05/artemisia-gentileshi-painter-beyond-caravaggio\" title=\"\">Artemisia Gentileschi</a>. In the painting, two scheming elders loom over the naked Susanna, who has been surprised while taking a bath. Gentileschi is known to have been raped by her painting teacher. \u201cI can\u2019t help but see her rape in the figure, but I wonder if that\u2019s more about me than about her,\u201d says Beard, who notes that the version she is studying is in the collection of Burghley House, where it spent much of its life in a bedroom. \u201cI doubt anyone there saw it as an advert for sexual restraint.\u201d Where does this leave us now? Today, male genitals cross the line of what\u2019s allowed to be seen, she asserts, though this self-censorship applies in interesting ways to the female body as well. \u201cMy first introduction to pinups was at my local garage, and you wouldn\u2019t go to a garage today and see a lot of naked women in the mechanics\u2019 workshop.\u201d</p> <p>Which brings us back to the fig leaf. \u201cWhat I think is interesting is that we have a view of it as a very simple trajectory: the 19th century plastered them on and we\u2019ve taken them off, but the moment you look at historical art from the late middle ages onwards the fig leaf and the nude are always in tension with each other.\u201d</p> <p>So what of today\u2019s ubiquitous culture of selfies and dick pics? \u201cI\u2019m probably a bit old to understand the culture of the dick pic,\u201d she says. \u201cBut one of the things that is really interesting to me is, when you go to the Louvre, what do you see people doing in front of the Venus de Milo? They take selfies, and I think it\u2019s too easy to be sniffy about that. We should be more sympathetic about the selfie, because it\u2019s a new way of engaging with works of art and also with your body\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 Mary Beard\u2019s Shock of the Nude will be broadcast on BBC2 on 3 February.</em></p>",

The statue, cast in plaster from an original in the Vatican collection, has suffered \u201ca limited castration\u201d, with the result that the fig leaf \u2013 probably added in the 19th century to spare the blushes of Irish art lovers \u2013 had nothing much to hide. \u201cThere\u2019s something really ironic about these things that were meant to stop you seeing things,\u201d Beard reflects, \u201cwhen what they end up doing is saying: \u2018Look at what you can\u2019t see.\u2019\u201d Her outing to Cork comes midway through the first episode of Shock of the Nude, a two-part BBC Two series which sets out to interrogate western art\u2019s obsession with the naked body. The Cambridge classics professor has already marvelled at the marble musculature of Michelangelo\u2019s David and tried her hand at a life-drawing hen party (\u201cHe\u2019s got very good bum cheeks,\u201d enthuses one of the group). These scenes are a subversion of Beard\u2019s central thesis: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can talk about the nude unless you talk about male desire.\u201d Given the dominance of the male gaze, the programmes ask, how is a woman to find her own perspective? One of the challenges of the subject, Beard admits, was how to place herself as the presenter. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting position to find yourself in, because you\u2019re having to present views to people with your clothes on about what it\u2019s like not to have your clothes on.\u201d She is not afraid to share her own emotional responses. \u201cIn my fantasies,\u201d she says of Titian\u2019s Venus of Urbino, a reclining nude with her hand lingering suggestively over her genitals, \u201cI\u2019m with this naked lady and we\u2019re both giggling at these blokes who are leering at us.\u201d Given the brickbats that Beard has suffered over the years, this challenge to the usual formalities of art scholarship is both pointed and brave. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to be a bit resilient about this,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a team effort. We\u2019ve said what we set out to say and if you get some crap on Twitter, as I\u2019m sure we will, that was not our intention.\u201d Over the years Beard has repeatedly faced down the misogyny of the media \u2013 both conventional and social. \u201cThis is what 57-year-old women look like, deal with it,\u201d she told the critic AA Gill after he criticised her appearance in her 2012 television series, Meet the Romans. Discovering that she had been largely edited out of the American version of the landmark 2018 series Civilisations, which she presented alongside Simon Schama and David Olusoga, she wryly responded: \u201cIt looks to me that mine were more substantially edited than the others\u2019\u2026 I wonder why that was? I always try and stick up for elderly ladies with grey hair.\u201d The relevance of this very personal history, in the context of a film about the nude, is underlined in an interview with the artist Jemima Stehli, who in 2000 created a provocative set of photographs of herself stripping in front of a series of male curators and critics, to whom she had given control of the camera. One regular response, Stehli tells Beard, was \u201cWould you do this if you didn\u2019t have a body like this?\u201d Against the intransigence of the male gaze, Beard pits her own, shifting perspective. \u201cI was brought up with 1970s feminism, when the object of the male gaze was seen as a part of male appropriation of women, and there\u2019s a lot going for that position. But as I\u2019ve got older I\u2019ve begun to think: \u2018What do I do? Am I not supposed to engage with it? Step one is to see the sexual politics, but can we go beyond this? What happens with women artists? Is it just a case of exalting male desire?\u2019 But I like looking at these things and I have no intention of stopping. I think there\u2019s room for hope.\u201d Beard\u2019s story begins in Greece, in the 4th century BC, where a sculptor called Praxiteles became the first to carve a statue of a naked woman: \u201cIt was shockingly new and close to unacceptable.\u201d So intoxicating was the image of Aphrodite, \u201cwho we rather coyly call the goddess of love when she\u2019s really the goddess of sex\u201d, that one young man was reported to have driven himself mad by attempting to make love to her. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the story is true or not \u2013 \u201cit was their way of trying to talk about it\u201d. Before Praxiteles, she says, the nude was the preserve of men and represented an ideal of citizenship, embodying moral and elite virtue in figures whose genitals \u201cwere often noticeably small\u201d. She is too scrupulous a scholar to suggest that Praxiteles\u2019s Aphrodite changed all that. \u201cIt\u2019s been very hard to document the change in the viewing of the male nude, but the logic has to be that once you have sexualised the female naked form it\u2019s going to reflect back on the male one.\u201d By the time Michelangelo unveiled his David in early 16th-century Florence, the male nude had been routinely sexualised, occupying \u201cthe blurry space where art meets erotica\u201d and causing such anxiety that David himself was pelted with stones and fitted with a brass modesty belt. A brief detour into traditional African art \u2013 where the naked body is an expression of community or ritual \u2013 demonstrates the fetishistic weirdness of this western tradition, the disconnect between art and real life. \u201cWe say Jesus is naked, but we don\u2019t say nude. And what about the bodies of the elderly or anatomical models. Are they nude?\u201d Beard asks. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the naked body is the unclothed body and the nude is the naked body in art \u2013 clothed in its nudity.\u201d The programmes are partly a canter through the ruses that have been used through history to keep art and pornography apart. Both location and language play a part in this: if it\u2019s in a gallery, preferably in a gold frame, it\u2019s art. If it has a mythological subject it\u2019s art, even if \u2013 as in the case of John William Waterhouse\u2019s pre-Raphaelite painting Hylas and the Nymphs \u2013 the myth itself has long lost its significance, leaving a flotilla of pubescent girls with titillatingly budding breasts. Hylas and the Nymphs became the centre of a minor scandal two years ago when it was publicly removed from the wall of Manchester Art Gallery by the artist Sonia Boyce. The outcry \u2013 which even spilled into the Guardian letters page \u2013 was quite unfair, says Beard. The painting was never intended to be permanently censored. Its removal was in a tradition of a feminist performance that has become a way of forcing people to question what they are looking at, how and why. She cites a far more radical intervention in 2014, when the performance artist Deborah de Robertis sat down and exposed her naked crotch in front of Gustave Courbet\u2019s breathtakingly explicit L\u2019Origine du Monde in Paris\u2019s Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, repeatedly chanting \u201cJe suis l\u2019origine. Je suis toutes les femmes. Tu ne m\u2019as pas vue ... \u201d The performance is not shown, or even alluded to, in the series, though Courbet\u2019s painting itself is displayed in a closeup that powerfully exposes the dissemblance of context. On the gallery wall it is an acceptable work of art; in reproduction, it is a crotch-shot by another name, which remains so shocking that a teacher had his Facebook account terminated when he posted it. \u201cJust think how differently we would look at it if it was called, say, Jeanette\u2019s Pussy,\u201d says Beard, who argues that the painting contains its own critique. \u201cWhat I think Courbet was doing was exposing so many other of those European nudes for exactly what they are.\u201d Courbet\u2019s hyperreal pictorial form of truth-telling is not unlike Beard\u2019s own. One of the great popularisers of the last decade, she has a plain-talking style which has no truck with academic jargon. \u201cIn some ways we take the nude absolutely for granted. We know it has been the centre of modern art training for hundreds of years but we can also be shocked by it and a bit of vernacular helps,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not a posh male art historian. They\u2019ve done good things on this stuff, but I think it\u2019s good for a woman presenter to do this. I don\u2019t want people only to talk in terms of tits and bums and willies \u2013 that would be unedifying \u2013 but we need to have a range of repertoire.\u201d Her feminist viewpoint is particularly pertinent in the case of Susanna and the Elders, a biblical story of embattled virtue that was painted several times by the early 17th-century artist Artemisia Gentileschi. In the painting, two scheming elders loom over the naked Susanna, who has been surprised while taking a bath. Gentileschi is known to have been raped by her painting teacher. \u201cI can\u2019t help but see her rape in the figure, but I wonder if that\u2019s more about me than about her,\u201d says Beard, who notes that the version she is studying is in the collection of Burghley House, where it spent much of its life in a bedroom. \u201cI doubt anyone there saw it as an advert for sexual restraint.\u201d Where does this leave us now? Today, male genitals cross the line of what\u2019s allowed to be seen, she asserts, though this self-censorship applies in interesting ways to the female body as well. \u201cMy first introduction to pinups was at my local garage, and you wouldn\u2019t go to a garage today and see a lot of naked women in the mechanics\u2019 workshop.\u201d Which brings us back to the fig leaf. \u201cWhat I think is interesting is that we have a view of it as a very simple trajectory: the 19th century plastered them on and we\u2019ve taken them off, but the moment you look at historical art from the late middle ages onwards the fig leaf and the nude are always in tension with each other.\u201d So what of today\u2019s ubiquitous culture of selfies and dick pics? \u201cI\u2019m probably a bit old to understand the culture of the dick pic,\u201d she says. \u201cBut one of the things that is really interesting to me is, when you go to the Louvre, what do you see people doing in front of the Venus de Milo? They take selfies, and I think it\u2019s too easy to be sniffy about that. We should be more sympathetic about the selfie, because it\u2019s a new way of engaging with works of art and also with your body\u201d \u2022 Mary Beard\u2019s Shock of the Nude will be broadcast on BBC2 on 3 February.",

      "body": "<p>Do you know what a tweakment is?<strong> </strong>I didn\u2019t, not really, until I was lying on my back with a woman dressed in white poised to inject a needle into my face. Tweakment sounds cute, right? Well, tweak does. Like in the Mary Poppins song: \u201cMy father gave me nose a tweak.\u201d A tweak is a gesture of affection, like pinching the cheek of a toddler. Tweak tweak.</p> <p>A tweakment is a minor cosmetic procedure, one that doesn\u2019t involve being cut open or going under general anaesthetic or hiding from the world for a fortnight. (Actually, it might involve the last.) The word has come to prominence over the past few years, and is used to cover many different techniques and therapies, mostly done to your face.</p> <p>Botox and fillers are two of the most common tweakments, and they are the ones I\u2019ve agreed to undergo. I didn\u2019t really think about any of this properly before arriving \u2013 I\u2019ve been busy, and this is research for a book I\u2019m writing, rather than something I\u2019ve been fretting over \u2013 so it\u2019s a bit of a shock to find myself in Caterham, Surrey, in the Rakushka clinic of Dr Elena Karnovitch. Karnovitch is medically qualified (she works in an NHS hospital as an acute medicine consultant) and far from an idiot. She insisted on a half-hour Skype consultation before I came in, during which she explained what could and could not be done with my fiftysomething, insufficiently moisturised face. She was managing my expectations, though my expectations were low and ill-informed, boiling down to two things. Does this stuff wear off? And: I don\u2019t want to look mad. (Yes, and she knows.)</p> <p>Beauty clinics are much like any other private medical clinic: clean and bright, with certificates on the wall and a bed that goes up and down. And they contain syringes. Thin-needled syringes are the primary instruments for tweakments, though there are others: cannulas (blunt needles), lasers, spiky rollers, LED face masks that make you look like a cyborg, other strange instruments that would make anyone who is scared of the dentist automatically clench their teeth.</p> <p>Karnovitch, 46, has, as you might expect, blemish-free skin. I couldn\u2019t see a single mark on her face, not even an open pore. She tries every treatment on herself first and is her own living advert. She\u2019s less expensive than Harley Street practitioners, because she doesn\u2019t have high rent or a receptionist, and some clients get cabs to her clinic from central London, especially as she speaks fluent Russian. Tweakments are still far from cheap, though: a single syringe costs between \u00a3200 and \u00a3500. Be aware that, according to my accountant, you can\u2019t claim any of this back against tax. Not even if you\u2019re a drag queen.</p> <p>Karnovitch shows me each needle before she injects it. She has already explained that if something goes wrong, she has an antidote to hand, and that\u2019s why she works with the products she does: because there is an antidote. We don\u2019t need it. Some of the injections hurt a bit, but not much, and after half an hour, I\u2019m done. She takes pictures of my face before and after, not just to show me, but for her insurance. (I don\u2019t tell her until later that I\u2019m writing about this.)</p> <p>I get into the car and turn the rearview mirror to look at myself. I appear to be the same, but without frown lines and with more prominent cheekbones. Do I look weird? Am I still me? I feel a bit sick.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Should I feel odd? I\u2019m simply joining a party that started many years ago. A tragic latecomer, in fact.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a60b6f22459653ca4472889e12c933e67d2b3638\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a60b6f22459653ca4472889e12c933e67d2b3638/76_371_2677_3344/801.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Barton Hanson\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Love Island 2015\u2019s Megan Barton-Hanson has talked about her tweakments.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I remember when Botox first arrived in the UK, in the 1990s, those innocent, messy years before it became normal to be slick. Back then, by today\u2019s standards, we were a bit unkempt. Nails were clippered, skincare uncomplicated. No one had heard of retinol. And Botox was the preserve of the wealthy, whether celebrities or not; not an everyday maintenance, like getting your hair cut, but something more serious, like a facelift, or a boob job.</p> <p>But that was then. These days, you can\u2019t move for immaculate manicures, fleeky eyebrows and skin like almond icing. Over time and especially in the past few years, Instagram, reality TV, older media stars and self-promoting celebrities have combined to offer up a new aesthetic. For the young, may I present the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\" title=\"\">Love Island</a> look, or \u201crich girl face\u201d. Full lips, wide eyes, straight nose, smooth skin, sleek lines. Plus body to match. For those seduced by this look (and many young people are) an Instagram selfie requires more than a bucketful of foundation and pulling a duck mouth. Because to be Instagram pretty \u2013 phone arm up, lighting behind you, always photo-ready! \u2013 is to be absolutely perfect. A flawless cartoon, a Disney princess.</p> <p>If you\u2019re older, the look is different. Harder to spot, because it\u2019s a sort of stasis. To be deemed good-looking in your middle years, your face should remain the same as it did in your late 30s/early 40s. Actually, for some stars, their faces get younger: plumper cheeks, especially just beneath the eyes, shallower lines around the mouth, a tauter neck, more defined cheekbones. On Facebook, adverts show me women in their 50s smoothing lotion on their foreheads or concealer under their eyes, and I think: surely that\u2019s not what makes you look so young? In magazines, media stars and actresses a full decade older than I am display skin that looks like my nine year old\u2019s.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Suddenly, I\u2019m a derma-detective. The Miss Marple of tweakments, the Botox PI. I see tweakees everywhere</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m unsure what\u2019s going on. Maybe these people are all special, maybe it is all \u201cgood bones\u201d and daily sunscreen. Because the effect of excellent tweakments is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/simoncowell\" title=\"\">Simon \u201cSweet Jesus!\u201d Cowell</a>, but something far more subtle. I look at famous people whom I\u2019ve looked at for years, and they seem to be gradually fading into the background, replaced by a smoothed out, less characterful, very beautiful person. They look great, but they don\u2019t look like them. </p> <p>All of this means that after I leave Karnovitch\u2019s clinic, the biggest effect of my tweakments has nothing to do with how I see myself. It\u2019s how I look at others. Suddenly, I\u2019m a derma-detective. The Miss Marple of tweakments, the Botox PI. I see tweakees everywhere. It seems to me that every TV presenter, and many actors over the age of 35, male and female, are tweaked. Spot of Botox in the frown lines, bit of filler in the cheeks. Now I\u2019m in the club, I see it. Those cheekbones! That smoothness! I watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/graham-norton\" title=\"\">Graham Norton</a>, check the faces of his guests, and I see it. I watch films with award-winning actors, known for being authentic, and I see it. Among my friends, I don\u2019t: most people don\u2019t spend money this way. But some who work in fashion or beauty, yes; also a couple in the music industry, where it\u2019s cool to look natural, like \u201cI just woke up like this\u201d.</p> <p>This new knowledge is a bit disturbing. I don\u2019t want to be looking at people I admire, and thinking: \u201cCheat\u201d. Not because they\u2019ve had work done \u2013 it\u2019s their face, after all \u2013 but because they don\u2019t admit that they have. Because they\u2019re embarrassed. I understand that. I am, too.</p> <p>***</p> <p>My new spotting power is not unusual, says Alice Hart-Davis. \u201cOnce you know what you\u2019re looking for, you see it everywhere,\u201d she says. And neither is my sick feeling. This happens every single time you\u2019re tweaked, she says. An initial, stomach-sinking, \u201cwhat have I done?\u201d dread is part of the process. \u201cI have it every time,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I have a lot of tweakments.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"790680639f77bddf3f79b72267075cfaa67018be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/790680639f77bddf3f79b72267075cfaa67018be/196_130_1506_1883/800.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Cowell\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Cowell has talked in the past about having \u2018too much Botox\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hart-Davis, 56, is the go-to beauty journalist for tweakments. She\u2019s written The Tweakments Guide, and has a <a href=\"https://thetweakmentsguide.com/\" title=\"\">well-researched </a><a href=\"https://thetweakmentsguide.com/\" title=\"\">website</a> that lists qualified and recommended practitioners (Karnovitch is there). She posts videos, holds seminars and is honest about which procedures she has had done: recently she had SVF facial rejuvenation, which seems to me like a major operation. Stem cells were removed from her thighs, spun around in a centrifuge, and then the resulting \u201cconcentrated stem-cell soup\u201d (her words) reinjected into her face. The cells mix with fat and regrow, transforming her face from the inside out. Is this a tweakment? Apparently so.</p> <p>Hart-Davis, like all the beauty experts I talk to, divides those who have tweakments into two distinct camps. The first, and largest group, is the middle-aged (35 to 55, according to Karnovitch, who says 25% of her clients are men). These people are cautious. They want a very light effect, just a wrinkle or two softened, a bit of skin-smoothing. They don\u2019t want to look younger. They want to look \u201cfresher\u201d, \u201cless tired\u201d, like \u201cthe best version\u201d of themselves. As with the beauty industry in general \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re worth it\u201d, \u201creal beauty\u201d \u2013 tweakments have moved to a positive, pseudo-feminist language to sell their wares. </p> <p>There are other clients. Karnovitch mentions a small but significant group of people: women whose marriages have recently broken up. But much more common are younger people, men and mostly women in their 20s and early 30s. They\u2019re after \u201cenhancement\u201d, says Karnovitch. \u201cDrama,\u201d says Hart-Davis. \u201cBlink impact \u2013 where you make an impression in the blink of an eye. Someone sees you and goes, \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201d These clients want cheekbones more dramatic, lips fuller, to strengthen their chin. They\u2019ve grown up with the Kardashians and know what Kim and co looked like before they went to beauty clinics. \u201cThe problem,\u201d says Hart-Davis, \u201cis that they\u2019re young and don\u2019t have much money. So they choose what they get according to price. And the cheapest person is not the one who is medically qualified.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cafcacb0eec7faca0105e99c5750b58cd0ca3b75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cafcacb0eec7faca0105e99c5750b58cd0ca3b75/564_179_2140_2672/801.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Kardashian\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tweakment clients in their 20s and early 30s have grown up with Kim Kardashian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cosmetic surgery, being elective, isn\u2019t regulated like the NHS. Anyone can set up as a practitioner. (Love Islander <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7711009/GP-slams-Wild-West-approach-Botox-Love-Island-star-qualifies-treatments.html\" title=\"\">Rykard Jenkins</a> went on a week\u2019s training course and started offering microneedling, injectable fillers and microblading.) You can even buy syringes of dermal fillers online and do it yourself (if you\u2019re mad). Unlike Botox (there are other makes, but no one remembers them), which is careful to only supply medical professionals, fillers are widely available in the UK as they are not classed as prescription medicine.</p> <p>When I ask Karnovitch which hashtags she uses to get attention on Instagram, she mentions a few. But not #Botox. Regulation brought in this month by the Committees of Advertising Practice and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency means medically qualified practitioners <a href=\"https://www.asa.org.uk/news/we-re-using-new-technology-to-enforce-botox-ad-ban.html\" title=\"\">aren\u2019t allowed to hashtag Botox any more</a>. Anyone else can use #Botox until they \u2013 or their clients \u2013 are blue in the face.</p> <p>Botox and fillers are often confused. After all, they\u2019re both injections. But there\u2019s a big difference. Botox takes about two minutes, and doesn\u2019t really hurt. It\u2019s a type of protein, a toxin that temporarily relaxes muscles. So if you have wrinkles around your eye, or on your forehead, you get Botox. It relaxes the muscles there so they stop working as well. (It can also be used to stop excess sweating and, sometimes, migraines.) The effects last around three months.</p> <p>For other so-called problem areas, fillers are used. The injections go deeper, and hurt a little. For hollow eyes, the filler isn\u2019t injected directly beneath the socket, but at the top and side of the cheeks, so the extra volume there pulls the skin tauter. That\u2019s why tweakment lovers have such prominent cheekbones. Fillers are also used on lips: often over four or five sessions, so that the skin stretches to accommodate the new fullness. They can be injected into the lines around your mouth, so they are fainter; and in the corners of your mouth to stop drooping. They can be used on the chin, to make the jawline sharper. They can even be used on saggy earlobes. The effects last around 18 months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"11c2120f7ea2c35e24c539174e29e4e8636d20e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11c2120f7ea2c35e24c539174e29e4e8636d20e7/0_0_5000_1312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Balloons with lips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"262\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018That stomach-sinking what have I done?

It sounds permanent and rigid, like Polyfilla. And at one point the products were a little like that. (Karnovitch tells me that she still sees some women, usually those who have had work in Brazil, who have permanent fillers in their faces. Any changes to those require surgery.) These days, though, fillers are usually some form of hyaluronic acid, the current beauty wonder ingredient. It occurs naturally in connective tissue, but we lose it as we age. Lots of moisturisers have hyaluronic acid as an ingredient.</p> <p>The filler effect is not always dramatic, but can be transformative. At the clinic, Karnovitch shows me pictures of her clients. They are ordinary, middle-aged women, with messy hair and half-smiles. They\u2019re having their jawline sharpened, their eye bags reduced; their insecurities made smaller, or muted. They look\u2026 normal. And I don\u2019t mean celebrity normal. Normal-normal.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Fiona Golfar, 57, journalist and broadcaster, is cohost of <a href=\"https://drmaryamzamani.com/podcasts/\" title=\"\">The Guinea Pig podcast</a>. (The other host is Dr Maryam Zamani, a cosmetic practitioner who offers a vast array of treatments and tweakments at her Sloane Street clinic.) The first time Golfar had Botox was in the 1990s. Her husband had said that if she had anything done to her face, he would divorce her. So she chose a clinic that was some distance from where they lived. She went overboard: \u201cI got Botox everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cI was frozen like a lake.\u201d When she left the hospital, she crossed the road, and who should she see at that very moment but her husband and his brother. She was so stricken that when her brother-in-law said to her, \u201cWhat are you doing here? Are you having an affair with a doctor?\u201d she replied, \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cIt seemed better than the truth,\u201d she says. (She and her husband are still together. He\u2019s got used to her changing her looks.)</p> <p>Golfar says there are two reasons tweakments have become more popular. One is that the available options are \u201cmuch less obvious and more effective\u201d, and the other is that \u201chonesty is the new black\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s fashionable to be open,\u201d she says. \u201cSelf-revelation is in. We\u2019re all aware that it\u2019s better for our mental health to be honest about our insecurities and our lives. And I\u2019m happy to say that I love Profhilo [a brand of filler]. I\u2019d drink it in my coffee if I could.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c5d123a008eccc381aafa4083bb3dd91f27377d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5d123a008eccc381aafa4083bb3dd91f27377d2/105_25_1765_2206/800.jpg\" alt=\"Madonna\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Madonna at 60.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She also highlights the \u201ctreat\u201d part of treatment. \u201cIn the past, if you\u2019d had a horrible week at work, then you might go out and get drunk. Or have a cake. Now, that something for yourself could be a spot of Botox. It\u2019s all in the promise, isn\u2019t it? The promise of something that might make you feel better. You can find it in drugs, or exercise. Or a needle or a laser. I\u2019d rather spend \u00a3300 on a filler than on a high-class face cream,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a better investment.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s because she understands all these feelings that she and Zamani started The Guinea Pig. They want, says Golfar, to be \u201cthe breath you take before you do anything\u201d. And because the podcast is out there, she finds that other people are talking more openly to her. \u201cAsking someone where they got their teeth bleached, or their skin hydrated, or their eyebrows microbladed, or their lips done, is the same as asking them where they bought their shoes,\u201d she says.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Are tweakments now so normal that we chat about them with strangers? I\u2019m not so sure. Rare is the Hollywood actress or older model who looks her age, and yet very few speak about what they do to maintain their appearance (Cindy Crawford is an honourable exception.) Partly, I suppose, this is because it would be rude for an interviewer to ask a star about such things. May I ask you to attempt to frown? How come you don\u2019t have any laughter lines? </p> <p>Plus, they don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s so prevalent. Within certain demographics, not just actors, \u201cBotox is like going to the dentist. You make a regular appointment, and you nip out in your lunch hour and get it done.\u201d So says Funmi Fetto, the Observer\u2019s beauty columnist and executive editor of Glamour. \u201cThere are loads of girls in their 20s who have it. It\u2019s about preventive measures \u2013 they want to prevent wrinkles from ever coming.\u201d</p> <p>Fetto is one of \u201ca handful\u201d of UK beauty writers who have had no tweakments at all. But she understands the pressure. \u201cI completely understand why actresses get tweakments,\u201d she says. \u201cIf everyone else is doing it, it\u2019s hard to be an outlier. There aren\u2019t so many parts for older women anyway, and if everyone else looks fresher than you, then you\u2019re going to join the club.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They take a selfie, then Facetune their face to get the look they want, take a screenshot and take it into a clinic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fetto says that fillers and Botox are not so prevalent among women of colour. \u201cWe\u2019re more concerned with pigmentation,\u201d she says. \u201cAgeing isn\u2019t so much of a concern, partly because of that cliche, black don\u2019t crack \u2013 it takes a while before we get wrinkles. But it\u2019s also because age is not seen as such a negative thing. Particularly in African culture, age is seen as a thing of beauty in itself, because it comes with wisdom.\u201d However, she says this is changing. Western society has a disproportionate impact on the world. And when it comes to younger people, there\u2019s a strange, pick-and-mix racial attitude to the looks that they want. A recent <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/decade-in-review/the-age-of-instagram-face\" title=\"\">New Yorker article</a> pointed out the fashion for \u201ca South Asian influence with the brows and eye shape, an African-American influence with the lips, a Caucasian influence with the nose, a cheek structure that is predominantly Native American and Middle Eastern\u201d. (It reminds me of Victorian colonial explorers raiding new lands and bringing home skulls.) Nothing to do with ageing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about using apps,\u201d says Fetto. \u201cThey take a selfie, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate\" title=\"\">Face</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate\" title=\"\">tune their face</a> until they get the look they want, take a screenshot and take it into a clinic. With millennials that\u2019s a huge thing, and it\u2019s not any particular race. There\u2019s a dysmorphia, a generally warped idea of what we look like, but also what we should look like. Lots of talk about loving yourself and celebrating your body, but a huge rise in tweakments.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Saul is a lawyer for TJL Solicitors in Manchester, a practice that specialises in cosmetic surgery negligence cases. He usually handles cases that involve \u201cinvasive surgery\u201d (nose jobs, boob jobs, butt lifts, liposuction) which, when they go wrong, can have catastrophic results. Tweakments, being less invasive, risk less serious complications, though he has seen some \u201csignificant problems\u201d. The most serious was occlusion of an artery. He won a case for a client who lost their sight in one eye when dermal filler was injected into their central retinal artery. And he recalls a couple of times when Botox was injected into the jawline and neck, resulting in problems with swallowing and, in one awful case, an emergency tracheotomy, because the patient couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>The majority of his cases, says Saul, involve nonqualified practitioners. His practice has been trying to encourage better regulation of this growing industry for years. But the government has only been \u201cpaying lip service\u201d; they have promised regulation, but haven\u2019t really done anything about it. Since clients are getting this work for aesthetic, rather than medical reasons, the general attitude is, he feels, tough luck: \u201cYou brought it on yourself.\u201d But he\u2019s seen how awful it is for people when things go wrong. Lumpy lips, \u201ccontour deformity\u201d, infection, new fillers injected into areas where old fillers remained, clients left with abscesses, and \u201casymmetry\u201d.</p> <p>I mention a recent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p080bwj9\" title=\"\">Woman\u2019s Hour </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p080bwj9\" title=\"\">interview</a> with a mother whose 17-year-old ran up \u00a315,000 on her credit card on fillers and a nose job. You should be 18 to have rhinoplasty, but no one asked for ID. \u201cThat is rare, but the younger generation is very vulnerable,\u201d says Saul. \u201cSocial media puts a pressure on their appearance already, and they think surgery or a treatment will be a panacea. So if it goes wrong, and they\u2019re left with an even bigger problem, then this is doubly devastating. The psychological effects can be terrible.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>How are my psychological effects? Not terrible, by any means. My face looks fine. My life continues. I\u2019m rational enough to know that I haven\u2019t fundamentally changed \u2013 you don\u2019t erase a lifetime with a needle, as any decent practitioner will tell you \u2013 but that initial clench in my stomach takes a while to disappear. I feel as if I\u2019ve stepped over a line. I\u2019ve become someone else. Who? One of those people. If you believe yourself to be feminist and essentially secure, then messing with the contours of your face will mess with your idea of yourself. I am not me. I am embarrassed. So I don\u2019t tell anyone, and instead silently challenge the world to play a game with me: someone has to spot that my face is a new face, that I am frozen and filled. Unfortunately, no one notices. Not my husband, not my kids, not my mum, not any of my friends. Perhaps people are too busy to look at each other closely, too polite to say anything if they spot something strange. It\u2019s like getting a new haircut that your family ignores. I notice though. Are my eyebrows too far apart? Why do my cheeks plump up like I\u2019m 25 when I smile? I check myself in the mirror a lot more than usual. I take selfies of me trying to frown. I don\u2019t think this is helpful.</p> <p>The only time anyone says anything is when I interview a footballer and a rap star. The photographer, whom I work with a lot, says, \u201cYou look well, Miranda.\u201d She has the eye, she sees the new contours. But I still don\u2019t tell her what I\u2019ve done. We talk about my gold trainers instead, about sourcing cool secondhand jeans \u2013 just as vain, really, but the stuff of vanity that suits my self-image. </p> <p>This is, apparently, me acting my age. Everyone I talk to says people in their 20s and 30s are far more open and relaxed about getting work done. They\u2019re used to sharing, or haven\u2019t reached an age where they feel the need to lie.</p> <p>I talk to Tom, a man in his early 30s who\u2019s had a bit of work. \u201cOh God, I told everybody,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m an oversharer.\u201d In his 20s he was concerned about his eye wrinkles, and a beauty editor advised him to try Plexr, a nonsurgical treatment where the practitioner \u201cstabs loads of holes in the skin so they lift up that area\u201d. But he was unsatisfied with the results, so last year he had proper surgery, the kind you need to be knocked out for. He\u2019s happy with the decision. It cost him a lot of money but now, he says, when he\u2019s out late at a club, and he steps into \u201cthose strip-lit toilets and I catch sight of myself in the mirror, I feel it\u2019s definitely worth it. Before, that would wreck my night. If that five grand has brought me five or 10 years without that feeling, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p> <p>He admits that he, too, has been affected by social media, by how his selfies look. \u201cYou can laugh,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been a Jennifer Lopez fan since I was 10. Obviously I follow her on Instagram, and she is not ageing. Somewhere deep inside me I think: why is she not ageing and I am?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As our eyes become even more accustomed to this non-ageing, this rubbing out of character, we normalise it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In previous eras, if you were a Jennifer Lopez fan, or \u2013 like me \u2013 a Madonna fan, you would tape TV shows, buy magazines, go to concerts. Your sense of what Madonna looked like would shift only when a new photo session was released. Now, if you\u2019re a fan of any celebrity, it\u2019s like they\u2019re part of your family. They post on Instagram, tease clips on Twitter, release tunes to TikTok. They are more exposed, so of course they get tweakments to make their faces look better on social media. Madonna doesn\u2019t disguise the work she has had done, but others are more subtle. They look fresh, they look dewy. They don\u2019t appear to grow older. </p> <p>And as our eyes become even more accustomed to this non-ageing, this rubbing out of character and past life from every famous face, we normalise it. Because the new tweakees still have expressions: modern fillers mean they can crinkle their smile lines, raise their eyebrows. They\u2019re not frozen, that\u2019s not what\u2019s weird. What\u2019s weird is that they all look the same. Lovely. Happy. Smooth between the eyebrows, with beautiful bone structure, glowing skin. No slack necks, no weak chins. Nothing unseemly.</p> <p>Perhaps the younger, Botox-in-your-20s generation will age like celebrities. As ever, it will be money that divides. Richer people will pay experienced doctors to work on them; those with less money will go to less qualified people, or not bother at all. And aside from celebrities, with every podcast, book and website on the subject, tweakments are further normalised. It\u2019s like taking drugs: once you realise how many people are doing them, they don\u2019t seem so bad. Now I\u2019m a tweakee, tweakments don\u2019t seem scary. Expensive, yes, and a faff (like drugs!): but not scary. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d get Botox again \u2013 I like my laughter lines, the grooves around my mouth \u2013 but having better skin has been nice. \u201cPeople get more tweakments,\u201d says Karnovitch, \u201cbecause they see what happens when they wear off.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>How do you stop? Or when? For some, their face becomes an ongoing project, like those people who never finish getting their house redecorated. And once one house in the road has been done up, then all the others feel the pressure to gentrify. To gentrify, but magically, with silent builders, that no one sees. Because to talk about it is mortifying. The worst part of my tweakments, for me, was admitting that I had it done. Still, that\u2019s changing. L\u2019Or\u00e9al recently added \u201cFiller\u201d and \u201cLaser Renew\u201d to its long-standing Revitalift skincare range, put them in packaging that looks like tweakment instruments.</p> <p>When Tom went home for Christmas, his family were impressed with the results of his eye procedure. His sister said to her husband, \u201cYour lip dips down in the middle, maybe you should do something about that.\u201d Her husband isn\u2019t on Instagram. He\u2019s a roofer. </p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Do you know what a tweakment is? I didn\u2019t, not really, until I was lying on my back with a woman dressed in white poised to inject a needle into my face. Tweakment sounds cute, right? Well, tweak does. Like in the Mary Poppins song: \u201cMy father gave me nose a tweak.\u201d A tweak is a gesture of affection, like pinching the cheek of a toddler. Tweak tweak. A tweakment is a minor cosmetic procedure, one that doesn\u2019t involve being cut open or going under general anaesthetic or hiding from the world for a fortnight. (Actually, it might involve the last.) The word has come to prominence over the past few years, and is used to cover many different techniques and therapies, mostly done to your face. Botox and fillers are two of the most common tweakments, and they are the ones I\u2019ve agreed to undergo. I didn\u2019t really think about any of this properly before arriving \u2013 I\u2019ve been busy, and this is research for a book I\u2019m writing, rather than something I\u2019ve been fretting over \u2013 so it\u2019s a bit of a shock to find myself in Caterham, Surrey, in the Rakushka clinic of Dr Elena Karnovitch. Karnovitch is medically qualified (she works in an NHS hospital as an acute medicine consultant) and far from an idiot. She insisted on a half-hour Skype consultation before I came in, during which she explained what could and could not be done with my fiftysomething, insufficiently moisturised face. She was managing my expectations, though my expectations were low and ill-informed, boiling down to two things. Does this stuff wear off? And: I don\u2019t want to look mad. (Yes, and she knows.) Beauty clinics are much like any other private medical clinic: clean and bright, with certificates on the wall and a bed that goes up and down. And they contain syringes. Thin-needled syringes are the primary instruments for tweakments, though there are others: cannulas (blunt needles), lasers, spiky rollers, LED face masks that make you look like a cyborg, other strange instruments that would make anyone who is scared of the dentist automatically clench their teeth. Karnovitch, 46, has, as you might expect, blemish-free skin. I couldn\u2019t see a single mark on her face, not even an open pore. She tries every treatment on herself first and is her own living advert. She\u2019s less expensive than Harley Street practitioners, because she doesn\u2019t have high rent or a receptionist, and some clients get cabs to her clinic from central London, especially as she speaks fluent Russian. Tweakments are still far from cheap, though: a single syringe costs between \u00a3200 and \u00a3500. Be aware that, according to my accountant, you can\u2019t claim any of this back against tax. Not even if you\u2019re a drag queen. Karnovitch shows me each needle before she injects it. She has already explained that if something goes wrong, she has an antidote to hand, and that\u2019s why she works with the products she does: because there is an antidote. We don\u2019t need it. Some of the injections hurt a bit, but not much, and after half an hour, I\u2019m done. She takes pictures of my face before and after, not just to show me, but for her insurance. (I don\u2019t tell her until later that I\u2019m writing about this.) I get into the car and turn the rearview mirror to look at myself. I appear to be the same, but without frown lines and with more prominent cheekbones. Do I look weird? Am I still me? I feel a bit sick. *** Should I feel odd? I\u2019m simply joining a party that started many years ago. A tragic latecomer, in fact. I remember when Botox first arrived in the UK, in the 1990s, those innocent, messy years before it became normal to be slick. Back then, by today\u2019s standards, we were a bit unkempt. Nails were clippered, skincare uncomplicated. No one had heard of retinol. And Botox was the preserve of the wealthy, whether celebrities or not; not an everyday maintenance, like getting your hair cut, but something more serious, like a facelift, or a boob job. But that was then. These days, you can\u2019t move for immaculate manicures, fleeky eyebrows and skin like almond icing. Over time and especially in the past few years, Instagram, reality TV, older media stars and self-promoting celebrities have combined to offer up a new aesthetic. For the young, may I present the Love Island look, or \u201crich girl face\u201d. Full lips, wide eyes, straight nose, smooth skin, sleek lines. Plus body to match. For those seduced by this look (and many young people are) an Instagram selfie requires more than a bucketful of foundation and pulling a duck mouth. Because to be Instagram pretty \u2013 phone arm up, lighting behind you, always photo-ready! \u2013 is to be absolutely perfect. A flawless cartoon, a Disney princess. If you\u2019re older, the look is different. Harder to spot, because it\u2019s a sort of stasis. To be deemed good-looking in your middle years, your face should remain the same as it did in your late 30s/early 40s. Actually, for some stars, their faces get younger: plumper cheeks, especially just beneath the eyes, shallower lines around the mouth, a tauter neck, more defined cheekbones. On Facebook, adverts show me women in their 50s smoothing lotion on their foreheads or concealer under their eyes, and I think: surely that\u2019s not what makes you look so young? In magazines, media stars and actresses a full decade older than I am display skin that looks like my nine year old\u2019s. I\u2019m unsure what\u2019s going on. Maybe these people are all special, maybe it is all \u201cgood bones\u201d and daily sunscreen. Because the effect of excellent tweakments is not Simon \u201cSweet Jesus!\u201d Cowell, but something far more subtle. I look at famous people whom I\u2019ve looked at for years, and they seem to be gradually fading into the background, replaced by a smoothed out, less characterful, very beautiful person. They look great, but they don\u2019t look like them. All of this means that after I leave Karnovitch\u2019s clinic, the biggest effect of my tweakments has nothing to do with how I see myself. It\u2019s how I look at others. Suddenly, I\u2019m a derma-detective. The Miss Marple of tweakments, the Botox PI. I see tweakees everywhere. It seems to me that every TV presenter, and many actors over the age of 35, male and female, are tweaked. Spot of Botox in the frown lines, bit of filler in the cheeks. Now I\u2019m in the club, I see it. Those cheekbones! That smoothness! I watch Graham Norton, check the faces of his guests, and I see it. I watch films with award-winning actors, known for being authentic, and I see it. Among my friends, I don\u2019t: most people don\u2019t spend money this way. But some who work in fashion or beauty, yes; also a couple in the music industry, where it\u2019s cool to look natural, like \u201cI just woke up like this\u201d. This new knowledge is a bit disturbing. I don\u2019t want to be looking at people I admire, and thinking: \u201cCheat\u201d. Not because they\u2019ve had work done \u2013 it\u2019s their face, after all \u2013 but because they don\u2019t admit that they have. Because they\u2019re embarrassed. I understand that. I am, too. *** My new spotting power is not unusual, says Alice Hart-Davis. \u201cOnce you know what you\u2019re looking for, you see it everywhere,\u201d she says. And neither is my sick feeling. This happens every single time you\u2019re tweaked, she says. An initial, stomach-sinking, \u201cwhat have I done?\u201d dread is part of the process. \u201cI have it every time,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I have a lot of tweakments.\u201d Hart-Davis, 56, is the go-to beauty journalist for tweakments. She\u2019s written The Tweakments Guide, and has a well-researched website that lists qualified and recommended practitioners (Karnovitch is there). She posts videos, holds seminars and is honest about which procedures she has had done: recently she had SVF facial rejuvenation, which seems to me like a major operation. Stem cells were removed from her thighs, spun around in a centrifuge, and then the resulting \u201cconcentrated stem-cell soup\u201d (her words) reinjected into her face. The cells mix with fat and regrow, transforming her face from the inside out. Is this a tweakment? Apparently so. Hart-Davis, like all the beauty experts I talk to, divides those who have tweakments into two distinct camps. The first, and largest group, is the middle-aged (35 to 55, according to Karnovitch, who says 25% of her clients are men). These people are cautious. They want a very light effect, just a wrinkle or two softened, a bit of skin-smoothing. They don\u2019t want to look younger. They want to look \u201cfresher\u201d, \u201cless tired\u201d, like \u201cthe best version\u201d of themselves. As with the beauty industry in general \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re worth it\u201d, \u201creal beauty\u201d \u2013 tweakments have moved to a positive, pseudo-feminist language to sell their wares. There are other clients. Karnovitch mentions a small but significant group of people: women whose marriages have recently broken up. But much more common are younger people, men and mostly women in their 20s and early 30s. They\u2019re after \u201cenhancement\u201d, says Karnovitch. \u201cDrama,\u201d says Hart-Davis. \u201cBlink impact \u2013 where you make an impression in the blink of an eye. Someone sees you and goes, \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201d These clients want cheekbones more dramatic, lips fuller, to strengthen their chin. They\u2019ve grown up with the Kardashians and know what Kim and co looked like before they went to beauty clinics. \u201cThe problem,\u201d says Hart-Davis, \u201cis that they\u2019re young and don\u2019t have much money. So they choose what they get according to price. And the cheapest person is not the one who is medically qualified.\u201d Cosmetic surgery, being elective, isn\u2019t regulated like the NHS. Anyone can set up as a practitioner. (Love Islander Rykard Jenkins went on a week\u2019s training course and started offering microneedling, injectable fillers and microblading.) You can even buy syringes of dermal fillers online and do it yourself (if you\u2019re mad). Unlike Botox (there are other makes, but no one remembers them), which is careful to only supply medical professionals, fillers are widely available in the UK as they are not classed as prescription medicine. When I ask Karnovitch which hashtags she uses to get attention on Instagram, she mentions a few. But not #Botox. Regulation brought in this month by the Committees of Advertising Practice and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency means medically qualified practitioners aren\u2019t allowed to hashtag Botox any more. Anyone else can use #Botox until they \u2013 or their clients \u2013 are blue in the face. Botox and fillers are often confused. After all, they\u2019re both injections. But there\u2019s a big difference. Botox takes about two minutes, and doesn\u2019t really hurt. It\u2019s a type of protein, a toxin that temporarily relaxes muscles. So if you have wrinkles around your eye, or on your forehead, you get Botox. It relaxes the muscles there so they stop working as well. (It can also be used to stop excess sweating and, sometimes, migraines.) The effects last around three months. For other so-called problem areas, fillers are used. The injections go deeper, and hurt a little. For hollow eyes, the filler isn\u2019t injected directly beneath the socket, but at the top and side of the cheeks, so the extra volume there pulls the skin tauter. That\u2019s why tweakment lovers have such prominent cheekbones. Fillers are also used on lips: often over four or five sessions, so that the skin stretches to accommodate the new fullness. They can be injected into the lines around your mouth, so they are fainter; and in the corners of your mouth to stop drooping. They can be used on the chin, to make the jawline sharper. They can even be used on saggy earlobes. The effects last around 18 months. Filler is a strange word. It sounds permanent and rigid, like Polyfilla. And at one point the products were a little like that. (Karnovitch tells me that she still sees some women, usually those who have had work in Brazil, who have permanent fillers in their faces. Any changes to those require surgery.) These days, though, fillers are usually some form of hyaluronic acid, the current beauty wonder ingredient. It occurs naturally in connective tissue, but we lose it as we age. Lots of moisturisers have hyaluronic acid as an ingredient. The filler effect is not always dramatic, but can be transformative. At the clinic, Karnovitch shows me pictures of her clients. They are ordinary, middle-aged women, with messy hair and half-smiles. They\u2019re having their jawline sharpened, their eye bags reduced; their insecurities made smaller, or muted. They look\u2026 normal. And I don\u2019t mean celebrity normal. Normal-normal. *** Fiona Golfar, 57, journalist and broadcaster, is cohost of The Guinea Pig podcast. (The other host is Dr Maryam Zamani, a cosmetic practitioner who offers a vast array of treatments and tweakments at her Sloane Street clinic.) The first time Golfar had Botox was in the 1990s. Her husband had said that if she had anything done to her face, he would divorce her. So she chose a clinic that was some distance from where they lived. She went overboard: \u201cI got Botox everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cI was frozen like a lake.\u201d When she left the hospital, she crossed the road, and who should she see at that very moment but her husband and his brother. She was so stricken that when her brother-in-law said to her, \u201cWhat are you doing here? Are you having an affair with a doctor?\u201d she replied, \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cIt seemed better than the truth,\u201d she says. (She and her husband are still together. He\u2019s got used to her changing her looks.) Golfar says there are two reasons tweakments have become more popular. One is that the available options are \u201cmuch less obvious and more effective\u201d, and the other is that \u201chonesty is the new black\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s fashionable to be open,\u201d she says. \u201cSelf-revelation is in. We\u2019re all aware that it\u2019s better for our mental health to be honest about our insecurities and our lives. And I\u2019m happy to say that I love Profhilo [a brand of filler]. I\u2019d drink it in my coffee if I could.\u201d She also highlights the \u201ctreat\u201d part of treatment. \u201cIn the past, if you\u2019d had a horrible week at work, then you might go out and get drunk. Or have a cake. Now, that something for yourself could be a spot of Botox. It\u2019s all in the promise, isn\u2019t it? The promise of something that might make you feel better. You can find it in drugs, or exercise. Or a needle or a laser. I\u2019d rather spend \u00a3300 on a filler than on a high-class face cream,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a better investment.\u201d It\u2019s because she understands all these feelings that she and Zamani started The Guinea Pig. They want, says Golfar, to be \u201cthe breath you take before you do anything\u201d. And because the podcast is out there, she finds that other people are talking more openly to her. \u201cAsking someone where they got their teeth bleached, or their skin hydrated, or their eyebrows microbladed, or their lips done, is the same as asking them where they bought their shoes,\u201d she says. *** Are tweakments now so normal that we chat about them with strangers? I\u2019m not so sure. Rare is the Hollywood actress or older model who looks her age, and yet very few speak about what they do to maintain their appearance (Cindy Crawford is an honourable exception.) Partly, I suppose, this is because it would be rude for an interviewer to ask a star about such things. May I ask you to attempt to frown? How come you don\u2019t have any laughter lines? Plus, they don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s so prevalent. Within certain demographics, not just actors, \u201cBotox is like going to the dentist. You make a regular appointment, and you nip out in your lunch hour and get it done.\u201d So says Funmi Fetto, the Observer\u2019s beauty columnist and executive editor of Glamour. \u201cThere are loads of girls in their 20s who have it. It\u2019s about preventive measures \u2013 they want to prevent wrinkles from ever coming.\u201d Fetto is one of \u201ca handful\u201d of UK beauty writers who have had no tweakments at all. But she understands the pressure. \u201cI completely understand why actresses get tweakments,\u201d she says. \u201cIf everyone else is doing it, it\u2019s hard to be an outlier. There aren\u2019t so many parts for older women anyway, and if everyone else looks fresher than you, then you\u2019re going to join the club.\u201d Fetto says that fillers and Botox are not so prevalent among women of colour. \u201cWe\u2019re more concerned with pigmentation,\u201d she says. \u201cAgeing isn\u2019t so much of a concern, partly because of that cliche, black don\u2019t crack \u2013 it takes a while before we get wrinkles. But it\u2019s also because age is not seen as such a negative thing. Particularly in African culture, age is seen as a thing of beauty in itself, because it comes with wisdom.\u201d However, she says this is changing. Western society has a disproportionate impact on the world. And when it comes to younger people, there\u2019s a strange, pick-and-mix racial attitude to the looks that they want. A recent New Yorker article pointed out the fashion for \u201ca South Asian influence with the brows and eye shape, an African-American influence with the lips, a Caucasian influence with the nose, a cheek structure that is predominantly Native American and Middle Eastern\u201d. (It reminds me of Victorian colonial explorers raiding new lands and bringing home skulls.) Nothing to do with ageing. \u201cIt\u2019s all about using apps,\u201d says Fetto. \u201cThey take a selfie, then Facetune their face until they get the look they want, take a screenshot and take it into a clinic. With millennials that\u2019s a huge thing, and it\u2019s not any particular race. There\u2019s a dysmorphia, a generally warped idea of what we look like, but also what we should look like. Lots of talk about loving yourself and celebrating your body, but a huge rise in tweakments.\u201d Michael Saul is a lawyer for TJL Solicitors in Manchester, a practice that specialises in cosmetic surgery negligence cases. He usually handles cases that involve \u201cinvasive surgery\u201d (nose jobs, boob jobs, butt lifts, liposuction) which, when they go wrong, can have catastrophic results. Tweakments, being less invasive, risk less serious complications, though he has seen some \u201csignificant problems\u201d. The most serious was occlusion of an artery. He won a case for a client who lost their sight in one eye when dermal filler was injected into their central retinal artery. And he recalls a couple of times when Botox was injected into the jawline and neck, resulting in problems with swallowing and, in one awful case, an emergency tracheotomy, because the patient couldn\u2019t breathe. The majority of his cases, says Saul, involve nonqualified practitioners. His practice has been trying to encourage better regulation of this growing industry for years. But the government has only been \u201cpaying lip service\u201d; they have promised regulation, but haven\u2019t really done anything about it. Since clients are getting this work for aesthetic, rather than medical reasons, the general attitude is, he feels, tough luck: \u201cYou brought it on yourself.\u201d But he\u2019s seen how awful it is for people when things go wrong. Lumpy lips, \u201ccontour deformity\u201d, infection, new fillers injected into areas where old fillers remained, clients left with abscesses, and \u201casymmetry\u201d. I mention a recent Woman\u2019s Hour interview with a mother whose 17-year-old ran up \u00a315,000 on her credit card on fillers and a nose job. You should be 18 to have rhinoplasty, but no one asked for ID. \u201cThat is rare, but the younger generation is very vulnerable,\u201d says Saul. \u201cSocial media puts a pressure on their appearance already, and they think surgery or a treatment will be a panacea. So if it goes wrong, and they\u2019re left with an even bigger problem, then this is doubly devastating. The psychological effects can be terrible.\u201d *** How are my psychological effects? Not terrible, by any means. My face looks fine. My life continues. I\u2019m rational enough to know that I haven\u2019t fundamentally changed \u2013 you don\u2019t erase a lifetime with a needle, as any decent practitioner will tell you \u2013 but that initial clench in my stomach takes a while to disappear. I feel as if I\u2019ve stepped over a line. I\u2019ve become someone else. Who? One of those people. If you believe yourself to be feminist and essentially secure, then messing with the contours of your face will mess with your idea of yourself. I am not me. I am embarrassed. So I don\u2019t tell anyone, and instead silently challenge the world to play a game with me: someone has to spot that my face is a new face, that I am frozen and filled. Unfortunately, no one notices. Not my husband, not my kids, not my mum, not any of my friends. Perhaps people are too busy to look at each other closely, too polite to say anything if they spot something strange. It\u2019s like getting a new haircut that your family ignores. I notice though. Are my eyebrows too far apart? Why do my cheeks plump up like I\u2019m 25 when I smile? I check myself in the mirror a lot more than usual. I take selfies of me trying to frown. I don\u2019t think this is helpful. The only time anyone says anything is when I interview a footballer and a rap star. The photographer, whom I work with a lot, says, \u201cYou look well, Miranda.\u201d She has the eye, she sees the new contours. But I still don\u2019t tell her what I\u2019ve done. We talk about my gold trainers instead, about sourcing cool secondhand jeans \u2013 just as vain, really, but the stuff of vanity that suits my self-image. This is, apparently, me acting my age. Everyone I talk to says people in their 20s and 30s are far more open and relaxed about getting work done. They\u2019re used to sharing, or haven\u2019t reached an age where they feel the need to lie. I talk to Tom, a man in his early 30s who\u2019s had a bit of work. \u201cOh God, I told everybody,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m an oversharer.\u201d In his 20s he was concerned about his eye wrinkles, and a beauty editor advised him to try Plexr, a nonsurgical treatment where the practitioner \u201cstabs loads of holes in the skin so they lift up that area\u201d. But he was unsatisfied with the results, so last year he had proper surgery, the kind you need to be knocked out for. He\u2019s happy with the decision. It cost him a lot of money but now, he says, when he\u2019s out late at a club, and he steps into \u201cthose strip-lit toilets and I catch sight of myself in the mirror, I feel it\u2019s definitely worth it. Before, that would wreck my night. If that five grand has brought me five or 10 years without that feeling, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d He admits that he, too, has been affected by social media, by how his selfies look. \u201cYou can laugh,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been a Jennifer Lopez fan since I was 10. Obviously I follow her on Instagram, and she is not ageing. Somewhere deep inside me I think: why is she not ageing and I am?\u201d In previous eras, if you were a Jennifer Lopez fan, or \u2013 like me \u2013 a Madonna fan, you would tape TV shows, buy magazines, go to concerts. Your sense of what Madonna looked like would shift only when a new photo session was released. Now, if you\u2019re a fan of any celebrity, it\u2019s like they\u2019re part of your family. They post on Instagram, tease clips on Twitter, release tunes to TikTok. They are more exposed, so of course they get tweakments to make their faces look better on social media. Madonna doesn\u2019t disguise the work she has had done, but others are more subtle. They look fresh, they look dewy. They don\u2019t appear to grow older. And as our eyes become even more accustomed to this non-ageing, this rubbing out of character and past life from every famous face, we normalise it. Because the new tweakees still have expressions: modern fillers mean they can crinkle their smile lines, raise their eyebrows. They\u2019re not frozen, that\u2019s not what\u2019s weird. What\u2019s weird is that they all look the same. Lovely. Happy. Smooth between the eyebrows, with beautiful bone structure, glowing skin. No slack necks, no weak chins. Nothing unseemly. Perhaps the younger, Botox-in-your-20s generation will age like celebrities. As ever, it will be money that divides. Richer people will pay experienced doctors to work on them; those with less money will go to less qualified people, or not bother at all. And aside from celebrities, with every podcast, book and website on the subject, tweakments are further normalised. It\u2019s like taking drugs: once you realise how many people are doing them, they don\u2019t seem so bad. Now I\u2019m a tweakee, tweakments don\u2019t seem scary. Expensive, yes, and a faff (like drugs!): but not scary. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d get Botox again \u2013 I like my laughter lines, the grooves around my mouth \u2013 but having better skin has been nice. \u201cPeople get more tweakments,\u201d says Karnovitch, \u201cbecause they see what happens when they wear off.\u201d *** How do you stop? Or when? For some, their face becomes an ongoing project, like those people who never finish getting their house redecorated. And once one house in the road has been done up, then all the others feel the pressure to gentrify. To gentrify, but magically, with silent builders, that no one sees. Because to talk about it is mortifying. The worst part of my tweakments, for me, was admitting that I had it done. Still, that\u2019s changing. L\u2019Or\u00e9al recently added \u201cFiller\u201d and \u201cLaser Renew\u201d to its long-standing Revitalift skincare range, put them in packaging that looks like tweakment instruments. When Tom went home for Christmas, his family were impressed with the results of his eye procedure. His sister said to her husband, \u201cYour lip dips down in the middle, maybe you should do something about that.\u201d Her husband isn\u2019t on Instagram. He\u2019s a roofer. \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>This is getting very granular for me,\u201d says Robert Eggers, half-jokingly, half-uncomfortably. We were talking about Eggers\u2019s obsession with history, but somehow we have drifted on to his childhood habit of dressing up in costumes. \u201cMy mom would take me to [US clothing chain] Joann Fabrics and buy some Lycra for me, and I would hand-sew a Wolverine costume that would look quite lumpy but serviceable.\u201d He would often go to school as a superhero or Captain Hook or Abraham Lincoln. The teachers were supportive. But when he was 11 or 12, some of the other kids beat him up for his unconventional dress sense. \u201cThen I decided to get very invested in dressing cool, which is something, unfortunately, now I\u2019m still conscious of. So that became sort of my thing that helped me not be an outsider.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of decades on, he still looks pretty dapper: dressed in black from head to toe, swept-back black hair and a neatly trimmed but resplendently full beard. You would not class him as an outsider, exactly, but Eggers seems to be defiantly doing things his own way. His 2015 feature The Witch was as singular a debut as we have seen for some time: a strange, solemn folk horror whose exacting recreation of 17th-century New England was rapturously received. Within 10 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/23/the-witch-review-robert-eggers-sundance-festival-2015\">The Witch</a> winning the directing prize at Sundance, Eggers was being offered the chance to direct franchise movies, he says, \u201cwhich made me realise how fickle and crazy and strange and silly this industry was, because no one had seen my film. They had just heard that I was, like, the new thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8131c5e4f0a13151355b339d5e46af2ed9252945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8131c5e4f0a13151355b339d5e46af2ed9252945/555_66_958_1198/800.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Eggers\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Eggers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Latour/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a few dalliances with the mainstream, including a stalled remake of his favourite film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/nosferatu-symphony-horror-murnau\">Nosferatu</a>, Eggers thankfully stuck to his own path, which seems to be heading away from the mainstream. Or rather, the mainland. The Lighthouse is set on an island off the coast of 1890s New England, where lighthouse keepers Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson are holed up for a horror-tinged two-hander that steadily becomes more drunken, disorienting and deranged. Shot in 35mm black and white, with an almost square aspect ratio, The Lighthouse feels more like a hallucination from the actual 19th century than a modern movie. At the same time, it is so earthy and claustrophobic you can practically smell the booze and the farts.</p> <p>Eggers now lives in Brooklyn but was raised in New Hampshire. \u201cWe sort of grew up in The Witch and would go on summer vacations to The Lighthouse,\u201d he says. He wrote the latter with his brother Max, and, as with The Witch, historical homework was essential. The salty sea-dog prose is informed by his study of 19th-century dialect, and the plot has elements of Herman Melville, Robert Louis Stevenson and Edgar Allan Poe, with perhaps a dash of HP Lovecraft. The maritime imagery and symbolism seem to beckon all the way down to the primal depths of our subconscious: crashing waves, seagulls, mermaids, tentacled leviathans and, of course, the phallic symbol of the title. \u201cThis movie is over the top and grotesque in all the definitions of the word, and the imagery is heavy-handed,\u201d Eggers admits. \u201cThat\u2019s by design. I would love to make a movie that both Freud and Jung would be furiously eating their popcorn to.\u201d</p> <p>If The Witch could be read as a tale of feminist ascendancy (\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intention; I just wanted to make a movie about witches\u201d), then The Lighthouse is all about men losing their bearings, ironically while maintaining a navigational aid. It has also been interpreted as an allegory of generational conflict, with Pattinson\u2019s surly underling growing increasingly resentful of Dafoe\u2019s weatherbeaten old tyrant. But Eggers was not really thinking about beaming out a commentary on modern times. \u201cI try to stay locked in my alchemical cell, sealed off from the present as much as possible,\u201d he jokes. \u201cBut the zeitgeist does work its way in there. There were times when me and my brother were like: \u2018Why are we writing a movie about two dudes right now? This is not good.\u2019 But when we got our first draft out we were like: \u2018Oh, OK. We\u2019re actually sort of illustrating the problem.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f5f4105a56df5a47f7d343f46a44962a57857b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f5f4105a56df5a47f7d343f46a44962a57857b2/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anya Taylor-Joy in The Witch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anya Taylor-Joy in The Witch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What they were not particularly thinking about was how to make the film. Eggers ought to have learned his lesson making The Witch (\u201cYou can\u2019t train a goat, let me tell you\u201d), but a combination of artistic ambition and youthful naivety pulled him towards what you might call the Werner Herzog school of film-making, where you engineer a real-life situation that is uncomfortably close to the fictional story, then film the results. \u201cI knew it was going to be much harder than I could imagine, but it was so much worse than that!\u201d Eggers laughs. \u201cWe were all isolated in this little fishing community in the middle of nowhere, like, going mad.\u201d</p> <p>Interior scenes were filmed on sound stages in Halifax, Nova Scotia, but the lighthouse complex, round which much of the action takes place, was purpose-built on a remote cape. Eggers began to understand the origins of all those maritime superstitions: \u201cThey come from trying to organise chaos, and if you live a life at sea, she is stronger than anything.\u201d The weather was either too sunny or too stormy. There were gale-force winds and freezing rains. Camera equipment broke down, lenses fogged up, and it turned out that seagulls were no easier to work with than goats. \u201cIt was fun overcoming challenges, but day-to-day it was not \u2026 you know \u2026 fun,\u201d says Eggers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/19/the-lighthouse-review-robert-pattinson-shines-in-sublime-maritime-nightmare\">The Lighthouse review \u2013 Robert Pattinson shines in sublime maritime nightmare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was not just the seagulls; cast and crew also became tired and irritable. Pattinson admitted in an interview that the fifth take of walking down a beach being sprayed in the face with a firehose was the closest he had come to punching a director. But Eggers says that he did not really need to push his actors. \u201cRob and Willem, if you look at their career choices, they choose adventurous, difficult things,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re after.\u201d In fact, Eggers says Pattinson turned down a role in one of his other movies (which ultimately did not get made) because it wasn\u2019t challenging <em>enough</em>.\u201cI didn\u2019t know he wanted to punch me in the face that day, because he\u2019s very professional. And not only that, the wardrobe supervisor told me he would have done another take if he needed to.\u201d</p> <p>It got to Eggers himself as well, he admits. \u201cI feel like you have to be the general when you\u2019re on set. I saved my crying for my hotel room.\u201d But now that the ordeal is over, Eggers can feel justifiably satisfied. The Lighthouse has earned rave reviews and awards nominations, including a prize at Cannes and Oscar and Bafta nominations for cinematographer Jarin Blaschke. It has also cemented Eggers\u2019s reputation. In a film landscape where risk-taking and trailblazing are endangered qualities, he is among a handful of dedicated, literate, intrepid young film-makers who are still committed to the cause, along with Ari Aster (Midsommar), the Safdie brothers (Uncut Gems) and Trey Edward Shults (Waves). \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to me anyone gave me support to make this,\u201d says Eggers. He puts his position down to luck as much as anything. \u201cThe fates weave a mysterious thread.\u201d</p> <p>Given his experiences so far, it would be understandable if Eggers announced his next movie would be set in a nice warm kitchen but, actually, it looks as if he is heading even further out there. Details leaked recently of his next project: a seafaring Viking epic set in 10th-century Iceland. He has already been talking to historians, he admits. As long as there are no goats or seagulls in it, what could go wrong?</p> <p><em>The Lighthouse is in cinemas from Friday 31 January</em></p>",

In a film landscape where risk-taking and trailblazing are endangered qualities, he is among a handful of dedicated, literate, intrepid young film-makers who are still committed to the cause, along with Ari Aster (Midsommar), the Safdie brothers (Uncut Gems) and Trey Edward Shults (Waves). \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to me anyone gave me support to make this,\u201d says Eggers. He puts his position down to luck as much as anything. \u201cThe fates weave a mysterious thread.\u201d Given his experiences so far, it would be understandable if Eggers announced his next movie would be set in a nice warm kitchen but, actually, it looks as if he is heading even further out there. Details leaked recently of his next project: a seafaring Viking epic set in 10th-century Iceland. He has already been talking to historians, he admits. As long as there are no goats or seagulls in it, what could go wrong? The Lighthouse is in cinemas from Friday 31 January",

The Guardian has obtained chat records, audio recordings and videos provided by an anti-fascist whistleblower who spent more than a year charting the inside workings of the Base. The same infiltrator took control of The Base\u2019s telegram channel in the early hours of Saturday morning, US time, and posted multiple memes mocking the group\u2019s founder, Rinaldo Nazzaro. The Guardian studied leaked materials relayed by the whistleblower and pursued other lines of inquiry to exclusively reveal the real identity of the Base\u2019s secretive leader as Nazzaro, 46, from New Jersey. Nazzaro is currently living in Russia with his Russian wife. Until the Guardian\u2019s expos\u00e9 little was known about his background and he was only known by the alias \u201cNorman Spear\u201d.

Members remained defiant following the arrest of seven alleged members of the group in mid-January, calling it an \u201cunjust political witch-hunt\u201d from the \u201cliberal globalist system\u201d. Nazzaro urged members to double down and commit to a decades-long insurgency, conceding they were \u201cat least 20 years away from a full-fledged civil unrest scenario\u201d. The US has seen a significant rise of white supremacist violent crimes in recent years.

Some members of the Base were also involved with the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, whose members have been involved in several murders. A path to real-life violence Included in the materials obtained by the Guardian is a record of members signaling their intention to commit hate crimes and terrorize their victims. One such involved Richard Tobin, 18, whose handle inside the Base was \u201clandser\u201d. He claimed to also be a member of Atomwaffen Division. Tobin is currently in federal custody, awaiting trial for an alleged conspiracy he organized inside the Base\u2019s chatrooms. Writing on 15 September last year in the Base\u2019s chatroom Tobin wrote: \u201cOur whole purpose is gradual escalation and we\u2019ve done absolutely fucking NOTHING.

Tobin was charged on 12 November with orchestrating both of these incidents, and another Base member, Yousef Barasneh, was charged last week with vandalizing the Racine synagogue. Federal prosecutors allege that they coordinated this in a private chat. A pale, nervous, overweight teen Although inside the group Tobin was vicious, militant and angry, a custody hearing attended by the Guardian in Camden, New Jersey, revealed the defendant as a pale, nervous, overweight teenager. None of his former comrades had made the journey to the gloomy courtroom in downtown Camden, but he was attended by an older female relative dragging an oxygen canister behind her, several prosecutors, and one man identified as an FBI agent. After the court heard about his fantasies of violence \u2013 including \u201csuicide by cop\u201d and machete attacks \u2013 and how a mental health crisis and infighting in Atomwaffen Division and the Base had driven him to talk to special agents, he was refused bail. His profile seems to be typical: new recruits are disproportionately younger men. The official age limit is 18 but this is frequently relaxed, and several members are 17. Many are in their late teens and early 20s. The bias towards youth is reflected in the ages of several of those arrested in raids on Base members, which range between 18 and 25. All Base prospects must participate in a group voice call in which they are led through a standardized list of questions. These include the reasons people have for joining the group and whether or not they have read key texts of accelerationist neo-Nazism. Leaders describe membership as a \u201ctwo-way street\u201d, and members are expected to detail skills \u2013 in survival, technology, or firearms \u2013 which they can offer or teach members determined to survive social collapse and prevail in the succeeding race war.

Furthermore, one vetting committee member and cell leader was himself an infiltrator. \u2018Action over words\u2019 One part of the Base\u2019s ethos which is repeatedly emphasized is the necessity of meetups. Members are expected to get together frequently in order to familiarise themselves with, and learn to cooperate with, other local members. \u201cAction over words was Norman\u2019s guiding light,\u201d the source who infiltrated the group told the Guardian. These meetings involve gunplay, combat drills, and photo and video shoots for propaganda purpose. One such gathering occurred between 30 October and 2 November in Silver Creek, Georgia. One image from the event shows six men standing, one holding a flag with the Base\u2019s runic logo, their faces covered with balaclavas or the distinctive skull masks that signify an affiliation with neo-Nazi \u201cSiege Culture\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Lord knows there are precious few stories these days that make one feel anything other than on the verge of striking Munch\u2019s Scream face. But last week, I found one that made me do something I hadn\u2019t done at a newspaper in a while: smile. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/chloe-sevigny\" title=\"\">Chlo\u00eb Sevigny</a>, 45, is pregnant,\u201d read the headline. \u201cAhh, how lovely!\u201d I actually said aloud, to the alarm of the dog.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always liked Sevigny, who manages to be incredibly cool without also seeming like a complete dick, making her pretty much unique in the pantheon of cool celebrities (and, let\u2019s be honest, cool people full stop). When I lived in New York I went through a mid-30s mini-breakdown about whether I would ever have kids. Occasionally, I\u2019d see Sevigny, who is four years older than me, hanging out in my local park, looking like a woman perfectly happy with her life, as opposed to one who was going boss-eyed from a myopic desire to get pregnant.</p> <p>But it turns out people have their own inner lives, as opposed to the ones we impose on them based on our own neuroses. A few years later, in 2015, I read an <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/eternal-indie-kid-chloe-sevigny-when-im-walking-the-red-carpet-all-i-can-think-about-is-the-a3129396.html\" title=\"\">interview with Sevigny</a> in which she talked about her fear that she\u2019d left it too late to have children: \u201cI feel like it\u2019s now-or-never time\u2026 I dreamed my whole life it would be a natural occurrence. Now that it seems like it has to be forced, it takes on a different connotation.\u201d A celebrity being this open about her fertility anxiety is as rare as non-dickishness.</p> <p>So now Sevigny is having her baby, and no doubt feels as if she \u201cmade it on to a plane the moment before the gate closes \u2013 you can\u2019t help but thrill,\u201d as the journalist Ariel Levy writes in her book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/19/ariel-levy-the-rules-do-not-apply-review-feminism-nicci-gerrard\" title=\"\">The Rules Do Not Apply</a>, about her late 30s pregnancy. I passed on this rare bit of cheering news to friends, and for some this prompted musings on what Sevigny would name her kid (Atticus? Dido? Or is she so cool she\u2019d go the other way and call it John?) For others, it sparked anger born from enormous pain. I\u2019m old enough to have seen all my female friends contend with The Baby Issue, running the gamut from those who contentedly knew they didn\u2019t want one, to those who have endured the worst kind of IVF horror shows. Almost everyone who wanted a baby now has one, but some \u2013 not many, but too many \u2013 do not. In some cases, there was a medical condition, and in others the relationship collapsed. And for some, it was just too late.</p> <p>After the Sevigny news, one friend said to me: \u201cI hate these stories, because they make having a baby in your 40s seem normal, and it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s really rare.\u201d It is true that fortysomething women having a baby attract a lot of coverage: Cameron Diaz, 47, announced the birth of her daughter last month; Rachel Weisz gave birth last year at 48. But it is also true that the media is not exactly reticent in hectoring women to hurry up and get on it. When I was having my mid-30s meltdown, I felt positively besieged by articles telling me that my fertility \u2013 <em>at that very moment</em> \u2013 was plunging, lemming-like, off a cliff. \u201cWomen <em>can\u2019t</em> have it all: expert warns women are losing their best years of fertility because of financial and career pressures\u201d was a <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5888091/Women-Expert-warns-women-losing-best-years-fertility.html\" title=\"\">typical headline</a>.</p> <p>Pregnancy, like parenting, is a tender and emotive subject, and many women can\u2019t help but take such stories personally, because we anxiously seek validation that we are doing it the Right Way.

      "bodyText": "Lord knows there are precious few stories these days that make one feel anything other than on the verge of striking Munch\u2019s Scream face. But last week, I found one that made me do something I hadn\u2019t done at a newspaper in a while: smile. \u201cChlo\u00eb Sevigny, 45, is pregnant,\u201d read the headline. \u201cAhh, how lovely!\u201d I actually said aloud, to the alarm of the dog. I\u2019ve always liked Sevigny, who manages to be incredibly cool without also seeming like a complete dick, making her pretty much unique in the pantheon of cool celebrities (and, let\u2019s be honest, cool people full stop). When I lived in New York I went through a mid-30s mini-breakdown about whether I would ever have kids. Occasionally, I\u2019d see Sevigny, who is four years older than me, hanging out in my local park, looking like a woman perfectly happy with her life, as opposed to one who was going boss-eyed from a myopic desire to get pregnant. But it turns out people have their own inner lives, as opposed to the ones we impose on them based on our own neuroses. A few years later, in 2015, I read an interview with Sevigny in which she talked about her fear that she\u2019d left it too late to have children: \u201cI feel like it\u2019s now-or-never time\u2026 I dreamed my whole life it would be a natural occurrence. Now that it seems like it has to be forced, it takes on a different connotation.\u201d A celebrity being this open about her fertility anxiety is as rare as non-dickishness. So now Sevigny is having her baby, and no doubt feels as if she \u201cmade it on to a plane the moment before the gate closes \u2013 you can\u2019t help but thrill,\u201d as the journalist Ariel Levy writes in her book The Rules Do Not Apply, about her late 30s pregnancy. I passed on this rare bit of cheering news to friends, and for some this prompted musings on what Sevigny would name her kid (Atticus? Dido? Or is she so cool she\u2019d go the other way and call it John?) For others, it sparked anger born from enormous pain. I\u2019m old enough to have seen all my female friends contend with The Baby Issue, running the gamut from those who contentedly knew they didn\u2019t want one, to those who have endured the worst kind of IVF horror shows. Almost everyone who wanted a baby now has one, but some \u2013 not many, but too many \u2013 do not. In some cases, there was a medical condition, and in others the relationship collapsed. And for some, it was just too late. After the Sevigny news, one friend said to me: \u201cI hate these stories, because they make having a baby in your 40s seem normal, and it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s really rare.\u201d It is true that fortysomething women having a baby attract a lot of coverage: Cameron Diaz, 47, announced the birth of her daughter last month; Rachel Weisz gave birth last year at 48. But it is also true that the media is not exactly reticent in hectoring women to hurry up and get on it. When I was having my mid-30s meltdown, I felt positively besieged by articles telling me that my fertility \u2013 at that very moment \u2013 was plunging, lemming-like, off a cliff. \u201cWomen can\u2019t have it all: expert warns women are losing their best years of fertility because of financial and career pressures\u201d was a typical headline. Pregnancy, like parenting, is a tender and emotive subject, and many women can\u2019t help but take such stories personally, because we anxiously seek validation that we are doing it the Right Way. For the same reason, we extrapolate from our own experiences and apply those lessons to all women. \u201cThe biological clock is real. I think it\u2019s the worst thing that we do to each other as women \u2013 not share how our bodies work and don\u2019t work,\u201d Michelle Obama said in an interview two years ago, when talking about how she conceived her daughters by IVF.

This, she said, was how to \u201cspeak honestly and frankly about fertility\u201d.

Not only because it is officially the world\u2019s largest such gathering, but also because it has earned its place on the global literary map, even with a serious reading public still emerging in India.</p> <p>Where else in the world could you listen to Weijian Shan, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Out-Gobi-Story-China-America-ebook/dp/B07MFQPS5Y\">Out of the Gobi</a>, recall his childhood during China\u2019s cultural revolution, when Mao urged students to beat their teachers to death? Or learn how the late war correspondent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/22/marie-colvin\">Marie Colvin</a> had to drink Colonel Gaddafi\u2019s guards under the table in order to secure an interview with him? Or hear biographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/08/susan-sontag-her-life-benjamin-moser-review\">Benjamin Moser</a> talk about Susan Sontag\u2019s lifelong shame at being gay?</p> <p>Where else, in between absorbing such literary joys, could you eat a <em>masala dosa</em> in the dappled sunlight under an old banyan tree watching a soft breeze make the coloured bunting dance over the lawns of the Diggi Palace?</p> <p>Last year, half a million people came to Jaipur for the five-day event, prompting co-founder and historian William Dalrymple to say at Thursday\u2019s opening: \u201cAt a time when people say the love for literature is dying, we are proof that it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The festival\u2019s organisers invariably pull off an amazing line-up: among those taking part this year are Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee, Howard Jacobson, Paul Muldoon, Simon Schama, Leila Slimani, Shashi Tharoor, Nicholas Coleridge, Forrest Gander, Asne Seierstadand Lemn Sisssay.</p> <p>The organisers have also highlighted little-known or neglected areas of literature \u2013 books by Dalits and by Indian women, poetry, regional writing \u2013 providing a platform that simply wasn\u2019t available before. That high-profile literary agents attend only makes it more meaningful.</p> <p>It has become fashionable to knock the festival for being ruined by its own success. Some of the gripes are understandable. The teeming crowds, particularly at weekends, have made for scenes you might see on an Indian train platform. The determination to be democratic and allow anyone to come in for free has proved problematic \u2013 if only from a security perspective.</p> <p>Some feel commercialism has gradually crept in, with too many stalls selling merchandise, others complain of writers being corralled away from the hoi polloi in their lounges when they had once mingled and eaten among the crowds. In the queues for delicious <em>masala chai </em>served in clay cups, visitors had been able to chat to famous authors. Vikram Seth was once spotted sitting on the ground because there was no free seat.</p> <p>The commercialisation continues. Stalls selling trinkets and clothes now begin on the road that leads to Diggi Palace, rather than inside the venue. The crowds are as big as ever.

      "bodyText": "For a country too often associated with poverty and bad news, the annual Jaipur literature festival is a matter of national pride. Not only because it is officially the world\u2019s largest such gathering, but also because it has earned its place on the global literary map, even with a serious reading public still emerging in India. Where else in the world could you listen to Weijian Shan, author of Out of the Gobi, recall his childhood during China\u2019s cultural revolution, when Mao urged students to beat their teachers to death? Or learn how the late war correspondent Marie Colvin had to drink Colonel Gaddafi\u2019s guards under the table in order to secure an interview with him? Or hear biographer Benjamin Moser talk about Susan Sontag\u2019s lifelong shame at being gay? Where else, in between absorbing such literary joys, could you eat a masala dosa in the dappled sunlight under an old banyan tree watching a soft breeze make the coloured bunting dance over the lawns of the Diggi Palace? Last year, half a million people came to Jaipur for the five-day event, prompting co-founder and historian William Dalrymple to say at Thursday\u2019s opening: \u201cAt a time when people say the love for literature is dying, we are proof that it isn\u2019t.\u201d The festival\u2019s organisers invariably pull off an amazing line-up: among those taking part this year are Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee, Howard Jacobson, Paul Muldoon, Simon Schama, Leila Slimani, Shashi Tharoor, Nicholas Coleridge, Forrest Gander, Asne Seierstadand Lemn Sisssay. The organisers have also highlighted little-known or neglected areas of literature \u2013 books by Dalits and by Indian women, poetry, regional writing \u2013 providing a platform that simply wasn\u2019t available before. That high-profile literary agents attend only makes it more meaningful. It has become fashionable to knock the festival for being ruined by its own success. Some of the gripes are understandable. The teeming crowds, particularly at weekends, have made for scenes you might see on an Indian train platform. The determination to be democratic and allow anyone to come in for free has proved problematic \u2013 if only from a security perspective. Some feel commercialism has gradually crept in, with too many stalls selling merchandise, others complain of writers being corralled away from the hoi polloi in their lounges when they had once mingled and eaten among the crowds. In the queues for delicious masala chai served in clay cups, visitors had been able to chat to famous authors. Vikram Seth was once spotted sitting on the ground because there was no free seat. The commercialisation continues. Stalls selling trinkets and clothes now begin on the road that leads to Diggi Palace, rather than inside the venue. The crowds are as big as ever. While weekdays are very pleasant, at the weekend the place turns into a literary version of the Kumbh Mela pilgrimage: the swarming crowds are such that your feet don\u2019t touch the ground as you are carried along. The intimacy of the early years has gone; the festival is now a truly titanic affair. But whatever barbs are thrown at the event, it remains the greatest literary show on Earth. In five days there are more than 200 sessions, authors from 20 countries and literature in more than 25 languages. It\u2019s all too rare that India does an event well, never mind an event marked on the international cultural calendar. Jaipur is superbly organised, with excellently curated music and a warm, good-natured atmosphere. \u201cThe festival has carved out a place for itself in the world. Everyone is in awe of it,\u201d said Rajasthan\u2019s chief minister Ashok Gehlot this week. People from all over the world converge on the event \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t cope with the rest of the year until I\u2019ve had my Jaipur fix,\u201d one person was overheard to remark \u2013 and its freshness is no doubt a factor. Like serious reading itself among the Indian public, it is a work in progress. Homes in the country rarely contain books, and a volume that sells 8,000 copies is regarded as a bestseller.

Many parents filling in their tax return have ended up being handed a big bill by HM Revenue &amp; Customs \u2013 but there are simple things you can do to avoid being clobbered.</p> <p>This all relates to the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge\">high income child benefit charge</a>, where child benefit is clawed back via the tax system if either you or your partner have an \u201cadjusted net income\u201d of more than \u00a350,000. For those earning more than \u00a360,000, the charge is 100% \u2013 in effect, they receive no child benefit.</p> <p>Those affected have a choice: carry on receiving child benefit but pay extra tax via self-assessment, or give up the benefit and don\u2019t pay.</p> <p>It\u2019s probably too late to do much about 2018-19, bearing in mind the self-assessment deadline is 31 January, but there are things you can do right now to reduce your future liability. You need to reduce your adjusted net income, and the best way to do that is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/28/child-benefit-pension-contributions-higher-earners\">pay more into your pension</a>. Any contributions made into a company or personal pension scheme will reduce the final amount of adjusted net income. For example, you could pay additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) into your occupational scheme.</p> <h2><strong>The most common mistakes on tax returns</strong></h2> <p>Millions of people still haven\u2019t filed their self-assessment tax form\u2013 and time is running out ahead of the 31 January deadline.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t done your form yet, there\u2019s no time like the present. Dig out your documents right now (online banking apps have made finding the docs so much easier) and give in to the experience. Set aside some time \u2013 doing it in a hurry means you are more likely to make careless errors.</p> <p>Here are a few of the top mistakes to avoid:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Don\u2019t leave it too late!</strong> For most people it will be fine if they crack on now. But if you didn\u2019t do a return last year, you might find time is against you: after you <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return/register-if-youre-not-self-employed\">register for self-assessment</a>, you will get a letter that contains your unique taxpayer reference, which you use to enrol. Then you will be posted an activation code so you can sign in and file your return.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Don\u2019t forget/omit things.</strong> People often forget what savings and investments they have, which means they end up leaving out one or more sources of income. For example, in the \u201cinterest and dividends from UK banks and building societies\u201d section of the form, you also have to include in box 1 and 2 any interest from UK unit trusts and investment trusts, certain National Savings &amp; Investments products, credit union and friendly society accounts, and on payment protection insurance (PPI) compensation payouts.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Don\u2019t forget to claim for expenses.</strong> According to Which?, <a href=\"https://press.which.co.uk/whichpressreleases/consumer-confusion-around-tax-return-expenses-claims-warns-which/\">there\u2019s a lot of consumer confusion</a> when it comes to expenses claims. Of those Which? members who submit a self-assessment tax return, only 39% said they normally claim expenses, \u201cmeaning many could be missing out\u201d. For example, you can usually claim tax relief on work expenses for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/job-expenses-for-uniforms-work-clothing-and-tools\">the cost of cleaning a uniform</a>, provided it\u2019s \u201crecognisable as identifying someone as having a particular occupation\u201d \u2013 for example, a police officer. Meanwhile, did you know that nurses and midwives can claim for replacing shoes, socks and underwear? It\u2019s a complex area \u2013 to find out more, try <a href=\"https://www.litrg.org.uk/tax-guides/employment/employment-benefits-and-expenses\">litrg.org.uk/tax-guides/employment/employment-benefits-and-expenses</a>.</p>",

For those earning more than \u00a360,000, the charge is 100% \u2013 in effect, they receive no child benefit. Those affected have a choice: carry on receiving child benefit but pay extra tax via self-assessment, or give up the benefit and don\u2019t pay. It\u2019s probably too late to do much about 2018-19, bearing in mind the self-assessment deadline is 31 January, but there are things you can do right now to reduce your future liability. You need to reduce your adjusted net income, and the best way to do that is to pay more into your pension. Any contributions made into a company or personal pension scheme will reduce the final amount of adjusted net income. For example, you could pay additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) into your occupational scheme. The most common mistakes on tax returns Millions of people still haven\u2019t filed their self-assessment tax form\u2013 and time is running out ahead of the 31 January deadline. If you haven\u2019t done your form yet, there\u2019s no time like the present. Dig out your documents right now (online banking apps have made finding the docs so much easier) and give in to the experience. Set aside some time \u2013 doing it in a hurry means you are more likely to make careless errors. Here are a few of the top mistakes to avoid: \u2022 Don\u2019t leave it too late! For most people it will be fine if they crack on now. But if you didn\u2019t do a return last year, you might find time is against you: after you register for self-assessment, you will get a letter that contains your unique taxpayer reference, which you use to enrol. Then you will be posted an activation code so you can sign in and file your return. \u2022 Don\u2019t forget/omit things. People often forget what savings and investments they have, which means they end up leaving out one or more sources of income. For example, in the \u201cinterest and dividends from UK banks and building societies\u201d section of the form, you also have to include in box 1 and 2 any interest from UK unit trusts and investment trusts, certain National Savings &amp; Investments products, credit union and friendly society accounts, and on payment protection insurance (PPI) compensation payouts. \u2022 Don\u2019t forget to claim for expenses. According to Which?, there\u2019s a lot of consumer confusion when it comes to expenses claims. Of those Which? members who submit a self-assessment tax return, only 39% said they normally claim expenses, \u201cmeaning many could be missing out\u201d. For example, you can usually claim tax relief on work expenses for the cost of cleaning a uniform, provided it\u2019s \u201crecognisable as identifying someone as having a particular occupation\u201d \u2013 for example, a police officer. Meanwhile, did you know that nurses and midwives can claim for replacing shoes, socks and underwear? It\u2019s a complex area \u2013 to find out more, try litrg.org.uk/tax-guides/employment/employment-benefits-and-expenses.",

      "body": "<p>Everyone has a similar reaction when they see Reynhard Sinaga for the first time. It was the same whenever a new reporter came into the Manchester crown courtroom and stared into the dock. Sitting there, smiling, between three hulking security guards, was a small man with thick-rimmed hipster glasses, playing with the shiny, shoulder-length hair he had not cut since his arrest in June 2017. Him? That\u2019s Britain\u2019s worst rapist? Predators come in all shapes and sizes, but Sinaga\u2019s \u201cworst ever\u201d billing was hard to square with the boyish figure in the lumberjack shirt, scribbling notes behind the bulletproof glass as a stream of nervous young men went into the witness box to testify against him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/25/reynhard-sinaga-may-have-been-raping-men-as-far-back-as-2005\">Reynhard Sinaga may have been raping men as far back as 2005</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Guardian was present at three out of Sinaga\u2019s four trials, and Sinaga often seemed to be enjoying himself. He would cock his head to one side, as if studying a nature documentary, as he watched videos of himself raping dozens of men who had made the mistake of going back to his flat after a drunken night out. The prosecution tried to persuade the judge, Suzanne Goddard QC, that Sinaga didn\u2019t need to see the films he had recorded on two iPhones, one perched on a dresser for long shots and another handheld for closeups. But Goddard reluctantly ruled that he should be allowed to see the evidence in order to mount what seemed to be a hopeless defence: that he wasn\u2019t a sexual predator, but a harmless deviant. He just happened to be irresistible to young, usually straight men, who would pretend to be asleep as part of a sexual fantasy in which Sinaga would penetrate them on camera, sometimes for hours on end.</p> <p>There was no remorse. Were we in the presence of a psychopath? By the time the 36-year-old gave evidence in his fourth and final trial, before Christmas, he seemed to have persuaded himself that he was innocent. It was a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fifty-shades-of-grey\" title=\"\">50 Shades Of Grey</a>\u201d thing, he said; the sort of sex people have \u201cunderground\u201d.</p> <p>When Sinaga first stood trial in May 2018, charged with drugging and raping 12 men, no journalist knew; Greater Manchester police were trying to keep it quiet. They had already gathered enough evidence to suggest that Sinaga might have abused 195 men between 2005 and 2017, including before he even arrived in the UK on a student visa from Indonesia in 2007. More trials were inevitable. They had identified about 120 of the victims and 48 were eventually willing to testify, far too many for one jury to cope with. On one level, the jurors\u2019 task was simple: they just had to decide whether the men in the videos were awake. But to do that, they had to watch hours and hours of explicit footage, much of it so traumatising that they were offered counselling once their trials were over.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many victims didn\u2019t remember meeting Sinaga \u2013 until, years later, police showed them stills from the videos</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sitting on the press benches, journalists could hear but not see the videos: snoring and sleep-talking, with occasional sirens. The Guardian got wind of the second trial in April last year, and attended the third and fourth in September and December. Reporting restrictions banned all media coverage to avoid prejudicing future juries, and we were barred from telling friends what we had seen and heard. It was hard in a case that felt very close to home. The locations where Sinaga preyed on his targets were horribly familiar, outside Manchester clubs where we\u2019d had our own drunken nights out: Factory, Fifth Avenue, the Ritz, Gorilla. Crown court cases often seem distant when you\u2019re a reporter: gang violence, domestic dramas, stupid decisions you feel quite sure you would never make yourself. But what happened to Sinaga\u2019s victims could have happened to anyone who had been out and had too much to drink; who had lost their phones and mates. If Reynhard Sinaga had invited you back to his flat, you might well calculate you\u2019d be able to tackle him if he tried anything silly. He was only 5ft 7in. And anyway: he doesn\u2019t look the type. Right?</p> <p>Some of Sinaga\u2019s victims gave evidence in open court, shunning the offer of screens. They seemed to want to get a good look at him. Many said they didn\u2019t remember meeting him, even when police knocked on their door several years later. They were adamant that detectives were barking up the wrong tree, until they were shown stills from the videos. The investigation team arranged to visit them at home with crisis counsellors from <a href=\"https://www.stmaryscentre.org/\" title=\"\">Saint Mary\u2019s sexual assault referral centre</a>. A police officer would begin by telling the men why they were there, and counsellors would start the therapy that continues today with 60 of Sinaga\u2019s victims.</p> <p>\u201cThere were many different reactions but a lot of men felt completely overwhelmed,\u201d says Lisa Waters, the centre\u2019s deputy directorate manager. \u201cSome were very distressed. Some were very confused. Some were very angry and wondered why we\u2019d come and told them this, which you can understand.\u201d </p> <p>Not one of the victims wanted to see the films, but some were glad to get back watches and phones they hadn\u2019t seen since a drunken night out many moons ago; Sinaga had stolen them, along with passports and bank cards, as souvenirs. A couple of men immediately went online and deleted him as a Facebook friend. They were horrified to realise the friendly man who had added them after they had woken up in his flat in a pile of vomit (\u201cHe said he saved me, that I was passed out on the sidewalk next to Factory,\u201d said one man, giving evidence via videolink) had in fact drugged and abused them.</p> <p>In court, the contrast between Sinaga and his victims \u2013 tall, stocky, laddish, all but four heterosexual \u2013 was striking. Most were students, but there was also a chef, a personal trainer and two members of the armed forces. The youngest were 18, the oldest 36. One was still in sixth form.</p> <p>Though the trials delivered powerful justice for all 48 men, many questions remained unanswered. How had Sinaga kept his double life a secret from all his friends and lovers? When did he begin his campaign of rape? And had the police missed opportunities to catch him earlier?</p> <p>***</p> <p>When reporting restrictions were finally lifted earlier this month, Sinaga\u2019s friends told us they could not believe the man they knew as \u201cRey\u201d was capable of such wickedness. Even his most recent boyfriend, whom we tracked down to a hotel in mainland Europe, struggles to reconcile the predator with the man he was in a relationship with for six months in 2013. George (not his real name) first met Sinaga through a mutual friend over drinks at Sinaga\u2019s flat. \u201cHe was kind, always joyful,\u201d George recalls. The pair spent hours at coffee shops, talking about everything from childhood to politics, \u201cfrom the simplest to the most complicated\u201d topics. George says Sinaga went for straight-looking guys \u2013 \u201cI know he liked the \u2018hetero\u2019 type and the first time we met he thought I was hetero\u201d \u2013 but adds that their sex life was normal: there was no role-play around pretending to be asleep, although Sinaga did like to wake him up by initiating intercourse. \u201cI am confused, puzzled,\u201d George says, during a break from work. \u201cI would never imagine him raping somebody. It is so unlike the Rey I knew.\u201d</p> <p>News of the case came as less of a surprise to his former flatmate, Andrew (not his real name). We first contacted him in May last year, during the second trial, but he wasn\u2019t ready to talk. He changed his mind on 6 January this year, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-jailed-life-drugging-raping-men-manchester\" title=\"\">Sinaga was sentenced</a> to life in prison with a minimum tariff of 30 years. Whereas Sinaga\u2019s friends all talk about the giggly party animal who was obsessed with Victoria Beckham and the Spice Girls, who recounted every sexual encounter like it was a fairytale or a Hollywood film, Andrew knew Sinaga had a predatory side.</p> <p>From September 2013 until early 2015, Andrew lived in the spare room of Sinaga\u2019s flat in Montana House, a modern block on Princess Street in central Manchester. Andrew is now 27, but he was 21 when he moved in, and worked at G-A-Y, one of the biggest clubs on Canal Street, the heart of Manchester\u2019s gay village. He paid \u00a3400 a month for the box room, sandwiched between the open-plan kitchen and living room, and Sinaga\u2019s large master bedroom. The flat was in a great location, five minutes\u2019 walk from G-A-Y and a 10-minute stroll from Manchester University\u2019s main campus, where Sinaga completed his first master\u2019s after arriving in the UK on a student visa in 2007. For Sinaga, the flat had another significant advantage, being on the same street as two nightclubs, Factory \u2013 in a building that once housed Joy Division\u2019s record label \u2013 and Fifth Avenue. On a busy night, the Factory queue snaked right under the flat\u2019s window. Across the street, he could see drunk students eating kebabs in the bus shelter. If he had his windows open, he could hear them remonstrating with the bouncers who wouldn\u2019t let them back in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e18c94f88f2a793d32f539fa4be143ddd429572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e18c94f88f2a793d32f539fa4be143ddd429572/0_128_1110_666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sinaga on Princess Street in Manchester in May 2017, just weeks before he was finally caught.

But the two men ended up on such bad terms that Sinaga called 999 to ask police for help to evict him in February 2015. Sinaga was advised that it was a civil matter. The police had no evidence then that their time was being wasted by a serial rapist.</p> <p>Sinaga was hard to live with, Andrew remembers. He hogged the bathroom and spent hours in front of the mirror on his great obsession: his highlighted hair, which he maintained with industrial quantities of hairspray. Andrew was not allowed in Sinaga\u2019s bedroom but would sometimes slip in when he was out, usually to borrow hairspray. \u201cThe rest of the flat was quite nice but it was disgusting in there,\u201d he recalls. Sinaga had a double bed, but on the floor there always seemed to be a makeshift bed cobbled together from two grubby duvets.</p> <p>Sinaga\u2019s narcissism soon began to grate. His PhD thesis said it all, Andrew says. Entitled \u201cSexuality And Everyday Transnationalism Among South Asian Gay And Bisexual Men In Manchester\u201d, it was basically an autobiography: \u201cHe was doing a PhD on himself.\u201d Leeds University failed the thesis in 2016. According to Andrew\u2019s sister, Sinaga seemed convinced that the world would end without him. \u201cI had an argument with him once, because he believed that if he died, all life would cease to exist,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried to explain that we would all still be here. He didn\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> <p>A few months after moving in, Andrew noticed something odd: Sinaga kept leaving the flat in the middle of the night and coming back a short time later with different men. \u201cI just thought, OK, he\u2019s out to meet a guy: a Grindr hook-up or something,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cSome of the places on Canal Street stay open until 9am, so it\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t have anywhere to go. It just started to seem unusual when it became so frequent.\u201d He kept shtum: \u201cI had a boyfriend who I would bring back to the flat as well, so I wasn\u2019t going to say anything about him bringing people home. I consider myself to be a very unprying person. I didn\u2019t really question it, and I suppose I didn\u2019t really want to know either.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a guy at the door, asking for Rey. 'I was here last night,' he said. 'I just want to know if I was raped'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then, walking home from G-A-Y one night, Andrew saw Sinaga hanging around outside Factory. Another time he was outside Fifth Avenue. As he recalls the encounters, he shakes his head, unable to comprehend how he failed to understand what he saw.</p> <p>\u201cHe was standing there on his own. That was unusual. That\u2019s when I started to think he was taking advantage, even though I didn\u2019t make the connection I should have. But I thought: fair enough, he goes for drunk guys \u2013 maybe he\u2019s got<strong> </strong>low self-esteem. I could tell he had only just left the flat. He\u2019s a very well-dressed person but he was standing there in sweat pants, flip-flops and a jumper, as if he had literally just left in his pyjamas.\u201d</p> <p>Pepe (also not his real name) first met Sinaga around 2009, in the Bannatyne gym in Manchester\u2019s gay village. He was in a WhatsApp group with Sinaga where he would discuss his conquests. Some of their messages, from July 2015, were read to the court, with Sinaga announcing that his latest flatmate was going to move out in August and he would be living alone. \u201cYou can get in lots of straight boys, darling,\u201d Pepe replied. Sinaga responded with a picture of a 21-year-old he had raped eight times the previous evening, having met the younger man drunkenly trying to walk six miles home to Stockport after losing his bank card. \u201cHahahahaha,\u201d Pepe wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s always a new one.\u201d Earlier, on New Year\u2019s Day 2015, Sinaga had boasted of sleeping with another straight man he had met in Factory, saying he had begun the year with his \u201cbreakthrough to the gay world\u201d. He sent some pictures he said he had taken \u201csecretly\u201d that morning. \u201cI always wonder how you manage to get these straight boys,\u201d Pepe mused. \u201cLol dunno,\u201d replied Sinaga. \u201cGood luck mostly lol. Plus it\u2019s Manchester hun. There\u2019s always a chance here.\u201d </p> <p>But Pepe, who fell out with Sinaga shortly after this exchange, insists he had no idea any of the men had been raped. And he says he never believed his friend was \u201cturning\u201d straight men in a sinister way: \u201cWhen we say \u2018straight\u2019 guys, many people aren\u2019t comfortable with themselves as being gay, so they call themselves straight.\u201d Pepe says he never slept with Sinaga but remembers a detective asking what role Sinaga took in bed. \u201cI said he was the bottom, in gay slang\u2026 Many times he mentioned to us, \u2018Oh my God, I went home with a guy last night and my bum is still burning.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4b58a2402af5d33401343f31b04db0a47c3e3ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4b58a2402af5d33401343f31b04db0a47c3e3ac/0_231_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Princess Street in Manchester.

Every time he went back to Indonesia, he had his hair cut shorter before he got on the plane. \u201cThey knew he was different somehow but he never told his family about his sexuality, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Pepe says. \u201cHe shared with us a couple of times before going home that he was nervous. His father would give him a hard time. Once, he mentioned that he wanted him to meet this girl in London, the daughter of some important person from his country. He would send us messages when he was in Indonesia saying his family were horrible and they wanted him to get married.\u201d</p> <p>George, the ex-boyfriend, says Sinaga had a poor relationship with his father, a palm oil tycoon: \u201cHe told me a few times how he was glad that England gave him the opportunity of living in a country where he didn\u2019t need to pretend to be someone else.\u201d Yet Sinaga presented two very different faces in his adopted home. Andrew first got a sense of his dark side in 2014, when one day he heard a knock on the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Rey was in, so I answered it,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cThere was this guy there, he must have been 18 to 21, and he looked surprised to see me. He said, \u2018Oh, sorry, does a Chinese guy live here?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah \u2013 Rey?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yeah \u2013 is he in?\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t think so.\u2019 The guy looked really uncomfortable and he said, \u2018It\u2019s just that I was here last night\u2019 \u2013 or the other night. He said, \u2018I woke up here\u2019 and he used the word rape: \u2018I just want to know if I was raped or not.\u2019 And at that point I thought: fuck.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew gave the man Sinaga\u2019s number and shut the door. Almost immediately, he heard ringing from Sinaga\u2019s room. \u201cRey came through to the living room a few minutes later, laughing, saying: \u2018Did you give my number to a boy?\u2019\u201d Andrew remembers the visitor being tall, gym-toned, tanned, with short hair. He was nervous and stuttered slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started to worry what was going on.\u201d But he didn\u2019t ask any questions: \u201cI suppose I didn\u2019t want to know.\u201d He also didn\u2019t want to be homeless. \u201cI had nowhere else to go.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A 19-year-old, who met Sinaga after a night out with his mum, texted him the next day, unaware he'd been raped six times</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> Not long afterwards, Sinaga brought home another man in his mid-20s, late at night. A fight broke out shortly after they went into Sinaga\u2019s bedroom. \u201cI came out of my room and saw this guy stripped down to his boxers with, like, one sock on or something. And he\u2019s got Rey up against his bedroom door with his hand on his throat. They were shouting at each other,\u201d Andrew recalls. \u201cI then spent about an hour calming this guy down, getting him dressed slowly, and out of my flat, and walking him down to the front door, just trying to reassure him\u2026 I can\u2019t remember what he was saying to me because he was very drunk and wasn\u2019t really making a lot of sense. I think he thought Rey had tried to touch him, and he didn\u2019t really know why he was there.\u201d</p> <p>While many of the victims had no memory of meeting Sinaga, and no clue they had been abused \u2013 because, the jury was told, of the \u201crelaxing\u201d effect of GHB, the date rape drug he was suspected of using \u2013 others stayed in touch. One 19-year-old, who met Sinaga after a night out on Canal Street with his mum, texted with him the following day, unaware that Sinaga had raped him six times the previous evening. He\u2019d woken up at 10am, naked and confused, and Sinaga said he\u2019d undressed him because he\u2019d been sick. He gave the young man clean clothes to wear \u2013 a pink T-shirt with the word \u201clove\u201d on it and some jogging bottoms \u2013 and the two started drinking again. Sinaga then asked him for sex and he refused, saying he had a girlfriend.</p> <p>That afternoon he sent Sinaga an SMS: \u201cYo man haha literally just got home I\u2019m so pissed we will have to meet up tomorrow Night if your up for it.\u201d Sinaga was enthusiastic about the idea: \u201cLooking forward to another good old drunken night. Bring us the shots till we pass out. Ha!\u201d But the boy got cold feet when Sinaga steered the conversation back towards sex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcb20be5772263e5c89e1b9acd6fd8b04ac8e66c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcb20be5772263e5c89e1b9acd6fd8b04ac8e66c/123_299_3377_2026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bedroom of serial rapist Reynhard Sinaga\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was disgusting in there,\u2019 a former flatmate recalls of Sinaga\u2019s room, with its grubby duvets on the floor. Photograph: PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greater Manchester Police/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 15 months living with Sinaga, Andrew says he saw no evidence of drug-taking in the flat. He knew from the gay scene what paraphernalia came with taking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/24/club-drug-ghb-melts-plastic-kill\" title=\"\">GHB</a>, and never saw any of it: no pipettes, no syringes, none of the little fish-shaped soy sauce bottles you get with sushi sets that are just the right size for measuring out a dose. \u201cHe just drank alcohol, and not even that much,\u201d Andrew says.</p> <p>Sinaga has always denied drugging anyone. Defending him, Richard Littler QC emphasised that police never found any evidence of GHB use. When measuring out a dose of the drug, \u201cthere\u2019s a narrow margin between euphoric high and death,\u201d he told the jury. \u201c[Sinaga] would have had to be a practising anaesthetist to administer these drugs without killing someone.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Listening to the evidence, it was hard not to wonder why the victims did not realise what had happened to them. Perhaps it was the complacency that comes with being a young, straight man. \u201cI thought briefly he might have done something, but I thought: stuff like that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d one 21-year-old told the jury. Had dozens of young women woken up in Sinaga\u2019s flat with no underwear on, and no memory of the night before, would they have been more likely to suspect the worst and go to the police?</p> <p>Only two of the men Sinaga attacked were sufficiently worried after waking up to seek medical assistance. One, a 33-year-old, called police and also contacted Saint Mary\u2019s sexual assault referral centre in Manchester city centre, on 25 April 2017. \u201cI just wanted to report a, like, possible sexual assault thing,\u201d he told a 999 operator, explaining that he had woken up with a sore anus in what he thought was a hotel room, with an Asian man next to him being \u201coverly friendly\u2026 just like cuddling me, stroking me\u201d. He thought he might have been at the Ibis hotel, across the road from Montana House, the address on his Uber receipt.</p> <p>Forensic analysis identified a stranger\u2019s semen in the man\u2019s boxer shorts, but there was no match on the DNA database, and the police investigation focused on the hotel and went nowhere. Sinaga was unknown to police as a perpetrator, though he had reported crimes, Andrew says. Once, towards the end of their flat-share, Andrew was on his PlayStation in the living room when Sinaga brought home another stranger. \u201cThe door opened and I turned to see this giant, terrifying-looking man. He was clearly on drugs \u2013 his eyes were massively dilated \u2013 and he looked scary, thuggish, as tall as the door.\u201d</p> <p>Sinaga took the man into his bedroom, smiling. Within a minute, a fight had started. Sinaga and Andrew managed to get the man out into the communal corridor, where he started smashing things up, barging into a neighbour\u2019s unlocked flat. Sinaga called 999, and the police arrived and took the man away. They asked Sinaga if he wanted to press charges, but he declined. What on earth was he doing with a violent drug dealer who was known to carry knives, they asked. \u201cYou\u2019re very lucky that neither of you has been killed,\u201d the police officer said.</p> <p>In the early hours of 2 June 2017, Sinaga <em>was </em>almost killed by the last young man he brought back to Montana House. The boy, an 18-year-old rugby player, had lost his friends in Factory. Sinaga, then 34, suggested he come back to his flat and try to contact them from there. And that\u2019s as much as the boy could remember until he woke up several hours later, lying face down, with his jeans and boxer shorts around his knees. He was in a bathroom and Sinaga, naked, was sexually assaulting him.</p> <p>In the ensuing fight, Sinaga bit the boy, who responded with such powerful punches that by the time the paramedics arrived, Sinaga had to be taken to hospital with a suspected bleed on the brain. Police initially arrested the wrong man, suspecting the 18-year-old of grievous bodily harm. That changed when they succeeded in unlocking Sinaga\u2019s phones. Though police believe Sinaga has been abusing men since 2005, the earliest victim to go to court was the man he met on New Year\u2019s Day 2015.</p> <p>The Sinaga story is unlikely to end there. At least 30 new potential victims have approached the police since he was sentenced, with detectives promising to fully investigate every new case they uncover. The CPS has left open the possibility of future trials, and Andrew now feels ready to go to court and testify for any of the men he met while he was Sinaga\u2019s flatmate \u2013 particularly the one who knocked on the door the morning after, asking if he might have been raped. \u201cI really hope he gets in touch with the police. I really want to help,\u201d Andrew says.</p> <p>Only Sinaga knows how many men ended up comatose and abused in his city centre flat, or why he did it. From his prison cell at Strangeways, he has refused for two and a half years to cooperate with probation officers, detectives or psychologists. According to his mother, he still maintains his innocence. He will be 66 when he is first eligible for release \u2013 or even older, following the attorney general\u2019s referral of his sentence to the court of appeal. Perhaps, when the enormity of that dawns on him, he may feel willing to tell all about his horrifying campaign. </p> <p>\u2022 Anyone with information about this case can contact GMP on 101.

      "bodyText": "Everyone has a similar reaction when they see Reynhard Sinaga for the first time. It was the same whenever a new reporter came into the Manchester crown courtroom and stared into the dock. Sitting there, smiling, between three hulking security guards, was a small man with thick-rimmed hipster glasses, playing with the shiny, shoulder-length hair he had not cut since his arrest in June 2017. Him? That\u2019s Britain\u2019s worst rapist? Predators come in all shapes and sizes, but Sinaga\u2019s \u201cworst ever\u201d billing was hard to square with the boyish figure in the lumberjack shirt, scribbling notes behind the bulletproof glass as a stream of nervous young men went into the witness box to testify against him. The Guardian was present at three out of Sinaga\u2019s four trials, and Sinaga often seemed to be enjoying himself. He would cock his head to one side, as if studying a nature documentary, as he watched videos of himself raping dozens of men who had made the mistake of going back to his flat after a drunken night out. The prosecution tried to persuade the judge, Suzanne Goddard QC, that Sinaga didn\u2019t need to see the films he had recorded on two iPhones, one perched on a dresser for long shots and another handheld for closeups. But Goddard reluctantly ruled that he should be allowed to see the evidence in order to mount what seemed to be a hopeless defence: that he wasn\u2019t a sexual predator, but a harmless deviant. He just happened to be irresistible to young, usually straight men, who would pretend to be asleep as part of a sexual fantasy in which Sinaga would penetrate them on camera, sometimes for hours on end. There was no remorse. Were we in the presence of a psychopath? By the time the 36-year-old gave evidence in his fourth and final trial, before Christmas, he seemed to have persuaded himself that he was innocent. It was a \u201c50 Shades Of Grey\u201d thing, he said; the sort of sex people have \u201cunderground\u201d. When Sinaga first stood trial in May 2018, charged with drugging and raping 12 men, no journalist knew; Greater Manchester police were trying to keep it quiet. They had already gathered enough evidence to suggest that Sinaga might have abused 195 men between 2005 and 2017, including before he even arrived in the UK on a student visa from Indonesia in 2007. More trials were inevitable. They had identified about 120 of the victims and 48 were eventually willing to testify, far too many for one jury to cope with. On one level, the jurors\u2019 task was simple: they just had to decide whether the men in the videos were awake. But to do that, they had to watch hours and hours of explicit footage, much of it so traumatising that they were offered counselling once their trials were over. Sitting on the press benches, journalists could hear but not see the videos: snoring and sleep-talking, with occasional sirens. The Guardian got wind of the second trial in April last year, and attended the third and fourth in September and December. Reporting restrictions banned all media coverage to avoid prejudicing future juries, and we were barred from telling friends what we had seen and heard. It was hard in a case that felt very close to home. The locations where Sinaga preyed on his targets were horribly familiar, outside Manchester clubs where we\u2019d had our own drunken nights out: Factory, Fifth Avenue, the Ritz, Gorilla. Crown court cases often seem distant when you\u2019re a reporter: gang violence, domestic dramas, stupid decisions you feel quite sure you would never make yourself. But what happened to Sinaga\u2019s victims could have happened to anyone who had been out and had too much to drink; who had lost their phones and mates. If Reynhard Sinaga had invited you back to his flat, you might well calculate you\u2019d be able to tackle him if he tried anything silly. He was only 5ft 7in. And anyway: he doesn\u2019t look the type. Right? Some of Sinaga\u2019s victims gave evidence in open court, shunning the offer of screens. They seemed to want to get a good look at him. Many said they didn\u2019t remember meeting him, even when police knocked on their door several years later. They were adamant that detectives were barking up the wrong tree, until they were shown stills from the videos. The investigation team arranged to visit them at home with crisis counsellors from Saint Mary\u2019s sexual assault referral centre. A police officer would begin by telling the men why they were there, and counsellors would start the therapy that continues today with 60 of Sinaga\u2019s victims. \u201cThere were many different reactions but a lot of men felt completely overwhelmed,\u201d says Lisa Waters, the centre\u2019s deputy directorate manager. \u201cSome were very distressed. Some were very confused. Some were very angry and wondered why we\u2019d come and told them this, which you can understand.\u201d Not one of the victims wanted to see the films, but some were glad to get back watches and phones they hadn\u2019t seen since a drunken night out many moons ago; Sinaga had stolen them, along with passports and bank cards, as souvenirs. A couple of men immediately went online and deleted him as a Facebook friend. They were horrified to realise the friendly man who had added them after they had woken up in his flat in a pile of vomit (\u201cHe said he saved me, that I was passed out on the sidewalk next to Factory,\u201d said one man, giving evidence via videolink) had in fact drugged and abused them. In court, the contrast between Sinaga and his victims \u2013 tall, stocky, laddish, all but four heterosexual \u2013 was striking. Most were students, but there was also a chef, a personal trainer and two members of the armed forces. The youngest were 18, the oldest 36. One was still in sixth form. Though the trials delivered powerful justice for all 48 men, many questions remained unanswered. How had Sinaga kept his double life a secret from all his friends and lovers? When did he begin his campaign of rape? And had the police missed opportunities to catch him earlier? *** When reporting restrictions were finally lifted earlier this month, Sinaga\u2019s friends told us they could not believe the man they knew as \u201cRey\u201d was capable of such wickedness. Even his most recent boyfriend, whom we tracked down to a hotel in mainland Europe, struggles to reconcile the predator with the man he was in a relationship with for six months in 2013. George (not his real name) first met Sinaga through a mutual friend over drinks at Sinaga\u2019s flat. \u201cHe was kind, always joyful,\u201d George recalls. The pair spent hours at coffee shops, talking about everything from childhood to politics, \u201cfrom the simplest to the most complicated\u201d topics. George says Sinaga went for straight-looking guys \u2013 \u201cI know he liked the \u2018hetero\u2019 type and the first time we met he thought I was hetero\u201d \u2013 but adds that their sex life was normal: there was no role-play around pretending to be asleep, although Sinaga did like to wake him up by initiating intercourse. \u201cI am confused, puzzled,\u201d George says, during a break from work. \u201cI would never imagine him raping somebody. It is so unlike the Rey I knew.\u201d News of the case came as less of a surprise to his former flatmate, Andrew (not his real name). We first contacted him in May last year, during the second trial, but he wasn\u2019t ready to talk. He changed his mind on 6 January this year, after Sinaga was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum tariff of 30 years. Whereas Sinaga\u2019s friends all talk about the giggly party animal who was obsessed with Victoria Beckham and the Spice Girls, who recounted every sexual encounter like it was a fairytale or a Hollywood film, Andrew knew Sinaga had a predatory side. From September 2013 until early 2015, Andrew lived in the spare room of Sinaga\u2019s flat in Montana House, a modern block on Princess Street in central Manchester. Andrew is now 27, but he was 21 when he moved in, and worked at G-A-Y, one of the biggest clubs on Canal Street, the heart of Manchester\u2019s gay village. He paid \u00a3400 a month for the box room, sandwiched between the open-plan kitchen and living room, and Sinaga\u2019s large master bedroom. The flat was in a great location, five minutes\u2019 walk from G-A-Y and a 10-minute stroll from Manchester University\u2019s main campus, where Sinaga completed his first master\u2019s after arriving in the UK on a student visa in 2007. For Sinaga, the flat had another significant advantage, being on the same street as two nightclubs, Factory \u2013 in a building that once housed Joy Division\u2019s record label \u2013 and Fifth Avenue. On a busy night, the Factory queue snaked right under the flat\u2019s window. Across the street, he could see drunk students eating kebabs in the bus shelter. If he had his windows open, he could hear them remonstrating with the bouncers who wouldn\u2019t let them back in. Andrew moved in after his sister, a longterm friend of Sinaga\u2019s, moved out. But the two men ended up on such bad terms that Sinaga called 999 to ask police for help to evict him in February 2015. Sinaga was advised that it was a civil matter. The police had no evidence then that their time was being wasted by a serial rapist. Sinaga was hard to live with, Andrew remembers. He hogged the bathroom and spent hours in front of the mirror on his great obsession: his highlighted hair, which he maintained with industrial quantities of hairspray. Andrew was not allowed in Sinaga\u2019s bedroom but would sometimes slip in when he was out, usually to borrow hairspray. \u201cThe rest of the flat was quite nice but it was disgusting in there,\u201d he recalls. Sinaga had a double bed, but on the floor there always seemed to be a makeshift bed cobbled together from two grubby duvets. Sinaga\u2019s narcissism soon began to grate. His PhD thesis said it all, Andrew says. Entitled \u201cSexuality And Everyday Transnationalism Among South Asian Gay And Bisexual Men In Manchester\u201d, it was basically an autobiography: \u201cHe was doing a PhD on himself.\u201d Leeds University failed the thesis in 2016. According to Andrew\u2019s sister, Sinaga seemed convinced that the world would end without him. \u201cI had an argument with him once, because he believed that if he died, all life would cease to exist,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried to explain that we would all still be here. He didn\u2019t get it.\u201d A few months after moving in, Andrew noticed something odd: Sinaga kept leaving the flat in the middle of the night and coming back a short time later with different men. \u201cI just thought, OK, he\u2019s out to meet a guy: a Grindr hook-up or something,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cSome of the places on Canal Street stay open until 9am, so it\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t have anywhere to go. It just started to seem unusual when it became so frequent.\u201d He kept shtum: \u201cI had a boyfriend who I would bring back to the flat as well, so I wasn\u2019t going to say anything about him bringing people home. I consider myself to be a very unprying person. I didn\u2019t really question it, and I suppose I didn\u2019t really want to know either.\u201d Then, walking home from G-A-Y one night, Andrew saw Sinaga hanging around outside Factory. Another time he was outside Fifth Avenue. As he recalls the encounters, he shakes his head, unable to comprehend how he failed to understand what he saw. \u201cHe was standing there on his own. That was unusual. That\u2019s when I started to think he was taking advantage, even though I didn\u2019t make the connection I should have. But I thought: fair enough, he goes for drunk guys \u2013 maybe he\u2019s got low self-esteem. I could tell he had only just left the flat. He\u2019s a very well-dressed person but he was standing there in sweat pants, flip-flops and a jumper, as if he had literally just left in his pyjamas.\u201d Pepe (also not his real name) first met Sinaga around 2009, in the Bannatyne gym in Manchester\u2019s gay village. He was in a WhatsApp group with Sinaga where he would discuss his conquests. Some of their messages, from July 2015, were read to the court, with Sinaga announcing that his latest flatmate was going to move out in August and he would be living alone. \u201cYou can get in lots of straight boys, darling,\u201d Pepe replied. Sinaga responded with a picture of a 21-year-old he had raped eight times the previous evening, having met the younger man drunkenly trying to walk six miles home to Stockport after losing his bank card. \u201cHahahahaha,\u201d Pepe wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s always a new one.\u201d Earlier, on New Year\u2019s Day 2015, Sinaga had boasted of sleeping with another straight man he had met in Factory, saying he had begun the year with his \u201cbreakthrough to the gay world\u201d. He sent some pictures he said he had taken \u201csecretly\u201d that morning. \u201cI always wonder how you manage to get these straight boys,\u201d Pepe mused. \u201cLol dunno,\u201d replied Sinaga. \u201cGood luck mostly lol. Plus it\u2019s Manchester hun. There\u2019s always a chance here.\u201d But Pepe, who fell out with Sinaga shortly after this exchange, insists he had no idea any of the men had been raped. And he says he never believed his friend was \u201cturning\u201d straight men in a sinister way: \u201cWhen we say \u2018straight\u2019 guys, many people aren\u2019t comfortable with themselves as being gay, so they call themselves straight.\u201d Pepe says he never slept with Sinaga but remembers a detective asking what role Sinaga took in bed. \u201cI said he was the bottom, in gay slang\u2026 Many times he mentioned to us, \u2018Oh my God, I went home with a guy last night and my bum is still burning.\u2019\u201d Despite being \u201cout\u201d in Manchester, Sinaga was in the closet with his parents, Pepe remembers. Every time he went back to Indonesia, he had his hair cut shorter before he got on the plane. \u201cThey knew he was different somehow but he never told his family about his sexuality, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Pepe says. \u201cHe shared with us a couple of times before going home that he was nervous. His father would give him a hard time. Once, he mentioned that he wanted him to meet this girl in London, the daughter of some important person from his country. He would send us messages when he was in Indonesia saying his family were horrible and they wanted him to get married.\u201d George, the ex-boyfriend, says Sinaga had a poor relationship with his father, a palm oil tycoon: \u201cHe told me a few times how he was glad that England gave him the opportunity of living in a country where he didn\u2019t need to pretend to be someone else.\u201d Yet Sinaga presented two very different faces in his adopted home. Andrew first got a sense of his dark side in 2014, when one day he heard a knock on the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Rey was in, so I answered it,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cThere was this guy there, he must have been 18 to 21, and he looked surprised to see me. He said, \u2018Oh, sorry, does a Chinese guy live here?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah \u2013 Rey?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yeah \u2013 is he in?\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t think so.\u2019 The guy looked really uncomfortable and he said, \u2018It\u2019s just that I was here last night\u2019 \u2013 or the other night. He said, \u2018I woke up here\u2019 and he used the word rape: \u2018I just want to know if I was raped or not.\u2019 And at that point I thought: fuck.\u201d Andrew gave the man Sinaga\u2019s number and shut the door. Almost immediately, he heard ringing from Sinaga\u2019s room. \u201cRey came through to the living room a few minutes later, laughing, saying: \u2018Did you give my number to a boy?\u2019\u201d Andrew remembers the visitor being tall, gym-toned, tanned, with short hair. He was nervous and stuttered slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started to worry what was going on.\u201d But he didn\u2019t ask any questions: \u201cI suppose I didn\u2019t want to know.\u201d He also didn\u2019t want to be homeless. \u201cI had nowhere else to go.\u201d Not long afterwards, Sinaga brought home another man in his mid-20s, late at night. A fight broke out shortly after they went into Sinaga\u2019s bedroom. \u201cI came out of my room and saw this guy stripped down to his boxers with, like, one sock on or something. And he\u2019s got Rey up against his bedroom door with his hand on his throat. They were shouting at each other,\u201d Andrew recalls. \u201cI then spent about an hour calming this guy down, getting him dressed slowly, and out of my flat, and walking him down to the front door, just trying to reassure him\u2026 I can\u2019t remember what he was saying to me because he was very drunk and wasn\u2019t really making a lot of sense. I think he thought Rey had tried to touch him, and he didn\u2019t really know why he was there.\u201d While many of the victims had no memory of meeting Sinaga, and no clue they had been abused \u2013 because, the jury was told, of the \u201crelaxing\u201d effect of GHB, the date rape drug he was suspected of using \u2013 others stayed in touch. One 19-year-old, who met Sinaga after a night out on Canal Street with his mum, texted with him the following day, unaware that Sinaga had raped him six times the previous evening. He\u2019d woken up at 10am, naked and confused, and Sinaga said he\u2019d undressed him because he\u2019d been sick. He gave the young man clean clothes to wear \u2013 a pink T-shirt with the word \u201clove\u201d on it and some jogging bottoms \u2013 and the two started drinking again. Sinaga then asked him for sex and he refused, saying he had a girlfriend. That afternoon he sent Sinaga an SMS: \u201cYo man haha literally just got home I\u2019m so pissed we will have to meet up tomorrow Night if your up for it.\u201d Sinaga was enthusiastic about the idea: \u201cLooking forward to another good old drunken night. Bring us the shots till we pass out. Ha!\u201d But the boy got cold feet when Sinaga steered the conversation back towards sex. In 15 months living with Sinaga, Andrew says he saw no evidence of drug-taking in the flat. He knew from the gay scene what paraphernalia came with taking GHB, and never saw any of it: no pipettes, no syringes, none of the little fish-shaped soy sauce bottles you get with sushi sets that are just the right size for measuring out a dose. \u201cHe just drank alcohol, and not even that much,\u201d Andrew says. Sinaga has always denied drugging anyone. Defending him, Richard Littler QC emphasised that police never found any evidence of GHB use. When measuring out a dose of the drug, \u201cthere\u2019s a narrow margin between euphoric high and death,\u201d he told the jury. \u201c[Sinaga] would have had to be a practising anaesthetist to administer these drugs without killing someone.\u201d *** Listening to the evidence, it was hard not to wonder why the victims did not realise what had happened to them. Perhaps it was the complacency that comes with being a young, straight man. \u201cI thought briefly he might have done something, but I thought: stuff like that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d one 21-year-old told the jury. Had dozens of young women woken up in Sinaga\u2019s flat with no underwear on, and no memory of the night before, would they have been more likely to suspect the worst and go to the police? Only two of the men Sinaga attacked were sufficiently worried after waking up to seek medical assistance. One, a 33-year-old, called police and also contacted Saint Mary\u2019s sexual assault referral centre in Manchester city centre, on 25 April 2017. \u201cI just wanted to report a, like, possible sexual assault thing,\u201d he told a 999 operator, explaining that he had woken up with a sore anus in what he thought was a hotel room, with an Asian man next to him being \u201coverly friendly\u2026 just like cuddling me, stroking me\u201d. He thought he might have been at the Ibis hotel, across the road from Montana House, the address on his Uber receipt. Forensic analysis identified a stranger\u2019s semen in the man\u2019s boxer shorts, but there was no match on the DNA database, and the police investigation focused on the hotel and went nowhere. Sinaga was unknown to police as a perpetrator, though he had reported crimes, Andrew says. Once, towards the end of their flat-share, Andrew was on his PlayStation in the living room when Sinaga brought home another stranger. \u201cThe door opened and I turned to see this giant, terrifying-looking man. He was clearly on drugs \u2013 his eyes were massively dilated \u2013 and he looked scary, thuggish, as tall as the door.\u201d Sinaga took the man into his bedroom, smiling. Within a minute, a fight had started. Sinaga and Andrew managed to get the man out into the communal corridor, where he started smashing things up, barging into a neighbour\u2019s unlocked flat. Sinaga called 999, and the police arrived and took the man away. They asked Sinaga if he wanted to press charges, but he declined. What on earth was he doing with a violent drug dealer who was known to carry knives, they asked. \u201cYou\u2019re very lucky that neither of you has been killed,\u201d the police officer said. In the early hours of 2 June 2017, Sinaga was almost killed by the last young man he brought back to Montana House. The boy, an 18-year-old rugby player, had lost his friends in Factory. Sinaga, then 34, suggested he come back to his flat and try to contact them from there. And that\u2019s as much as the boy could remember until he woke up several hours later, lying face down, with his jeans and boxer shorts around his knees. He was in a bathroom and Sinaga, naked, was sexually assaulting him. In the ensuing fight, Sinaga bit the boy, who responded with such powerful punches that by the time the paramedics arrived, Sinaga had to be taken to hospital with a suspected bleed on the brain. Police initially arrested the wrong man, suspecting the 18-year-old of grievous bodily harm. That changed when they succeeded in unlocking Sinaga\u2019s phones. Though police believe Sinaga has been abusing men since 2005, the earliest victim to go to court was the man he met on New Year\u2019s Day 2015. The Sinaga story is unlikely to end there. At least 30 new potential victims have approached the police since he was sentenced, with detectives promising to fully investigate every new case they uncover. The CPS has left open the possibility of future trials, and Andrew now feels ready to go to court and testify for any of the men he met while he was Sinaga\u2019s flatmate \u2013 particularly the one who knocked on the door the morning after, asking if he might have been raped. \u201cI really hope he gets in touch with the police. I really want to help,\u201d Andrew says. Only Sinaga knows how many men ended up comatose and abused in his city centre flat, or why he did it. From his prison cell at Strangeways, he has refused for two and a half years to cooperate with probation officers, detectives or psychologists. According to his mother, he still maintains his innocence. He will be 66 when he is first eligible for release \u2013 or even older, following the attorney general\u2019s referral of his sentence to the court of appeal. Perhaps, when the enormity of that dawns on him, he may feel willing to tell all about his horrifying campaign. \u2022 Anyone with information about this case can contact GMP on 101.

I wouldn\u2019t wish a repeat viewing of Suicide Squad and Jared Leto\u2019s garish interpretation (available on all major streaming platforms, if you must) on anyone, but sandwiching Phoenix\u2019s bravura turn between the gleefully shrill comic burlesque of Jack Nicholson\u2019s turn in Tim Burton\u2019s Batman (free on Now TV) and Heath Ledger\u2019s inspired, Oscar-winning human-monster hybrid in The Dark Knight (Now TV again) gives a helpful sense of the character\u2019s lineage. If geek completists want to trace it back to Cesar Romero\u2019s slightly camper, less ghoulish Joker in the original Batman TV series from the 1960s \u2013 or the lower-key, Mark Hamill-voiced Joker of the 1992 animated series \u2013 Google Play has you covered on both fronts. What of less immediate antecedents? Much has been made of how Phillips\u2019s film doffs its cap to Scorsese \u2013 and sure enough, you can\u2019t watch the latter\u2019s scabrous, still undervalued media satire The King of Comedy (free on Amazon Prime) or Taxi Driver (Prime again), with its era-defining rebel yell of the unhinged, unloved Travis Bickle, without identifying the exact elements of both films that Joker has sampled and remixed. From an equivalent era and state of mind, it also echoes the humid desperation that suffuses Sidney Lumet\u2019s Dog Day Afternoon (streaming on Chili) and Al Pacino\u2019s electric performance as a bank robber down to his last nerve. In interviews, Phillips has repeatedly cited a different Lumet-Pacino collaboration, the hard, seamily atmospheric undercover cop noir Serpico (on Now TV), as a reference point: I see the kinship less, but it\u2019s a great film all the same. Less frequently mentioned with regard to Joker \u2013 not least because it\u2019s rarely remembered in its own right \u2013 is Joel Schumacher\u2019s Falling Down (on iTunes), a luridly entertaining film that seemed an eccentric provocation when it came out in 1993, but holds up as rather brilliantly prescient today. This portrait of a fraying white-collar dad (played by Michael Douglas at his most perfectly short-fused and square, down to his haircut) who comes sensationally apart over the course of one exasperating day in Los Angeles is a manic manifesto for toxic-but-martyred masculinity. Watch it and see how far we haven\u2019t come. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week Ad Astra (Fox, 12) Undeservedly overlooked in awards season, James Gray\u2019s first foray into big-budget science fiction matches true visual and sonic splendour with the open emotionalism of his smaller, intimate films. The Nightingale (Vertigo, 18) Unlike her beloved debut The Babadook, Australian director Jennifer Kent\u2019s slow but visceral colonial-era outback revenge tale isn\u2019t going to be a meme machine: this is violently tough-minded cinema of real weight and grace. The Last Tree (Spirit, 15) A young black man is uprooted from his childhood Lincolnshire idyll to his birth mother\u2019s rougher London environs. Shola Amoo\u2019s elegantly crafted, superbly acted film sensitively unpicks a tangled identity crisis. Downton Abbey: The Movie (Universal, PG) If you skipped it in cinemas because, well, it\u2019s just telly, this well-attired spinoff film\u2019s featherweight pleasures won\u2019t prove you wrong. Only fans need apply.",

Plus, having argued that some of her rivals had \u201ckept quiet\u201d on Labour\u2019s handling of antisemitism, the former candidate needed to pick a fellow backbencher who had consistently voiced concerns in parliament as well as when pushed to do so in interviews.</p> <p>Labour members, who make up the majority of the selectorate in this contest, are largely on the left of the party. Recent polling found that Corbyn is their favourite leader of the last century, with Ed Miliband close behind, while most view Tony Blair unfavourably.

While sticking with her \u201ctowns like mine\u201d mantra, she has successfully reasserted herself as the \u201csoft left\u201d candidate and carved out a unique space in the contest. She can attract a wide range of members: Corbynites who didn\u2019t like the second referendum policy; those persuaded that she is best placed to win back leavers and town-dwellers; members of soft-left groups such as Open Labour, who are pro-EU but looking for a strong commitment to working with members of all factions across the party; young activists who simply appreciate a strong meme game.</p> <p>Starmer must have been relieved when he only came second in the preferences expressed by Phillips. As a more recently elected MP than Nandy, and someone not involved in setting up groups such as Labour Together, his place on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/21/keir-starmer-soft-left-approach-unifying-labour\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s factional spectrum</a> is less obvious. We know that Starmer is a London representative who backed the leadership challenger, Owen Smith, in 2016 and later pushed for a more anti-Brexit stance. He is often described as \u201csensible\u201d by so-called moderates as a synonym for Corbyn scepticism. Considering this context and his desire to win votes from the Corbynite left, he could have been badly hurt by a Phillips endorsement.</p> <p>Starmer set out his stall early, however, and he pitched it carefully. His slogan, \u201cAnother future is possible\u201d, is not particularly meaningful. Yet it conveys hope, and it is suggestive of both the anti-Brexit campaign group, Another Europe is Possible, and a phrase used by John McDonnell, \u201cAnother world is possible\u201d. He has hired the unrelated Fletchers, Simon and Kat, who worked on Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaigns, but also Matt Pound of \u201cold right\u201d group Labour First. This is all part of a balancing act being performed by Starmer, which allowed him to build a broad coalition of support early on. The question is whether it will hold.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/22/rebecca-long-bailey-sets-out-vision-of-hope-in-labour-leadership-pitch\" title=\"\">Rebecca Long-Bailey</a> has the tricky job of denying that she is the \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d candidate while firming up the votes of Corbyn supporters. Rating the outgoing leader \u201c10 out of 10\u201d was a blunder that cost her local party nominations and votes from members who want evidence that the next leader will not fall into media traps. Since then, Long-Bailey has developed a strategy focused on enthusing her base while creating dividing lines. Her announcement that she backs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/03/momentum-calls-for-more-open-labour-selection-process\" title=\"\">open selections</a> \u2013 the rule under which sitting MPs would go through a full selection process before every general election \u2013 baffled those who saw it as a move that would alienate those outside the left of the party, when she needs to gain a broader base of support. But its purpose was to motivate activists while putting forward a radical left-wing agenda that Starmer, it is assumed, cannot match.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/aspiration-socialist-idea-rebecca-long-bailey-social-climbing\">Yes, \u2018aspiration\u2019 can be a socialist idea \u2013 if the left can rid it of its baggage | Tom Blackburn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what does this all mean for the makeup of the leadership contest\u2019s political spectrum? Nandy is moving leftwards and gathering momentum. Starmer established an early lead and has been steadily gathering more nominations than any other candidate. Long-Bailey, firmly on the left, is striving to squeeze Starmer\u2019s vote and consolidate her own. It is actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/21/labour-leadership-emily-thornberry-vows-to-make-rich-pay-more-tax\" title=\"\">Emily Thornberry</a>, the contender who struggled to get enough MP and MEP nominations in the first phase, who most closely resembles Phillips now.</p> <p>Thornberry benefited most when Phillips \u2013 as the only other candidate needing to secure her place on the ballot via local party nominations \u2013 left the contest and provided room to breathe. Her pitch also sounds remarkably similar: I\u2019m the charismatic one, and Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t like me. Pressed for a policy priority by Andrew Neil, she even came up with the same answer as Phillips: social care. The narrowed field means Thornberry should be able to enter the next stage of the process \u2013 but it also risks placing her at an end of Labour\u2019s factional spectrum that is not a popular place to be right now.</p> <p>\u2022 Sienna Rodgers is editor of LabourList</p>",

Yet it conveys hope, and it is suggestive of both the anti-Brexit campaign group, Another Europe is Possible, and a phrase used by John McDonnell, \u201cAnother world is possible\u201d. He has hired the unrelated Fletchers, Simon and Kat, who worked on Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaigns, but also Matt Pound of \u201cold right\u201d group Labour First. This is all part of a balancing act being performed by Starmer, which allowed him to build a broad coalition of support early on. The question is whether it will hold. Rebecca Long-Bailey has the tricky job of denying that she is the \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d candidate while firming up the votes of Corbyn supporters. Rating the outgoing leader \u201c10 out of 10\u201d was a blunder that cost her local party nominations and votes from members who want evidence that the next leader will not fall into media traps. Since then, Long-Bailey has developed a strategy focused on enthusing her base while creating dividing lines. Her announcement that she backs open selections \u2013 the rule under which sitting MPs would go through a full selection process before every general election \u2013 baffled those who saw it as a move that would alienate those outside the left of the party, when she needs to gain a broader base of support. But its purpose was to motivate activists while putting forward a radical left-wing agenda that Starmer, it is assumed, cannot match. So what does this all mean for the makeup of the leadership contest\u2019s political spectrum? Nandy is moving leftwards and gathering momentum. Starmer established an early lead and has been steadily gathering more nominations than any other candidate. Long-Bailey, firmly on the left, is striving to squeeze Starmer\u2019s vote and consolidate her own. It is actually Emily Thornberry, the contender who struggled to get enough MP and MEP nominations in the first phase, who most closely resembles Phillips now. Thornberry benefited most when Phillips \u2013 as the only other candidate needing to secure her place on the ballot via local party nominations \u2013 left the contest and provided room to breathe. Her pitch also sounds remarkably similar: I\u2019m the charismatic one, and Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t like me. Pressed for a policy priority by Andrew Neil, she even came up with the same answer as Phillips: social care. The narrowed field means Thornberry should be able to enter the next stage of the process \u2013 but it also risks placing her at an end of Labour\u2019s factional spectrum that is not a popular place to be right now. \u2022 Sienna Rodgers is editor of LabourList",

Dr Liang worked at the Hubei Xinhua hospital in Wuhan and was the first known fatality among staff treating patients in the city, which is under lockdown along with at least a dozen other cities in Hubei state. Liang\u2019s death highlighted the pressure faced by medical staff in the state as social media was flooded with posts showing exhausted workers struggling to cope. One photo circulating showed a sign on a glass door entrance of Wuhan Fourth hospital that read: \u201cMedical staff infected. All appointment cancelled!\u201d Others posts tell of doctors and nurses working without much food or rest under poorly ventilated contamination suits. Another posting showed a local effort of 4,000 volunteer drivers who have been helping distribute supplies around the city to hospitals and medical staff. Beijing News reported on Friday that there were 15 infected medical staff in Wuhan, and said on Saturday that a doctor at Peking University no 1 hospital had the virus. The outbreak has dampened lunar new year celebrations in Wuhan and across the country. With restaurants, markets and parks closed, public gatherings banned and public transport suspended, many people have chosen to stay home. Long queues were reported at pharmacies in the city as people rushed to buy face masks from staff wearing protective suits and surgical gloves. Police were stationed at roadblocks on roads leading out of the city of 11 million people as the government tried to contain the spread of infection. Elsewhere in China, the Great Wall has been closed along with Disneyland in Shanghai, where all cinemas have been closed. The extra staff sent to Hubei included 450 military medics with experience of battling Sars and Ebola, state media said, who arrived in Wuhan on Friday night. As the extra personnel moved into hospitals, work continued on the construction of an emergency 1,000 bed facility for virus sufferers. It is hoped it will be completed by the first week of February. The chaos in cities under lockdown across Hubei has led to shortages of virus testing kits and face masks. There is growing anger within Wuhan that authorities did not do enough in the initial days of the outbreak to determine the extent of the spread of the virus, with misdiagnosis due to limited testing kits, lack of staff and space for patients rampant. One victim, Xia Qianqing, 36, told how she went to hospital in early January after feeling sick but was told her condition was not serious enough. She later came down with fever and was admitted to the hospital but discharged since beds were needed for critical patients. \u201cThe fever clinics at major hospitals are currently only treating those in critical condition who need to be transferred to other hospitals to for testing, and in the process there\u2019s a serious shortage of testing kits,\u201d she told the Guardian, adding that the situation had improved since central government took responsibility for responding to the crisis away from state authorities. In Jingzhou, a city just west of Wuhan also under lockdown, Wang Xin, visiting for the new year holiday from Shenzhen, told the Guardian that he was about to leave the city but started to feel sick on Friday and has now been told to isolate himself at home for 14 days. Wang said the situation in Jingzhou appeared to be better that in Wuhan and that there were few people at the hospital when he visited early on Saturday. \u201cThe drug store was out of antibiotics, but they gave out five free masks to everyone and you can buy the N95 masks [supposedly best for preventing transfer] at the normal price, which might mean that mask supplies are coming back,\u201d he said. Markus Tiet\u00e4v\u00e4inen, 33, a language student at Wuhan University, was scheduled to fly back to Finland on Thursday when the travel ban hit and is now holed up at the campus, mainly waiting around with other foreign students since most Chinese students are away on holiday. \u201cThey have started measuring our body temperatures at the dormitory entrances and are keeping one of the canteens open for those who are still on campus,\u201d Tiet\u00e4v\u00e4inen said. \u201cNo one really knows what is going on or how long this will last,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to admit that I\u2019m not actually worried about the disease itself, it is more the isolation and I had holiday plans and now they are all gone. I have to stay here for who knows how long.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Just as you never forget how to ride a bike, so you never forget how to do a downward dog; but what goes clean out of your head, after even a brief period of absence, is why you would ever want to. Even a week off yoga more or less guarantees a massive effort to rejoin the flow. So two things would help: if you could do it at home, so that it ate only half an hour out of your day, rather than two. And if it didn\u2019t cost anything.</p> <p>Which is what brought me back to the internet: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/25/yoga-adriene-mishler-youtube-interview\" title=\"\">Adriene is the most famous</a> practitioner here and also the freest, both in the sense that the tutorials don\u2019t cost anything, and that they are incredibly easy to find and navigate. They are a bite-sized length (24 minutes) and are arranged in blocks of 30; each series starts easy and builds up. I\u2019ve tried Adriene before, and couldn\u2019t stick to her. That was before I realised the point of yoga by doing the 90-minute, hot-studio variety. A large part of the value is in being bored: \u201cfeel the boredom and do it anyway\u201d was my mantra for a while. That enforced concentration on activities that are fundamentally unengaging \u2013 holding a warrior two, then doing something pretty similar and calling it warrior three \u2013 is mysteriously good for the mood (I\u2019m avoiding the word \u201csoul\u201d, for no good reason).</p> <p>So, I came back to Adriene\u2019s videos with a renewed self-discipline and found them far easier to stick to, getting a bargain-hunter\u2019s thrill from not spending 20 quid on a class, and allowing her sun-kissed American tone to wash over me, without feeling as if I was exercising to an Instagram advert. She\u2019s very good, very clear, quite fast-paced. There is enough plank action, even at the start, that you can certainly feel the benefit afterwards. Yes, you are still in your living room, easily distracted by the postman or stains on your carpet, but if you can\u2019t let go of domesticity for the length of a single episode of The Big Bang Theory, arguably the answer to that is to do even more yoga.</p> <p>Frankly, Adriene is such a pro that the only comparable alternatives I found were subscription sites, but they\u2019re not insanely expensive. Ashleigh Sergeant is extremely fun to watch \u2013 ambitious, show-offy yoga that makes you want a body more like a sports car. A lot of the moves I couldn\u2019t really emulate, however, so this was more entertainment experience than exercise, and frankly, it wasn\u2019t that entertaining. Cat Meffan is as well organised and accessible as Adriene, and has a reassuring studio that looks and sounds as if she could be recording next door to you, which is good if you are prone to feelings of wannabe Californian fraudulence.</p> <p>The only pitfall is obvious; there\u2019s nobody around to tell you if you\u2019re doing it wrong. So you really have to concentrate, which can make it feel as exhausting as a class three times as long.</p> <h2>What I learned</h2> <p>If you can do it in front of a mirror \u2013 I couldn\u2019t, unless I practised in the bath \u2013 that would be so much better than waiting until it\u2019s dark and trying to check your shapes in a window.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just as you never forget how to ride a bike, so you never forget how to do a downward dog; but what goes clean out of your head, after even a brief period of absence, is why you would ever want to. Even a week off yoga more or less guarantees a massive effort to rejoin the flow. So two things would help: if you could do it at home, so that it ate only half an hour out of your day, rather than two. And if it didn\u2019t cost anything. Which is what brought me back to the internet: Adriene is the most famous practitioner here and also the freest, both in the sense that the tutorials don\u2019t cost anything, and that they are incredibly easy to find and navigate. They are a bite-sized length (24 minutes) and are arranged in blocks of 30; each series starts easy and builds up. I\u2019ve tried Adriene before, and couldn\u2019t stick to her. That was before I realised the point of yoga by doing the 90-minute, hot-studio variety. A large part of the value is in being bored: \u201cfeel the boredom and do it anyway\u201d was my mantra for a while. That enforced concentration on activities that are fundamentally unengaging \u2013 holding a warrior two, then doing something pretty similar and calling it warrior three \u2013 is mysteriously good for the mood (I\u2019m avoiding the word \u201csoul\u201d, for no good reason). So, I came back to Adriene\u2019s videos with a renewed self-discipline and found them far easier to stick to, getting a bargain-hunter\u2019s thrill from not spending 20 quid on a class, and allowing her sun-kissed American tone to wash over me, without feeling as if I was exercising to an Instagram advert. She\u2019s very good, very clear, quite fast-paced. There is enough plank action, even at the start, that you can certainly feel the benefit afterwards. Yes, you are still in your living room, easily distracted by the postman or stains on your carpet, but if you can\u2019t let go of domesticity for the length of a single episode of The Big Bang Theory, arguably the answer to that is to do even more yoga. Frankly, Adriene is such a pro that the only comparable alternatives I found were subscription sites, but they\u2019re not insanely expensive. Ashleigh Sergeant is extremely fun to watch \u2013 ambitious, show-offy yoga that makes you want a body more like a sports car. A lot of the moves I couldn\u2019t really emulate, however, so this was more entertainment experience than exercise, and frankly, it wasn\u2019t that entertaining. Cat Meffan is as well organised and accessible as Adriene, and has a reassuring studio that looks and sounds as if she could be recording next door to you, which is good if you are prone to feelings of wannabe Californian fraudulence. The only pitfall is obvious; there\u2019s nobody around to tell you if you\u2019re doing it wrong. So you really have to concentrate, which can make it feel as exhausting as a class three times as long. What I learned If you can do it in front of a mirror \u2013 I couldn\u2019t, unless I practised in the bath \u2013 that would be so much better than waiting until it\u2019s dark and trying to check your shapes in a window.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWho could be against children joining their families?\u201d Few questions better capture the cruelty of the Conservative government\u2019s approach to child refugees than that posed by Labour peer Alf Dubs this week. Dubs was protesting against the government\u2019s decision to scrap a commitment from the Brexit withdrawal agreement that allows unaccompanied child refugees to reunite with their families in Britain. The House of Lords struck down the measure on Tuesday \u2013 only for the government to promptly overturn its changes. Dubs\u2019 question pinpointed the confusing priorities of Boris Johnson\u2019s hard-right government: why did it pick this fight? The government\u2019s position is riven with contradictions: it publicly supports protecting family reunification, but argues that including the commitment within the Brexit withdrawal bill ties its hands in EU negotiations. How can your hands be tied by something you\u2019ve publicly supported? Vulnerable children should not be made bargaining chips, but the row over child refugees plays into a culture war that has proved a winning electoral formula for the right.

But what, if anything, is the real and immediate impact on your life? On your travel plans, finances, education, consumer rights and even your phone usage on holiday?</p> <p>The reality is that the UK will remain in the EU\u2019s single market as negotiations proceed regarding the future trading relationship. During this transitional period, which is expected to last until 31 December, EU law will remain in force.</p> <p>Note that this does not mean that everything can still be turned upside down at the end of December this year.</p> <p>It is important to know that when commentators talk about a \u201cno deal\u201d still being on the table at the end of December, this is not the dramatic cliff edge that people referred to last year.</p> <p>The withdrawal agreement, or Brexit deal, that Boris Johnson reached with the EU last October enshrines in law all the rights and legislation pertaining to the three areas of negotiation in the first phase of Brexit talks.

Will my state pension still go up every year?</strong></h2> <p>Pensioners who have already retired to an EU country \u2013 with Spain the most popular \u2013 can heave a huge sigh of relief. They had been concerned that under a no-deal Brexit their pension could be \u201cfrozen\u201d at the date of leaving the EU, with no further increases.</p> <p>Former pensions minister Ros Altmann says: \u201cCurrent UK pensioners in Europe are guaranteed lifelong state pension uprating: the withdrawal agreement has negotiated reciprocal rights for state pensions to increase in line with those paid in the UK. People\u2019s fears of having their pensions frozen can now be allayed. The government should now reassure these pensioners that, whatever happens after 2020, they have lifelong state pension uprating.\u201d</p> <p>However, the withdrawal agreement does not cover those who retire to Europe after 2020. The government says it is aiming to agree reciprocal arrangements with the EU for the next phase of the UK\u2019s departure. But if it fails to do so by year end, says Altmann, and the implementation period is not extended, future UK pensioners in Europe could have their state pensions frozen.</p> <p>Altmann says there is an \u201curgent need\u201d for the government for the government to better inform existing pensioners. \u201cI am delighted that there is now protection for the 650,000 or so worried British citizens living in European countries. I also hope that the next phase of Brexit will agree reciprocity by end 2020.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Arriving in the EU: </strong><strong>which passport queue will you have to join?</strong></h2> <p>Nearly all EU airports operate two channels for arrivals \u2013 telling passengers to go through either the EU channel or the (usually much slower) non-EU queue. Officially from 1 February the British are no longer in the EU, but fortunately they will be told to continue to go through the EU queue. What happens after 31 December is much less clear: the Republic of Ireland said there would be a combined EU/UK channel, but other governments are still deciding.</p> <p>At Dublin airport, for example \u2013 where UK passport holders make up around a third of arrivals \u2013 the authorities said: \u201cUK passport holders will continue to be processed by Irish immigration through the EU channel post 31 January. After the end of the transition period at the end of the year, given the common travel area, the signage will be amended and UK passport holders will then go through a combined EU/UK channel rather than a non-EU channel.\u201d</p> <p>The common travel area is a free movement convention between the UK and Ireland that predates the UK joining the EU.</p> <p>We asked other EU governments what their approach will be. In a statement, the Dutch ministry of defence said: \u201cDuring the transition period, expected to start 1 February, the procedure for border checks will remain unchanged. This means that UK travellers can still use the e-gates and/or join the EU+EEA [European Economic Area] channel. After the transition period ends, UK travellers will be subject to more thorough checks as third-country nationals.\u201d</p> <p>The Spanish government said everything would remain the same for British travellers this summer \u2013 and UK tourists could continue to use e-gates as before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f14059398ef374a2aa4008b8a5891c7cc792f440\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f14059398ef374a2aa4008b8a5891c7cc792f440/0_490_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duty Free Store at Madrid Airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK holidaymakers will not be able to pay the reduced duty price on alcohol and cigarettes that travellers from the US and Asia enjoy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anouchka/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Will you now be allowed to buy cheap booze in the duty-free shop?</strong></h2> <p>No. During the transition period, which runs until at least 31 December, the rules on what goods you can bring into the UK from the EU remain the same. So on the one hand, you can still take the car to Calais on a booze cruise and return loaded with cheap wine. But on the other, you cannot go into duty-free zone at airports and pay the reduced duty price on alcohol and cigarettes that travellers to, say, North America or Asia currently benefit from.</p> <h2><strong>Will I be able to rely on </strong><strong>a European </strong><strong>health </strong><strong>insurance </strong><strong>card this summer?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. The EHIC, which gives you state-provided healthcare in the EU for free or at reduced cost until you return home, will continue to work as before until the end of December this year. The UK has issued about 27 million of the cards, and you can still apply for a free one \u2013 type \u201cNHS EHIC\u201d into Google and don\u2019t fall for any of the dodgy websites that charge fees.</p> <p>What happens after December? It could continue to work as now, but will depend on what is decided in the negotiations. Note that the EHIC is not the same as a travel insurance policy, and you should still buy holiday cover for your summer break.</p> <h2><strong>Will I need a new blue UK passport?</strong></h2> <p>No. There will be no change to the British passport, though the UK government has started replacing the EU burgundy covers with blue ones.</p> <h2><strong>Will </strong><strong>mobile phone firms still offer free roaming after 31 December?</strong></h2> <p>Arguably the one thing even the most rabid Brexiters will miss, is how the EU\u2019s roaming rules have allowed mobile users to use their handsets \u201cas if at home\u201d while travelling in another EU country. Britons heading abroad this year will still be able to use their UK calls and data allowance while on holiday.</p> <p>Calls back to the UK, to landline numbers and to other UK mobiles, will still have to be charged as if at home until 31 December. From 1 January 2021, there is nothing legally to stop roaming charges being reintroduced for UK travellers. The mobile operators have indicated they are working to keep the existing regime, but this is not guaranteed.</p> <p>So far, only the Three network has committed to not reintroducing roaming to EU destinations. EE, the UK\u2019s biggest network, told Money this week that had \u201cno plans to change [current free roaming] based on the Brexit outcome\u201d. O2 said it would be \u201cworking closely with the government and other European operators to try to protect the current arrangements\u201d. Vodafone\u2019s stance is almost identical.</p> <p>If no government-level agreement is reached, it will then be up to the providers to negotiate agreements with each of the networks across the EU. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15960b11ab7dc853a8f55f673398823ff7f136bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15960b11ab7dc853a8f55f673398823ff7f136bc/0_115_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"University graduates\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK students starting courses this autumn may have to pay higher fees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ison/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>What happens if I apply </strong><strong>for a course in the EU starting in September?</strong></h2> <p>One of the big unknowns has been what will happen to students who start a three- to four-year degree course this coming September. Before Brexit, EU residents could study in any other European country and pay the same fees as if they originated in that country. There are 143,000 EU students studying here, and a smaller but significant number of UK undergraduates studying in EU countries \u2013 where they pay considerably lower fees than in Britain.</p> <p>Most students studying in another EU country who have already started a course have been told they will continue to pay the same \u201chome\u201d fees as they paid in the first year. The British government has also pledged that EU students arriving in the UK to start a course this September will pay the home fees rate \u2013 up to \u00a39,250 a year \u2013 for the course\u2019s duration.</p> <p>This compares with the \u00a330,000-plus fees paid by international students, that they might otherwise have been forced to pay. Crucially, because EU nationals are treated as \u201chome\u201d applicants, they also gain access to the local student finance scheme.</p> <p>It has been less clear as to what will happen to British students starting courses in an EU country this coming autumn \u2013 many of whom will be applying right now. In the Netherlands, a big draw for UK students, those already on courses could be given the same home fee promise.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Dutch government told Money that UK students starting courses this September would pay the home fees \u2013 currently \u20ac2,043 (\u00a31,722) a year \u2013 for the course\u2019s duration provided they remain living and registered in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Without this pledge, British nationals would have to pay international student fees of between \u20ac8,000-\u20ac15,000 a year. Students arriving after 31 December, will be treated as international students and pay the higher fees, the Dutch government confirmed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2494cbed757c8fa6033fac2eade61454c8d2b71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2494cbed757c8fa6033fac2eade61454c8d2b71/0_13_5187_3112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Driving on tree-lined rural road, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britons can still drive in the EU on a UK driving licence the rest of 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Tilley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Will my UK driving licence be acceptable in the EU?</strong></h2> <p>Had the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal, Britons taking their car to most European countries this year would have required an international drivers permit \u2013 in some cases two \u2013 and to travel with a green card proving their car was insured. The fact that we are now in \u201ctransition\u201d means drivers need only produce their UK licence, and their existing UK insurance documents, if asked.</p> <p>Drivers still need to take their V5 ownership document, and a GB sticker is still required. After 31 December \u2013 and the end of the transition period \u2013 drivers permits and green cards will be required, unless an agreement is struck by the government and the EU. A mutual agreement recognising driving licences/insurance between the EU and UK is likely, but by no means guaranteed. Watch this space.</p>",

During this transitional period, which is expected to last until 31 December, EU law will remain in force. Note that this does not mean that everything can still be turned upside down at the end of December this year. It is important to know that when commentators talk about a \u201cno deal\u201d still being on the table at the end of December, this is not the dramatic cliff edge that people referred to last year. The withdrawal agreement, or Brexit deal, that Boris Johnson reached with the EU last October enshrines in law all the rights and legislation pertaining to the three areas of negotiation in the first phase of Brexit talks.

All that remains is for the European parliament to ratify it formally by 29 January for it to be an international treaty. I retired to Spain. Will my state pension still go up every year? Pensioners who have already retired to an EU country \u2013 with Spain the most popular \u2013 can heave a huge sigh of relief. They had been concerned that under a no-deal Brexit their pension could be \u201cfrozen\u201d at the date of leaving the EU, with no further increases. Former pensions minister Ros Altmann says: \u201cCurrent UK pensioners in Europe are guaranteed lifelong state pension uprating: the withdrawal agreement has negotiated reciprocal rights for state pensions to increase in line with those paid in the UK. People\u2019s fears of having their pensions frozen can now be allayed. The government should now reassure these pensioners that, whatever happens after 2020, they have lifelong state pension uprating.\u201d However, the withdrawal agreement does not cover those who retire to Europe after 2020. The government says it is aiming to agree reciprocal arrangements with the EU for the next phase of the UK\u2019s departure. But if it fails to do so by year end, says Altmann, and the implementation period is not extended, future UK pensioners in Europe could have their state pensions frozen. Altmann says there is an \u201curgent need\u201d for the government for the government to better inform existing pensioners. \u201cI am delighted that there is now protection for the 650,000 or so worried British citizens living in European countries. I also hope that the next phase of Brexit will agree reciprocity by end 2020.\u201d Arriving in the EU: which passport queue will you have to join? Nearly all EU airports operate two channels for arrivals \u2013 telling passengers to go through either the EU channel or the (usually much slower) non-EU queue. Officially from 1 February the British are no longer in the EU, but fortunately they will be told to continue to go through the EU queue. What happens after 31 December is much less clear: the Republic of Ireland said there would be a combined EU/UK channel, but other governments are still deciding. At Dublin airport, for example \u2013 where UK passport holders make up around a third of arrivals \u2013 the authorities said: \u201cUK passport holders will continue to be processed by Irish immigration through the EU channel post 31 January. After the end of the transition period at the end of the year, given the common travel area, the signage will be amended and UK passport holders will then go through a combined EU/UK channel rather than a non-EU channel.\u201d The common travel area is a free movement convention between the UK and Ireland that predates the UK joining the EU. We asked other EU governments what their approach will be. In a statement, the Dutch ministry of defence said: \u201cDuring the transition period, expected to start 1 February, the procedure for border checks will remain unchanged. This means that UK travellers can still use the e-gates and/or join the EU+EEA [European Economic Area] channel. After the transition period ends, UK travellers will be subject to more thorough checks as third-country nationals.\u201d The Spanish government said everything would remain the same for British travellers this summer \u2013 and UK tourists could continue to use e-gates as before. Will you now be allowed to buy cheap booze in the duty-free shop? No. During the transition period, which runs until at least 31 December, the rules on what goods you can bring into the UK from the EU remain the same. So on the one hand, you can still take the car to Calais on a booze cruise and return loaded with cheap wine. But on the other, you cannot go into duty-free zone at airports and pay the reduced duty price on alcohol and cigarettes that travellers to, say, North America or Asia currently benefit from. Will I be able to rely on a European health insurance card this summer? Yes. The EHIC, which gives you state-provided healthcare in the EU for free or at reduced cost until you return home, will continue to work as before until the end of December this year. The UK has issued about 27 million of the cards, and you can still apply for a free one \u2013 type \u201cNHS EHIC\u201d into Google and don\u2019t fall for any of the dodgy websites that charge fees. What happens after December? It could continue to work as now, but will depend on what is decided in the negotiations. Note that the EHIC is not the same as a travel insurance policy, and you should still buy holiday cover for your summer break. Will I need a new blue UK passport? No. There will be no change to the British passport, though the UK government has started replacing the EU burgundy covers with blue ones. Will mobile phone firms still offer free roaming after 31 December? Arguably the one thing even the most rabid Brexiters will miss, is how the EU\u2019s roaming rules have allowed mobile users to use their handsets \u201cas if at home\u201d while travelling in another EU country. Britons heading abroad this year will still be able to use their UK calls and data allowance while on holiday. Calls back to the UK, to landline numbers and to other UK mobiles, will still have to be charged as if at home until 31 December. From 1 January 2021, there is nothing legally to stop roaming charges being reintroduced for UK travellers. The mobile operators have indicated they are working to keep the existing regime, but this is not guaranteed. So far, only the Three network has committed to not reintroducing roaming to EU destinations. EE, the UK\u2019s biggest network, told Money this week that had \u201cno plans to change [current free roaming] based on the Brexit outcome\u201d. O2 said it would be \u201cworking closely with the government and other European operators to try to protect the current arrangements\u201d. Vodafone\u2019s stance is almost identical. If no government-level agreement is reached, it will then be up to the providers to negotiate agreements with each of the networks across the EU. What happens if I apply for a course in the EU starting in September? One of the big unknowns has been what will happen to students who start a three- to four-year degree course this coming September. Before Brexit, EU residents could study in any other European country and pay the same fees as if they originated in that country. There are 143,000 EU students studying here, and a smaller but significant number of UK undergraduates studying in EU countries \u2013 where they pay considerably lower fees than in Britain. Most students studying in another EU country who have already started a course have been told they will continue to pay the same \u201chome\u201d fees as they paid in the first year. The British government has also pledged that EU students arriving in the UK to start a course this September will pay the home fees rate \u2013 up to \u00a39,250 a year \u2013 for the course\u2019s duration. This compares with the \u00a330,000-plus fees paid by international students, that they might otherwise have been forced to pay. Crucially, because EU nationals are treated as \u201chome\u201d applicants, they also gain access to the local student finance scheme. It has been less clear as to what will happen to British students starting courses in an EU country this coming autumn \u2013 many of whom will be applying right now. In the Netherlands, a big draw for UK students, those already on courses could be given the same home fee promise. A spokesman for the Dutch government told Money that UK students starting courses this September would pay the home fees \u2013 currently \u20ac2,043 (\u00a31,722) a year \u2013 for the course\u2019s duration provided they remain living and registered in the Netherlands. Without this pledge, British nationals would have to pay international student fees of between \u20ac8,000-\u20ac15,000 a year. Students arriving after 31 December, will be treated as international students and pay the higher fees, the Dutch government confirmed. Will my UK driving licence be acceptable in the EU? Had the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal, Britons taking their car to most European countries this year would have required an international drivers permit \u2013 in some cases two \u2013 and to travel with a green card proving their car was insured. The fact that we are now in \u201ctransition\u201d means drivers need only produce their UK licence, and their existing UK insurance documents, if asked. Drivers still need to take their V5 ownership document, and a GB sticker is still required. After 31 December \u2013 and the end of the transition period \u2013 drivers permits and green cards will be required, unless an agreement is struck by the government and the EU. A mutual agreement recognising driving licences/insurance between the EU and UK is likely, but by no means guaranteed. Watch this space.",

But we are not standing in some vast storage space picking out old tour props; we are in her living room in south London, where the palm tree now takes pride of place behind her TV. Even her cat Calypso eyes it up strangely as she settles on the sofa between us. Jackson had to fight to get her bold centrepiece, haggling with the hire company who kept telling her no. \u201cThey said: \u2018We don\u2019t sell stuff,\u2019 and I was like: \u2018I get that, I\u2019m not stupid, but I will give you anything for it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Fighting to get what she wants has been the overarching theme of Jackson\u2019s tumultuous career so far, and that tenacity forms the foundation of her new album, the supple, groove-led Supervision, the first on her own label. It is still unmistakably La Roux, kaleidoscopic musical references covering her favourite 80s pop from Let\u2019s Dance to Faith, but it also feels looser, a reflection of an artist more comfortable in their own skin. While the album itself carries a sophisticated ease (its eight tracks clock in at a luxuriant 48 minutes), it was preceded by a nightmare of scrapped songs, panic attacks and life-changing decisions.</p> <p>When she arrived with a bang in 2009, all burnt orange Mr Whippy quiff and ear-pricking falsetto, Jackson stood out in a sea of TV talent-show blandness.

On New Year\u2019s Day 2015, a letter from the head of Polydor landed on her doormat, unceremoniously announcing that she was to be dropped. \u201cI opened it and was like: \u2018Yippee, I\u2019m fucking free!\u2019\u201d she smiles. \u201cI knew how lucky I was to get out of that deal\u201d \u2013 she still owed the label three more albums \u2013 \u201cbut everything was a mess. I had no infrastructure whatsoever and I knew I was going to have to start from scratch.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson found career advice in the unlikeliest of places. While filming a cameo in the Absolutely Fabulous movie, she got chatting to Joanna Lumley about how difficult Trouble in Paradise had been to make. \u201c[Lumley] said: \u2018In the future, a warning: if something\u2019s a nightmare at the start just give up, because it will be a nightmare all the way to the end.\u2019 I remember thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going to take note of that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Reader, she did not heed those words. While her new record Supervision was eventually knocked out in four months towards the end of 2018, demoed downstairs in Jackson\u2019s makeshift kitchen studio, and finished with producer Dan Carey (Kylie, Sia, Kate Tempest), it was preceded by an earlier attempt that was marred by destructive old habits. In contrast to her usual openness, Jackson won\u2019t go into details about the early iteration of album three, refusing to name its main collaborator.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll never go into it in interviews but shit got dark,\u201d she says, before adding that \u201cthe main problem was that my confidence wasn\u2019t there at all, still. I felt like [that early album] was displaying the hardships more than the lessons. It all felt really, really wrong.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ2Wsgm_Cjg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DZ2Wsgm_Cjg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Things came to a head at the end of 2017 during a holiday in Greece with her then partner of 10 years. \u201cI was walking to the beach and I kind of just collapsed out of nowhere,\u201d she says, slowly turning her body to the side, her head resting on her fist like a Rodin sculpture. \u201cI was holding on to the floor trying to breathe and I said: \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this unhappy.\u2019 I felt like I needed to walk away from everything in that moment, which then made me have another panic attack.\u201d She sits bolt upright and loudly admonishes herself, rattling through a list of questions she couldn\u2019t find the answers to. \u201cIt was like: \u2018How much longer do you fucking need? What is wrong with you? All you have to do is make fucking music, it\u2019s not that complicated. Why are you so stressed? Where\u2019s your confidence gone? Where did your voice go? And why is this still happening now, when you\u2019re on holiday?\u2019\u201d That last one makes her laugh, as does the memory of telling her mum, Trudie Goodwin, AKA The Bill\u2019s Sergeant June Ackland, she was scrapping a near-completed album. \u201cShe was like: \u2018I\u2019m going to have a heart attack and die because of you,\u2019\u201d she says, her south London accent growing more pronounced. \u201cImagine being me! But I knew I had to stop doing things that made me unhappy.\u201d</p> <p>Once the decision was made, everything changed. \u201cI think that whole process made me see other things more clearly,\u201d she says. She ended her relationship. \u201cI was a mess. I felt unfair about the person I was being, like it wasn\u2019t right to be with anyone else at that point.\u201d She channels this clarity into the aptly titled Supervision, be it playfully poking fun at ideas around control on the disco-tinged lead single International Woman of Leisure or directly digging into the split on Automatic Driver\u2019s loping funk. Not that Jackson consciously planned it that way, with the song\u2019s prescient lyrics, including \u201csometimes I feel like we\u2019re just pretending\u201d, eked out of garbled melodies she had left on the demo.</p> <p>While Jackson is hardly a closed book, she has been keen to keep her personal life out of interviews, typically employing the less-is-more edict previously adopted by her heroes Prince and David Bowie. \u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve been really nervous about speaking about my sexuality because there currently isn\u2019t a word for how I feel,\u201d she explains steadily. \u201cAndrogyny 90% covers it, I\u2019d say, but I\u2019ve felt weird about using the term \u2018gay\u2019. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m straight, because I\u2019m not, it\u2019s just that that particular word doesn\u2019t feel accurate for me.\u201d She remembers telling her parents she was in love with her best friend, which came as a relief to her mum, apparently still in character from The Bill. \u201cShe was like: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s why you hang out so much! We thought you were doing a lot of drugs in your room.\u2019\u201d For a time, she says, she thought she might be bisexual. \u201cBut then I thought: \u2018Well I can sleep with [men], that\u2019s not an issue, but that\u2019s not the same as falling in love with them.\u2019\u201d She says part of her distrust of labels stems from frustration at hearing people define bisexuality as being about having sex with \u201canything that lives and breathes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a623c7eea8d0b7a222d351065182ebda18d3e67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a623c7eea8d0b7a222d351065182ebda18d3e67/0_184_1995_2492/801.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson at Glastonbury Festival in 2010\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Worthy performance... Jackson at Glastonbury in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Besides, sex is not hugely important to her. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I make music instead of having sex,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cI like playing with the feeling and sounds of being sexy and maybe that\u2019s my outlet. And I\u2019m not asexual, either, before anyone starts,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf men had any patience in bed they could possibly be of use, but they don\u2019t.\u201d She lets out a palm tree-rattling cackle, before becoming serious again just as quickly. \u201cI just found there was a lot of pushiness around labelling myself. Over time, I\u2019ve understood myself a lot better and now I can be happier with my sexuality. At the moment I don\u2019t feel like I even have a sexuality because I\u2019m not aiming it at anything or anyone. Male, female or otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson is acutely aware that, as in 2009, she is still a glorious anomaly. Her recent appearance on Jools\u2019 Annual Hootenanny was a case in point. Sandwiched between the likes of Tom Walker and Stereophonics, Jackson \u2013 resplendent in shiny pink bomber jacket and what looked like MC Hammer\u2019s old trousers \u2013 seemed like an extravagantly dressed alien. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a shock to people now,\u201d she says of standing out. \u201cAll the more reason for me to do it.\u201d She laments the end of the era when pop stars could be both otherworldly entertainers and perfectionist musicians. \u201cNow, you\u2019re either PJ Harvey or you\u2019re Dua Lipa,\u201d she says. \u201cAs we get further down that line, I find having my own lane in pop music harder and harder.\u201d</p> <p>But that is a worry for another time; for now Jackson is just happy her strongest relationship remains intact. \u201cI realised music was about enjoyment,\u201d she smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be about having a hit, or making money, or keeping your label happy, or any of that dirty bollocks. It\u2019s about making <em>me</em> happy. That\u2019s why I do it.\u201d </p> <p><em>Supervision is out on 7 February</em></p>",

And why is this still happening now, when you\u2019re on holiday?\u2019\u201d That last one makes her laugh, as does the memory of telling her mum, Trudie Goodwin, AKA The Bill\u2019s Sergeant June Ackland, she was scrapping a near-completed album. \u201cShe was like: \u2018I\u2019m going to have a heart attack and die because of you,\u2019\u201d she says, her south London accent growing more pronounced. \u201cImagine being me! But I knew I had to stop doing things that made me unhappy.\u201d Once the decision was made, everything changed. \u201cI think that whole process made me see other things more clearly,\u201d she says. She ended her relationship. \u201cI was a mess. I felt unfair about the person I was being, like it wasn\u2019t right to be with anyone else at that point.\u201d She channels this clarity into the aptly titled Supervision, be it playfully poking fun at ideas around control on the disco-tinged lead single International Woman of Leisure or directly digging into the split on Automatic Driver\u2019s loping funk. Not that Jackson consciously planned it that way, with the song\u2019s prescient lyrics, including \u201csometimes I feel like we\u2019re just pretending\u201d, eked out of garbled melodies she had left on the demo. While Jackson is hardly a closed book, she has been keen to keep her personal life out of interviews, typically employing the less-is-more edict previously adopted by her heroes Prince and David Bowie. \u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve been really nervous about speaking about my sexuality because there currently isn\u2019t a word for how I feel,\u201d she explains steadily. \u201cAndrogyny 90% covers it, I\u2019d say, but I\u2019ve felt weird about using the term \u2018gay\u2019. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m straight, because I\u2019m not, it\u2019s just that that particular word doesn\u2019t feel accurate for me.\u201d She remembers telling her parents she was in love with her best friend, which came as a relief to her mum, apparently still in character from The Bill. \u201cShe was like: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s why you hang out so much! We thought you were doing a lot of drugs in your room.\u2019\u201d For a time, she says, she thought she might be bisexual. \u201cBut then I thought: \u2018Well I can sleep with [men], that\u2019s not an issue, but that\u2019s not the same as falling in love with them.\u2019\u201d She says part of her distrust of labels stems from frustration at hearing people define bisexuality as being about having sex with \u201canything that lives and breathes\u201d. Besides, sex is not hugely important to her. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I make music instead of having sex,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cI like playing with the feeling and sounds of being sexy and maybe that\u2019s my outlet. And I\u2019m not asexual, either, before anyone starts,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf men had any patience in bed they could possibly be of use, but they don\u2019t.\u201d She lets out a palm tree-rattling cackle, before becoming serious again just as quickly. \u201cI just found there was a lot of pushiness around labelling myself. Over time, I\u2019ve understood myself a lot better and now I can be happier with my sexuality. At the moment I don\u2019t feel like I even have a sexuality because I\u2019m not aiming it at anything or anyone. Male, female or otherwise.\u201d Jackson is acutely aware that, as in 2009, she is still a glorious anomaly. Her recent appearance on Jools\u2019 Annual Hootenanny was a case in point. Sandwiched between the likes of Tom Walker and Stereophonics, Jackson \u2013 resplendent in shiny pink bomber jacket and what looked like MC Hammer\u2019s old trousers \u2013 seemed like an extravagantly dressed alien. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a shock to people now,\u201d she says of standing out. \u201cAll the more reason for me to do it.\u201d She laments the end of the era when pop stars could be both otherworldly entertainers and perfectionist musicians. \u201cNow, you\u2019re either PJ Harvey or you\u2019re Dua Lipa,\u201d she says. \u201cAs we get further down that line, I find having my own lane in pop music harder and harder.\u201d But that is a worry for another time; for now Jackson is just happy her strongest relationship remains intact. \u201cI realised music was about enjoyment,\u201d she smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be about having a hit, or making money, or keeping your label happy, or any of that dirty bollocks. It\u2019s about making me happy. That\u2019s why I do it.\u201d Supervision is out on 7 February",

      "body": "<p>During the first half of my working day, I am generally able to leave my office shed for a break in a warm, silent kitchen, where I can drink coffee and stare back out the window at my empty desk with a certain satisfaction. In the afternoons, however, with the winter sun already dipping behind the roofline, the kitchen becomes a hive of inactivity. Whenever I go in, two or more of my sons are to be found hunched over laptops at the kitchen table. Charging cords are stretched across the room at knee height.

      "bodyText": "During the first half of my working day, I am generally able to leave my office shed for a break in a warm, silent kitchen, where I can drink coffee and stare back out the window at my empty desk with a certain satisfaction. In the afternoons, however, with the winter sun already dipping behind the roofline, the kitchen becomes a hive of inactivity. Whenever I go in, two or more of my sons are to be found hunched over laptops at the kitchen table. Charging cords are stretched across the room at knee height. To the untrained eye, the kitchen looks like a place of business, specifically the kind of tech startup where you\u2019re allowed to turn up for work at three, in bare feet. \u201cHey,\u201d I say, pulling the back door shut. \u201cWhat\u2019s good?\u201d the youngest one says. \u201cAll right?\u201d the oldest one says.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Don\u2019t </strong><strong>plan too far ahead</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s a tendency to focus on the big things coming in the year ahead (a child starting school, a teenager heading to university, a son or daughter getting married) and start worrying. \u201cMake a list of what\u2019s going to happen, then put it in a drawer and forget about it,\u201d says Samantha Abraham, a life coach with 20 years\u2019 experience working with families. \u201cIt\u2019s much better to tackle family life a month, or even a week, at a time. Change is going to happen, and it\u2019s often easier to cope with in the moment. You won\u2019t make it easier by worrying.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Clear </strong><strong>clutter</strong></h2> <p>Getting rid of things you no longer need frees up space for fresh energy and ideas. \u201cMake space-clearing a ritual,\u201d Sue Holmes, feng shui and space clearing consultant at <a href=\"http://firehorse.uk.com/\" title=\"\">firehorse.uk.com</a>. \u201cThis is the ideal time for it. Put a bin bag out and ask everyone to contribute before taking it to the charity shop: things you never wear, old toys that aren\u2019t played with, books that will never be read. If it\u2019s difficult for people to part with something, try putting it in a bag and keeping it in a cupboard for a month. If no one has missed it after that, it can go.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Make mealtimes sacred</strong></h2> <p>In my family, we have only one rule: no phones at shared mealtimes. That includes adults, even visiting ones. Mealtimes are a chance to share across the generations, and for everyone to have a voice and space. They work if everyone pitches in, and respects the value of the occasion.</p> <h2><strong>Take time for yourself</strong></h2> <p>Having said that, it\u2019s worth carving out some space for yourself, to see the big picture. What do you want from life \u2013 for yourself, for your family? \u201cOften we\u2019re so busy we don\u2019t focus on our bigger goals,\u201d Abraham says. \u201cMake time to do that: it might be going for a coffee once a week by yourself, or meeting up with someone to talk things through. Try to find someone who\u2019s at a different stage from you to bounce thoughts off. That way, you get a different perspective.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Start talking about money</strong></h2> <p>This doesn\u2019t happen enough. Look at what the issues are and make a plan. You should be saving, says Brian Brown, consumer finance expert at Defaqto, because every family needs a rainy-day fund. \u201cThink small: regular amounts put away grow, so look at saving even \u00a330 or \u00a350 a month, forget about it, and after a while you\u2019ll have a few thousand. Look at how you can cut back: how about one less takeaway a month? Or look at switching to a cheaper gas supplier.\u201d</p> <p>A big issue in families right now, says Brown, is intergenerational transfer. Younger people haven\u2019t got enough money for a house deposit, but their parents and grandparents are sitting on valuable properties. \u201cCan you free up some of that capital?\u201d he asks. \u201cCould parents or grandparents sell and move somewhere smaller \u2013 or consider equity release, which has some very competitive rates at the moment, or intergenerational mortgages.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Switch jobs</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s easy to get into a rut about who does what chores, so why not shake things up a bit? Instead of one person always doing the washing-up and the other putting out the rubbish, swap chores. Or let the person who never does the gardening try some planting, while the gardener cooks.</p> <h2><strong>Get fit together</strong></h2> <p>Fitting in fitness is a big issue for families: everyone knows it matters, for mental as well as physical health, but it\u2019s easy to prioritise other things. Lucinda Newman-Jones, a personal trainer who works with her husband at <a href=\"http://fitnessrunsinthefamily.com/\" title=\"\">fitnessrunsinthefamily.com</a>, recommends getting fit together. \u201cThat way it\u2019s a bonding exercise \u2013 and it\u2019s a lot more fun,\u201d she says. \u201cTry <a href=\"https://www.parkrun.org.uk/\" title=\"\">parkruns</a>; or if you go for a jog or cycle ride, take along younger kids on their scooters. Think of the wider benefits, rather than focusing too much on weight loss \u2013 it\u2019s about feeling better and having fun with your family rather than fitting into a smaller size of clothes.\u201d Or try an online workout: ring-fence a bit of time you\u2019d otherwise have squandered, and using it for a family keep-fit session. \u201cHow about that 20 minutes when the food is in the oven for supper, instead of scrolling through your phone?\u201d says Newman-Jones. \u201cIf other people don\u2019t want to join you, just carry right on. Fitness is infectious: if you do it, chances are that eventually everyone else will join in.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Shop more mindfully</strong></h2> <p>Why are we all hoarding food as though there\u2019s going to be a mass shortage? It\u2019s far better for the planet, and our pockets, to use what we\u2019ve got in our cupboards and freezers, then to buy what we need in smaller quantities. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely the way to develop more thoughtful shopping,\u201d says Jenny Chandler, who runs courses for <a href=\"https://www.seasonedcourses.com/jenny-chandler\" title=\"\">Seasoned </a><a href=\"https://www.seasonedcourses.com/jenny-chandler\" title=\"\">cookery </a><a href=\"https://www.seasonedcourses.com/jenny-chandler\" title=\"\">school</a>. Every Monday, she whizzes up all the vegetables in her fridge into a minestrone soup, vegetable curry or with chick peas for a flavoured hummus (\u201cdon\u2019t worry about a recipe\u201d), forming the basis for lunch or dinner for the week.</p> <h2><strong>Rethink your home</strong></h2> <p>Family space is all about relationships, so you want your home to help you interact. \u201cReappraise your home with that view in mind: do you have a welcoming place where you can sit with your children?\u201d asks Holmes. \u201cThink about sociability: the focal point is often the TV, but could you move it and make the seating circular, so people are facing one another to encourage conversation?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Welcome others in</strong></h2> <p>Being generous and welcoming to others outside your immediate family will enhance relationships in every direction. Having friends, relatives or neighbours around your table dramatically reduces the risk of fallouts and changes the dynamic in interesting, and often fruitful, new directions. Invite cousins you\u2019ve not been in touch with for ages over for a meal, or friends you don\u2019t spend enough time with.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:%20weekend@theguardian.com\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "A reallocation of council funding could redirect hundreds of millions of pounds from so-called left-behind communities in the north of England to the leafy southern shires, analysis has found, leaving many newly Conservative voting \u201cred wall\u201d areas facing fresh cuts to local services. Under a review of the local authority funding formula, \u00a3320m a year could be shifted out of councils in England\u2019s most deprived areas while Tory-controlled shire councils mainly in the south-east gain \u00a3300m. High-profile losers include many constituencies that elected new Tory MPs in December, including Workington, which would suffer from Cumbria county council\u2019s \u00a35m loss, and Sedgefield, which would feel the impact of \u00a310m being taken out of Durham county council. An estimated 37 of the 50 new Tory MPs \u2013 amounting to 70% of the gains made by the Conservatives at the general election \u2013 represent areas that are set to lose millions a year. Other notable losers include Stoke-on-Trent, Redcar, West Bromwich, Bishop Auckland, Grimsby and Leigh. The analysis, commissioned by the Local Government Association, presentsBoris Johnson with an early test of his promise to \u201clevel up\u201d resources between the south and the north and Midlands.

At the time, ministers have refused to bail it out, saying this would be a reward for failure. The Conservative-run East Sussex, council, which hit the headlines in 2018 after warning that cuts would pare local services back to a \u201cbare legal minimum\u201d, stands to gain \u00a36m a year, while Wokingham in Berkshire, one of England\u2019s most affluent boroughs, could get a 30% funding rise. Johnson made a high-profile visit to Sedgefield \u2013 for many years Tony Blair\u2019s seat \u2013 the morning after the election to celebrate his party\u2019s emphatic victory, and he promised to repay the trust of voters who had helped propel him to power by switching from Labour to Tory.

It resisted pressure to make its economic approach more centrist. It took control of London\u2019s municipal government and used it as a showcase for radical policies. Despite press hostility, and a BBC much more interested in the Conservatives, Labour steadily grew its support \u2013 particularly in the south and among the young, who often suffered most from a sluggish, unbalanced economy and the Tories\u2019 austerity policies. The 1930s were a long time ago, and slow politics was easier to practise then, in a totally different media environment. But the period demonstrates something about the left that some of those inside it, and many outside, often forget: success tends to come from sticking to controversial but far-sighted ideas and patiently building new electoral coalitions around them, rather than from sudden breakthroughs during times of social and economic turbulence. During the 2019 election, Jeremy Corbyn and Labour seemed to forget that his most potent political feature \u2013his moral authority \u2013 had been built up over decades. He campaigned in too much of a hurry. His successor is going to have to ignore demands to demonstrate immediate progress. Politics may have settled down, but many voters and journalists remain impatient with it, as Johnson will find out when his honeymoon ends. Even the SNP \u2013 electorally secure in ways Labour and the Tories can only dream of \u2013 may increasingly struggle to persuade some of its supporters that independence is going to take years more. Politics might also become more measured if the media treated it less like a soap opera, and more like something connected to how Britons are actually living, and how that\u2019s always changing. British politics isn\u2019t going to slow right down. The electoral system creates volatility. There will always be crises; some already under way, such as the climate emergency, can\u2019t wait years for governments to attend to them. But unless the UK accepts again that politics sometimes needs to be slow, its political life will be all stalemates and frenzies. Neither is a great environment for democracy. \u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Across Europe, historic cities are buckling. Mass tourism, encouraged by cash-hungry councils after the 2008 crash and fuelled by the explosion of cheap flights and online room rentals, has become a monster. The backlash, however, has begun.</p> <p>In the past decade, the number of low-cost airline seats available each year in Europe has risen by more than 10% annually, <a href=\"https://www.anna.aero/2018/07/18/lcc-capacity-in-europe-set-for-half-a-billion-seats-in-2018/\">more than doubling</a> to more than 500m. </p> <p>Meanwhile Airbnb, the biggest but far from only holiday lettings platform, has reported triple-digit growth in several European cities over the past five years, driving 10 of them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/20/ten-cities-ask-eu-for-help-to-fight-airbnb-expansion\">to ask the EU for help</a>. The cities have between 10,000 and 60,000 listings each.</p> <p>The net result is that over the course of a year, popular short-break destinations such as Barcelona and Amsterdam are hosting 20 or more visitors for each inhabitant, prompting angry protests from locals and forcing city halls to take action.</p> <p>It is not always evident, however, what that action should be \u2013 or if it will work. The trade-off between the revenues and jobs generated through tourism and quality of life is a tricky one. So the idea is not discouragement but management, say city halls.</p> <h2>Amsterdam</h2> <p>Overtourism in the historic centre of Amsterdam had gone beyond the already extreme nuisance of drunken visitors vomiting nightly on 17th-century doorsteps and urinating copiously in canals, according to city hall.</p> <p>With more than 19 million tourists in 2018 thronging a warren of narrow streets and alleyways that are home to 850,000 people, it was getting dangerous. \u201cAt times there was a real safety concern,\u201d said Vera Al, of the finance and economic affairs department.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/amsterdam-zip/giv-3902MhUfi6Pwtk1S/\" data-alt=\"Tourist numbers in Amsterdam\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/amsterdam-zip/giv-3902MhUfi6Pwtk1S/\">Tourist numbers in Amsterdam</a> </figure>  <p>The most crowded parts of the city \u2013 the red light district and the main nightlife areas of Rembrandtplein and Leidseplein \u2013 were becoming unliveable; in the old centre shops selling wooden tulips, vacuum-packed cheese or cannabis seeds were replacing chemists, greengrocers and hairdressers. Doctors could no longer find surgery space.</p> <p>More than 60,000 jobs in Amsterdam are directly linked to tourism and visitors to the city spend more than \u20ac6bn (\u00a35bn) annually.</p> <p>But over the past two years, the council has adopted tough measures. Tour coaches have mostly been banished to the outskirts and new shops catering solely to tourists have been outlawed by rewritten zoning regulations.</p> <p>There will be no new hotels once developers have exhausted existing licenses. Pending a possible outright ban in some neighbourhoods, Airbnb-style lets must sleep no more than four and cannot be let for more than 30 days a year.</p> <p>A tourist tax has been launched: \u20ac3 per person per night, on top of a 7% levy on each hotel room (10% on accommodation booked person-to-person online). \u201cTourists increase the cost of policing and cleaning the public space,\u201d said Al, who works with deputy mayor Victor Everhardt. \u201cWe say it\u2019s only fair they should contribute to them.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the worst excesses, such as beer bikes \u2013 a pedal-powered mobile bar groups of drinkers \u2013 have been outlawed in the city centre. Tours of the red light district\u2019s windows, running once every couple of minutes, are to be banned from 1 April, when all guided tours of the old centre will also require permits.</p> <p>The new mayor, Femke Halsema, has even tabled four possible options for the historic sex workers\u2019 district, known as De Wallen. These include relocating all or part of it to other parts of the city, which would be a big call, politically, for part of the fabric of old Amsterdam.</p> <p>Somewhat less controversially, city hall has run several successful tourist awareness campaigns, including plastering large posters portraying residentson city centre doors, each bearing the slogan \u201cWe live here.\u201d</p> <p>The concerted drive involves the mayor and all eight deputies. \u201cIt crosses all departments,\u201d Al said. \u201cNone of it is rocket science, and we hope that taken together these measures will add up.\u201d</p> <p>Nationally, said Elsje van Vuuren of the Dutch tourist board NBTC, the strategy is about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/06/we-must-act-now-netherlands-tries-to-control-tourism-boom\">dispersing visitors to lesser-known</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/06/we-must-act-now-netherlands-tries-to-control-tourism-boom\"> but equally attractive</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/06/we-must-act-now-netherlands-tries-to-control-tourism-boom\"> towns</a>. The board has stopped promoting the Netherlands as a destination and aims instead to better manage the flow.</p> <p>Amsterdam has no illusions, however, that its programme will reduce the number of tourists visiting the city \u2013 or even significantly slow a rate of growth due to bring 40 million visitors a year to the Netherlands by 2030.</p> <p>\u201cThe focus is really about restoring liveability for all those who have been affected,\u201d said Al. \u201cIt\u2019s about making residents feel at home again. They shouldn\u2019t feel like strangers in their own city. We believe a city is first for living in. Only second for visiting.\u201d</p> <h2>Barcelona</h2> <p>About 30 million people will visit Barcelona this year, a seemingly unstoppable tide, which has prompted exasperated residents to resort to ill-concealed irony.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone you have been on holiday to Barcelona,\u201d reads one leaflet recently handed out to tourists. \u201cThey will steal the city from us, and it will stop being attractive to you and liveable for us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7af1d617601b857f6b62e0a6785516fa3be8ab52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7af1d617601b857f6b62e0a6785516fa3be8ab52/0_250_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Visitors ride bikes in Barcelona\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visitors ride bikes through Barcelona.

Its Plan 2020 initiative aims to change \u201cfrom managing tourism in the city, to managing the tourist city\u201d \u2013 although Xavier Marc\u00e9, the councillor responsible, insists residents take priority.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in managing a tourist city,\u201d he said. Dispersal is the answer, Marc\u00e9 believes: the problem is not so much that Barcelona has sold itself but that it\u2019s sold itself badly. Aware the sector brings in about \u20ac10bn a year, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want more tourists but that doesn\u2019t mean we want fewer.\u201d</p> <p>As the city\u2019s well-known sites, such as the Sagrada Familia, la Rambla and Park G\u00fcell are over-subscribed, the idea is to divert people to other areas and activities. The city is in talks with booking.com and others to devise an alternative visitor\u2019s package.</p> <p>Barcelona has also declared a moratorium on new hotels in its most touristed areas, pushing visitors to the periphery (although as Pere Marin\u00e9 of the 120-member Federation of Barcelona Residents\u2019 Associations noted, where people sleep \u201cdoesn\u2019t make much difference. They all want to go to the Sagrada Familia.\u201d)</p> <p>Despite trying hard, the city seems unable to control the rise of Airbnb and others. According to a Vic University study, Barcelona has the highest density of tourist apartments in Europe: 12 for every 1,000 residents, compared with 10 in Rome and seven in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/barcelona-zip/giv-3902jGLWxH32coUp/\" data-alt=\"Tourist numbers in Barcelona\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/barcelona-zip/giv-3902jGLWxH32coUp/\">Tourist numbers in Barcelona</a> </figure>  <p>For residents, this has translated into a 50% rent increase over the past five years. A 24-year-old earning an average wage now faces a monthly rent equal to 114% of their salary. As a result, about 80% of 16- to 30-year-olds still live with their parents.</p> <p>The battle to reduce the number of available beds will not affect the millions of daytrippers. As many as 20,000 a day disembark from cruise ships to head for the sites but spend little ashore. More arrive by coach, clogging up and polluting the city.</p> <p>Marc\u00e9 plans to force coaches to park on Barcelona\u2019s perimeter and their passengers to use the already saturated public transport network; extra buses will be financed by a new Barcelona tourist tax, he says.</p> <p>While residents are fed up with mass tourism, Marin\u00e9 says there is no real popular movement for change, partly because tourists mean jobs. A demo with the slogan \u201cBarcelona is not for sale\u201d drew 2,000 people: \u201cThat\u2019s not going to change anything.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, the city\u2019s powers are limited and the Catalan regional government tends to share the hospitality industry\u2019s view that more is better. As tour operators survey the growing Asian market, millions more are due to discover Barcelona\u2019s not-so-secret treasures. <strong>Stephen Burgen</strong></p> <h2>Florence</h2> <p>Sick of the sight of tourists picnicking on the steps of Renaissance monuments, the mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, announced in 2017 that he would douse the surfaces with water to keep people at bay.</p> <p>The hosepipe ploy never became permanent, only being used a couple of times on the steps of key monuments, such as the Basilica of Santa Croce, the burial place of Michelangelo, and the Chiesa di Santo Spirito. But the message resonated.</p> <p>\u201cThere does seem to have been a rise in awareness and sensitivity among visitors,\u201d said Cecilia Del Re, Florence\u2019s councillor for tourism and the environment. \u201cWe did a lot of campaigning, telling people not to throw their rubbish on the street and to respect the city, and this is showing some results.\u201d</p> <p>Hefty fines for people caught scrawling their name on the Ponte Vecchio or peeing in the street in the historic centre, a Unesco world heritage site, have also improved decorum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b5f591f47f0a893909540f2211a6a979a2c640a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b5f591f47f0a893909540f2211a6a979a2c640a/0_159_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence.

      "bodyText": "Across Europe, historic cities are buckling. Mass tourism, encouraged by cash-hungry councils after the 2008 crash and fuelled by the explosion of cheap flights and online room rentals, has become a monster. The backlash, however, has begun. In the past decade, the number of low-cost airline seats available each year in Europe has risen by more than 10% annually, more than doubling to more than 500m. Meanwhile Airbnb, the biggest but far from only holiday lettings platform, has reported triple-digit growth in several European cities over the past five years, driving 10 of them to ask the EU for help. The cities have between 10,000 and 60,000 listings each. The net result is that over the course of a year, popular short-break destinations such as Barcelona and Amsterdam are hosting 20 or more visitors for each inhabitant, prompting angry protests from locals and forcing city halls to take action. It is not always evident, however, what that action should be \u2013 or if it will work. The trade-off between the revenues and jobs generated through tourism and quality of life is a tricky one. So the idea is not discouragement but management, say city halls. Amsterdam Overtourism in the historic centre of Amsterdam had gone beyond the already extreme nuisance of drunken visitors vomiting nightly on 17th-century doorsteps and urinating copiously in canals, according to city hall. With more than 19 million tourists in 2018 thronging a warren of narrow streets and alleyways that are home to 850,000 people, it was getting dangerous. \u201cAt times there was a real safety concern,\u201d said Vera Al, of the finance and economic affairs department. The most crowded parts of the city \u2013 the red light district and the main nightlife areas of Rembrandtplein and Leidseplein \u2013 were becoming unliveable; in the old centre shops selling wooden tulips, vacuum-packed cheese or cannabis seeds were replacing chemists, greengrocers and hairdressers. Doctors could no longer find surgery space. More than 60,000 jobs in Amsterdam are directly linked to tourism and visitors to the city spend more than \u20ac6bn (\u00a35bn) annually. But over the past two years, the council has adopted tough measures. Tour coaches have mostly been banished to the outskirts and new shops catering solely to tourists have been outlawed by rewritten zoning regulations. There will be no new hotels once developers have exhausted existing licenses. Pending a possible outright ban in some neighbourhoods, Airbnb-style lets must sleep no more than four and cannot be let for more than 30 days a year. A tourist tax has been launched: \u20ac3 per person per night, on top of a 7% levy on each hotel room (10% on accommodation booked person-to-person online). \u201cTourists increase the cost of policing and cleaning the public space,\u201d said Al, who works with deputy mayor Victor Everhardt. \u201cWe say it\u2019s only fair they should contribute to them.\u201d Some of the worst excesses, such as beer bikes \u2013 a pedal-powered mobile bar groups of drinkers \u2013 have been outlawed in the city centre. Tours of the red light district\u2019s windows, running once every couple of minutes, are to be banned from 1 April, when all guided tours of the old centre will also require permits. The new mayor, Femke Halsema, has even tabled four possible options for the historic sex workers\u2019 district, known as De Wallen. These include relocating all or part of it to other parts of the city, which would be a big call, politically, for part of the fabric of old Amsterdam. Somewhat less controversially, city hall has run several successful tourist awareness campaigns, including plastering large posters portraying residentson city centre doors, each bearing the slogan \u201cWe live here.\u201d The concerted drive involves the mayor and all eight deputies. \u201cIt crosses all departments,\u201d Al said. \u201cNone of it is rocket science, and we hope that taken together these measures will add up.\u201d Nationally, said Elsje van Vuuren of the Dutch tourist board NBTC, the strategy is about dispersing visitors to lesser-known but equally attractive towns. The board has stopped promoting the Netherlands as a destination and aims instead to better manage the flow. Amsterdam has no illusions, however, that its programme will reduce the number of tourists visiting the city \u2013 or even significantly slow a rate of growth due to bring 40 million visitors a year to the Netherlands by 2030. \u201cThe focus is really about restoring liveability for all those who have been affected,\u201d said Al. \u201cIt\u2019s about making residents feel at home again. They shouldn\u2019t feel like strangers in their own city. We believe a city is first for living in. Only second for visiting.\u201d Barcelona About 30 million people will visit Barcelona this year, a seemingly unstoppable tide, which has prompted exasperated residents to resort to ill-concealed irony. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone you have been on holiday to Barcelona,\u201d reads one leaflet recently handed out to tourists. \u201cThey will steal the city from us, and it will stop being attractive to you and liveable for us.\u201d The city\u2019s response is improved management. Its Plan 2020 initiative aims to change \u201cfrom managing tourism in the city, to managing the tourist city\u201d \u2013 although Xavier Marc\u00e9, the councillor responsible, insists residents take priority. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in managing a tourist city,\u201d he said. Dispersal is the answer, Marc\u00e9 believes: the problem is not so much that Barcelona has sold itself but that it\u2019s sold itself badly. Aware the sector brings in about \u20ac10bn a year, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want more tourists but that doesn\u2019t mean we want fewer.\u201d As the city\u2019s well-known sites, such as the Sagrada Familia, la Rambla and Park G\u00fcell are over-subscribed, the idea is to divert people to other areas and activities. The city is in talks with booking.com and others to devise an alternative visitor\u2019s package. Barcelona has also declared a moratorium on new hotels in its most touristed areas, pushing visitors to the periphery (although as Pere Marin\u00e9 of the 120-member Federation of Barcelona Residents\u2019 Associations noted, where people sleep \u201cdoesn\u2019t make much difference. They all want to go to the Sagrada Familia.\u201d) Despite trying hard, the city seems unable to control the rise of Airbnb and others. According to a Vic University study, Barcelona has the highest density of tourist apartments in Europe: 12 for every 1,000 residents, compared with 10 in Rome and seven in London. For residents, this has translated into a 50% rent increase over the past five years. A 24-year-old earning an average wage now faces a monthly rent equal to 114% of their salary. As a result, about 80% of 16- to 30-year-olds still live with their parents. The battle to reduce the number of available beds will not affect the millions of daytrippers. As many as 20,000 a day disembark from cruise ships to head for the sites but spend little ashore. More arrive by coach, clogging up and polluting the city. Marc\u00e9 plans to force coaches to park on Barcelona\u2019s perimeter and their passengers to use the already saturated public transport network; extra buses will be financed by a new Barcelona tourist tax, he says. While residents are fed up with mass tourism, Marin\u00e9 says there is no real popular movement for change, partly because tourists mean jobs. A demo with the slogan \u201cBarcelona is not for sale\u201d drew 2,000 people: \u201cThat\u2019s not going to change anything.\u201d Ultimately, the city\u2019s powers are limited and the Catalan regional government tends to share the hospitality industry\u2019s view that more is better. As tour operators survey the growing Asian market, millions more are due to discover Barcelona\u2019s not-so-secret treasures. Stephen Burgen Florence Sick of the sight of tourists picnicking on the steps of Renaissance monuments, the mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, announced in 2017 that he would douse the surfaces with water to keep people at bay. The hosepipe ploy never became permanent, only being used a couple of times on the steps of key monuments, such as the Basilica of Santa Croce, the burial place of Michelangelo, and the Chiesa di Santo Spirito. But the message resonated. \u201cThere does seem to have been a rise in awareness and sensitivity among visitors,\u201d said Cecilia Del Re, Florence\u2019s councillor for tourism and the environment. \u201cWe did a lot of campaigning, telling people not to throw their rubbish on the street and to respect the city, and this is showing some results.\u201d Hefty fines for people caught scrawling their name on the Ponte Vecchio or peeing in the street in the historic centre, a Unesco world heritage site, have also improved decorum. Attracting 14 million tourists a year, Florence is Italy\u2019s most-visited city after Venice and Rome. Boasting a huge and rich variety of the world\u2019s heritage and surrounded by Tuscany\u2019s rolling hills, the city\u2019s popularity is easy to understand. But as with Venice and Rome, the growth in tourism has seen residents driven out of town by the rising cost of living and arrival of Airbnb: according to a Siena university study, one in five properties in the historic centre is advertised as a short-term let. Some measures, however, seem to be paying off. \u201cOne of the main issues is that everyone is so focused on the historic centre, which is only a 5km sq area in a city of 105km sq,\u201d said Del Re. \u201cSo we are heavily promoting areas outside of the centre. \u201cWe are also close to launching an app that will direct people to other sites if, for example, the Uffizi Gallery is too crowded.\u201d The city is also working with lesser known, but equally beautiful, towns in Tuscany, such as Arezzo, to promote them. City leaders are against imposing daily limits on the numbers who can enter the centre, but have increased tenfold the cost of taking tour buses that bring people to the city for a couple of hours. They are also promoting \u201ccongress tourism\u201d, where people visit the city for a conference or business meeting and stay for a few days. Meanwhile, Florence authorities have converted some public property into social housing to motivate young people to move in. \u201cWe want to re-incentivise people to live in the historic centre,\u201d said Del Re. Angela Guiffrida Prague The crowds surging into Prague\u2019s majestic Old Town Square to witness last year\u2019s seasonal illumination of Christmas lights were so vast that ambulance crews and squads of police officers were needed in case things got out of hand. The packed scene and cosmopolitan nature of the gathered multitudes seemed to attest to a marketing triumph that had assisted the Czech capital\u2019s arrival as a first-rank global tourist draw. Yet the vast number of foreign visitors crammed into the modestly sized square crystallised what has become one of Prague authorities\u2019 biggest headaches, prompting a major rethink of its tourism strategy that may eventually include a crackdown on short-term lettings. The sheer numbers drawn by the beautiful but relatively small medieval old town \u2013 encompassing Prague castle, the 600-year-old Charles bridge and a maze of ancient cobbled streets \u2013 has put a strain on resources and quality of life that many long-established residents find intolerable. A rising exodus of native residents and the growth of often tacky tourist shops at the expense of those catering for locals finally forced the authorities to act. The first step is a major publicity campaign to encourage visitors to explore greater Prague, a city of 1.4 million residents, beyond the limited quarter on either bank of the River Vltava, where the majority of its most storied buildings, as well as touristy restaurants and pubs, are located. \u201cToo many people are coming just for a very small number of purposes, of buildings,\u201d said Pavel \u010ci\u017einsk\u00fd, the former mayor of the Prague 1 municipality, which includes the historic old town district. \u201cTo disperse the tourists more, I think it is necessary to involve more those who are running the tourist industry. \u201cThe guides must say to their groups, do you want to go through these crowds where everything is twice as expensive, or do you want to go and see something which is maybe half a kilometre from Charles bridge, but which is also nice.\u201d The local tourist authority has published brochures called Prague Walks promoting the attractions of other neighbourhoods of historic interest, including Vinohrady, Karl\u00edn, Hole\u0161ovice and \u017di\u017ekov.

It\u2019s understandable that the likelihood that they will leave the city centre is limited.\u201d Compounding the rising volume of visitors has been the growth of alcohol-fuelled tourism spurred by the Czech Republic\u2019s deserved reputation as home to some of the world\u2019s best, and cheapest, beer. Lucrative organised pub crawls and stag nights have become the bane of many locals\u2019 lives, with high noise levels and rowdy behaviour commonplace in a city centre residential area that is home to about 25,000 Praguers.

In terms of legality, it is still the dark side of the moon.</p> <p>Defence lawyers at the Guant\u00e1namo military commission hearings have asked to examine 52 witnesses. They have so far been permitted to question only two, Mitchell and Jessen.</p> <p>James Connell, representing defendant Ammar al-Baluchi, lost his patience on Thursday when prosecutors objected that he was asking Mitchell about events he had not directly witnessed.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only witness we\u2019ve got. The government has blocked all the CIA witnesses,\u201d Connell complained.</p> <p>Four days before the current pre-trial hearing, the 40th in eight years of legal skirmishes, the prosecution changed the classification rules, and amended them again on Monday on the evening before the first open session. As a result, some facts that were previously unclassified, in published books for example, were reclassified, sending defence attorneys scrambling to reframe their planned line of questioning.</p> <p>The longer the hearings have continued, the clearer it has become that the Mitchell and Jessen partnership was just a small part of the infrastructure of torture, with its own bureaucracy and personal rivalries. In his testimony, Mitchell railed repeatedly against the \u201cmiddle management\u201d who he believed was plotting against him.</p> <p>Mitchell became embroiled in a vicious turf war with a rival, the CIA chief of interrogations, for mastery of the \u201cenhanced programme\u201d. Each sought to use their links to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to get the other removed from their post. In that struggle the detainees were used as bargaining counters. The two men had them tortured for training or demonstration purposes.</p> <p>In the courtroom this week, the interrogations chief has been referred to by the code NX2. Mitchell calls him the \u201cnew sheriff\u201d, but it has been reported his real name was Charlie Wise, who had honed his craft carrying out interrogations for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua in the 1980s. He apparently died of a heart attack in 2003, just weeks after being dismissed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e19faa262ecee7f3786a4d6cdadf61464af9b38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e19faa262ecee7f3786a4d6cdadf61464af9b38/0_0_3488_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giving evidence at a military commission on Guant\u00e1namo Bay, James Mitchell gave a detailed account of the 2002 decision to interrogate suspected al-Qaida leaders using water boarding and other techniques.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giving evidence at a military commission on Guant\u00e1namo Bay, James Mitchell gave a detailed account of the 2002 decision to interrogate suspected al-Qaida leaders using water boarding and other techniques.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to declassified cables and courtroom testimony, Wise set up his own training programme, and took his students to a black site in Afghanistan, codenamed Cobalt, to practise their techniques on Ammar al-Baluchi and other prisoners. During that training, Baluchi was repeatedly slammed against a wall, suffering brain trauma as a result.</p> <p>\u201cLooks like they used your client as a training prop,\u201d Mitchell told Connell. A newly declassified paragraph in a secret CIA inspector general report quotes one of the students as saying the site was used for \u201con-the-job training\u201d. Trainees had to use each of their techniques on Baluchi and other inmates in order to earn certification.</p> <p>An unsanctioned, improvised waterboard was also set up at the Cobalt site, according to defence lawyers.

      "bodyText": "There were three men authorised by the CIA to carry out waterboarding on detainees in America\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d. Two of them were contractors who are in Guant\u00e1namo Bay this week to give evidence. The third has still not been identified 17 years after the torture was committed. In the courtroom of the military commission, the CIA officer was referred to only by three-digit code NZ7, or simply as \u201cthe Preacher\u201d \u2013 a nickname he was given because of his peculiar way of terrorising detainees. According to James Mitchell, a psychologist on contract to the CIA who helped draft and apply their \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d, the Preacher \u201cwould at random times put one hand on the forehead of a detainee, raise the other high in the air, and in a deep Southern drawl say things like, \u2018Can you feel it, son? Can you feel the spirit moving down my arm, into your body?\u2019\u201d Mitchell gave that chilling description in his memoir, Enhanced Interrogation, and on the witness stand on Thursday, he confirmed the Preacher\u2019s role at the CIA black sites. He was giving evidence at a pre-trial hearing in the case against five defendants charged for the 9/11 al-Qaida attacks, including the self-styled mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Mitchell, together with his friend and business partner, Bruce Jessen \u2013 who is due to testify next week \u2013 have been the public face of the US torture programme for five years, settling out of court in 2017 in a civil suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of three prisoners. Almost everyone else involved in the extensive programme, involving a network of black sites around the world, has remained in the shadows. In terms of legality, it is still the dark side of the moon. Defence lawyers at the Guant\u00e1namo military commission hearings have asked to examine 52 witnesses. They have so far been permitted to question only two, Mitchell and Jessen. James Connell, representing defendant Ammar al-Baluchi, lost his patience on Thursday when prosecutors objected that he was asking Mitchell about events he had not directly witnessed. \u201cHe\u2019s the only witness we\u2019ve got. The government has blocked all the CIA witnesses,\u201d Connell complained. Four days before the current pre-trial hearing, the 40th in eight years of legal skirmishes, the prosecution changed the classification rules, and amended them again on Monday on the evening before the first open session. As a result, some facts that were previously unclassified, in published books for example, were reclassified, sending defence attorneys scrambling to reframe their planned line of questioning. The longer the hearings have continued, the clearer it has become that the Mitchell and Jessen partnership was just a small part of the infrastructure of torture, with its own bureaucracy and personal rivalries. In his testimony, Mitchell railed repeatedly against the \u201cmiddle management\u201d who he believed was plotting against him. Mitchell became embroiled in a vicious turf war with a rival, the CIA chief of interrogations, for mastery of the \u201cenhanced programme\u201d. Each sought to use their links to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to get the other removed from their post. In that struggle the detainees were used as bargaining counters. The two men had them tortured for training or demonstration purposes. In the courtroom this week, the interrogations chief has been referred to by the code NX2. Mitchell calls him the \u201cnew sheriff\u201d, but it has been reported his real name was Charlie Wise, who had honed his craft carrying out interrogations for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua in the 1980s. He apparently died of a heart attack in 2003, just weeks after being dismissed. According to declassified cables and courtroom testimony, Wise set up his own training programme, and took his students to a black site in Afghanistan, codenamed Cobalt, to practise their techniques on Ammar al-Baluchi and other prisoners. During that training, Baluchi was repeatedly slammed against a wall, suffering brain trauma as a result. \u201cLooks like they used your client as a training prop,\u201d Mitchell told Connell. A newly declassified paragraph in a secret CIA inspector general report quotes one of the students as saying the site was used for \u201con-the-job training\u201d. Trainees had to use each of their techniques on Baluchi and other inmates in order to earn certification. An unsanctioned, improvised waterboard was also set up at the Cobalt site, according to defence lawyers. It does not seem to have been part of the training, but it was used on at least one detainee. The CIA was forced to close down its first main interrogation centre in Thailand in late 2002 when its existence was discovered by the New York Times. The \u201chigh value detainees\u201d were transferred by rendition flights to a new site in Poland, codenamed Blue, which was run by Wise. Mitchell visited Blue shortly before Christmas in 2002, and testified he witnessed at least two extreme techniques that had not been approved by the CIA or the justice department. In one, a piece of wooden dowel was put behind the knees of a detainee who was made to kneel and then had his back forced back \u201cuntil his shoulder blades were touching the floor\u201d. In another, the prisoner\u2019s elbows were strapped together with a strap behind his back and his hands were raised above his head. Fearing the torture would cause permanent injury, Mitchell said he tried to stop it but was told \u201cit was none of my fucking business\u201d. When the contractor declared he wanted to return to the US, Wise told him he was not allowed to leave, Mitchell claimed. Nor could Mitchell contact the outside world as all communications equipment at the site were locked up. For a week he was a prisoner of his rival, he said. Mitchell said he was finally permitted to go home because the tension inside the site began damaging morale. On his return he said he complained to the CIA leadership but to no avail. Wise stayed in his job and Mitchell found he was giving courses at headquarters including the banned techniques more than four months later. The chief of interrogation was only fired that summer. Throughout his testimony this week, Mitchell has portrayed himself as a moderate who stuck to the rules and only used extreme measures when he felt he had no choice. He tried to halt waterboarding of the first major detainee, Abu Zubaydah, in August 2002, arguing that the prisoner was fully cooperating, but his superiors in Langley ordered told him and his team in the original black site in Thailand to \u201cstay the course\u201d. In an effort to win the argument, he said he persuaded the head CIA officer in the country to witness a waterboarding for himself. \u201cI wanted the chief of station to experience what we were experiencing,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t smell pleasant. It smelled like sweat \u2013 kinda musky.\u201d He also conceded he and Jessen were beginning to feel a bit exposed. They realised they were the only ones in the interrogation room not wearing a mask, and the torture was being videoed. \u201cI wanted [the station chief] on tape,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cMy mental calculus was that Dr Jessen and I were the only ones on that tape.\u201d The station chief turned up to watching Abu Zubaydah being waterboarded, but dressed as a guard, his face covered When his superiors insisted he persevere in Thailand, he told them to send a delegation to witness the simulated drowning. \u201cBuddy \u2013 you want it,\u201d Mitchell told them. \u201cBring your rubber boots and come on down.\u201d When the senior officials flew in, on 17 August, he waterboarded Abu Zubaydah even though he was quite sure the detainee had no actionable intelligence to surrender. It was done purely as a demonstration for the agency VIPs. And he applied the technique to the maximum extent allowed, pouring water on to a cloth on the prisoner\u2019s face for 20 seconds and then a full 40 seconds. According to a CIA cable describing the event, Abu Zubaydah went into spasm. The visitors were stunned. \u201cSome of the folks were tearful,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI was tearful, but I cry at dog food commercials,\u201d Mitchell claimed.

In the years after the second world war, RAI\u2019s early programming was influenced by the Reithian values of the BBC and its educational approach. It aired travel programmes for people who could not afford to travel abroad and it proposed the BBC model of an independent public broadcaster for itself.</p> <p>However, Rai has often been at the centre of controversies over its political independence owing to its proximity to the government. Most recently, in 2018, the coalition government of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and far-right League oversaw the appointment of a Eurosceptic journalist known for anti-gay, anti-immigration, anti-vaccine and pro-Russia views as Rai\u2019s president.</p> <p>Marcello Foa remains in the role despite the fall of the government in August last year, and this week one of Rai\u2019s most popular political shows, Porta a Porta, sparked criticism after giving the League leader, Matteo Salvini, a solo slot during the half-time break in a Juventus-Roma Italian Cup football match for him to pitch to voters why they should back his party in key regional elections in Emilia Romagna on Sunday. <strong>Lorenzo Tondo</strong></p> <h2>US</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"271a9d6609cd0de933e43edc5086404691a89ad5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/271a9d6609cd0de933e43edc5086404691a89ad5/0_120_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sesame Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sesame Street has switched from PBS to HBO.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most Americans who know the BBC know it through its shows, consumed via BBC America or according to what Netflix and Amazon buy in.

      "bodyText": "France The BBC is widely admired in France and frequently cited by politicians as a model of public service broadcasting. News of its director general\u2019s early departure was reported with concern. Le Monde said Tony Hall\u2019s announcement came at an awkward time: the BBC was losing viewers to Netflix and other commercial streaming services, under attack \u201cfrom all sides\u201d for its Brexit coverage and had heard the prime minister publicly question the continued existence of its licence fee. \u201cThe corporation\u2019s central role in British life is being eroded,\u201d the paper said. \u201cIt is becoming harder to defending a licence fee paid by all. Of course, the BBC remains a giant. Some phenomenal successes still bring the nation together. But Hall\u2019s successor must prepare for a serious fight.\u201d France\u2019s public TV and radio are being reformed to create what Emmanuel Macron in his 2017 election campaign called \u201cune BBC \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\u201d \u2013 essentially, bundling all the country\u2019s public TV and radio stations into one group in search of professional synergies and financial savings. More than 80% of public broadcasting costs in France are covered by the redevance, or TV licence, which costs \u20ac138 a year, with the rest coming from advertising and some direct state funding. Only households with a TV set have to pay the redevance, but this is set to change in 2020 to reflect modern viewing habits, possibly by the introduction of a lower but universal fee. Jon Henley Italy Italians generally see the BBC as a model to be imitated, but it is a judgment based on reputation rather than on any real knowledge of British TV programmes. Italy has one of the lowest levels of English-language fluency in Europe and while some BBC programmes are visible on Italian satellite televisions, they are watched by only a small part of the population. The Italian equivalent of the BBC is the broadcaster Rai, which is owned by the finance ministry. In the years after the second world war, RAI\u2019s early programming was influenced by the Reithian values of the BBC and its educational approach. It aired travel programmes for people who could not afford to travel abroad and it proposed the BBC model of an independent public broadcaster for itself. However, Rai has often been at the centre of controversies over its political independence owing to its proximity to the government. Most recently, in 2018, the coalition government of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and far-right League oversaw the appointment of a Eurosceptic journalist known for anti-gay, anti-immigration, anti-vaccine and pro-Russia views as Rai\u2019s president. Marcello Foa remains in the role despite the fall of the government in August last year, and this week one of Rai\u2019s most popular political shows, Porta a Porta, sparked criticism after giving the League leader, Matteo Salvini, a solo slot during the half-time break in a Juventus-Roma Italian Cup football match for him to pitch to voters why they should back his party in key regional elections in Emilia Romagna on Sunday. Lorenzo Tondo US Most Americans who know the BBC know it through its shows, consumed via BBC America or according to what Netflix and Amazon buy in. Costume dramas are forever huge, The Great British Bake-Off inspires serious coverage, and devotees of Veep can quote Malcolm Tucker verbatim. But most will not be aware of rising concern in Britain over the fate of the BBC itself. The notion of a powerful state broadcaster \u2013 anguish about Fox News under Donald Trump aside \u2013 remains distinctly alien. There is a BBC equivalent in the US. Not C-Span, a nonprofit that provides barebones politics coverage, but the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio, established under Lyndon Johnson in 1967, together serving the young, the less well-off and liberals, most of them ageing, on the coasts and in college towns between. Programming \u2013 think Sesame Street or Ken Burns on Vietnam \u2013 is authoritative, rigorous and vital. PBS and NPR score highly in surveys about public trust. But they do sometimes find themselves under fire and usually it\u2019s because of money. PBS and NPR rely on donations as well as federal cash but during the 2012 election, for example, Mitt Romney said he would stop PBS\u2019s subsidy. \u201cI like PBS,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cI love Big Bird \u2026 but I\u2019m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it.\u201d Romney lost the White House race to Barack Obama, his threat to a beloved PBS character a big yellow albatross around his neck. Such threats \u2013 from Trump too \u2013 prompt reliable outcry. But funding remains inadequate and in 2015 even Sesame Street decamped, to be made by HBO. Martin Pengelly Australia Australians are well aware they adopted the public broadcasting model of the BBC to form the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, a much-loved institution that plays a vital role in the political and cultural life of the nation. ABC viewers still enjoy BBC productions such as Call the Midwife and Doctor Who, but over the years the BBC content from the UK has shifted to the commercial broadcasters due to rising costs and shrinking budgets. Formed in 1932 with the launch of a single radio service, the ABC is now a multi-platform media operation with television, radio, digital, international and emergency broadcasting functions, that latter of which has received overwhelming praise during the recent bushfire emergency. The ABC charter is set down by parliament and requires the corporation to provide informative, entertaining and educational services that reflect the breadth of the nation. What that encompasses is frequently disputed, especially by the Murdoch press. Australians have not one but two publicly funded broadcasters. A multicultural broadcaster, SBS, has only one-tenth of the ABC\u2019s budget and has been allowed to receive some revenue from limited advertising since 2005. The difference between the BBC and the ABC is in the funding model. Since 1989, the ABC has been wholly funded by a three-year budget commitment known as the triennial funding system. This cycle has provided $3.16bn. However, the ABC has been historically subjected to budget cuts, mainly from conservative governments, and it is trying to manage cuts of $84m over three years imposed by the Coalition. The ABC serves a population one-third the size of the UK and does it with a budget one-eighth that of the BBC. Amanda Meade Russia The longstanding editor-in-chief of Russia Today, Margarita Simonyan, likes to compare her channel to the BBC, suggesting that the BBC\u2019s global mission is to project British soft power, while her own channel naturally boosts the Kremlin\u2019s line.

The team described in elaborate detail a \u201ccorrupt scheme\u201d to pressure Ukraine to open an investigation into his political rivals. They used the president\u2019s words against him, in video clips that played from screens installed on the Senate floor.

They will have the same 24 hours in a three-day period to make their case before the senators have an opportunity to ask questions.</p> <p>At that point Schumer has vowed to compel votes on witnesses.

      "bodyText": "After nearly 24 hours, divided across three long days, the prosecution rested their case in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. There was passion, drama and even a display of \u201chistrionics\u201d, but little suspense. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, had revealed the ending weeks ago. Aquittal was inevitable. The measure of success for the seven impeachment managers appointed by Nancy Pelosi to prosecute the House\u2019s case against the president was therefore not whether Trump was removed from office, but whether they had managed to persuade the Republican-controlled Senate to allow new testimony before a verdict is rendered, perhaps as early as next week. \u201cSoon members of this body will face the most momentous of decisions, not as I said at the outset of guilt or innocence, but a far more foundational issue,\u201d the congressman Adam Schiff, an eloquent former federal prosecutor and lead impeachment manager, said in an impassioned closing statement. \u201cShould there be a fair trial?\u201d Of the 100 senators, who sit as judge and jury in the trial, most have already tipped their hand as to how they will vote on the question of whether Trump should be convicted for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d. The American public remains deeply divided over whether the president should be removed from office. But on the matter of witnesses, there is the edge of unpredictability. A majority of Americans support the effort and perhaps just enough \u2013 four \u2013 Republicans are open to it. In Schiff\u2019s soaring \u2013 and lengthy \u2013 finish, he seemed to speak directly to these senators, appealing to their sense of American ideals and pleading with them to pursue \u201cmoral courage\u201d. He acknowledged the political stakes for senators whose \u201cheartfelt views of right or wrong are in conflict with the popular opinion of our constituents\u201d. \u201cThose are the times that try our souls,\u201d he said. But then he continued, exaggerating his point. He referenced a CBS story, that quoted a Trump confidant who warned Republican senators that \u201ca vote against the president and your head will be on a pike\u201d. The mood changed sharply. Groans of displeasure and disbelief rumbled from the Republican side of the chamber. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine who has said she is supportive of calling additional witnesses, shook her head, visibly upset. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d she said, so outraged that she violated the rule that senators remain silent \u201con pain of imprisonment\u201d during the trial. \u201cHe was doing fine with \u2018moral courage\u2019 until he got to head on a pike,\u201d Senator Lisa Murkowski, an independent Republican voice in the Senate, told reporters as she left the Capitol. \u201cThat\u2019s where he lost me.\u201d Without their support, Democrats have little chance of cobbling together a coalition to subpoena witnesses and documents in the trial. But the hour was late and the senators left exhausted. It had been more than nine hours since the Senate chaplain, Barry Black, convened the session with a prayer that the senators maintiain the \u201cwisdom to distinguish between facts and opinions without lambasting the messenger.\u201d For three days, the impeachment managers delivered what many Democrats \u2013 and a few generous Republicans \u2013 hailed as a tour-de-force. The team described in elaborate detail a \u201ccorrupt scheme\u201d to pressure Ukraine to open an investigation into his political rivals. They used the president\u2019s words against him, in video clips that played from screens installed on the Senate floor. He sought to enrich his political fortunes at the expense of the national interest, and he was bound to do it again, they said. \u201cPresident Trump tried to cheat, he got caught and then he worked hard to cover it up,\u201d congressman Hakeem Jeffries, one of the impeachment managers, said, summarizing the charges for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, another member of the team, said that Trump\u2019s conduct \u201cputs even president Nixon to shame\u201d. Trump, he said, seeks to be \u201call powerful.\u201d \u201cHe is a dictator,\u201d Nadler declared. In his final plea, Schiff warned that the president remains an \u201cimminent threat\u201d and will continue to abuse his power unless Congress acts to remove him from office. \u201cHe is who he is,\u201d Schiff exhorted. \u201cYou cannot leave a man like that in office.\u201d Yet few Republicans were persuaded \u2013 or even listening. Instead hey did their best to signal \u2013 silently from the chamber and loudly during the brief recesses \u2013 that they were bored. \u201cWe saw that protester yell something bad about Chuck Schumer,\u201d Senator Rick Scott, a Republican from Florida, told Fox News. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about possibly doing the same thing so the sergeant-at-arms will take me out also. This is ridiculous. We\u2019ve heard the same thing three days in a row.\u201d Members darted into the antechamber despite rules requiring them to remain in their seats. Some Republicans openly played with fidget spinners \u2013 toys for children who have difficulty focusing. And Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican of Pennsylvania, doled out candy, stashed in a not-so-secret drawer in his desk. On Friday, he announced that Hershey\u2019s, his homestate chocolate manufacturer, had sent reinforcements after stock ran low. The charge of monotony is exasperating for the House managers, who have argued at great length that there is additional, relevant information just beyond their grasp that the Senate could summon with a simple majority vote. Trump delighted in their struggle, taunting the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer. Before the proceedings began on Friday, he appendaged his commentary to a tweet by conservative Wall Street Journalist columnist: \u201cSchumer had one job this week: to convince a handful of Rs to join his call for more testimony. He\u2019s done the opposite.\u201d Democrats won\u2019t know whether there is enough support until next week \u2013 after the president\u2019s team delivers its defense, which begins tomorrow. They will have the same 24 hours in a three-day period to make their case before the senators have an opportunity to ask questions. At that point Schumer has vowed to compel votes on witnesses. And even if they can assemble enough votes to call witnesses, Republicans intend to make it as painful as possible for Democrats and those in their party who defected. They\u2019ve suggested something of a \u201cwitness swap\u201d \u2013 John Bolton, the president\u2019s former national security adviser who has said he would comply with a subpoena to testify, for Joe Biden, the former vice-president over his son Hunter\u2019s involvement with Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had been under investigation. On Thursday the managers took a calculated risk by rebutting Tump\u2019s baseless assertion Joe Biden sought to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a move the president\u2019s allies said \u201copened the door\u201d to calling Biden as a witness. Democrats are largely opposed to the idea, which they see as a distraction. Yet if one gratuitous remark in an otherwise sterling speech is enough to topple the crusade for new evidence, then it was unlikely there was ever a chance it could be won in the first place. But Schiff continued, undeterred. \u201cThe American people do not agree on much, but they will not forgive being deprived of the truth.\u201d Schiff said in closing. \u201cI ask you, I implore you. Give America a fair trial. Give America a fair trial. She\u2019s worth it.\u201d",

But if we\u2019re to decide here that a president of the United States can simply say, under Article 2 I can do whatever I want and I don\u2019t have to treat a branch of this government like it exists...that will be an unending injury to this country.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e2b8c208f08a6950eb48a38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-25T00:35:32.217Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Senator<strong> Tim Kaine</strong> gets carded outside the impeachment trial. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/1220861037962055682\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Officer: \u201cmay I see your ID?\u201d<br>Kaine: \u201cI\u2019m one of the senators\u201d</p>\u2014 Burgess Everett (@burgessev) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/1220861037962055682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 25, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e2b8a808f08a6950eb48a32\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-25T00:27:22.600Z\">12.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While we were watching the impeachment trial, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was accepting that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI have felt very strongly that while Russia\u2019s actions had no impact at all on the outcome of the election, let me be totally clear in saying, and I\u2019ve said this many times, I accept our intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election took place,\u201d Trump said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere was no collusion,\u201d he added. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1220840205067919360\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">President <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realDonaldTrump</a> has unequivocally denounced foreign interference in our elections and accepted the conclusions of the intelligence community. <a href=\"https://t.co/lhdHNbvrLv\">pic.twitter.com/lhdHNbvrLv</a></p>\u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1220840205067919360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 24, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1220841091752255489\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">President <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realDonaldTrump</a>: \u201cAs I have made clear, the United States will not tolerate any form of foreign meddling in our elections.\u201d</p>\u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1220841091752255489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 24, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1220842167809212417\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">President <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realDonaldTrump</a>: \u201cMy administration has taken a very firm stance.

      "bodyText": "Live coverage of Trump\u2019s impeachment trial continues on Saturday\u2019s blog: Day 4 of the impeachment trial, and Democrats wrapped up their presentation with impeachment manager Adam Schiff calling on Republicans to exercise \u201cmoral courage\u201d. \u201cGive America a fair trial,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s worth it.\u201d Schiff rattled some Republicans by alluding to a CBS News report that alleged Republican senators were warned: \u201cVote against the president, and your head will be on a pike.\u201d \u201cMethinks doth thou protest too much,\u201d Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown said, of the Republican reaction to Schiff\u2019s remarks. Everyone is preparing for the president\u2019s legal team to take the floor of the impeachment trial on Saturday morning, with Schiff anticipating some of their tactics. Jay Sekulow, attorney for Donald Trump, told reporters that the impeachment managers \u201cdecided to not just open the door, but kick the door open on the Burisma-Biden matter.\u201d Elsewhere, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly reacted furiously when hed learned that Ukraine was of interest to the American public. He reportedly swore at NPR host Mary Louise Kelly and forced her to point out Ukraine on a map for him. Thanks for tuning in, everyone. As we head into Day 5 of the impeachment trial, starting at 10am EST, please follow us for updates - and live long and prosper. Because everybody needs a hug after this week. Most of the Republican ire focused in on the reference to the \u201chead on a pike\u201d threat. But others were also not that impressed with impeachment manager Adam Schiff for other reasons: With the eyes on Washington on the impeachment trial, Tulsi Gabbard goes on Fox. ABC News has posted audio from the recording in which Donald Trump purportedly talks about firing then-US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch a year before she was recalled from Kyiv. \u201cGet rid of her!\u201d said a voice that appears to be Trump\u2019s voice. \u201cGet her out tomorrow. I don\u2019t care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. OK? Do it.\u201d Yovanovitch was recalled from Kyiv over what she called \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives\u201d. As we prepare to head into Day 5 of the impeachment trial tomorrow morning, the brilliant Matthew Cantor has a rundown of all the ways the senators are getting through the proceedings: If you want the full account of the impeachment trial today, my colleague Tom McCarthy has the details: In non-impeachment news, if you were wondering what Marianne Williamson was up to these days since dropping out of the presidential race, well, here she is with Andrew Yang: Here\u2019s some more reaction to Schiff\u2019s allusion to the alleged \u201chead on a pike\u201d comment: CBS News reported last night that Republican senators were very threateningly warned: \u201cVote against the president, and your head will be on a pike.\u201d Impeachment manager Adam Schiff alluded to this in his closing remarks. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but when I read that I was struck by the irony,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not true. But I was struck by the irony of the idea that when we\u2019re talking about a president who would make himself a monarch, that whoever it was that said that would use a penalty that was posed by a monarch.\u201d Outside Senate chambers, the Republican Senator James Lankford told reporters that the president never told Republican senators that their heads would be on a pike if they voted against him (note: CBS News never outright states if the warning came from the president himself). \u201cNone of us have been told that by the president,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cI was visibly upset by it, the whole room was visibly upset by it.\u201d The Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown thought the reaction from the Republican senators spoke of something else. \u201cThe fact when Adam Schiff said that about the head on a pike, that was the only time I heard a loud audible reaction from the Republican side,\u201d Brown told reporters. \u201cMethinks thou doth protest too much.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re afraid to do the right thing here,\u201d Brown said. It appears to be the Tweeting Hour for Donald Trump, who continued on his retweet tirade, who has reposted six more tweets along with two more original tweets hyping up Sean Hannity. \u201cGive America a fair trial,\u201d impeachment manager Adam Schiff said, wrapping up the Democrats\u2019 opening statements. \u201cShe\u2019s worth it.\u201d And just like that, Senate has adjourned for the night. The impeachment trial continues tomorrow morning. As impeachment manager Adam Schiff continues to talk, Donald Trump has gone on a retweeting frenzy. He reposted a tweet of his from earlier today, as well as one from the Senate Republicans account, and one each from Republican senators John Barrasso and Marsha Blackburn. After hours of impeachment trial this week: Politico is reporting that \u201ca small minority\u201d of Republican senators may \u201cend up mildly criticizing president\u2019s behavior in requesting investigations into Joe Biden and delaying military aid to Ukraine\u201d. \u201cBut any expressions of disapproval are muted, or explained away as an honest mistake by a frustrated president who just wanted to fight corruption in Ukraine.\u201d \u201cI do things every week that are inappropriate. So no, I\u2019m not going to go down that road,\u201d Senator Roger Wicker told Politico. \u201cThis is a constitutional remedy that was designed for the most extreme of cases and we\u2019re just not anywhere in that [ball] park.\u201d While we were all busy at the impeachment trial, the White House was tweeting about Donald Trump accepting that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. But the clip tweeted out on the official White House account was from July 2018. Schiff is now going point by point over what he anticipates the White House will say tomorrow. Schiff warned that the legal team will attack the impeachment managers, \u201cthose managers are just awful, they\u2019re terrible people, especially that Schiff guy, he\u2019s the worst, he\u2019s the worst.\u201d He warned that they will try to distract with Biden and Burisma, corruption and burden-sharing, and question the motives of the whistleblower. \u201cDo you want to know why the president is mad at the whistleblower?\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBecause but for the whistleblower, he wouldn\u2019t have been caught. And that is an unforgivable sin.\u201d Impeachment manager Adam Schiff read out each allegation laid out against President Trump in the articles of impeachment, ending each statement with, \u201cThat has been proved\u201d. \u201cThe facts have been proved,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThose facts are not contested. We have met our burden.\u201d This portion of the impeachment trial is winding down, with Schiff taking the floor to lay out the significance of this particular trial. As noted many, many times by the Democrats, this is the first president in history to defy an impeachment inquiry in the way Trump has, by ordering various members of his administration to not comply with congressional subpoenas. Article 1 of the articles of impeachment focuses on abuse of power, and Article 2 focuses on obstruction of Congress. Schiff said there will be no more Article 1 with no Article 2 this time around - that if the Senate does not hold the president accountable for obstruction of Congress, Congress will never have the power of impeachment again. \u201cAs I said before, our relationship with Ukraine will survive,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cGod willing, our relationship with Ukraine will survive and Ukraine will prosper and we will get beyond this ugly chapter in our history. But if we\u2019re to decide here that a president of the United States can simply say, under Article 2 I can do whatever I want and I don\u2019t have to treat a branch of this government like it exists...that will be an unending injury to this country.\u201d Senator Tim Kaine gets carded outside the impeachment trial. While we were watching the impeachment trial, Donald Trump was accepting that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. \u201cI have felt very strongly that while Russia\u2019s actions had no impact at all on the outcome of the election, let me be totally clear in saying, and I\u2019ve said this many times, I accept our intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election took place,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere was no collusion,\u201d he added. Jay Sekulow, attorney for President Trump, addressed the media during the dinner recess: \u201cLook, for whatever reason, the house managers decided to not just open the door, but kick the door open on the Burisma-Biden matter,\u201d he said, hinting at what his focus will be during the impeachment trial. In addressing the situation with former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump was caught on recording calling to be removed, Sekulow said, \u201cAn ambassador serves at the pleasure of the president. You know who said that? The ambassador herself.\u201d Just before the dinner recess, impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries spoke about the president\u2019s procedural complaints. \u201cThe constitution provides the House with the sole power of impeachment and the sole authority to determine the rules of its proceedings,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the constitution\u2019s priority on this point, the president\u2019s argument that he can engage in blanket obstruction is just dead wrong.\u201d Back to the impeachment trial. Impeachment manager Zoe Lofgren is on the floor, talking about precedents set by the impeachment process of Richard Nixon as well as presidents\u2019 general obligation to comply with impeachment inquiries. \u201cPresidents are still free to raise privacy, national security or other concerns in the course of an impeachment inquiry,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when a president abuses his office, abuses his power, to completely defy house investigators\u2019 impeachment inquiry, when he does that without lawful cause or excuse, he attacks the constitution itself. When he does that, he confirms that he sees himself as above the law.\u201d NPR has posted the transcript to the interview that the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is reportedly furious about: I just want to give you another opportunity to answer this, because as you know, people who work for you in your department, people who have resigned from this department under your leadership, saying you should stand up for the diplomats who work here. [crosstalk] I don\u2019t know who these unnamed sources are you\u2019re referring to. I can tell you this, when I talked to my team here -- These are not unnamed sources. [crosstalk] This is your senior adviser Michael McKinley, a career foreign service officer with four decades experience, who testified under oath that he resigned in part due to the failure of the state department to offer support to foreign service employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry on Ukraine. I\u2019m not going to comment on things that Mr McKinley may have said. I\u2019ll say only this. I have defended every state department official. We\u2019ve built a great team. The team that works here is doing amazing work around the world. Sir, respectfully [crosstalk] where have you defended Marie Yovanovitch? I\u2019ve defended every single person on this team. I\u2019ve done what\u2019s right for every single person on this team. [crosstalk] Can you point me toward your remarks where you have defended Marie Yovanovitch? I\u2019ve said all I\u2019m going to say today. Thank you. Thanks for the repeated opportunity to do so. I appreciate that. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, was reportedly furious about host Mary Louise Kelly daring to ask him about Ukraine on All Things Considered. The impeachment manager Jerry Nadler takes the floor to talk about the administration not complying with congressional subpoenas. \u201cIf the president chooses to ignore our subpoena, our power as a branch of government, our ability to do our jobs, our ability to keep an administration in check, our ability to make sure the American people are represented by a congress and not just a president, are diminished,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must act,\u201d he continued. \u201cIs there a consequence for a president that defies our subpoenas absolutely, who says to all branches of the administration, \u2018Do not obey a congressional subpoena, categorically\u2019?\u201d So there\u2019s much to-do over the new logo for the US space force, which for better or for worse, looks an awful lot like the Star Trek Starfleet Command logo. But it appears the United States has been all about that \u201clive long and prosper\u201d life for a while now. Hello all, Vivian Ho on the west coast, taking you through all the US politics developments this evening, with the focus on the impeachment trial. I\u2019m taking the baton from my colleagues Joan E Greve and Maanvi Singh, who have been keeping everyone up to date on the drama in the impeachment trial so far this week. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Vivian Ho, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: House impeachment managers wrapped up their opening arguments about the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, and are now making their case for the second article, obstruction of Congress. Today is the Democrats\u2019 final day to present opening arguments. Concluding the managers\u2019 opening arguments about the first article, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff said Trump represented an \u201cimminent threat to the integrity of our democracy.\u201d ABC News published a report about a 2018 recording appearing to show Trump calling for the removal of then-US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch, whose ouster has become a key issue in the impeachment trial. The Pentagon confirmed 34 US soldiers suffered concussions or traumatic brain injuries from the Iranian missile strike in Iraq, contradicting Trump\u2019s earlier statements that there were no casualties. Trump unveiled the new logo for the US Space Force, which prompted instant comparisons to the \u201cStar Trek\u201d logo. Vivian will have more updates and analysis as the impeachment trial continues, so stay tuned. Concluding her presentation about Trump\u2019s alleged obstruction of Congress, impeachment manager Sylvia Garcia said Trump\u2019s actions were \u201cbeyond comparison.\u201d \u201cThis president should be removed,\u201d Garcia said. She then ceded the floor to fellow impeachment manager Zoe Lofgren, who has jumped into a presentation about Trump\u2019s efforts to keep administration officials from cooperating with the House impeachment inquiry. Almost immediately after Trump unveiled the new logo for the US Space Force, Twitter pointed out its many similarities to the logo for a certain fictional space fleet. George Takei, one of the stars of \u201cStar Trek,\u201d quickly jumped into the conversation to suggest the Trump administration pay the cast \u201croyalties.\u201d As impeachment managers accuse his of orchestrating a cover-up to conceal his impeachable actions toward Ukraine, Trump is busy unveiling the new logo for the US Space Force. The massive defense spending bill Trump signed last month created the Space Force, which he has been pushing for since early 2018. Trump\u2019s signature made the Space Force the sixth branch of the US military, the first new service since the creation of the Air Force in 1947. Impeachment manager Sylvia Garcia accused Trump of committing obstruction of Congress in a \u201chistoric fashion.\u201d \u201cIn other words, he orchestrated a cover-up, and he did it in plain sight,\u201d Garcia said. The Texas Democrat pointed to three key points to demonstrate Trump\u2019s obstruction: his refusal to turn over the initial whistleblower complaint, his instructions to administration officials not to cooperate with the House inquiry and his attacks on key impeachment witnesses. Presenting impeachment managers\u2019 arguments about Trump\u2019s alleged obstruction of Congress, Val Demings said, \u201cWe must stop this president.\u201d Demings outlined the managers\u2019 planned arguments, saying they would show Trump \u201ctook extraodinary measures\u201d to obstruct Congress and committed impeachable offenses that merit his removal from office. Demings has now stepped off the floor, and fellow manager Sylvia Garcia has taken the podium. The Senate trial has resumed, and impeachment managers are now moving on to the second article of impeachment, obstruction Congress. Impeachment manager Val Demings kicked off her team\u2019s opening arguments on the second article of impeachment, calling Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry \u201ccategorical, indiscriminate and historically unprecedented.\u201d \u201cThis was a declaration of total defiance of the House\u2019s authority to investigate credible allegations of the president\u2019s misconduct and a wholesale rejection of the Congress\u2019 ability to hold the president accountable,\u201d Demings said. Jay Sekulow, one of the president\u2019s lawyers, confirmed that they intend to present opening arguments for three hours tomorrow morning. Trump\u2019s legal team will also have Monday and Tuesday to present their opening arguments. The president said in a tweet today that Saturday was considered \u201cDeath Valley\u201d for TV ratings, which he reportedly tracks very closely. The Senate trial is still in a brief recess, but Trump ally Lindsey Graham used the break to tell reporters that the Senate judicicary committee, which he leads, might investigate Joe Biden and his son\u2019s connections to Ukraine. The South Carolina Republican complained about no other body probing the baseless corruption claims peddled by the president and his allies. \u201cIf I have to, I will do it,\u201d Graham told reporters. Interestingly, Graham said earlier today that he would not support a subpoena of Hunter Biden if the Senate decided to call new witnesses for the trial. The impeachment managers spent an additional two and a half hours today presenting opening arguments on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. The managers spent nine hours yesterday detailing Trump\u2019s alleged abuse of power and have now spent more than 11 collective hours focusing on the first article of impeachment. When the Senate trial resumes, the managers are expected to begin making their opening arguments about the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress. Closing the impeachment managers\u2019 opening arguments about the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, Adam Schiff warned that Trump \u201cremains a threat to national security and the constitution.\u201d The California congressman described the president as an \u201cimminent threat to the integrity of our democracy\u201d and predicted he would abuse his power again. \u201cHe is who he is,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThat will not change and nor will the danger associated with him.\u201d Schiff then yielded back to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who called for a 15-minute recess. Moments ago, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff appealed to the senators acting as jurors in the impeachment trial by asking them to imagine if Trump had asked for them to be investigated by a foreign power. \u201cDo you think for a moment that any of you, no matter what your relationship is with this president, no matter how close you are to this president, do you think for a moment that if he felt it was in his interest he wouldn\u2019t ask you to be investigated?\u201d Schiff asked. Delivering a fiery denunciation of the sitting president, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff warned that Trump\u2019s abuse of power, the first article of impeachment, is \u201ccontinuing.\u201d \u201c[Trump] is still trying to cheat in the next election,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s going to stop now? It\u2019s not going to stop unless the Congress does something about it.\u201d The California congressman again warned that Trump posed a threat to American democracy. \u201cYou cannot leave a man like that in office when you think he violated the constitution,\u201d Schiff said. Lead impeachment manger Adam Schiff just played a clip from Trump\u2019s 2018 press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In that Helsinki press conference, Trump cast doubt upon the US intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that the Kremlin had interfered in the 2016 election and instead peddled a baseless claim about a missing DNC \u201cserver.\u201d Schiff described the moment as \u201cbreathtaking\u201d and \u201cthe most incredible propaganda coup\u201d for Russian intelligence. \u201cWhatever profile Russia did of our president, boy did they have it spot on,\u201d Schiff said. That assessment was echoed by a New Yorker staff writer who co-authored a book about Putin\u2019s rise to power: Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign said in a memo Friday that the candidate is preparing for an extended fight for the Democratic presidential nomination, going through the early primary contests and even beyond. \u201cWe expect this to be a long nomination fight and have built our campaign to sustain well past Super Tuesday and stay resilient no matter what breathless media narratives come when voting begins,\u201d campaign manager Roger Lau writes in the memo sent to supporters. The memo, released to the general public on Friday, comes a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses. That contest is valued as an early springboard for any presidential candidate. The memo suggests that the Warren campaign is ready to stay in the race even if it doesn\u2019t place well in Iowa or the subsequent primaries in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Recent polling has shown Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice-president Joe Biden gaining ground in Iowa and New Hampshire. Lau said that the campaign has grown to 1,000 across 31 states and Washington D.C. Oftentimes campaigns move staff out of early primary states after those contests are decided. Lau said that would not happen in Iowa. \u201cThis means that as we build our campaign to win delegates in every state and territory to secure the Democratic nomination, we\u2019re doing it with an eye towards sustaining it through the general election,\u201d Lau continued. \u201cFor instance, after the very first contest, we will keep staff on the ground and offices open in Iowa. For states that will be part of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s path to victory in the Electoral College, it\u2019s especially critical that we don\u2019t lose momentum or stall the infrastructure after the primary has passed when we have a chance to keep building for the even bigger contest in November.\u201d He also took a subtle dig at former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and billionaire Tom Steyer, two of Warren\u2019s rivals who have poured their personal fortunes into the race. \u201cWe knew that this primary process was never going to be easy. We also know that you can\u2019t just stand up an organization overnight or buy your way to the nomination,\u201d Lau added. \u201cWhile billionaires may be able to buy their way into the conversation, it will be a broad, grassroots effort and organization that delivers the Democratic nomination.\u201d Speaking on the Senate floor, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff reflected upon the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, which resulted in the ouster of then-president Viktor Yanukovych. Schiff noted the uprising was also known as the \u201cRevolution of Dignity.\u201d \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what we need here at home,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cA revolution of dignity. A revolution of civility.\u201d Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff warned that the Trump administration\u2019s freeze on Ukrainian military assistance jeaopardized the crucial alliance between Washington and Kyiv. \u201cColleagues, this is how alliances wither and die,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThis is how Russia wins.\u201d Schiff noted that the Trump administration backed Ukrainian military assistance in 2017 and 2018, but he said the White House had abandoned that support last year because officials were prioritizing the president\u2019s electoral prospects. \u201cIf our allies cannot trust us to stand behind them in a time of need, we will not have a single ally left,\u201d Schiff warned. To underscore the significance of the US-Ukrainian alliance, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff quoted a Republican lawmaker who also appreciated the importance of Ukraine: the late senator John McCain. \u201cWe are all Ukrainians,\u201d McCain said in 2014 in response to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. \u201cThis is a chess match reminiscent of the Cold War and we need to realize that and act accordingly.\u201d Concluding his team\u2019s presentation about the abuse of power article of impeachment, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff offered an explanation about the importance of the US-Ukrainian alliance. The House intelligence committee chairman said Ukraine was a key ally in \u201cfighting our fight against authoritarianism.\u201d \u201cAt least that used to be our fight,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAnd God help us if it\u2019s not our fight still.\u201d Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff just said he would now present the final argument on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. Once Schiff concludes, the managers will move on to the second article, obstruction of Congress. Schiff said Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine had \u201charmed our national security.\u201d \u201cThat is without a doubt,\u201d Schiff added. As the impeachment trial continues, Trump\u2019s approval rating has seen a slight increase, according to a new poll. The Washington Post/ABC News poll found that the president\u2019s approval rating currently sits at 44%, up 6 points since late October. Meanwhile, his disapproval rating has hit a new low of 51%, down 7 points since late October. But two-thirds of Americans think the Senate should call new witnesses to testify in the impeachment trial, while the public remains evenly divided on whether Trump should be removed from office. Impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries warned that Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine had put the country in jeopardy. \u201cPresident Trump tried to cheat,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cHe got caught. And then he worked hard to cover it up.\u201d The New York Democat also warned of a \u201ctoxic mess\u201d emanating from the White House. \u201cI humbly suggest it is our collective job on behalf of the people to try and clean it up,\u201d Jeffries said. As the impeachment trial continues to unfold in Washington, Politico reported that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer and a key figure in the Ukraine controversy, was seen at JFK Airport in New York. The former New York mayor was reportedly complaining about people being unable to find his podcast and offering a flattering quote about Trump. During an erratic interview on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d this morning, Giuliani claimed he would offer evidence against Joe Biden on his podcast this afternoon. Shortly before the Senate trial resumed, Lindsey Graham explained his absence from the chamber yesterday, as impeachment manager Jerry Nadler played a 1999 clip of Graham. In the clip taken from Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, Graham argued a president does not necessarily have to commit a crime to warrant impeachment, a stance that contradicts his current defenses of Trump. Nadler played the clip yesterday as part of the impeachment managers\u2019 opening arguments, but reporters noted Graham was not in his seat to see it. The South Carolina Republican explained today that he was in the bathroom at the time because he has been \u201csick as a dog\u201d but expressed regret about not being able to see the clip of himself. Mike Pence defended Trump after a report emerged that a 2018 recording showed the president pushing for the removal of then-US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch. \u201cI have not heard the tape and would not be prepared to comment on it,\u201d Pence told reporters in Italy, according to a pool report. \u201cAll of the ambassadors for the United States of America serve at the pleasure of the president of the United States.\u201d The audio, Pence added, \u201cwill only confirm what people already know: is that the President had concerns, and in his authority this president made a decision.\u201c Trump claimed in November that didn\u2019t \u201cknow much\u201d about Yovanovitch when he signed off on recalling her from Kyiv, but this recording clearly contradicts that. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell kicked off today\u2019s proceedings by confirming that the trial would resume tomorrow at 10 a.m. ET, earlier than recent days, and run for \u201cseveral hours.\u201d Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts said the impeachment managers have nearly eight hours left to finish presenting their opening arguments. Impeachment manager Jason Crow has now taken the floor to wrap up his team\u2019s presentation about the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, before the Democrats move on to the second article, obstruction of Congress. Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts has assumed his post in the Senate chamber, and the impeachment trial will now resume. Today is the final day for the House impeachment managers to present their opening arguments for why Trump should be removed from office. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill just before the impeachment trial resumed, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff warned that Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the investigation could set a dangerous precedent. Trump just finished speaking at the March for Life on the National Mall, becoming the first sitting president to address the annual anti-abortion event. \u201cIt is my profound honor to be the first president in history to attend the March for Life,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cToday, millions of extraordinary women across America are using the power of their votes to fight for the first right in the Declaration of Independence \u2013 the right to life.\u201d Trump\u2019s unprecedented appearance at the event is his latest effort to lock down evangelical support heading into his reelection race. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: ABC News has reviewed a 2018 recording of Trump appearing to call for the removal of then-US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch. The president has repeatedly denied pushing for the longtime diplomat\u2019s ouster. Trump has unleashed a stream of Twitter attacks against Democrats as the impeachment managers prepare for their final day of opening arguments. The Pentagon has confirmed that 34 US troops suffered concussions or traumatic brain injuries from the Iranian missile strike in Iraq, contradicting Trump\u2019s claims that there were no casualties. Trump also dismissed the soldiers\u2019 concussionas as \u201cheadaches.\u201d The blog will have more updates and analysis as the impeachment trial resumes in about 30 minutes, so stay tuned. The Pentagon has confirmed that 34 US soldiers were diagnosed with concussions or traumatic brain injuries following the Iranian missile attack in Iraq. Administration officials, including Trump, initially claimed there were no casualties from the strike, which followed the US drone attack that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. When asked about the soldiers\u2019 injuries on Wednesday, Trump dismissed the concussions as \u201cheadaches,\u201d sparking intense criticism. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Trump told reporters in Davos. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what Iran has done with their roadside bombs to our troops. ... I\u2019ve seen people that were horribly, horribly injured in that area, in that war.\u201d A lawyer for Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani who reportedly appears on the recording that includes Trump calling for the removal of then-US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, confirmed the accuracy of ABC News\u2019 report. Federal prosecutors in New York\u2019s Southern District reportedly have a copy of the 2018 recording, which appears to include Trump calling for the removal of then-US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch, in their custody. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, former associates of Rudy Giuliani who have been implicated in the Ukraine controversy, are facing campaign-finance charges in the Southern District of New York. Parnas has been cooperating with House investigators who led the impeachment inquiry, while Fruman has not. The recording reviewed by ABC News, which appears to include Trump calling for the removal of then-US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch, was reportedly made by Igor Fruman. Fruman is a former associate of Rudy Giuliani who has been indicted on campaign-finance charges, and another one of his associates, Lev Parnas, has turned over documents related to Trump\u2019s impeachment to House Democrats. ABC News reports: During the conversation, several of the participants can be heard laughing with the President. At another point, the recording appears to capture Trump praising his new choice of Secretary of State, saying emphatically: \u2018Pompeo is the best.\u2019 But the most striking moment comes when Parnes and the President discuss the dismissal of his ambassador to Ukraine. Parnas appears to say: \u2018The biggest problem there, I think where we need to start is we gotta get rid of the ambassador. She\u2019s still left over from the Clinton administration,\u2019 Parnas can be heard telling Trump. \u2018She\u2019s basically walking around telling everybody \u2018Wait, he\u2019s gonna get impeached, just wait,\u2019 he said. (Yovanovitch actually had served in the State Department since the Reagan Administration.) ABC News has reviewed a recording of Trump calling for the removal of then-US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, a year before she was recalled from Kyiv over what she called \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d The president appears to have been recorded at a small 2018 gathering that included Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two former associates of Rudy Giuliani who have been indicted on campaign-finance charges and implicated in the Ukraine controversy. ABC News reports: The recording appears to contradict statements by President Trump and support the narrative that has been offered by Parnas during broadcast interviews in recent days. Sources familiar with the recording said the recording was made during an intimate April 30, 2018 dinner at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. Trump has said repeatedly he does not know Parnas, a Soviet-born America who has emerged as a wild card in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, especially in the days since Trump was impeached. \u2018Get rid of her!\u2019 is what the voice that appears to be President Trump\u2019s is heard saying. \u2018Get her out tomorrow. I don\u2019t care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it.\u2019 Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer once again praised the performance of the House impeachment managers as the Democratic team prepares for its final day of opening arguments. \u201cThe House managers have already set a very high bar for the president\u2019s counsel to meet,\u201d Schumer said. Trump\u2019s lawyers will have up to 24 hours spread over three days, starting tomorrow, to present their opening arguments in the president\u2019s defense. \u201cThe president\u2019s counsel have their work cut out for them,\u201d Schumer said. House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer have announced that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar will deliver the Democratic response to the Trump\u2019s State of the Union. The president will deliver the annual address on Feb. 4, a day after the Iowa caucuses kick off the Democratic presidential primary. Whitmer and Escobar were both elected to their current posts in 2018, when a wave of young, Democratic women were swept into office. The selection of the two women reflects Democratic hopes of keeping that enthusiasm alive with the 2020 election. It has become tradition for the party who does not control the White House to deliver a response to the State of the Union, but past responses have met with mixed success. Republican senator Marco Rubio became an instant GIF when he took a water break in the middle of his 2013 response, but former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams was widely praised for her response last year. Trump continues to lash out against Democrats on his favorite form of social media, claiming that the impeachment trial is political retribution for his reshaping of the federal judiciary. At the risk of stating the obvious, Trump has been nominating federal judges at a record clip since he assumed office, largely thanks to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s blocking of Barack Obama\u2019s nominations during the final years of his presidency. But many Democrats only came around to supporting impeachment after a whistleblower raised national-security concerns about Trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president. So the suggestion that the impeachment trial is only occurring because of political animus toward Trump seems rather baseless. Don McGahn, Trump\u2019s former White House counsel, joked about the ongoing impeachment trial during an event at Stockton University yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s timely that you\u2019re here. Couldn\u2019t come at a better time,\u201d said William Hughes, who was posing questions to his friend McGahn. \u201cYou have some on one side saying actions were necessary \u2014 almost required \u2014 and on the other side saying actions aren\u2019t justified \u2014 it was rash and an institution is in jeopardy. I ask you about ... Harry and Meghan?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a tough one,\u201d McGahn replied. \u201cNot as tough as where I thought you were going. I heard she called the queen and said she thought it was a perfect call.\u201d Trump has repeatedly referred to his July call with the Ukrainian president, the source of the whistleblower complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry, as \u201cperfect.\u201d In the call, the US president asked Volodymyr Zelenskiy for \u201ca favor\u201d and went on to discuss possible investigations of Joe Biden and the 2016 election. In some other non-impeachment news, Trump will address the March for Life on the National Mall today, becoming the first sitting president to speak at the annual anti-abortion event. The AP reports: It\u2019s Trump\u2019s latest nod to the white evangelical voters who have proven to be among his most loyal backers. And it makes clear that, as he tries to stitch together a winning coalition for reelection, Trump is counting on the support of his base of conservative activists to help bring him across the finish line. ... It also shows how much times have changed. Past presidents who opposed abortion, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, steered clear of personally attending the march to avoid being too closely associated with demonstrators eager to outlaw the procedure. They sent remarks for others to deliver, spoke via telephone hookup or invited organizers to visit the White House. Trump has taken steps to lock down his evangelical support in recent weeks, after a prominent evangelical magazine published an editorial calling for the president\u2019s removal from office. As the impeachment trial continues, the Iowa caucuses get closer, with just 10 days remaining until voting begins in the Democratic presidential primary. Joe Biden has released a new ad focused on polling that shows he has the largest current advantage over Trump in a hypothetical general election. \u201cThis is no time to take a risk. We need our strongest candidate,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says. \u201cSo let\u2019s nominate the Democrat Trump fears the most. Vote Biden. Beat Trump.\u201d The ad comes as Bernie Sanders has seen his national polling numbers steadily climb, even taking a solo lead in CNN\u2019s polling for the first time since the start of the race. Many Democratic voters are prioritizing a candidate\u2019s perceived ability to defeat Trump as they make their final primary choices, and Biden is clearly seeking to capitalize on Democrats\u2019 fears of the current president. The House impeachment managers will begin their final day of opening arguments at 1pm ET. The managers\u2019 final conclusion today will almost certainly be the same one they drew yesterday: that Trump represents a danger to the country and should be removed from office. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t trust this president to do what\u2019s right for this country,\u201d lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff said at the end of yesterday\u2019s arguments. \u201cYou can only trust this president to do what\u2019s right for Donald Trump.\u201d The House impeachment managers will have to wrap up their opening arguments today, and then Trump\u2019s lawyers will be given up to 24 hours, spread over to three days, to begin their defense of the president. Because the Senate remains in session on Saturdays for impeachment trials, the president\u2019s team will start presenting tomorrow, but there is widespread speculation that Trump\u2019s lawyers will save most of their arguments for Monday and (if necessary) Tuesday. Good morning, live blog readers! House impeachment managers will finish presenting their opening arguments today, capping three full days of senators hearing evidence that Donald Trump committed impeachable offenses and should be removed from office. Yesterday\u2019s arguments focused on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. The managers will spend today laying out their case for the second article, obstruction of Congress. Although today\u2019s proceedings won\u2019t begin until 1pm ET, the president is already tweeting about the trial, attacking Democrats for allegedly spreading \u201clies, fraud &amp; deception\u201d. In reality, of course, the impeachment team led by Adam Schiff have been mostly replaying clips from the House hearings and using Trump\u2019s own words about Ukraine to make the argument for his removal from office. That presentation of evidence will continue in a few hours. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on today: Trump will speak at the 47th annual March for Life at 12.15pm ET and later deliver a speech to US mayors about \u201cTransforming America\u2019s Communities.\u201d Mike Pence is in Rome, where he will meet the Italian prime minister at 11.15am ET. Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg are campaigning in New Hampshire today. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

Mary Louise Kelly, a respected broadcaster on National Public Radio (NPR), sat down for a pre-arranged interview with the secretary of state on Friday, whose wrath was apparently triggered by a string of questions about Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. Kelly asked Pompeo whether he owed Yovanovitch an apology for not defending her in the face of a smear campaign orchestrated by Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates. Kelly said an aide to Pompeo then abruptly ended the interview, before Pompeo summoned her to his private living room at the state department and began berating her, asking her :\u201cdo you think Americans care about Ukraine?\u201d \u201cHe used the F-word in that sentence and many others,\u201d Kelly said, describing a rant in the room where the notoriously thin-skinned former Republican congressman had called her. Pompeo \u201cshouted at me for about the same amount of time as the interview\u201d Kelly recalled. \u201cHe was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine.\u201d Pompeo is due to travel to Ukraine next week. In what appeared to be a bizarre attempt to browbeat her, he asked the host of the NPR programme All Things Considered if she could find Ukraine on a map, and when she said she could (she was a foreign correspondent and has covered intelligence and national security) he called for aides to bring a map of the world with no country or place names on it. Kelly pointed to Ukraine, Pompeo put the map away and said: \u201cPeople will hear about this\u201d. That is what happened. Kelly went on NPR after her interview aired, and gave her account of the encounter. Yovanovitch was removed in May as the Trump camp was trying to put pressure on the Ukraine government to produce compromising material on Joe Biden and his son \u2013 the issue at the heart of the impeachment trial underway in the Senate. Kelly\u2019s questions were particularly topical as a new recording surfaced on Friday in which Giuliani\u2019s associates denigrated Yovanovitch and a voice that appears to the president\u2019s can be heard saying: \u201cTake her out\u201d. Pompeo told Kelly he had agreed to the interview to talk about Iran. But Kelly pointed out that she had confirmed with his staff that she would ask about both Iran and Ukraine. \u201cI just don\u2019t have anything else to say about that this morning,\u201d Pompeo said. According to Kelly, he leaned towards her and glared as the interview was wound up. Most of the interviews Pompeo gives are to conservative or evangelical Christian media or outlets from his home state of Kansas, where the tone of questioning tends towards the reverential and supportive. He has a history of attacking his interviewer when faced with challenging questions, often dismissing those questions as absurd. In June 2018, when asked whether the statement about denuclearisation signed by Trump and Kim Jong-un at a summit in Singapore would be verified by weapons inspectors, Pompeo became angry telling a reporter: \u201cI find that question insulting and ridiculous and, frankly, ludicrous.\u201d In the face of further questioning he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not productive to do that, to say silly things.

The White House, Democrats said, tried to hide records of a call Trump had with the Ukrainian president and tried to stop a whistleblower complaint reaching Congress, before Trump demanded federal agencies and employees stonewall the impeachment inquiry. \u201cHe tried to cheat, he got caught and then he worked hard to cover it up,\u201d said the New Yorker Hakeem Jeffries, one of the House \u201cmanagers\u201d prosecuting the case. In the fourth full day of Trump\u2019s Senate impeachment trial, Democrats completed their presentation of evidence in support of the first article of impeachment, charging Trump with abuse of power, and moved to the second and final article, charging Trump with obstruction of Congress. In October, the White House issued a letter ordering federal agencies and employees to defy congressional subpoenas for testimony and documents. A dozen career public servants defied the order but many individuals avoided testifying and no agency turned over documents. \u201cNo other president facing impeachment has taken the extreme step of prohibiting executive branch witnesses from testifying before Congress,\u201d said Zoe Lofgren, the only manager to work on all three recent presidential impeachment cases. \u201cEven President Richard Nixon \u2013 not only did Nixon allow staff to testify before Congress, he publicly asked them to testify, and without a subpoena.\u201d Republicans told reporters the Democratic case was failing to gain traction on their side of the aisle.

A Reuters-Ipsos poll published on Friday found 72% of respondents agreed the trial \u201cshould allow witnesses with first-hand knowledge of the impeachment charges to testify\u201d. A Washington Post poll found 66% support for witnesses. In a 90-minute closing statement that seemed to arrest the chamber, Schiff struck a rhythm as he summarized the Democrats\u2019 case \u2013 and then launched a preemptive attack on Trump\u2019s defense. Reading from the articles of impeachment laying out accusations against Trump, Schiff repeatedly toned, \u201cThat has been proved.\u201d \u201cThe facts have been proven. Those facts are not contested,\u201d he said. Schiff then skippingly previewed more than a dozen lines of defense mooted by Trump\u2019s team and the president himself \u2013 from \u201cread the transcript\u201d to \u201c[Joe] Biden is corrupt\u201d to \u201cObama did it\u201d \u2013 and deftly eviscerated each one. Schiff drew laughter from the Senate when he described how Trump\u2019s legal team would brandish in the president\u2019s defense his statement that he wanted \u201cnothing\u201d from Ukraine \u2013 \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d That line of argument, Schiff japed, would be based on \u201cthe well known principle of criminal defense\u201d that when someone denies a crime they didn\u2019t do it. The trial was scheduled to reconvene with an opening presentation by Trump\u2019s legal team on Saturday at 10am. Trump\u2019s team will make a \u201cstraightforward\u201d defense, a source working on the team said, on condition of anonymity: \u201cThe president didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers have indicated that they may take fewer than the 24 hours allotted under the rules. Following their presentation, 16 hours have been set aside for questioning by senators, after which the body will debate and vote on whether to call additional witnesses. Emerging for a dinner break, the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said: \u201cThe president\u2019s lawyers will have their work cut out for them. \u201cThe House managers did an amazing job and set a very, very high bar, which will be difficult for the president\u2019s lawyers to overcome.\u201d Asked to address an ABC News report that an audio recording from 2018 had surfaced in which Trump can be heard to order the dismissal of the then ambassador Marie Yovanovitch \u2013 \u201ctake her out\u201d, the president appears to say \u2013 Schumer said the president was \u201cvicious\u201d.

As he has for days, Schiff strived to appeal to Republican senators in a way that would circumvent the cold political calculus of the moment. A two-thirds majority of voting senators would be required to remove Trump from office. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. Schiff has warned that Trump threatens the constitution and America\u2019s standing in the world.

      "body": "<p>Three days of sitting quietly and listening is a tall order for anyone \u2013 even for the senators attending Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial this week. </p> <p>Reports from inside the chamber indicate that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/22/senate-impeachment-trial-trump-rules\">barred from using their electronic devices</a> many members of what, we keep being reminded, is \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest deliberative body\u201d at times struggled to keep their eyes open or stop fidgeting. Senator James Risch, an Idaho Republican, drifted off to dreamland during Tuesday\u2019s nearly 13-hour session, captured in a moving illustration by a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/16/us/politics/senate-impeachment-trial-sketches.html\">New York Times sketch artist</a>. The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/326336f2b37f03a521e867db9a41d0f0\">Associated Press</a> spotted an unnamed Democrat who \u201cleaned on his right arm, covered his eyes and stayed that way for nearly a half-hour\u201d the next day. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, typically tireless in the pursuit of injustice, allowed his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/22/impeachment-trial-mcconnell-sleep-schiff\">eyelids to droop</a>. A career spent stoking the flames of partisanship at the expense of all that is good and true really takes it out of you.</p> <p>Even the perpetually energetic Bernie Sanders was seen to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/01/21/us/politics/ap-us-trump-impeachment-attention-span.html\">yawn and lean backward</a>. According to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/us/senate-candy-desk-impeachment.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur\">New Yorker</a>, he has spent much of the week \u201cstaring blankly into space\u201d.

Some were productive: Elizabeth Warren, not known for slacking, and Susan Collins, whose sporadically rational behavior could force her party to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/trump-impeachment-trial-key-senators-mitt-romney-lisa-murkowski-susan-collins\">allow witnesses at the trial</a>, have reportedly taken thorough notes. Amy Klobuchar chatted with those nearby \u2013 which could, according to Senate decorum rules, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/us/politics/senators-impeachment-scene.html\">land her in prison</a>. (As of publication, she remains free.) She is among several senators known to chew gum on the floor, which might not lead to jail time but would certainly get her kicked out of many high school classrooms.</p> <p>In many ways, however, the experience is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/22/senate-impeachment-trial-trump-rules\">just like school</a>: the good students remain seated and attentive; the bad ones pass notes and giggle; the worst <em> </em>steadfastly defend corrupt presidential administrations. Snacks are generally not allowed, but if you bring enough for the whole class, the teacher \u2013 Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 will tolerate it. That\u2019s the case with the Republican Pat Toomey, who is in charge of the Senate candy drawer. Toomey has been in charge of the drawer since 2015, and he stocks it with stuff from his home state of Pennsylvania, which is fortunately also home to Hershey\u2019s. And in an era of bitter division, he magnanimously provides sweets to Democrats. \u201cThe candy desk is bipartisan,\u201d a spokesman told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/us/senate-candy-desk-impeachment.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur\">New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Senator Richard Burr handed out fidget spinners<strong> </strong>to fellow Republicans. But the Senate squirming epidemic was not limited to those on the right. Many senators have been getting up \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/22/politics/impeachment-trial-senators-sitting-walking-around/index.html\">CNN</a> counted 20 empty seats at 10.30pm on Tuesday \u2013 with the rascal <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-impeachment-trial-01-22-20/h_5d1fcff57599acc51b2b0237101f3fb7\">Lindsey Graham</a> reportedly spending more time out of his chair than in it, despite <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/senators-impeachment-trial-chamber\">leaders\u2019 request</a> that lawmakers \u201cremain in their seats at all times they are on the Senate floor\u201d. Mark Warner, a Democrat, was apparently excited to see Alyssa Milano, who had arrived to watch the proceedings; he <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/trump-impeachment-day-two-milk-crosswords-cruzs-phone.html\">pointed the Who\u2019s the Boss actor out</a> to his colleague Michael Bennet. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, was reportedly seen drawing a picture of the Capitol, doing a crossword puzzle, and possibly even working on a paper airplane.

      "bodyText": "Three days of sitting quietly and listening is a tall order for anyone \u2013 even for the senators attending Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial this week. Reports from inside the chamber indicate that barred from using their electronic devices many members of what, we keep being reminded, is \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest deliberative body\u201d at times struggled to keep their eyes open or stop fidgeting. Senator James Risch, an Idaho Republican, drifted off to dreamland during Tuesday\u2019s nearly 13-hour session, captured in a moving illustration by a New York Times sketch artist. The Associated Press spotted an unnamed Democrat who \u201cleaned on his right arm, covered his eyes and stayed that way for nearly a half-hour\u201d the next day. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, typically tireless in the pursuit of injustice, allowed his eyelids to droop. A career spent stoking the flames of partisanship at the expense of all that is good and true really takes it out of you. Even the perpetually energetic Bernie Sanders was seen to yawn and lean backward. According to the New Yorker, he has spent much of the week \u201cstaring blankly into space\u201d. (Eventually, he apparently summoned the fortitude to take notes.) Senators who avoided the beckoning of sweet slumber maintained lucidity in a variety of ways. Some were productive: Elizabeth Warren, not known for slacking, and Susan Collins, whose sporadically rational behavior could force her party to allow witnesses at the trial, have reportedly taken thorough notes. Amy Klobuchar chatted with those nearby \u2013 which could, according to Senate decorum rules, land her in prison. (As of publication, she remains free.) She is among several senators known to chew gum on the floor, which might not lead to jail time but would certainly get her kicked out of many high school classrooms. In many ways, however, the experience is just like school: the good students remain seated and attentive; the bad ones pass notes and giggle; the worst steadfastly defend corrupt presidential administrations. Snacks are generally not allowed, but if you bring enough for the whole class, the teacher \u2013 Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 will tolerate it. That\u2019s the case with the Republican Pat Toomey, who is in charge of the Senate candy drawer. Toomey has been in charge of the drawer since 2015, and he stocks it with stuff from his home state of Pennsylvania, which is fortunately also home to Hershey\u2019s. And in an era of bitter division, he magnanimously provides sweets to Democrats. \u201cThe candy desk is bipartisan,\u201d a spokesman told the New York Times. Senator Richard Burr handed out fidget spinners to fellow Republicans. But the Senate squirming epidemic was not limited to those on the right. Many senators have been getting up \u2013 CNN counted 20 empty seats at 10.30pm on Tuesday \u2013 with the rascal Lindsey Graham reportedly spending more time out of his chair than in it, despite leaders\u2019 request that lawmakers \u201cremain in their seats at all times they are on the Senate floor\u201d. Mark Warner, a Democrat, was apparently excited to see Alyssa Milano, who had arrived to watch the proceedings; he pointed the Who\u2019s the Boss actor out to his colleague Michael Bennet. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, was reportedly seen drawing a picture of the Capitol, doing a crossword puzzle, and possibly even working on a paper airplane. He kept it covered with a piece of paper but he had to move that in order to write in his answers. \u201cAll smart people do crossword puzzles,\u201d a spokesman told ABC News, though one might argue that most of those people are not simultaneously deciding the fate of a president. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, admitted to being \u201cbored\u201d: \u201cI don\u2019t know what else they can keep talking about,\u201d he told the New York Times. \u201cI mean, we heard their case in the first 13 hours.\u201d Perhaps things would be less boring if his fellow Republicans hadn\u2019t spent Tuesday valiantly voting against effort after effort to bring in new evidence. Sadly, it seems the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body would prefer to do a little less deliberating. An ABC reporter summed up the senators\u2019 departure that night: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a madder dash from senators to get out of this place.\u201d",
