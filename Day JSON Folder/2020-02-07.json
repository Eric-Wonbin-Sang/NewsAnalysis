And for that, the most powerful man in the world \u2013 buoyed by the silent, the pliable, and the complicit \u2013 has decided to exact revenge.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no question in the mind of any American why this man\u2019s job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House.

      "bodyText": "In an accelerating assault on Donald Trump\u2019s critics in the days since his impeachment acquittal, the administration fired Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, shortly after removing Lt Col Alexander Vindman from his White House post on Friday. Sondland and Vindman delivered damaging testimony during the impeachment inquiry, in defiance of Trump. \u201cI was advised today that the president intends to recall me effective immediately as United States Ambassador to the European Union,\u201d Sondland said in a statement. Hours earlier, Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the national security council who had been scheduled to rotate out of his White House assignment this summer, was suddenly fired and escorted out of the building on Friday, according to a statement from his lawyer. The attorney, David Pressman, said: \u201cHe followed orders, he obeyed his oath, and he served his country. And for that, the most powerful man in the world \u2013 buoyed by the silent, the pliable, and the complicit \u2013 has decided to exact revenge. \u201cThere is no question in the mind of any American why this man\u2019s job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House. Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth.\u201d Sondland and Vindman\u2019s firings were the latest in a string of moves by Trump against his perceived antagonists from the impeachment inquiry. An hour after Trump\u2019s acquittal, Senate Republicans announced an investigation of Hunter Biden, whose former employment with a Ukrainian gas company Trump has made the centerpiece of a political attack on his father, Joe Biden, the former vice-president. Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr have also repeatedly attacked Mitt Romney of Utah in the past week, the only Republican senator to vote to convict Trump on abuse of power. Romney voted to acquit Trump on obstruction of Congress. Central to the House impeachment managers\u2019 argument for Trump\u2019s removal was a warning that if he faced no retribution for his misconduct, Trump would expand the pace and scope of his power abuses. The president\u2019s son, Donald Trump, Jr, seemingly confirmed that Sondland and Vindman\u2019s removal was in retaliation for their cooperation with the Democrats\u2019 investigation. Were it not for the lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff\u2019s \u201ccrack investigation skills\u201d, the president \u201cmight have had a tougher time unearthing who all needed to be fired\u201d, he wrote in a tweet. Sondland\u2019s bombshell testimony was a turning point in the impeachment inquiry. Asserting that he and other officials \u201cfollowed the president\u2019s orders\u201d to negotiate a quid pro quo with Ukraine, Sondland implicated Trump and several other senior officials. After initially denying a pressure campaign in Ukraine, Sondland revised his testimony, admitting that he told a senior official in Ukraine that nearly $400m in US aid hinged on an announcement that the country was investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals. Sondland also said that an Oval Office meeting with Trump depended on Ukranian officials publicly declaring investigations into Burisma, a gas company linked to the 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that Ukraine planted evidence on a Democratic party server to make it appear that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Throughout his shocking televised testimony, Sondland remained calm, even jovial. When, during his questioning, he was told that another witness referred to him as \u201cthe Gordon problem\u201d, Sondland responded: \u201cThat\u2019s what my wife calls me.\u201d The wealthy hotelier and Trump donor, who has been described as one of the so-called \u201cthree amigos\u201d who bypassed usual state department channels in Ukraine, had no foreign policy experience prior to his appointment as ambassador. Most of the dozen witnesses who testified in public impeachment hearings had already left their posts in the Trump administration before testifying. But both Sondland and Vindman continued to work in the administration after they testified about Trump\u2019s Ukraine scheme. A line from Vindman\u2019s testimony about the supposed strength of the rule of law in the United States \u2013 \u201chere, right matters\u201d \u2013 became a refrain in the prosecution of Trump at the Senate impeachment trial, which ended on Wednesday. Schiff, urged the senators to reflect on Vindman\u2019s words as they weighed the charges against Trump. Trump was acquitted on both articles of impeachment on a party-line vote, with the exception of Romney\u2019s vote to convict on abuse of power. In the opening statement that Vindman gave when testifying to the House of Representatives last October, he outlined how he planned to describe his concerns that the president\u2019s plot to weaken rival Biden by strong-arming the Ukrainian government into investigating him was undermining US foreign policy in Ukraine. Vindman\u2019s testimony was a dramatic moment in the inquiry. At one point he delivered a message to his father, who fled the former Soviet Union with the family to settle in New York. \u201cDad, my sitting here today, in the US Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth.\u201d Why do you have the confidence to \u201ctell your dad not to worry?\u201d Representative Sean Maloney asked Vindman. \u201cCongressman, because this is America,\u201d he replied, without hesitating. \u201cThis is the country I have served and defended, that all of my brothers have served. And here, right matters.\u201d Schiff echoed Vindman\u2019s words once more in response to the news of his firing. \u201cHe upheld his oath when others would not,\u201d Schiff said in a tweet. \u201cRight matters to him.

Since defeating New Zealand in November 2018, Ireland have declined, well beaten by England at home a year ago, strangled by Wales in Cardiff and overrun by Japan in the World Cup before being crushed by New Zealand in the quarter-final. Farrell, like Pivac, has made few personnel changes but the difference is that he did not inherit a winning side. Wales\u2019s only defeat in a competitive match since they lost to Ireland in Dublin two years ago was against South Africa in the World Cup semi-final, and then to a late penalty.

That\u2019s something that we want to get better at and something that we\u2019re focused on in our preparation.\u201d The Six Nations organisers and the Scottish Rugby Union are continuing to monitor Storm Ciara closely with gusts of 50mph expected in Edinburgh. The Scotland captain Stuart Hogg believes his side will have a few \u201ctricks up their sleeve\u201d but Mitchell is adamant England can cope with the expected conditions. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for anything,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly in our preparation. We\u2019ve looked at all situations that could occur and weather is certainly one of those. It\u2019s important for us to be adaptable in those situations. I\u2019m not sure who it will favour. Certainly both teams will have to adapt to it. Should it come then it\u2019s adapting to what it presents in each of the halves.\u201d Jonny May meanwhile, has admitted he does not know where he will be playing next season with his Leicester contract up in the summer. May moved to fifth on the list of all-time England try-scorers with two stunning efforts against France but faces a pay cut if he wants to stay at Welford Road because of salary cap constraints. \u201cI don\u2019t think: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m out of contract so I need to try a bit harder.\u2019 Nobody knows what I\u2019m going to do yet, because I don\u2019t. We\u2019re playing Scotland and I swear to you, everything I\u2019m doing is focused on being the best I can be. Whenever there is a disappointing result all you can rip in until the next game.\u201d",

After Anna Karolina Schmiedlova thoroughly outplayed Heather Watson 6-2, 6-3, Harriet Dart produced a desperate, courageous performance in her first live Fed Cup rubber, but she eventually lost 6-7, 6-3, 6-4.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/02/sofia-kenin-garbina-muguruza-australian-open-womens-final\">Sofia Kenin emerges from the shadows in style with first major title</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watson had arrived dreaming of a different opener. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/21/johanna-konta-katie-boulter-fed-cup\" title=\"\">Great Britain overcame Kazakhstan</a> last year to reach the now defunct World Group II for the first time in 26 years, the team\u2019s joy came at a delicate period for Watson. She was forced to watch from her bed at home, crippled by sickness. Despite her years of service, she would not have played even if she had been fit; she had fallen out of the top 100 with a six-match losing streak. It has taken courage for her to turn her form around since the end of 2019, rising back into the top 100 and arriving in Bratislava with the possibility of righting in the absence of Johanna Konta.</p> <p>Her problem was the simple difference between a player who was born on the dirt and one still learning to play on the surface. From the first exchanges on the indoor clay of Slovakia\u2019s National Tennis Center, Schmiedlova flew into her strokes with long, perfectly judged sliding as Watson\u2019s excellent defence was slowed by the slippery clay. While Schmiedlova\u2019s loopy top-spin strokes and wicked angles are built precisely to work her opponents to death on the slow clay, Watson\u2019s strokes are flatter and her game is more linear, built on the hard courts of Guernsey. She felt that her only hope was to stand on the baseline and hit through the surface.</p> <p>Watson battled well in the opening stages, feathering a series of delicate drop-shot winners and engaging in bruising rallies, but Schmiedlova\u2019s counterpunching forced Watson out of her comfort zone and the Slovak eventually marched to victory with an accomplished performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3fe704c09a79be11721cd8e0e67f36b0968ebe9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fe704c09a79be11721cd8e0e67f36b0968ebe9b/0_139_3806_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heather Watson lost 6-2, 6-3 to Anna Karolina Schmiedlova.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heather Watson lost 6-2, 6-3 to Anna Karolina Schmiedlova.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images for LTA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pressure rested on Dart\u2019s shoulders for the second rubber. She stood at the baseline without a single live Fed Cup rubber to her name, only 16 clay-court matches in her record and a highest ranking win of 64. Her stress was high and her odds even higher against No 65 Viktoria Kuzmova. Many better players would have crumbled, but Dart handled herself exceptionally, fighting hard to the death.</p> <p>In her young career, Dart has shown that she can make up for her lack of weaponry and experience with fight. She arrived prepared to shoulder the pressure, opening the match serving incredibly well and controlling most of the rallies off the ground. Dart breezed through her opening service games and then saved three set points.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/03/australian-open-2020-tournament-tarnished-tennis-image\">Australian Open 2020: the tournament that tarnished tennis\u2019s image | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Kuzmova eventually found her range on her powerful groundstrokes and rolled through seven consecutive games in the middle of the second set, it seemed the match would quickly fall her way as she moved to a 5-2 third-set lead. But Dart refused to buckle. She resolutely held serve and then disdainfully dismissed a match point on the Slovak\u2019s serve with a searing backhand down the line.</p> <p>On her own serve at 5-4, Dart saved four match points including one with an astonishing exhibition of defence and grit, retrieving two overheads and then forcing a Kuzmova error. As the Slovak gagged, spraying errors and looking helplessly to her team, Dart\u2019s temperament was outstanding and her focus was relentless.</p> <p>It took six match points and two hours 55 minutes for the Slovak No 1 to defeat her. Dart may not possess the biggest game and she currently does not have a coach or a permanent training base, but the 23-year-old has many years of battling ahead. No matter how the second day goes, the No 141 should leave Bratislava a little more hopeful about being among the likes of Kuzmova in the top 100 soon.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Great Britain face a struggle to reach the Fed Cup Finals after going 2-0 down on the opening day of Fed Cup Qualifiers in Bratislava. After Anna Karolina Schmiedlova thoroughly outplayed Heather Watson 6-2, 6-3, Harriet Dart produced a desperate, courageous performance in her first live Fed Cup rubber, but she eventually lost 6-7, 6-3, 6-4. Watson had arrived dreaming of a different opener. When Great Britain overcame Kazakhstan last year to reach the now defunct World Group II for the first time in 26 years, the team\u2019s joy came at a delicate period for Watson. She was forced to watch from her bed at home, crippled by sickness. Despite her years of service, she would not have played even if she had been fit; she had fallen out of the top 100 with a six-match losing streak. It has taken courage for her to turn her form around since the end of 2019, rising back into the top 100 and arriving in Bratislava with the possibility of righting in the absence of Johanna Konta. Her problem was the simple difference between a player who was born on the dirt and one still learning to play on the surface. From the first exchanges on the indoor clay of Slovakia\u2019s National Tennis Center, Schmiedlova flew into her strokes with long, perfectly judged sliding as Watson\u2019s excellent defence was slowed by the slippery clay. While Schmiedlova\u2019s loopy top-spin strokes and wicked angles are built precisely to work her opponents to death on the slow clay, Watson\u2019s strokes are flatter and her game is more linear, built on the hard courts of Guernsey. She felt that her only hope was to stand on the baseline and hit through the surface. Watson battled well in the opening stages, feathering a series of delicate drop-shot winners and engaging in bruising rallies, but Schmiedlova\u2019s counterpunching forced Watson out of her comfort zone and the Slovak eventually marched to victory with an accomplished performance. The pressure rested on Dart\u2019s shoulders for the second rubber. She stood at the baseline without a single live Fed Cup rubber to her name, only 16 clay-court matches in her record and a highest ranking win of 64. Her stress was high and her odds even higher against No 65 Viktoria Kuzmova. Many better players would have crumbled, but Dart handled herself exceptionally, fighting hard to the death. In her young career, Dart has shown that she can make up for her lack of weaponry and experience with fight. She arrived prepared to shoulder the pressure, opening the match serving incredibly well and controlling most of the rallies off the ground. Dart breezed through her opening service games and then saved three set points. As Kuzmova eventually found her range on her powerful groundstrokes and rolled through seven consecutive games in the middle of the second set, it seemed the match would quickly fall her way as she moved to a 5-2 third-set lead. But Dart refused to buckle. She resolutely held serve and then disdainfully dismissed a match point on the Slovak\u2019s serve with a searing backhand down the line. On her own serve at 5-4, Dart saved four match points including one with an astonishing exhibition of defence and grit, retrieving two overheads and then forcing a Kuzmova error. As the Slovak gagged, spraying errors and looking helplessly to her team, Dart\u2019s temperament was outstanding and her focus was relentless. It took six match points and two hours 55 minutes for the Slovak No 1 to defeat her. Dart may not possess the biggest game and she currently does not have a coach or a permanent training base, but the 23-year-old has many years of battling ahead. No matter how the second day goes, the No 141 should leave Bratislava a little more hopeful about being among the likes of Kuzmova in the top 100 soon.",

Meanwhile, dismembered hands spider-crawl across Duval\u2019s hair. She mutates into a vampire and gets Hurst in the neck. On the other hand, it\u2019s like being on a rollercoaster, ghost train, merry-go-round and the dodgems all at once: sensationally stimulating but perilously dizzying and sometimes hard to stomach. Here\u2019s an ice-cream seller handing over a mystic key. There\u2019s a corpse-bride, briefly emerging from the shadows, scientists in gas masks, a cajun cowgirl, a giant shark. Now we\u2019re in a swampy forest; now on the moon; now in a pharaoh\u2019s tomb. Catching everything the piece throws at them are the designs \u2013 light, set and costumes all fantastically versatile \u2013 and ultimately the skilled dancers themselves, who come into their own especially in some tautly inventive choreographic episodes: a frenetic group thrash on the floor; a ferocious kneeling duet, with Jordi Calpe Serrats and Carina Howard rising and lunging like hooded cobras. It might work better with a more informal, irreverent presentation that plays up to the cultish, B-movie undercurrents, releasing its wry laughs and occasional guffaws. Still, when it falters, Return to Heaven can look hollow or even silly, and though its scenes often work well individually they lose impact cumulatively. Certainly it needs no narrative, but such threads that it does have \u2013 winding between calypso, Anubis and outer space \u2013 string the work out more than they pull it together. \u2022At Tobacco Factory, Bristol, until 8 February. Then touring until 29 April.",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government pledged $4.5m to build a tidal pool in Port Macquarie before the 2019 election as part of a controversial $150m grants program with no open application process despite the opposition of the local council and no site having been chosen for the pool. The grant was made as part of the female facilities and water safety stream (FFWSS), announced in the 2019 budget, which went on to fund Coalition election commitments, with 73% of the projects which received funding in marginal or under-threat seats. On Thursday the health department told Guardian Australia the tidal pool grant is to be paid to the Port Macquarie Hastings council, but when contacted on Friday the council was not even aware the department has listed it as the recipient. In May 2018 the council explicitly warned that a tidal pool \u201cis not a priority\u201d. On Friday the department clarified the \u201cadministrative error\u201d, stating the intended grant recipient is not the council but the Port Macquarie Tidal Pool Committee Incorporated, a charity formed in July 2018 to lobby government for funding for the pool that received $50,000 from the New South Wales government for a feasibility study. Scott Morrison and Nationals candidate Pat Conaghan announced the $4.5m grant on 9 May, 2019, citing a 18,000 signature petition to the council as evidence of community support for the project. Port Macquarie is in the seat of Cowper, which was held by retiring Nationals MP Luke Hartsuyker on a 4.5% margin but was once again under threat from the former independent MP for Lyne, Rob Oakeshott. At a meeting on 16 May, 2018 the Port Macquarie Hastings council noted two petitions in favour of the pool but resolved that \u201can ocean tidal pool in Port Macquarie is not a priority for council\u201d \u2013 a decision taken due to the uncertainty around the project\u2019s future and a preference to focus on reconstruction of the Port Macquarie Aquatic Centre. The resolution also called on the tidal pool committee to \u201cmake any future requests, submissions and grant applications through council\u2019s recognised engagement processes to ensure that the competing priorities of all volunteer and community groups in our area receive appropriate and equal consideration by council\u201d. The tidal pool committee has said it is spending the $50,000 grant on environmental geomorphic and site studies conducted by James Carley, principal engineer of water laboratory at the University of NSW and Nicole Larkin, an architect and tidal pool designer. Josh Rummery, a local mortgage broker and a member of the tidal pool committee, told Guardian Australia it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any of that [$4.5m federal money] yet\u201d and said he had \u201cno idea\u201d if it would be given the grant to build the pool. Asked when the pool is likely to be built, Rummery replied: \u201cIt would be lovely if we could build it today. I have no idea. Until we\u2019ve contracted \u2013 until whoever is going to build it is contracted, we\u2019re still in the feasibility and planning stage.\u201d Carley told Guardian Australia he had assessed seven potential sites but the process of selecting one and conducting a full feasibility study is \u201cstill ongoing\u201d. \u201cTo actually do a feasibility study, the technical work, takes three months \u2013 in a dictatorship it would happen in three months,\u201d he said. \u201cBut like any complex piece of infrastructure it takes longer, with the to-ing and fro-ing it takes about six months.\u201d \u201cFrom the time you decide you want to build a tidal pool to the time you open it, can take from two to five years.\u201d Conaghan told Guardian Australia: \u201cPort Macquarie is a town of 45,000 people and has only one public swimming pool, so this tidal pool will deliver great sport and recreational benefits, plus the health and tourism benefits from having an alternative to a chlorinated pool.\u201d \u201cProjects of this size and scale always take time to deliver as they need to have their environmental and social impacts and benefits properly assessed,\u201d he said. Conaghan said the feasibility study was already complete and the next step is to prepare a development application. A Guardian Australia analysis of the 41 projects awarded FFWSS funding found that 58.5% were in marginal seats, including $30m for two pools in the Victorian seat of Corangamite, $25m in Christian Porter\u2019s West Australian seat of Pearce and $20m in the WA seat of Swan. When grants to Kooyong and Farrer, Coalition-held seats under threat despite larger margins, are considered, some 73% of projects were located in marginal or at-risk seats. By dollar value, $111m of the program\u2019s $150m of grants was spent in marginal seats. On Friday, Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the FFWSS program was \u201csports rorts on steroids again\u201d, describing it as \u201ca program with no guidelines, $150m of taxpayers money, abused for political purposes where the only guidelines were the electoral map and the political interests of the government\u201d. Later, Morrison misinterpreted several questions about the $150m FFWSS program, telling reporters in Townsville the government had funded 60 projects across the country, which he described as \u201cfantastic\u201d, a reference to the $100m community sport infrastructure grants program which triggered the resignation of former sports minister Bridget McKenzie. A spokesman for Morrison said the department \u201cis finalising funding and contractual arrangements with the program\u2019s participants\u201d and noted Labor had promised \u201cat least $250m\u201d for local and community sport programs in the lead-up to the election. The health department has told Guardian Australia the FFWSS program \u201cwas not open to applications for grants\u201d. \u201cThe projects were selected as election commitments. Projects eligible for funding included those that supported the development of female change room facilities at sporting grounds and community swimming facilities.\u201d The Greens have written to the auditor general asking for an audit of the FFWSS program, after the scathing report into the community sport infrastructure grant program found it was targeted at marginal seats .",

Under changes posted online on Thursday, BHP coal and iron ore mines in Western Australia and Queensland, Alcoa\u2019s Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria and a Boggabri coalmine in New South Wales were each given the green light to emit more under the scheme known as the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d. Of those made public, the allowed increases ranged between 3% to 33% above previous emissions limits. Not all the increases were published. Two of three BHP mines moved from annual to multi-year emissions limits, which means they promised to emit less over the next two years to make up for excess emissions last year. The increases were signed off despite the safeguard mechanism\u2019s promise to limit emissions from big polluters to ensure they do not just cancel out cuts paid for by taxpayers through the Coalition\u2019s main climate policy, the emissions reduction fund. Under the scheme, every industrial facility across the country that emits more than 100,000 tonnes a year was set a pollution limit, known as a baseline, based on either its historic emissions or an independent forecast of future emissions. Under changes being introduced this year, all facilities will be moved to limits based not on their total emissions, but on how much they expect to emit per unit of production. The Australian Conservation Foundation found increases approved over the past two years alone allowed more than 7m tonnes of potential extra emissions each year \u2013 about 1.3% of annual national carbon pollution. The increases allowed under Thursday\u2019s changes, including those from a new Jemena gas pipeline between Tennant Creek and Mount Isa, are at least 236,658 tonnes a year. Bret Harper, director of research with energy and carbon consultants RepuTex, said it showed the safeguard mechanism was a \u201cpretty ineffective policy\u201d. \u201cThe bottom line is there is no accountability for any emissions increases that do occur,\u201d he said. Emissions from electricity generation have reduced and the drought has triggered a drop from agriculture, but cuts in those sectors have been effectively cancelled out by increases, mostly from big industry. Emissions have increased from the liquified natural gas (LNG) industry, mining sector and transport, in particular. Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said national climate policies did not send a strong enough market signal to unlock the private investment needed to put Australia on a path to zero emissions. She said it should take the opportunity to strengthen the safeguards mechanism and other emissions reduction policies after a review led by businessman Grant King and through the development of a long-term emissions reduction strategy. \u201cUnless we provide tighter emissions pathways to net-zero for large emitters it\u2019s hard to see how we can reduce pollution in line with our overarching commitments under the Paris agreement,\u201d Herd said. The Coalition has changed how it describes the safeguard mechanism over time. In 2016, the then environment minister, Greg Hunt, said it would ensure emissions cuts contracted through the emissions reduction fund were not offset by significant increases above business-as-usual levels elsewhere in the economy. But a government climate policy document released before last year\u2019s election said the mechanism required Australia\u2019s largest emitters to \u201cmeasure, report and manage\u201d their emissions, not that it would limit pollution. An analysis by RepuTex found the government regulator had approved a 32% increase in how much large industrial facilities were allowed to emit under the scheme. While not every company emitted up to their limit, the most recent data, for 2017-18, showed emissions from large industry were up 12% since 2015.

In December Hani was transferred but made to stay in detention until enough pressure was brought on the authorities to let him live with his wife and child. \u201cIt was overwhelming, I was crying, I was really happy for us to be together again as a family, and for Mohammed and Hani to be together as a father and son,\u201d says Dima. \u201cBecause Mohammed is so young, it was sort of effortless. I\u2019m not saying that is for every family, but we were speaking every day so Mohammed knew it was his father. But it was so different because he was living with us now.\u201d \u2018Not as easy as it seems\u2019 Their Toronto apartment is in a friendly and multicultural community near services, transport, halal food and Mohammed\u2019s preschool. They are still looking for friends, Dima says, but first they need jobs. \u201cMoving to a new country is not as easy as it seems. Although we have our freedom, we have to look for jobs, to engage and emerge in the community, and then we can find work.\u201d Dima wants to study and Hani, a mechanic, wants to get his Canadian qualifications and has started an apprenticeship. They have time \u2013 the Canadian program requires sponsors provide a certain amount of money for each refugee to support them for the first year, while they find their feet. Ravi and his four co-sponsors (his partner Dilya, Dilya\u2019s sister and two friends) were approved after a full year\u2019s wait, and with fundraising by Caroline, provided C$24,000 ($26,800) for the family. \u201cThe private sponsors have to think about where the family are going to arrive, what services they would need, what kind of supports exist,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce you start looking, in this country and this city in particular, there are so many things. We found free furniture, clothes, healthcare, speech therapy for Mohammed. There are all kinds of things here. So the settlement plan is really about coming up with those kind of things that human beings need \u2013 what kind of housing will be realistic, kinds of work, school.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s people action\u2019 The sponsorship program was originally designed to bring in Syrian refugees from the civil conflict, but bringing in people from Australia\u2019s ill-designed and internationally condemned system proved more challenging. \u201cDima and Hani were in the Australian system with a whole set of pretty challenging legal situations and uncertainties we had to figure out, as well as the sponsorship process,\u201d Ravi says. \u201c[I got advice from a colleague in law school who] said there\u2019s no way of knowing things like average timelines with Australian detention, [whereas] there were timelines and parameters for people coming from camps in Turkey. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened inside the Canadian immigration department and so on, but in the end it happened very effectively.\u201d Asked how he feels as an Australian expat in Canada, comparing the two countries\u2019 treatment of the family, Ravi says it\u2019s frustrating that the political cultures are so different. \u201cI don\u2019t want to convey the idea that Canadians are free from racism or anything like that, it\u2019s not, but it\u2019s not a public culture or a political culture where people can be \u2013 or there\u2019s a need to be \u2013 very aggressive towards marginalised people like refugees,\u201d he says. \u201cCanada\u2019s situation hasn\u2019t produced a carceral state, an archipelago of camps and offshoring.\u201d Dima just wants people to help those still in the system, like people helped her even though they didn\u2019t know her. \u201cIf you want to help you can do it. Don\u2019t wait for the government to change its mind because they won\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s people action, not the government, because the government doesn\u2019t listen to people.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An Australian in quarantine on Christmas Island has spoken of his anguish at having to choose between staying with his elderly parents in Wuhan and taking an evacuation flight that would mean he could rejoin his wife and twin daughters in Australia. Prof Yan Zhang, an Australian citizen from Sydney who teaches at Western Sydney University, spoke to Guardian Australia from the remote island detention centre as he undergoes a 14-day period of isolation. The 57-year old said it was hard to leave behind his parents, who are now vulnerable and unsupported by China\u2019s under-pressure medical system. \u201cIt was a hard and also sad decision for me,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cOn one hand, my wife and twin daughters are in Australia, and they worried about me so much and wished me to return as soon as possible. \u201cBut on the other hand, Wuhan has my parents and elder sister and her husband. Especially my father turns 93, and my mother 85 this year, they are quite fragile. I really worry about them. \u201cAfter the Wuhan lockdown, all hospitals had to deal with patients with coronavirus infections, people with other issues had no place to see doctors. Now I can only pray my parents don\u2019t get sick, and can overcome this difficult period.\u201d Zhang said he was otherwise in good spirits, felt \u201chealthy\u201d and was not aware of any cases of coronavirus among the 277 Australians who have been evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan. Zhang thanked the Australian government for organising the evacuation flight out of Wuhan, where the new strain of coronavirus first emerged. Earlier, other Australians evacuating from Wuhan told Guardian Australia they had concerns over the rudimentary health facilities on the island \u2013 especially for the elderly, the young and pregnant women. On Friday, Zhang said that to his knowledge, no Australians had come down with the new virus. \u201cI\u2019m very healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an amateur mountaineer. I have climbed some difficult peaks in New Zealand and the Himalayas. I\u2019m not aware of anyone who got sick in here.\u201d The Sydney professor said conditions were \u201cnot perfect\u201d but adequate. \u201cLife on Christmas Island is good enough for me. I have my own room, and we have sufficient outdoor space to walk around and do some exercise. \u201cFood is a bit limited, too much meat for me, and lacking fruits and vegetables. Yesterday I had put some comments on this in the request book. Hopefully it will be improved. \u201cWe have a big oval ground, where we can do some walks. I usually get up at 5am, go to the oval to take photographs, for about one hour. During the daytime, I do some university research, write my diary. \u201cIn the afternoon I do some body weight exercises in my own room. After dinner I go to the oval again to take photos. I read books for about one or two hours before I go to bed at 9pm. I don\u2019t feel bored at all.\u201d The Australian government organised its first evacuation flight \u2013 using a jet provided by Qantas \u2013 to bring 243 Australian citizens and permanent residents out of Wuhan on Monday. A pregnant woman and her partner were taken to Perth to be nearer a tertiary hospital, but the rest were transferred to Christmas Island. Another 36 Australians were evacuated on a NZ-government chartered flight. They were also brought to Christmas Island. A second Australian-run evacuation flight was scheduled to leave Wuhan just after midnight Saturday morning. Those passengers will be quarantined at the now-disused Inpex workers village just outside Darwin in the Northern Territory, rather than on Christmas Island. The second Australian flight out of Wuhan was reportedly over-subscribed, with many more Australians trying to get out than there are seats on the plane. However, it is likely to be the last flight the government will be able to organise, with Chinese authorities unlikely to permit more evacuation missions from Australia. When the initial charter flight was announced, some Australians chose to stay in the city, preferring to wait for the outbreak to subside, but as it has spread and intensified, many are now taking the chance to leave. Globally, the outbreak has infected more than 31,000 people and killed 636, the vast majority of those in Hubei province. Zhang, who did his undergraduate studies in Wuhan, said it was \u201cpanic\u201d in the city when the Chinese government announced it would be locked down to prevent the spread of the virus. \u201cAll kinds of transportation were cut off suddenly without any warning. I realised I couldn\u2019t return to Sydney on my schedule of 29 January. \u201cSome people thought the lockdown could finish within a couple of weeks, and things would get better. With the situation of Wuhan was getting worse every day, we finally realised our life in Wuhan would be much more difficult than initially thought.\u201d \u201cI would like to thank the Australian government to make this evacuation plan happen,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cAlso I would like to tell outside people that conditions in Christmas Island are not perfect, but generally good from my personal point of view.

With authorities still assessing the direct and indirect damage, there is a chance some regions may escape unharmed. \u201cAt this stage it is still too early to tell what the exact situation is,\u201d Poddar says. \u201cWe started doing research on smoke taint in 2003. What happens is when there\u2019s fresh, heavy smoke, it lands on the outside of the grape, and specific compounds get into the skin, not the flesh. It\u2019s a one-season thing \u2013 next season the vines are fine.\u201d With most winemakers now focused on the short-term work of getting through the year, few are asking whether this might represent a new normal. Alisdair Tulloch, of Keith Tulloch Wine, says the threat posed by bushfires and smoke taint are indicative of a larger problem. \u201cYou need to pull the camera back further than the bushfires themselves and the way they are influenced by climate change to look at the broader picture of grape growing in general,\u201d he says. \u201cGrape growing has been showing the fingerprints of climate change since the 1980s when the harvesting dates began to move forward. \u201cLast year was both the hottest and driest year on record, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, which confirms that this drought is anything but normal.\u201d Like chocolate and coffee crops elsewhere, wine grapes the world over require specific microclimates, while growers need predictable weather to make production decisions. Thanks to the climate emergency this is changing right across the globe. Within Australia, seasons are arriving earlier and weather has grown unpredictable. Rain falls in large quantities or not at all, while drier conditions are making it harder to grow certain varieties. These effects were predicted in a landmark study on the impact of climate change on the Australian wine industry published in 2011. A team at Australia\u2019s scientific research agency CSIRO forecast temperatures would rise between 0.3C and 1.7C by 2030. Events have since borne out the predictions, with shorter winters and earlier harvests as fruit ripens earlier. All of which has underscored the need to act, according to Alisdair Tulloch, who says problems affecting viticulture are true for all agricultural sectors. \u201cOur small family vineyard has been carbon neutral since 2017,\u201d Tulloch says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been certified as carbon neutral by the Australian government since March 2019. \u201cMeanwhile, other industries are free to pollute and pump as much of these greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, while agriculture and the wine industry is picking up the bill. \u201cIf we can do it, why can\u2019t they?\u201d",

The leaked analysis by a Labour staffer, produced for senior party figures, found that officials were not in the right parts of the country to run an effective strategy, despite the fact that door-to-door campaigning increases turnout for Labour. And though Labour is the largest political party in Europe, the report \u2013 seen by the Guardian \u2013 suggests it needs to expand its membership even further if it is to swing decisive seats in future elections. \u201cDiscussions with activists reveal \u2026 major deficiencies in the running of the campaign,\u201d the report reveals. \u201cThese include poor quality and late delivery of printed materials, lack of communication and preparation over key policy lines, lack of clarity on how campaigns could secure the data of newly registered voters, the unreliability of digital tools, and inadequate training of activists. \u201cTherefore there is clearly major room for improvement in the effectiveness of on-the-ground campaigning.\u201d Significant regional differences were also revealed in the rate of conversations Labour activists had with voters.

But there is statistical proof that canvassing works.\u201d The report found that for every 10% change in campaign contact rate there would be a 2% increase in Labour\u2019s vote share. The report is one of a number of critical election postmortems for the Labour party, which returned its worst result since 1935. So far an analysis presented to the party\u2019s National Executive Committee found that the poor election performance was down to the party leadership\u2019s decision to back a second Brexit referendum and that too many policies were released on a daily basis throughout the election period. It did not blame the leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who they suggested had been the victim of unrelenting attacks on his character. Organisation Labour Together \u2013 which is being backed by the party\u2019s former leader Ed Miliband and the Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell \u2013 has so far had feedback from 8,000 people. Early findings showed that voters did not like the party\u2019s policies, and that the campaign was inefficient and beset with technical difficulties. However, this fresh report seen by the Guardian is the first statistical analysis of how conversations with voters correlated to vote share for the party in individual seats. Citing the link between the contact rate and the increase in the Labour vote share, the report said: \u201cThe party\u2019s potential to mobilise large numbers of volunteers is a major electoral asset, with significant potential to swing decisive seats if [it] targets accurately.

The UK has said it will allow Huawei to be involved in building \u201cperipheral\u201d parts of the 5G and full-fibre network, despite labelling it a \u201chigh-risk vendor\u201d. It will also introduce a new regulatory framework aimed at ensuring the Chinese firm\u2019s share of the 5G market cannot exceed 35% \u2013 and can be reduced over time. Several high-profile Conservative MPs, including former cabinet ministers David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith, have expressed concerns about the decision. Some backbench rebels are pressing the government to announce a deadline for removing Huawei from the UK altogether. One Tory rebel said they had been emboldened by news of Trump\u2019s anger, and would continue to demand concessions from No 10. A spokesman for the prime minister declined to be drawn on the Trump conversation, merely repeating the official readout from the call at the time, which said Johnson had, \u201cunderlined the importance of like-minded countries working together to diversify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies\u201d. Truss\u2019s job had been widely thought to be at risk in the forthcoming reshuffle, which is expected next Thursday, but Johnson repeatedly name-checked her in his Brexit speech last Monday. She had pressed for negotiations with the US to kick off immediately, in parallel with talks with Brussels over the future relationship with the EU27.

Finally, we call on human rights bodies and the international press to put a spotlight on what is happening in Brazil. This is a grave political moment. We must reject the rise of authoritarianism. More than 2,000 actors, academics, journalists, artists and others have signed this op-ed.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s future at the Evening Standard is believed to be in doubt, with sources at the newspaper expecting the former chancellor to leave the publication. Osborne was appointed to edit the daily London newspaper in March 2017 and since then has continued to juggle the job with several other roles, including a \u00a3650,000-a-year post advising the investment fund BlackRock, and as chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. Amid rampant speculation over the editor\u2019s future among staff, the Evening Standard did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Friday afternoon. Sources at the newspaper said the publication was changing direction under its new chief executive, Mike Soutar \u2013 the founder of the free magazine Shortlist who joined the Evening Standard at the end of last year \u2013 as he seeks to reduce financial losses of \u00a311m a year. The newspaper, which distributes 800,000 copies a day across London, has been hit hard by the decline in print advertising revenue. Its free distribution model means that it has high fixed costs, which cannot be offset with price rises. At the same time the outlet is facing the challenge of 4G mobile phone signal coming to the London Underground, giving readers an alternative to reading a print newspaper. The company has been pushing investment in its website while having to make job cuts and several long-serving staff members have departed. A key issue facing the Evening Standard is the role of its owner, the Russian businessman Evgeny Lebedev, and his willingness to subsidise the operation. The company\u2019s accounts say the losses mean the outlet \u201crequires continuous financial support from the shareholders\u201d. A minority stake in the Evening Standard\u2019s parent company was bought at the end of December 2017 by an offshore Cayman Islands company that turned out to be ultimately controlled by a Saudi Arabian state bank. This led to a failed attempt by the British government to investigate what they termed \u201cunconventional, complex and clandestine\u201d deals to enable Saudi investment in the Evening Standard and the Independent, a sister title. The Guardian also revealed that Lebedev has hosted a private dinner for Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman.

      "bodyText": "A drop in the number of new coronavirus cases for two days has been cautiously welcomed by the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The world is running out of masks and other protective gear, with demand increasing 100-fold and prices soaring, the WHO has warned. The test used to diagnose coronavirus is being rolled out to laboratories across the UK from Monday, increasing testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day. Hong Kong has announced six-month jail terms for breaching quarantine conditions. The 14-day mandatory quarantine for visitors arriving from mainland China is expected to reduce the number of people crossing the border. Art Basel, Asia\u2019s largest annual art fair, has been cancelled. It was scheduled to take place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from 19 March. A British man on a Japan cruise ship has tested positive for coronavirus. He is one of 61 passengers diagnosed aboard the Diamond Princess, moored off Yokohama. Singapore reported three more coronavirus cases with no travel history in China. The country moved its disease outbreak response up a level to \u201corange\u201d The first plane carrying Canadian evacuees from Wuhan touched down in Ontario. The 176 to arrive today will be followed by a second group of 39 tomorrow. The cruise line operator Royal Caribbean has said it will refuse any passengers with Chinese, Hong Kong or Macao passports, regardless of when they were last in China. The remarkable statement comes after reports that about two dozen passengers aboard a cruise ship that docked in Bayonne, New Jersey, on Friday morning were screened for coronavirus and four were sent to a local hospital for further screening. In a statement published on its website, Royal Caribbean said that none of the four passengers tested showed clinical signs or symptoms of coronavirus, although one tested positive onboard for flu. However, the company said it would be adopting a number of health screening protocols, including the following: Regardless of nationality, any guest or crew member traveling from, to, or through mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau less than 15 days prior to their sailing will be unable to board any of our ships. Any guests holding a Chinese, Hong Kong, or Macau passport, regardless of when they were there last, will not be allowed to board our ships. Any guest or crew member that has been in contact (which the CDC defines as 6 feet or 2 meters) with someone that has traveled from, to, or through mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau less than 15 days. Additionally, there will be mandatory specialized health screenings performed on: a. Guests who are unsure if they have been in contact with individuals who have traveled from, to or through mainland China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days; b. Guests who report feeling unwell or demonstrate any flu-like symptoms; c. Any guest presenting with fever or low blood oximetry in the specialized health screening will be denied boarding. Burberry has said the coronavirus is having a devastating effect on the luxury goods market, as wealthy Chinese consumers stay away from shops, and travel restrictions curb overseas shopping sprees, Zoe Wood reports. The British company closed 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China and those that remained open were operating with reduced hours because shopper numbers had plunged 80%. None of the group\u2019s employees in China had been diagnosed with the illness, it said. The chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, said: \u201cThe outbreak of coronavirus in mainland China is having a material negative effect on luxury demand. \u201cWhile we cannot currently predict how long this situation will last, we remain confident in our strategy. In the meantime, we are taking mitigating actions and every precaution to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees.\u201d A plane carrying 176 Canadians repatriated from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus epidemic, has touched down in Ontario, Reuters reports. A second group of 39, who left China on a US flight, should arrive later on Friday after switching planes in Vancouver, Francois-Philippe Champagne, minister of foreign affairs, told reporters on Thursday. No one on board the plane, which landed in Trenton airforce base, showed symptoms of the coronavirus or other illness during the flight, health minister Patty Hajdu told CBC Radio. All evacuees will be quarantined on the base for two weeks, separated from each other in a building that resembles a small hotel, with families kept together. There is growing concern that the new coronavirus may be going undetected in Indonesia, where officials have not confirmed a single case of infection among the 272 million-strong population despite the country\u2019s close links to China, reports Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian\u2019s south-east Asia correspondent. As of Thursday, Indonesia said it had no confirmed cases of the coronavirus and that 238 people evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, had not shown symptoms of the illness, although it said they hadn\u2019t been tested. More than 630 people have been killed by the virus in China, while confirmed infections have passed 30,000 globally. Most cases are concentrated in China, though the virus has been recorded in countries across Asia, as well as Europe, Australia and the US. China is the workshop of the world. It\u2019s where most of the west\u2019s consumer electronics come from. And if you were worried that supplies of digital goods might run out, fear not. The juggernaut of capitalist production continues. Foxconn, the electronics company that supplies Apple, has begun manufacturing its own surgical masks, allowing Chinese workers to churn out iPhones uninterrupted as the coronavirus crisis continues, Rob Davies reports. The Taiwanese company\u2019s production lines have been shut down because of the disruption caused by the outbreak, slowing down the supply chain that feeds Apple\u2019s global retail network. However, in a statement released via the Chinese social media platform WeChat, Foxconn said it hoped to get around the problem by switching some of its own production lines to make masks, for its own staff and to supply the soaring global demand for them. Demand for masks, gowns, gloves and other protective gear has risen by up to 100 times and prices have soared due to the China coronavirus outbreak, producing a \u201csevere\u201d disruption in supply, the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is reported as saying by Reuters. \u201cThis situation is exacerbated by widespread use of personal protective equipment outside patient care,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva, adding that he had spoken to manufacturers and distributors to ensure supplies for those who need them. He also said he could see practices such as hoarding in order to ensure higher prices, and called for solidarity from the public and private sector. The upgrading of the coronavirus alert level in Singapore has sparked panic-buying of essentials in some shops across the island, Reuters reports. Earlier, we reported that the city state had raised its alert level to orange, after three more cases of the illness were diagnosed. According to Reuters: With the disease reviving memories of Sars, which killed more than 30 people in Singapore and hundreds worldwide, shoppers started clearing shelves of toilet paper, noodles and rice, and formed long queues in supermarkets across the island on Friday evening, videos posted on social media showed. Singapore\u2019s trade minister, Chan Chun Sing, said in a Facebook post: I understand that people are concerned after the announcement this afternoon. However, we must ... not hoard items unnecessarily. This will create undue panic and is unhelpful to the situation at hand. This is Damien Gayle taking over the live blog now for the rest of the afternoon (it\u2019s 3.20pm here in London). As usual you can reach me on email at damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via my Twitter profile, @damiengayle The test used to diagnose coronavirus is being rolled out to laboratories across the UK from Monday, increasing testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day. Currently coronavirus is tested and diagnosed in one laboratory in London, but testing will be extended to 12 labs across the country over the coming weeks. At its laboratories in London, Public Health England (PHE) has the capacity to process samples from more than 100 people a day. Now, to ensure that the country is prepared for further cases and to speed up the time taken to get results, the test will be carried out by trained scientists across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This will increase testing capacity to more than 1,000 people a day for England. Prof Yvonne Doyle, PHE\u2019s medical director, said: Once China confirmed that they had identified a novel coronavirus, Public Health England was ready to test potential cases in this country. We have now trained scientists in labs across the UK to conduct the specialist test \u2013 ensuring that we are well prepared should we begin to see an increased number of cases across the country. The test, developed by PHE, made the UK one of the first countries outside China to have assured testing capability for the new coronavirus. When a clinician suspects coronavirus in a patient, they take samples from the nose, throat and deeper respiratory tract and send them for laboratory testing. Using the diagnostic test, scientists can look for evidence of the presence of any type of coronavirus and then hone in on specific genetic clues that identify the novel coronavirus associated with this outbreak. The UK-wide roll-out is the fastest deployment of a new test to PHE and NHS labs in recent history, including in the swine flu pandemic in 2009. In addition to processing samples from suspected cases in the UK, PHE is now working as a reference laboratory for WHO, testing samples from countries that do not have assured testing capabilities. Passengers on a cruise ship that docked in New York City on Friday morning are being tested for the coronavirus, it has been confirmed. An official from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told CNN: There are folks on the ship that have a history of travel to China and so CDC and local health officials are going to board the ship when it docks to do an assessment in port for coronavirus. Video footage showed ambulances and stretchers on standby near the port at Bayonne, and personnel boarding the ship. An earlier post said that the first North Korean case had been confirmed. In fact, the North Korean authorities are yet to confirm the South Korean media report on the development. The original post has now been deleted. You can read more about the situation here. Travellers from China face up to six months in jail and a maximum fine of HK$25,000 (\u00a32,491) for breaching quarantine measures, Hong Kong\u2019s government has announced. At a press conference on Friday, the chief secretary, Matthew Cheung, said the 14-day mandatory quarantine for visitors arriving from mainland China is expected to reduce the number of people crossing the border. People involved in cross-border logistics and workers essential to government services would be exempted from quarantine but monitored closely. From Saturday, people entering the city will be required to sign a document consenting to the quarantine measures, while travellers with visas or permits valid for less than 14 days will be barred from entering Hong Kong. Cheung stressed the quarantine policy would not affect the flow of goods from the mainland. He said: I urge these people, especially those quarantined at home, to have a social conscience and civic responsibility, be cooperative and self-disciplined. Any rule breakers will be breaking the law. One person in Hong Kong has died from coronavirus. Communist party investigators in China are looking into issues raised by the public about a whistleblower doctor who was threatened by police for sharing his concerns about the virus, from which he later died. Following an online uproar over the government\u2019s treatment of Dr Li Wenliang, the ruling Communist party said it was sending a team to fully investigate relevant issues raised by the public regarding the case. Li, 34, was one of eight medical professionals in Wuhan who tried to warn colleagues and others about the new virus. He wrote on Weibo that on 3 December he saw a test sample that indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to Sars, which killed nearly 800 people in a 2002-2003 outbreak. After he reported seven patients had contracted the virus, he said he was visited by police on 3 January, who forced him to sign a statement admitting to spreading falsehoods and warning him of punishment if he continued. Li later developed a cough and fever before he was hospitalised on 12 January and began to have trouble breathing. His death was confirmed on Friday, prompting a deluge of mourning and outrage at the way he and the seven others had been treated. Even the staunchly pro-government Global Times newspaper said the eight whistleblowers\u2019 treatment \u201cwas evidence of local authorities\u2019 incompetence to tackle a contagious and deadly virus\u201d. Most of the deaths from the virus have been of older people with existing health problems, but disease specialists said Li\u2019s work may have increased his exposure and made his illness severe. More fall-out to the spread of the coronavirus outside China as Swedish telecoms giant Ericsson has become the latest firm to pull out of an international conference in Barcelona later this month because of the outbreak. The telecoms equipment manufacturer has withdrawn from the Mobile World Congress in the Spanish city, which is scheduled to take place between 24 and 27 February. It comes after South Korean tech firm LG and Chinese mobile firm ZTE also pulled out. The conference attracts more than 100,000 visitors and has come under increased scrutiny since the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus epidemic a public health emergency of international concern, Reuters reports. There has been only one confirmed coronavirus case in Spain to date. In a statement on the conference\u2019s website, organisers confirmed Ericsson\u2019s decision to withdraw, saying: \u201cWe respect their decision and are reassured by their commitment that they will be at MWC Barcelona 2021 in full force and our rebook trends for next year\u2019s event remain high. Ericsson\u2019s cancellation will have some impact on our presence at this time and will potentially have further impact.\u201d The statement adds: The GSMA continues to monitor and assess the potential impact of the coronavirus on MWC Barcelona 2020 as the health and safety of our exhibitors, attendees and staff are of paramount importance... the GSMA has implemented many measures to help to mitigate the spread of the virus and is continuing to add other actions regularly. In particular, there are extensive additional health measures that have been put in place. A leading UK academic who studies infectious diseases says it is difficult to tell whether the levelling off of coronavirus cases in the past two days is due to an actual decline or just difficulties in recording cases. John Edmunds, professor in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: I think time will tell - it\u2019s now about the time we would expect to see if there is an impact of the interventions they put in place. We would start to see an effect now if it is having an effect. A drop in the number of new coronavirus cases for two days is good news, says the director general of the World Health Organization. However, he cautions against reading too much into it. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the numbers could go up again, but the last two days were showing a declining trend. There were roughly 3,900 new cases reported worldwide on 5 February, 3,700 on 6 February and 3,200 on 7 February - the vast majority in China, WHO figures show. At the Science Media Centre, Paul Hunter, professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: Over the last two days we have actually seen the first of two consecutive declines in the number of new cases, which is nice, but whether that is sustainable or not we will only know in about a week or so. The infection, like most droplet-spread infections, tend to spread more in winter than in summer, so it\u2019s quite plausible that even if the spread does continue, at least in the northern hemisphere we will see a decline during the summer The big question then will be whether it reappears in November as we move into the traditional flu seasons where these sorts of viruses ... tend to predominate. Ghebreyesus also reported that in response to his appeal earlier this week for more countries to share information about the outbreaks in their countries, not all nations had provided the requested information. \u201cThere are some countries who have yet to send detailed case reports to WHO,\u201d he said. \u201cWe urge those member states to share that information immediately.\u201d The third patient to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK is being treated at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in Westminster. The patient is thought to have been diagnosed in Brighton, and brought to St Thomas\u2019, where there is an infectious diseases unit, on Thursday afternoon. The other two patients with the virus in the UK are being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle. None of the patients have been identified, but the first two cases are a University of York student and his mother, who had recently travelled from China. The third patient caught the virus in Singapore, and is thought to be a middle-aged man. A passenger quarantined on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan has described the \u201cgreat amount of fear\u201d he feels awaiting results of his coronavirus test. Spencer Fehrenbacher is travelling with three friends and was alarmed when the ship announced another 41 passengers had tested positive for the virus, bringing the total to 61. He told the BBC: When they made the announcement it was a very scary feeling if I\u2019m being honest. I was tested for the virus about three days ago and I have not yet been told whether my results are positive or negative. There is still the unknown that I could be getting a knock on my door at any moment with the news that I\u2019m being taken off the ship. This is one of the best places I can imagine being quarantined. We feel very fortunate but it is in the midst of a great amount of fear. A British passenger on his honeymoon is among the 41 new coronavirus cases. Alan Steele, from Wolverhampton, has been separated from his new wife, Wendy, and taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. In a Facebook post, he said he is not displaying any symptoms. Fellow British passenger, David Abel, described in a video how he felt when he found out his friend had tested positive for the virus. The child who has been tested for coronavirus at a hospital in Northern Ireland is believed to be less than a year old. The baby and his mother are still being held in isolation at Altnagelvin hospital in Derry city. It is understood the child was admitted yesterday to Altnagelvin\u2019s A&amp;E department, only a few days after returning to Northern Ireland from Hong Kong. A source told Belfast Live: The baby and family were met at the hospital by a fully prepared medical team who were wearing medical hazmat gear and masks. The NHS protocol is in place and the child has been placed in isolation while tests are being carried out. It will take a little time to get the results back which would allow the medical team to actively treat for the virus if the tests are positive. For now the child is undergoing tests and being treated along lines of the protocol and the situation is under control. The world is running out of masks and other gear to protect against the new coronavirus, the World Health Organization has warned. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told the organisation\u2019s executive board in Geneva: We\u2019re sending testing kits, mask, gloves, respirators and gowns to countries in every region. The world is facing a chronic shortage of personal protective equipment. Ghebreyesus added that he will be speaking to the Pandemic Supply Chain Network to identify the bottlenecks, find solutions and \u201cpush with fairness in distribution of equipment\u201d. A woman from China has taken ill at Copenhagen airport, prompting a small area to be cordoned off. The Copenhagen airport press officer Kenni Leth said the woman was transported to hospital by ambulance after arriving from China via Helsinki on Friday morning. The passenger contacted airport staff on arrival and was found to have influenza-like symptoms, leading to fears she could have contracted coronavirus. Leth said: Given that the passenger contacted airport staff with influenza-like symptoms we, in accordance with procedures agreed with authorities, contacted emergency services and the passenger was picked up by ambulance. An area of terminal 3 where the woman contacted staff has been cordoned off and will be sanitised in accordance with procedure. \u201cYou can still easily go to terminal 3 and use most of the terminal. It is not affecting airport traffic,\u201d Leth said. The British luxury fashion brand Burberry said coronavirus was damaging demand for luxury goods in mainland China and Hong Kong. The label said 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China were closed, and remaining stores were operating with reduced hours and with significant declines in footfall. The chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, said: The outbreak of the coronavirus in mainland China is having a material negative effect on luxury demand. While we cannot currently predict how long this situation will last, we remain confident in our strategy. Spending by Chinese tourists in Europe and other locations has been less impacted, but as further travel restrictions are introduced around the globe, the company anticipated the situation would worsen over the coming weeks. Meanwhile Uniqlo will temporarily close about half of its stores in China due to the coronavirus outbreak. A spokesperson for Fast Retailing, the Japanese company that owns Uniqlo, said 370 out of 750 stores had been closed. There is no planned reopening date for the China stores yet, and the company said it was continuing to monitor the situation. Chinese researchers have said the pangolin, an endangered mammal illegally trafficked for its scales and meat, is a potential intermediate host for the coronavirus. \u201cThis latest discovery will be of great significance for the prevention and control of the origin [of the virus],\u201d South China Agricultural University, which led the research, said in a statement on its website. The pangolin is considered the most trafficked animal in the world and an estimated 1 million were smuggled from 2000-13. In January, China ordered a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals until the epidemic was under control. Donald Trump has praised China\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying President Xi Jinping \u201cstrongly leads what will be a very successful operation\u201d. China has previously criticised US restrictions over the outbreak, which include barring entry to most foreign nationals who have visited China in the past two weeks. Hong Kong Airlines is to cut 400 jobs and reduce its operations as coronavirus adds to the company\u2019s financial woes. Reduced travel demand caused by the outbreak has caused the airline to reduce its daily operations from 82 to 30 sectors from 11 February to March. Hong Kong-based ground staff will be asked to take a minimum of two weeks\u2019 unpaid leave a month, or switch to working three days a week between 17 February and 30 June. A spokesman for the airline told Reuters: As uncertainty looms with the evolving nature of this global issue, weak travel demand will likely continue into the summer season and we need to take further action to stay afloat. There has never been a more challenging time in Hong Kong Airlines\u2019 history as of now. These decisions are difficult but had to be made to keep the airline alive. Rival airline Cathay Pacific Airways has also asked employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave to preserve cash, and said the situation caused by the coronavirus outbreak is as severe as the 2009 financial crisis. The British honeymooner who has tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship in Japan is Alan Steele from Wolverhampton, PA Media has reported. He married his wife, Wendy, last month and the couple were celebrating their honeymoon on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is in quarantine. Alan posted on Facebook: Just to let you all know I have been diagnosed as having the virus and am being shipped to hospital. Would also like to say that at the moment I am not showing any symptoms so just possibly a carrier. Will let you know how I am going on when possible. Steele has been separated from his wife and removed from the ship to be treated at a nearby hospital. The Washington Post reported that Wendy was due to celebrate her 52nd birthday on 11 February, and her husband was due to start a new job on 10 February. Singapore is reporting three more coronavirus cases with no links to previous cases or travel history in China. The country moved its disease outbreak response up a level to \u201corange\u201d on Friday as the new cases emerged, according to the Straits Times. This means the outbreak is thought to have moderate to high public health impact. Code orange is one step below red, the most severe category, and this is only the second time it has been activated since the coding system was set up after the Sars outbreak in 2003. It was previously activated for the swine flu outbreak in 2009. The new cases include a 53-year-old man who visited Malaysia in January, a 42-year-old woman who is a teacher at Victoria junior college, and a 39-year-old woman who was also in Malaysia in January. The cases were discovered because hospitals in Singapore had started testing all pneumonia patients for the virus, the health ministry said. The total number of coronavirus cases in Singapore is now 33. Four of these are not connected to previous cases and have no travel connections to China. The health minister, Gan Kim Yong, said at a press conference: We have been preparing for this scenario and we are ready to manage this situation. The key is quick detection and managing the local spread. Art Basel, Asia\u2019s largest annual art fair, has been cancelled due to the outbreak and spread of the coronavirus. The event was scheduled to take place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from 19 to 21 March. Marc Spiegler, Art Basel global director, said: The decision to cancel Art Basel Hong Kong was an extremely difficult one for us. We explored every other possible option before doing so. Unfortunately, the sudden outbreak and rapid spread of the novel coronavirus radically changed the situation. Last year the event, a key date on the global arts calendar, attracted almost 90,000 visitors from over 70 countries. Collector Michael Xufu Huang was reported by CNN as saying: \u201cI could see (the decision) coming. \u201cEven if the virus were to be contained by March ... there\u2019s so much organisation that goes into planning beforehand - shipping, traveling. And with travel restrictions it would be impossible for people in the mainland to go.\u201d Medical workers in Hong Kong demanding the government close all borders with mainland China are voting on whether to extend their five-day strike. The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA), a medical workers\u2019 union, said earlier today it will hold a vote on whether to extend or end the strike. The strike will continue if more than 6,000 members vote in favour of it. Yesterday, more than 6,400 union members went on strike, the HAEA said, and public hospitals have had limited services most of the week. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has introduced mandatory quarantines for travellers coming from mainland China, and closed all but three of the border crossings. A woman in North Korea has become the first person in the country to test positive for the coronavirus, a South Korean newspaper claimed on Friday. The woman, who lives in the capital, Pyongyang, displayed symptoms after returning from a trip to China, the conservative broadsheet the JoongAng Ilbo said, citing an anonymous source in North Korea. The North\u2019s state media has not confirmed any infections. In its most recent update, on 2 February, the state broadcaster said no infections had been confirmed. \u201cAs the chances of coronavirus spreading into North Korea increase, authorities started putting all people who had made overseas trips recently into quarantine for a certain period,\u201d the source was quoted as saying, according to an English translation in the Korea Times. \u201cThe first patient is a woman living in Pyongyang. All people who had contact with her are being quarantined.\u201d The report did not give details of when the woman was diagnosed or her state of health. North Korea has introduced several measures to guard against the disease \u2013 which has affected all of its neighbours \u2013 amid warnings that an epidemic could put an intolerable strain on its poor healthcare infrastructure. It has suspended flights from China and Russia and closed train routes across its borders with those two countries. It has also imposed a ban on foreign tourism and suspended operations at a liaison office it runs with South Korea just north of the demilitarised zone, the heavily armed border dividing the Korean peninsula. The country\u2019s authorities have increased border inspections and health screenings of North Koreans returning from overseas business trips, according to the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers\u2019 party. A British man on his honeymoon is among 41 more passengers to have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship in Japan, taking the total to 61. The man has not been identified but has been removed from the ship and taken to a nearby hospital, according to Japan\u2019s health ministry. The man\u2019s wife will remain onboard the Diamond Princess which is anchored at Yokohama port. In a Facebook video, fellow British passenger David Abel said: 41 additional passengers have been found positive for coronavirus, one of whom is a friend of ours on honeymoon who is going to be split from his wife. He is going to be taken to a medical facility and she is going to remain on board, so that is going to be very very tough indeed. It must be dreadful, I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s going to be like for them. Amnesty International has said the death of whistleblower Chinese doctor Li Wenliang highlights human rights failings in China\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. Li Wenliang was reprimanded by police for \u201cspreading false rumours\u201d after raising alarm over the virus back in December. Nicholas Bequelin, regional director of Amnesty International, said: The case of Li Wenliang is a tragic reminder of how the Chinese authorities\u2019 preoccupation with maintaining \u2018stability\u2019 drives it to suppress vital information about matters of public interest. China must learn the lesson from Li\u2019s case and adopt a rights-respecting approach to combating the epidemic. Nobody should face harassment or sanctions for speaking out about public dangers, just because it may cause embarrassment to the government. Hyundai has suspended operations at its giant Ulsan complex in South Korea, the most productive car factory in the world, due to a lack of parts caused by the coronavirus lock down in China. According to AFP, Hyundai has ran out of the engine wiring harnesses which are imported from China, and closed the factories on Friday. Hyundai said the supplier\u2019s factory had shut down after a worker tested positive for coronavirus. The five-plant network can make 1.4 million vehicles a year, and the closure puts 25,000 workers on forced leave and partial wages. Analysts estimate closing the factory complex for five days, would cost Hyundai - the world\u2019s fifth-largest car manufacturer - at least six hundred billion South Korean won ($500m). Hyundai is not the only car manufacturer being affected by the outbreak. Renault is considering stopping its factory in South Korea next week and Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley also told the FT his firm could be forced to halt one of its European factories over supply shortages. Hyundai operations in South Korea are expected to resume by early next week. It\u2019s Jessica Murray, taking over the live blog from Alison Rourke. I\u2019ll be following the latest developments of the coronavirus outbreak as the number of cases across the world continues to climb. Italy has just confirmed its third case of the virus, after an Italian national tested positive. The first two confirmed cases in the country were Chinese tourists, so this is the first Italian citizen to contract the virus. The patient travelled back from Wuhan last week, and is being treated at Lazzaro Spallanzani Institute, an infectious disease hospital in Rome, a statement said. Like many countries, Italy has seen rise in prejudice and discrimination against Chinese nationals as a result of the virus outbreak. In a video posted by the Chinese-Italian Youth Union, Massimiliano Martigli Jiang takes a silent protest against this discrimination on the streets of Florence, holding a sign that reads: \u201cI am not a virus. I\u2019m a human. Eradicate the prejudice.\u201d The death toll stands at 636 inside China (up 73 on the previous day), one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines Infections inside China stand at 31,161 Global infections have passed 280 in 28 countries There\u2019s been an outpouring of anger and grief over the death of the Chinese doctor, Li Wenliang, who first warned about the virus in December China\u2019s National Supervisory Commission has announced a\u201cfull investigation\u201d into the handling of the death of Dr Li There were 41 new cases on the quarantined cruise liner in the port of Yokohama south of Tokyo, bringing the total diagnosed on the ship to 61 Taiwan, which has 16 cases, banned international cruise ships from docking. The ratings agency S&amp;P slashed its forecast of China\u2019s economic growth for this year by 0.75 percentage points, saying the coronavirus will deliver a big temporary hit to the country\u2019s economy that will spill over to the whole world. Its new growth forecast is 5% Chinese President Xi Jinping assured Donald Trump in a phone call that China is doing all it can to contain the virus. Xi also urged the US to respond reasonably to the virus outbreak, a veiled message over quarantine restrictions in America Canadian and US evacuation flights are due to land back in their respective countries on Friday North Korea confirms first case of virus The Chinese city of Xiaogan, around 70km north-west of Wuhan in Hubei province, has become only the second city in China (after Wuhan) to record more than 2,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The New York Times is reporting on the deteriorating conditions in Wuhan and measures to control the virus, including house-to-house temperature checks, rounding up the sick and mass confinements at quarantine centres. The measures follow the visit of Vice Premier Sun Chunlan to Wuhan on Thursday. She said the country faced \u201cwartime conditions\u201d and \u201cthere must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever\u201d. Two groups of evacuees are set to arrive on Friday at a Canadian air force base from Wuhan. One flight of 176 people is expected in the early hours of Friday morning. A second group of evacuees, who left China on a US flight, should arrive later in the day, after switching planes in Vancouver. All the evacuees will be quarantined on the base, in Trenton, Ontario, for two weeks, separated from each other in a building that resembles a small hotel, with families kept together. China\u2019s National Supervisory Commission, which some on twitter are calling the country\u2019s \u201cmuch-feared disciplinary watchdog\u201d, says it is sending a team to Wuhan to conduct a \u201cfull investigation\u201d into the handling of the death of Dr Li Wenliang, the whistleblower who first raised concerns about the coronavirus in December. Chinese state media reported his death, retracted it and then confirmed it. I mentioned earlier about the anger inside China over the death of the whistleblower doctor in Wuhan, Li Wenliang. You can read our full report on it below: \u2018Hero who told the truth\u2019: Chinese rage over coronavirus death of whistleblower doctor Australia has published its first report on the coronavirus cases in the country. The report, covers the first 12 cases diagnosed up to 1 February (there are now 14 cases in the country). The report says: All twelve cases reported a travel history to China, and 92% (11/12) had a travel history to Wuhan The majority of cases (92%, 11/12) developed mild to moderate symptoms, with one case (8%, 1/12) admitted to intensive care The report says: \u201cClinical care of suspected patients with 2019-nCoV should focus on early recognition, immediate isolation, implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures and provision of optimised supportive care.\u201d You can read the full report here. We\u2019re getting more details on the two US planes with about 300 passengers, mostly American citizens, took off from the Chinese city of Wuhan on Thursday bound for the United States. It\u2019s the third group of evacuees from the city, the US State Department said. One of the flights had room to accommodate more than 60 Canadians, who will disembark on a stopover in Vancouver, British Columbia, before the remaining passengers continue on to the United States, a State Department spokeswoman told Reuters. The plane stopping in Vancouver will fly on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in Southern California, the Pentagon said in a separate statement. The second aircraft is headed for Omaha, Nebraska, by way of Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, following a refuelling stop in California, the Defense Department said. Both planes are due to arrive on Friday. We\u2019re getting more on President Xi Jinping\u2019s phone call with Donald Trump from the Associated Press: China\u2019s official news agency says President Xi Jinping has urged the US to respond reasonably to the virus outbreak in a phone call with President Donald Trump. China\u2019s foreign ministry has previously complained that the US was flying its citizens out of the worst-hit city of Wuhan but not providing any assistance to China. More generally, China has said other countries, many of whom have imposed travel bans or quarantines on travellers from China, should follow WHO recommendations on reacting proportionately to the threat. The New York Times reporter in Hong Kong has just posted a video that sums up the concern in the city about the spread of the coronavirus. The ratings agency S&amp;P has slashed its forecast of China\u2019s economic growth for this year by 0.75 percentage points, saying the coronavirus will deliver a big temporary hit to the country\u2019s economy that will spill over to the whole world. S&amp;P said it now forecast Chinese GDP growth of 5%, down from its previous estimate of 5.7%, but cautioned that it was less confident in its figures than usual because of continuing uncertainty over the severity of the outbreak. This will flow through to the global economy because China accounts for a third of worldwide growth, S&amp;P said. \u201cThe global impact will be felt through four real economy channels: sharply reduced tourism revenues, lower exports of consumer and capital goods, lower commodity prices, and industrial supply-chain disruptions,\u201d it said. \u201cIf the virus cannot be contained, a material risk, the economic impact could develop exponentially with significant credit implications.\u201d The agency said it expected a rebound next year that would make up lost ground, increasing its estimate of 2021 GDP growth from 5.6% to 6.4%. S&amp;P said it expected travel restrictions to ease from next month. Here is a global rundown of the latest figures for cases and deaths reported by health authorities around the world so far. China: 636 deaths and 31,161 confirmed cases on the mainland. In addition, Hong Kong has had one death, and 22 cases. Macao has had 10 cases. Japan: 86 cases Singapore: 30 Thailand: 25 South Korea: 24 Australia: 14 Germany: 13 United States: 12 Taiwan: 16 Malaysia: 14 Vietnam: 12 France: 6 United Arab Emirates: 5 Canada: 6 India: 3 Philippines: 3 cases, including 1 death Russia: 2 Italy: 2 Britain: 3 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Spain: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Reuters has the latest on a phone call between Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, and Donald Trump. It says: The Chinese government has spared no effort in its fight to contain the coronavirus outbreak, having taken the most comprehensive and stringent prevention and containment measures, President Xi Jinping told US President Donald Trump. In its battle against the coronavirus, China is gradually achieving results, Xi told his US counterpart on a phone call on Friday morning, according to state television. China is fully confident and capable of defeating the epidemic, and the long-term trend of the country\u2019s economic development will not change, Xi said. We have been reporting about death in Wuhan of Li Wenliang, the doctor who had tried to raise the alarm about the danger of the virus in December. The 34-year-old became a household name in China, known to hundreds of millions of people as the face and conscience of the spiralling crisis. (You can read our full story about him here.) Li\u2019s initial efforts to raise the alarm about the virus were met by the security forces accusing him of \u201cmaking false comments\u201d. He signed a statement agreeing not to discuss the disease further. The news of his death was muddled by state media, who initially reporting it, then rowed back on their confirmation, only to finally confirm that he died in hospital after having contracted the virus. It\u2019s prompted an outpouring of grief and anger on Chinese social media . Toyota has extended the closure of its 12 factories in China by a week. The Japanese carmaker had planned to reopen its car and component-making plants this weekend but will now keep them shuttered until 16 February \u201cafter considering various factors, including guidelines from local and region governments, parts supply, and logistics\u201d. Officials at the Beijing press conference said they had confidence in the economic system and that the impact on the economy from the outbreak would be \u201ctemporary. It will be limited and will not affect the fundamentals, and the economy is sound and stable\u201d. They added: The outbreak has taken place during the spring festival and the impact on services is notable. The holiday has been extended and the construction sector and other sectors will be affected. There will be an impact on economic performance in Q1 but the economy will return to productivity when the epidemic is over. Look at 2003 Sars outbreak. There was disrupted growth in Q2 but in Q3 it rebounded. When the epidemic is controlled, the economy will rebound and pent-up investment and consumption released. The Chinese econony will have a quick recovery. it is promising and resilient. The funadmentals will not change. There is ample room for macro regulation \u2013 China is one of the few major economies that have normal monetary policy so we have sufficient tools to repsond. Officials also said that the rise in the Chinese stock market since its reopening on Monday proves that it is becoming more mature. The benchmark Shanghai Composite is index lost 8% on Monday but is now off by 4.5% on the week so has regained some ground. Just doubling back on that press conference we have just heard from the Australian PM, Scott Morrison. He has told Australians to get out of China by commercial means if possible and that he cannot guarantee assisted flights out will continue in the future. Australians and immediate family members \u2013 if you are there, then there are still commercial flights coming out of China, mainland China to Australia and I strongly suggest you avail yourself of those. The government cannot guarantee that similar types of assisted flights would be able to be put on in the future either into the mainland or Wuhan On Wednesday, the British government told its citizens \u201cif you are in China and are able to leave, you should do so\u201d. On Thursday, Canada followed suit, telling its citizens who did not have to be in China, that they should get out on commercial flights if possible: \u201cIf your presence in China isn\u2019t essential, you should consider leaving by commercial means,\u201d the advice said. China\u2019s finance ministry has created a special fund of billions of yuan to target lending for companies involved in the manufacture of key medical supplies such as safety goggles, face masks and disinfectant, officials have said at a media conference in Beijing. A list of companies will be drawn up by the government and banks will be expected to hand over cash to them to enable them to keep production flowing. Morrison is asked if he would consider stopping cruise ships coming to Australia, given the infections on the cruise ship that has docked in Japan? \u201cNo. That is not under advice at the moment. No-one has recommended that. But those Australians who are on board that vessel (stuck in Yokohama) and a number of additional cases have been confirmed amongst the Australians on that vessel, which is up in Japan and they are getting consular support. They have been transferred to medical facilities in Japan as the other two were and there are quite a number of other Australians on board this ship that are in quarantine on the vessel.\u201d We are hearing a news conference from the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, on plans for a second evacuation flight from Wuhan. He confirms that the government is looking at a second quarantine facility in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory. The first evacuees were taken to Christmas Island, a former detention centre for refugees and asylum seekers. The site being considered isa a mining camp facility in the NT\u2019s capital city, Darwin. Morrison also has a message for Australians who are still in mainland China \u2013 that they should get out on commercial flights if possible: \u201cAustralians and immediate family members \u2013 if you are there, then there are still commercial flights coming out of China, mainland China to Australia and I strongly suggest you avail yourself of those. The government cannot guarantee that similar types of assisted flights would be able to be put on in the future either into the mainland or Wuhan.\u201d We reported yesterday that clinical trials had begun in China for the drug Remdesivir on coronavirus patients. State media says the first person to receive treatment was a 68-year-old man with serious symptoms in Wuhan\u2019s Jinyintan hospital. More than 750 patients will take part in the trial. The Chinese city of Xiaogan, around 70km north-west of Wuhan in Hubei province, has become only the second city in China (after Wuhan) to record more than 2,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Chinese state media is reporting Beijing\u2019s financial support during the virus outbreak. Hong Kong has cancelled a major a major cultural and business event for the city, amid the virus outbreak. The annual Art Basel Hong Kong, which drew more than 80,000 people last year, had been scheduled to take place on 19-21 March. It\u2019s the latest in a range of cultural, academic and sporting events canceled or postponed in China, Hong Kong and elsewhere because of the outbreak. Hong Kong has reported 22 cases of the virus and has ordered a 14-day quarantine for all travellers entering the city from mainland China from Saturday. On Thursday Hong Kongers faced long queues at some shops as shelves emptied amid concerns over the virus. You can see the South China Morning Post\u2019s front page below. The US State Department said on Thursday that two planes have left Wuhan, China, en route to the United States amid the coronavirus outbreak. The State Department statement did not say how many evacuees were on the flights or where in the United States they were headed. Taiwan and China are embroiled in a new spat over the fate of Taiwanese stranded in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Reuters reports, after Taiwan said one of its citizens sent back on the first flight was infected with coronavirus. Only one flight from China has so far evacuated 247 of the estimated 500 Taiwanese in Wuhan. Beijing has permitted countries from the United States to Japan to send often several flights to Wuhan to collect their nationals. But Taiwan and China have been unable to agree on further flights to take out the Taiwanese. Taiwan\u2019s China policy-making Mainland Affairs Council said the first flight back, on Monday, had one passenger confirmed to be affected and three others who had fevers. All the passengers are now in quarantine in Taiwan. The presence of the sick passenger \u201ccreated a tear in virus prevention\u201d, the council said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThis also caused an overlap infection risk for the people on the same flight, and if there are even more infected people caused by this then the serious consequences don\u2019t bear thinking about.\u201d China should be prioritising the elderly, the young and other vulnerable groups amongst the Taiwanese and those only on short-term visits to Wuhan to send back first, but China ignored this request when it returned the first batch, it added. China has said Taiwan should not be putting up obstacles to evacuate the Taiwanese, and further planned evacuation flights this week had been put off due to Taipei blocking them. \u201cSome people in Taiwan had been bad-mouthing arrangements for the homecoming of Taiwan compatriots, which has fully exposed the vile nature of their ignoring of the Taiwan compatriots\u2019 interests,\u201d China\u2019s Taiwan affairs office said late on Thursday. Taiwan should stop its \u201cpolitical games\u201d and let the flights resume, it added. Taiwan and China are already at loggerheads over the handling of the virus outbreak, especially over Taiwan\u2019s exclusion from the World Health Organization (WHO). Taiwan has 16 cases of the virus. Here are the nationalities of the newly diagnosed passengers onboard the Diamond Princess: 21 from Japan, eight from the US, five from Australia, five from Canada, one from Argentina and one from Britain. Japanese health officials said that none of the newly diagnosed patients was displaying severe symptoms of the virus. Johns Hopkins University has put those updated figures from China into its virus tracker. Let\u2019s have a look at those figures from China\u2019s National Health Commission in a little more detail. The vast number of new cases are in Hubei again. Of 3,143 new cases announced, 2,447 were from Hubei province Of the 73 new deaths, 69 were in Hubei But perhaps the more interesting figures are the suspected cases and their location. On Friday the NHC said there are 4,833 new suspected cases and, of that, 2,622, or 54% of those new cases, are in Hubei province \u2013 the centre of the infection. The commission has given this comparison figure each day since last Saturday (previously it was just a national suspected cases figure). Here\u2019s what they showed: Friday: 4,833 suspected cases; 2,622 or 54% in Hubei Thursday: 5,328 suspected cases; 3,230 or 60% in Hubei Wednesday: 3,971 suspected cases; 1957 or 49% in Hubei Tuesday: 5,072 suspected cases; 3,182 or 63% in Hubei Monday: 5,173 suspected cases; 3,260 or 70% in Hubei Sunday: 4,562 suspected cases; 2,606 or 57% in Hubei Another 41 people quarantined aboard a cruise liner off the coast of Japan have tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected passengers to 61. The dramatic jump in fresh cases follows 10 positive diagnoses among Diamond Princess passengers on Wednesday, and a further 10 on Thursday. The new cases were among 171 remaining test results. The results of all 273 tests have now been confirmed. About 3,700 passengers and crew are aboard the ship, but tests were conducted only on people who displayed symptoms or had been in close contact with a Hong Kong man who tested positive after leaving the ship at the end of last month. Twenty-one of the 41 patients are Japanese, the health minister, Katsunobu Kato, told reporters on Friday. The nationalities of the remaining passengers were not immediately available. The age range of the newly diagnosed patients suggests that older passengers are particularly vulnerable. The new cases include three people in their 20s to 40s, three in their 50s, eight in their 60s, 21 in their 70s and six in their 80s, Kato said. The health ministry said the patients would be transferred to hospitals in Tokyo and several other prefectures, according to public broadcaster NHK. Australia\u2019s ABC TV is talking to their reporter on the scene where the Diamond Princess is docked. He says some people onboard the ship have been let out of their rooms for short times, but there are others who he believes are still confined to their room.s Another 41 passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise liner moored in the Japanese port of Yokohama have been diagnosed with coronavirus. This brings the total on the ship to 61. By my calculations also raises Japan\u2019s number of confirmed infections to 86. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, with me, Alison Rourke. The Chinese Health Commission has just released its latest figures for deaths and infections. The headline figures are 636 deaths and more than 31,000 confirmed infections. I\u2019ll bring you some analysis of the figures shortly, but the other key points so far are: Japanese media reports another 41 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed on the stricken cruise ship in Yokohama, bringing the total to 61 The doctor who tried to raise the alarm about the virus in its early days, has died after becoming infected President Xi has declared a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d on the virus and warned of its global impact on business Singapore has said it will evacuate its citizens from Wuhan New cases have been reported in Germany, Italy and Britain You can stay up-to-date on all of our coronavirus outbreak coverage here, including our latest comment pieces: Small US businesses are falling victim to the coronavirus too China\u2019s response to coronavirus exposes a dangerous obsession with secrecy",

      "bodyText": "The stricken department store chain Beales is to close more than half its shops in the latest blow to the UK\u2019s struggling high streets. The Bournemouth-based retailer collapsed into administration last month, and on Friday it was announced that 12 of its 23 stores would close. The company, which began trading in Bournemouth in 1881, has about 1,300 employees. KPMG, the advisory firm handling the administration, said it was in active discussions with interested parties but there was no buyer for the whole chain. As a result, it was drafting a closure plan for a dozen stores, which would affect about 500 staff. The units on the list include Beales\u2019 flagship store in Bournemouth. The administrators said stores earmarked for closure would continue to trade, with closing-down sales for about eight weeks. Staff would be retained to help with trading over the coming weeks, KPMG said. Beales is the latest victim of the high street downturn that has forced a wave of closures. Its rivals Debenhams and House of Fraser have undergone an emergency financial restructuring, while in recent weeks Mothercare and the toy chain Hawkins Bazaar have closed their UK stores. Beales was opened by John Elmes Beale under the name Fancy Fair and Oriental House, selling products and novelties that reflected the growing enthusiasm for Chinese and Japanese design. The original store was bombed in the second world war but rebuilt on the same site on Old Christchurch Road, Bournemouth. In the 1990s, the chain floated on the stock exchange before returning to private ownership. It expanded to 23 department stores, from the Lake District to Norfolk and the home counties, selling furniture, fashion, toys and cosmetics.

One man\u2019s death exemplifies them. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\" title=\"\">Li Wenliang</a> warned fellow doctors of his concern about a spate of unusual pneumonia cases early in the outbreak \u2013 only to be silenced by police. His death sparked fury, itself swiftly censored.</p> <p>Similar surges of public anger have been seen over issues including shoddily built schools, toxic baby formula and a high-speed train crash. Each time, the rage reflected deeper concerns about the role of corruption and cover-ups \u2013 and, after a brief flurry of openness, it was suppressed. While authorities have warned officials not to conceal coronavirus cases, censorship of courageous Chinese reporters and social media is tightening. Yet the outbreak continues to unfold, and it directly affects people across the country, emotionally and economically if not physically. There are growing questions about national authorities. Some believe that Xi Jinping\u2019s centralisation of power, and valuing of ideology over technocracy, has degraded local competence and exacerbated the urge to suppress bad news. That Dr Li was punished for a private message to other doctors shows how far the space for discussion has shrunk.</p> <p>China\u2019s measures are draconian, and their effectiveness has yet to be seen, though the WHO cautiously welcomed an apparent drop in new cases in recent days. Other places have taken dramatic steps too, including closing borders to travellers from China. Though experts focus on hygiene measures, some think movement controls may help to buy scientists and doctors time. To deal with uncertainty and nuance is hard. But it is necessary if we are to act humanely and sensibly. What is needed is the best response, not the toughest: scalpels rather than hammers.</p>",

But this time, while the state has made a great show of constructing brand new hospitals, the city lacks medical staff and basic protective gear. The sick are being herded into quarantine centres where minimal care is available. The anger has spread beyond Wuhan to the broader Chinese population as the full, shocking scale of failures by local officials has become clearer. One man\u2019s death exemplifies them. Li Wenliang warned fellow doctors of his concern about a spate of unusual pneumonia cases early in the outbreak \u2013 only to be silenced by police. His death sparked fury, itself swiftly censored. Similar surges of public anger have been seen over issues including shoddily built schools, toxic baby formula and a high-speed train crash. Each time, the rage reflected deeper concerns about the role of corruption and cover-ups \u2013 and, after a brief flurry of openness, it was suppressed. While authorities have warned officials not to conceal coronavirus cases, censorship of courageous Chinese reporters and social media is tightening. Yet the outbreak continues to unfold, and it directly affects people across the country, emotionally and economically if not physically. There are growing questions about national authorities. Some believe that Xi Jinping\u2019s centralisation of power, and valuing of ideology over technocracy, has degraded local competence and exacerbated the urge to suppress bad news. That Dr Li was punished for a private message to other doctors shows how far the space for discussion has shrunk. China\u2019s measures are draconian, and their effectiveness has yet to be seen, though the WHO cautiously welcomed an apparent drop in new cases in recent days. Other places have taken dramatic steps too, including closing borders to travellers from China. Though experts focus on hygiene measures, some think movement controls may help to buy scientists and doctors time. To deal with uncertainty and nuance is hard. But it is necessary if we are to act humanely and sensibly. What is needed is the best response, not the toughest: scalpels rather than hammers.",

      "body": "<p>Several of the playwrights who transformed British theatre in the 1960s in the wake of John Osborne had experience in the armed services and the old days of repertory theatre. Charles Wood, who has died aged 87, was one of them, with this difference: he was a professional soldier for five years whereas others \u2013 Peter Nichols, Peter Barnes, Michael Frayn \u2013 did national service.</p> <p>Wood served as a corporal in the 17th/21st Lancers between 1950 and 1955 before leaving to work in the theatre as a stagehand and scenic artist, and on the Bristol Evening Post between 1959 and 1962 as an advertising copy artist \u2013 alongside Tom Stoppard as a reporter and feature writer. But if he had achieved promotion he might have stayed in the army.</p> <p>Much of his work, from his earliest plays through to the TV drama film <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/falklands-war-25-years-on-tumbledown-revisited-434024.html\" title=\"\">Tumbledown</a> (1988), directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/richard-eyre-king-lear-anthony-hopkins-national-theatre-depression\" title=\"\">Richard Eyre</a> and starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/colin-firth\" title=\"\">Colin Firth</a> as a wounded, disillusioned veteran of the Falklands war, reveals an acrid ambivalence about the military life. There is a speech delivered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/dec/05/guardianobituaries.film\" title=\"\">David Hemmings</a> in Wood\u2019s screenplay for Tony Richardson\u2019s The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968) which describes a thin line, as Wood saw it, between the job of a soldier and that of a murderer.</p> <p>For Wood, a tall, gentle and inherently private man, loved soldiering \u2013 he was a keen student of military history \u2013 but hated war and the politicians who waged it. The language of these scripts is marked by a startling, passionate intensity as much as by a fantastic mix of historical idiom, barrack room slang and barbaric crudity.</p> <p>You get a sense of this in the three episodes he wrote in the 90s for the television series Sharpe, starring Sean Bean as a soldier in the 95th Rifles during the Napoleonic wars, at the siege of Badajoz in 1812, in the England of 1813 and at the battle of Waterloo in 1815.</p> <p>But the bitter ferocity of his style is best demonstrated in a portrait of two privates at the western front in 1943 in Dingo (1967), a play commissioned by the National Theatre and quietly dropped after being refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain before surfacing as a club performance at the Royal Court. While Dingo, the professional soldier, loses faith in his mission, his mate Mogg, a civilian recruit, goes bayonet-thrusting through the enemy to a position of power.</p> <p>The army gave Wood, the eldest of four siblings, the stable family life he never had as a child. He was born in St Peter Port, Guernsey, where his parents, Jack Wood and Mae Harris, were on tour. They were both actors, while Jack was also a manager who toured during the war with Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud. Their lost world of fit-up companies in small-town rep was celebrated in his 1967 play Fill the Stage With Happy Hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c05a7836620b2be7354827369a10b460e711aad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c05a7836620b2be7354827369a10b460e711aad/7_90_704_880/400.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Wood was a proud member of John Osborne\u2019s \u2018British Playwrights\u2019 Mafia\u2019 years after it had been disbanded.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Wood was a proud member of John Osborne\u2019s \u2018British Playwrights\u2019 Mafia\u2019 years after it had been disbanded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Charles settled later in his wife\u2019s home city of Bristol, he was educated first at the grammar school in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, where his family lived for several years, and at King Charles I school, Kidderminster, Worcestershire, before training as a graphic artist at Birmingham College of Art.

      "bodyText": "Several of the playwrights who transformed British theatre in the 1960s in the wake of John Osborne had experience in the armed services and the old days of repertory theatre. Charles Wood, who has died aged 87, was one of them, with this difference: he was a professional soldier for five years whereas others \u2013 Peter Nichols, Peter Barnes, Michael Frayn \u2013 did national service. Wood served as a corporal in the 17th/21st Lancers between 1950 and 1955 before leaving to work in the theatre as a stagehand and scenic artist, and on the Bristol Evening Post between 1959 and 1962 as an advertising copy artist \u2013 alongside Tom Stoppard as a reporter and feature writer. But if he had achieved promotion he might have stayed in the army. Much of his work, from his earliest plays through to the TV drama film Tumbledown (1988), directed by Richard Eyre and starring Colin Firth as a wounded, disillusioned veteran of the Falklands war, reveals an acrid ambivalence about the military life. There is a speech delivered by David Hemmings in Wood\u2019s screenplay for Tony Richardson\u2019s The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968) which describes a thin line, as Wood saw it, between the job of a soldier and that of a murderer. For Wood, a tall, gentle and inherently private man, loved soldiering \u2013 he was a keen student of military history \u2013 but hated war and the politicians who waged it. The language of these scripts is marked by a startling, passionate intensity as much as by a fantastic mix of historical idiom, barrack room slang and barbaric crudity. You get a sense of this in the three episodes he wrote in the 90s for the television series Sharpe, starring Sean Bean as a soldier in the 95th Rifles during the Napoleonic wars, at the siege of Badajoz in 1812, in the England of 1813 and at the battle of Waterloo in 1815. But the bitter ferocity of his style is best demonstrated in a portrait of two privates at the western front in 1943 in Dingo (1967), a play commissioned by the National Theatre and quietly dropped after being refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain before surfacing as a club performance at the Royal Court. While Dingo, the professional soldier, loses faith in his mission, his mate Mogg, a civilian recruit, goes bayonet-thrusting through the enemy to a position of power. The army gave Wood, the eldest of four siblings, the stable family life he never had as a child. He was born in St Peter Port, Guernsey, where his parents, Jack Wood and Mae Harris, were on tour. They were both actors, while Jack was also a manager who toured during the war with Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud. Their lost world of fit-up companies in small-town rep was celebrated in his 1967 play Fill the Stage With Happy Hours. Although Charles settled later in his wife\u2019s home city of Bristol, he was educated first at the grammar school in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, where his family lived for several years, and at King Charles I school, Kidderminster, Worcestershire, before training as a graphic artist at Birmingham College of Art. His trio of short plays, Cockade (1963), at the Arts theatre in the West End, won him the Evening Standard\u2019s most promising playwright award, the first of them, Prisoner and Escort, having been heard on radio in 1961, then televised. Wood established himself in the 60s, first at the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he contributed to Peter Brook\u2019s controversial anti-war play, US, then at the National with \u201cH\u201d Or Monologues at Front of Burning Cities (1969), a historical pageant anatomising Sir Henry Havelock\u2019s campaign during the Indian mutiny of 1857. And he started on his collaborations with the film director Richard Lester. He provided blackly comic and satirical screenplays for Lester\u2019s The Knack \u2026 and How to Get It (1965), adapted from Ann Jellicoe\u2019s stage play; Help! (1965), with the Beatles at their zaniest and most frenetic; How I Won the War (1967), with John Lennon and Michael Crawford, an adaptation of a novel by Patrick Ryan; and a script of Spike Milligan and John Antrobus\u2019s The Bed Sitting Room (1969), with a cast including Milligan, Ralph Richardson, Marty Feldman, Arthur Lowe, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Wood created theatre based on the cinema of war in Veterans (1972) \u2013 an Evening Standard best play \u2013 at the Royal Court, with Gielgud and Bob Hoskins. The play was set on location for The Charge of the Light Brigade, with Gielgud playing himself, more or less. Jingo (1975) at the RSC, subtitled \u201ca farce of war\u201d, signalled the end of British domination in east Asia at the fall of Singapore, while Has \u201cWashington\u201d Legs? (1978) at the National featured a double act by Albert Finney and Robert Stephens in a scabrous contribution to the US bicentennial celebrations. Working solidly, and often autobiographically, in television through the 70s, he conjured his progress from grammar school to the army in the three-part Death or Glory Boy (1974) and created a wonderful role of a \u201cblocked\u201d and under-appreciated writer, George Maple, for George Cole in the 1977 and 1979 sitcom series Don\u2019t Forget to Write! A fifth film with Lester, Cuba (1979), a tale of romance and revolution, featured one of Sean Connery\u2019s finest performances, as a British security adviser during the last weeks of the Batista regime. With the advent of Channel 4, Wood wrote screenplays for Tony Palmer\u2019s Wagner (1983), starring Richard Burton with, uniquely, Olivier, Gielgud and Richardson together at once on screen, and Puccini (1984), with a smouldering Robert Stephens as the composer caught in an adulterous net between the restless compositions of The Girl of the Golden West and a cathartic Turandot. A third film with Palmer, England, My England (1995), celebrated the Henry Purcell tercentenary and was a debt of honour to John Osborne, who was too ill to complete a screenplay; conceived in two time zones, this quirky, original film starred Simon Callow as King Charles in the 17th century and an Osborne-esque playwright in the 20th. Wood had formed a great friendship with Lester, as he did with Palmer and then with Eyre \u2013 who had directed Fill the Stage during his time at the Nottingham Playhouse \u2013 on Tumbledown. He continued to work with Eyre on the 2001 film Iris, with Judi Dench as Iris Murdoch losing her mind, but not her love for Jim Broadbent\u2019s John Bayley and, less successfully, a romantic thriller, The Other Man (2008), starring Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Antonio Banderas.

She is so explosive on Mythic Quest that the show often seems as if it\u2019s hers and hers alone. We\u2019ll be hearing a lot more from her, I\u2019m certain. And hopefully on Mythic Quest. For a show to shake off a potentially ropey premise and become something as confident as powerful as this is incredible. It isn\u2019t the new Silicon Valley. It isn\u2019t an Always Sunny offshoot. It\u2019s its own fully formed beast, and I want more of it.",

More than 4,000 miles to the south, at the heart of Brazil\u2019s very own political swamp, Bolsonaro sat down to watch \u2013 filming himself viewing Trump\u2019s entire hour-long address and offering the occasional aside to the camera, hailing his North American hero or berating foes in politics and the press. \u201cWe\u2019re not the only ones with backstabbers in politics,\u201d Bolsonaro sniped of Mitt Romney\u2019s decision to vote against Trump in the impeachment trial. \u201cThey\u2019ve found a Republican rat too.\u201d Critics have derided Bolsonaro\u2019s Trumpian transmissions \u2013 the latest of which lasted 73 minutes \u2013 as an obsequious waste of presidential time. \u201cIt\u2019s pitiful,\u201d complained Lob\u00e3o, a Brazilian rock star who voted for Bolsonaro in 2018 but has since become one of his harshest critics. Lob\u00e3o said he was perplexed by Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201camorous incontinence\u201d towards Trump. How, the musician wondered, could Brazil\u2019s president express such \u201csnivelling, doormat like adoration\u201d of a US leader while simultaneously being a hardline nationalist? The leftwing senator Humberto Costa warned Brazilians would pay a high price for Bolsonaro\u2019s fandom. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to be a doormat. One must show oneself to be a doormat,\u201d Costa tweeted. But Brian Winter, the editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly, saw method in what many call kowtowing. \u201cI actually think this is serious and effective political messaging. Listening to Trump sends a strong symbolic message to Bolsonaro\u2019s base that he is also leading the country away from socialism. \u201cA lot of Brazilians look at it and see boot-licking and betrayal of national sovereignty. But at least a third of the country looks at it and understands what he means and is pretty happy with it,\u201d Winter added. \u201cIn the minds of Bolsonaro followers, the US means capitalism, prosperity and public safety \u2013 the ability to have a gun, a growing economy. I think it\u2019s really effective with his base.\u201d In Thursday\u2019s broadcast, Bolsonaro berated those who accuse him of brown-nosing. \u201cSome people criticize me: \u2018Look at him, licking Trump\u2019s boots,\u2019\u201d he said, adding: \u201cLook, you idiot, when they were sucking up to Maduro, Ch\u00e1vez and Fidel Castro you didn\u2019t say anything, did you? \u201cI\u2019m not worried about this,\u201d the rightwing populist added. \u201cIf people want to criticize, that\u2019s their right. But make it thoughtful, constructive criticism. Don\u2019t just try to do the US president and me down.\u201d Critics are not just from Brazil\u2019s left. Winter said many senior military figures were uncomfortable with Bolsonaro\u2019s courtship of Trump. \u201cI know for a fact the armed forces don\u2019t like this symbolism because they are loyal to Brazil first, and Bolsonaro second. I\u2019ve spoken with many generals who hate the fact that he\u2019s out there saluting the American flag.\u201d But Winter suspected the live streams \u2013 which many believe are the brainchild of Bolsonaro\u2019s politician son Eduardo, Steve Bannon\u2019s representative in South America \u2013 would continue and that Trump would approve. \u201cI know \u2026 from people in the administration that Trump loves having an acolyte in any part of the world \u2013 but especially in a large, relevant country like Brazil. It appeals to his ego \u2013 and we know how important that is.\u201d",

Of course, with a sport like cricket, there is always an issue that the roof wouldn\u2019t be high enough to prevent the ball hitting it, which would impact the game.\u201d</p> <p>Before he goes on, if you want about 500 takes on this, I\u2019ll point you to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jun/13/india-v-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-2019-live\">our OBO from the rained out India v New Zealand fixture during the World Cup.</a> Also, there\u2019s our <a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-final-word-cricket-podcast/world-cup-daily-day-12\">Final Word daily pod</a> from one of those sodden afternoons... after a lot of consideration, we landed on a shadecloth in space held up by drones. <br></p> <p>Back to Adam... <br></p> <p>\u201cSo, I crunched the numbers. The fastest ball ever bowled (by one Mr. Akhtar) was clocked at 161km/h, which roughly equates to 45m/s. Assuming that the impact of bat on ball (considering energy lost through sound, heat, kinetic energy dissipated through the bat etc) can add at most at 50% of the incident velocity to the ball, this gives us 67.5m/s as a maximum ball speed off the willow. Using the equations for Kinetic Energy and Gravitational Potential Energy, and assuming 20% of energy lost to air resistance, this would give the ball a maximum possible height off the bat of 181m if it went straight up. Adding a safety factor to balance out the assumptions made, if a blimp were to hang a large cover 200m above the pitch, rain delays would be a thing of the past, and the height of the cover above the pitch would prevent it obstructing the floodlights, thus enabling the continuation of the spectacle that is a day/night match.\u201d</p> <p>A blimp!

The 12-team Test tournament would be organised into two round-robin groups of six, with semi-finals and a final. The finalists would therefore play seven matches, which is easily doable within the seven-week span of the 2019 World Cup. That way everyone can play as much or as little bilateral cricket as they like, with a world championship of some sort to fight for every year.\u201d</p> <p>In reality, the WTC is isn\u2019t going to shift far from what we have at the moment. But I\u2019m increasingly persuaded by white-ball World Cups every other year argument. <br></p> <p>Smylers on email informs me that England haven\u2019t yet formally made the women tri-series final. Either way, it\u2019s the perfect prep and a benefit of being Big Three. <br></p> <p>On women\u2019s cricket too is Frank Morrish. \u201cWe hear a lot about Women\u2019s T20 games, which is undoubtedly a good thing. I\u2019ve always wondered, though, why don\u2019t women play test matches/so few test matches? In my opinion it\u2019s the superior game format - would like to see women play it too.\u201d</p> <p>A long and complicated story! Summed up in a sentence: scarce funds across the women\u2019s cricket world, so only a few countries can afford the investment. Also, a lack of red-ball/multiday action at domestic level. I can\u2019t see it changing, sadly.</p> <p>And one final email on 1966 (and all that) before I politely close the book on the topic, coming in from Steven Larcombe. \u201cWhen I lived in Germany, if the ball hit the bar, friends would turn to me and say, \u2018ah, in England, that\u2019s a goal, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6388c6c56f2dfd3cc216f1081fd82ac962b1f21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6388c6c56f2dfd3cc216f1081fd82ac962b1f21/0_0_2700_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We have action on the pitch with a traditional Zulu welcome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We have action on the pitch with a traditional Zulu welcome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Franks/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-07T12:40:59.373Z\">at 12.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3d55da8f08e1332473ee87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-07T12:23:44.029Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Quinton de Kock would have bowled too.</strong> The home skipper believes the wicket will be slow after the time under covers.

It\u2019s been associated with VAR because it often gets checked in that way and came in at the same time in this country, but it\u2019s a separate rule.

It should be possible to devise a meaningful T20 sequence between countries all year round, with either points or straight knockouts, to allow quarter-finals, semi-finals and final in October or November. This would have the added benefit of giving more meaning to all the current 3-match series going on already. There could be a three-series minimum to qualify. OK, now and again the finals could be in September to give GB the chance to host them, but it\u2019s a better prospect than a Test World Championship, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>I think it is mostly to do with concentrated tournament play. Even take the dearly departed Champions Trophy: when it was on, we are cared quite a bit. Remember too that T20 World Cups were held every other year until the current cycle and worked reasonably well given how infrequently T20Is were being played. Of course, that\u2019s why the women have stuck with that pattern and it works well. </p> <p>I don\u2019t want to bring the WTC into this necessarily but I would say that it is very fashionable to beat up on it now that we have it, however insufficient/quirky in this initial iteration. Until now, the stronger complaints were that bilateral series alone - without a central organising structure - were leaving Test cricket short. <br></p> <p>For mine, there\u2019s a good fix for the WTC when they revamp in 2023 for cycle three. In short: make every series three Tests and permit four-day fixtures to be played if it means getting to that minimum of three. This wouldn\u2019t preclude the Big Three playing longer series or five-day Tests; the Ashes won\u2019t be diminished by having two Tests that don\u2019t count for points. But it would make all WTC Tests equal. I\u2019d also insist on every country playing each other. Yes, that requires a compromise between India and Pakistan, but if we were in a perfect cricketing world.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3d4bd38f086a28115a7565\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-07T11:40:47.970Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u201cHi Adam.\u201d G\u2019day, Phil Russell.</strong> \u201c\u2018Fun\u2019 fact - England are the only country to have won a men\u2019s World Cup Final in Football, Rugby and Cricket, and every time they needed extra time to do it!\u201d Okay, there\u2019s an essay in this as well! <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheCricketGeek/status/1225745326608461824\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are in for &quot;one of those days&quot; in Durban where the &quot;hardworking groundstaff&#39;s best efforts&quot; will be the star in any match reports that actually get filed.</p>&mdash; Peter Miller (@TheCricketGeek) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheCricketGeek/status/1225745326608461824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 7, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3d49cf8f086a28115a754d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-07T11:30:10.767Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The covers are back on</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sorry, I tempted fate talking about toss times and so on, didn\u2019t I?

The bad news off the top: it is raining in Durban. With the TV coverage yet to start, I\u2019m not sure what we are talking about exactly, but twitter is hinting at a delayed start. The forecast isn\u2019t crash hot either, to level with you. But don\u2019t let than dampen your enthusiasm for the OBO - we all know that our rain chats are some of the best. </p> <p>If they play, the task ahead of England is levelling the series after losing the opener on Tuesday. We learned more about the home side in victory than the visitors in defeat, racing away to a comfortable victory with Quinton de Kock saluting for a century at the first time of asking since taking over as skipper.</p> <p>It was the first limited-overs international for the world champions since they held the trophy aloft on that famous day at Lord\u2019s last July, although the XI that played that day barely resembles the side out there this week. Plenty of those frontline white-ball stars (not least a couple of handy blokes called Stokes and Buttler) are having a breather while Archer\u2019s elbow - we have learned since the previous fixture - requires plenty of rehab before he bowls again. <br></p> <p>Righto, I\u2019m <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com\">looking forward to your company throughout,</a> rain or otherwise! <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-07T10:22:35.988Z\">at 10.22am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

England can\u2019t win the series, but they can level it in the third and final ODI at Jo\u2019burg on Sunday (10am local, 8am in the UK). England leave Durban empty-handed, apart from one tiny moral victory: their wily old captain, Eoin Morgan, outwitted his brand-new counterpart, Quinton de Kock, by bringing on Joe Root\u2019s non-turning off-breaks for the sixth over. But the South Africans can be satisfied with the way Reeza Hendricks played, timing and placing the ball beautifully, come rain or shine. Thanks for your correspondence and your company. It\u2019s been a non-event on the field, but a red-letter day for the OBO: the day we were asked for relationship advice (16:07). Sarah and John, we dedicate this soggy, stop-start OBO to you, and hope that, even in the gloom, sparks fly. Match abandoned, alas. If they\u2019re not back on by 7.22pm local time (5.22 in the UK), it\u2019s game over. In the unlikely event that they are on by then, it\u2019ll be a T20, which will be tough on South Africa, who spent the first half an hour of their innings, many moons ago, playing 50-over cricket. The England players are still out there. Chris Woakes is giving autographs, presumably scribbling \u201cLiam Plunkett\u201d. This could be curtains. \u201cAnonymous (\u2019s friend) is emailing the OBO for dating advice?\u201d says Robin Hazlehurst. \u201cWow! No really, wow, having met several OBO followers on OBOccasionals tours, I can safely say she doesn\u2019t want to be doing that! Or at least she doesn\u2019t want to be following any resulting advice.\u201d As Bavuma departs, so does everyone else \u2013 except the England players, who are lingering out there in light drizzle with their \u201cwhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d face on. Chris Jordan comes on, pins Bavuma in front, the appeal is turned down but Jonny Bairstow persuades Morgan to review.... And it\u2019s hitting leg! 11th over: South Africa 70-1 (Hendricks 35, Bavuma 21) Bavuma is so good at this that you wonder how on earth he is only playing his fourth ODI at the age of 29. He uses his feet to dance down the track and chip Parkinson for four, before dancing back to late-cut for a single that was worth four more. He has 21 off only 16 balls. 10th over: South Africa 61-1 (Hendricks 32, Bavuma 15) Bavuma tries to launch Tom Curran again, but he hasn\u2019t spotted the back-of-the-hand slower ball, so it\u2019s three rather than six. 9th over: South Africa 54-1 (Hendricks 29, Bavuma 11) Eoin Morgan, who is never fazed, brings on Matt Parkinson, whose legspin didn\u2019t go well on debut the other day. His first over goes for six, which is respectable. And it\u2019s raining, raining in my heart. 8th over: South Africa 48-1 (Hendricks 25, Bavuma 10) Temba Bavuma answers my question: slap in the middle of this over. After three dots, Bavuma goes big, whipping Tom Curran over square leg for the first six of the day. Curran, unfazed, recovers well with two more dots and an LBW shout, but it\u2019s going down. 7th over: South Africa 42-1 (Hendricks 25, Bavuma 4) SA just carry on where they left off, Hendricks timing it, Bavuma being busy. It\u2019ll be interesting to see when they start slogging. Chris Woakes has an over to finish. His beard, grown for the Test series, now looks like a tribute to Liam Plunkett, who was harshly ditched by England after helping to win the World Cup. \u201cSarah\u2019s problem? [16:07] Easy,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cThey both agree to \u2018follow\u2019 the cricket and see what kind of issues they can come up with to while away the rainy times. Assign points for inventiveness and irrelevance. If the OBO can do it, why not them?\u201d \u201cToto,\u201d says Robin Hazlehurst. \u201cRob Allen blames David Attenborough for this, but I blame the rains down in Africa. We\u2019re not in Kansas any more.\u201d Play will start in... FOUR MINUTES. It will be a 26-over game, not T20. Aleem Dar must be an optimist. \u201cIt\u2019s actually not that wet,\u201d says Rob Key. \u201cWe\u2019ve got quite an exciting game here, if the rain stays away.\u201d Here\u2019s an intriguing email (not that the rest weren\u2019t). \u201cSo,\u201d writes Anonymous, \u201cthere\u2019s a girl \u2013 let\u2019s just call her Sarah, who has been \u2018chatting\u2019 (a la Love Island) to a boy \u2013 we can call him John. Things were going well, but were moving into \u2018pen pal\u2019 territory even though they both lived in the same city and John had initially mentioned meeting up, but had never really followed up with anything concrete. \u201cSarah read between the lines, so threw out a \u2018let\u2019s take the pressure off and try being friends\u2019 vibe and they agreed this was a good plan, and he suggested an afternoon watching the cricket would be a good way to kick off the friendship as they both really love the sport \u2013 and met through it. \u201cThat afternoon was today. And there\u2019s no cricket. Soooo\u2026. do we assume that no cricket = no \u2018mate date\u2019? Or is there still grounds for a catch-up, even if the bonding element isn\u2019t there? Sarah started the chat last time, so won\u2019t initiate this time \u2013 annoying, but Sarah has standards (so she tells me\u2026). What are we saying? Abandon match or give the partnership time to develop in another session?\u201d Give it time! And don\u2019t worry about any lack of action. \u201cAbout S Sub,\u201d says Rob Lewis. \u201cRaman Subba Row? Still alive and kicking and living in Streatham, aged 88.\u201d They don\u2019t make careers like that any more: retired at 29, with a Test average of 46, to become a PR man, of all things. Though he reappeared later as a match referee, which may have been a hint that he rather missed it all. \u201cIf Reeza Hendricks continues as he\u2019s started,\u201d says Romeo, \u201che could go on to have as successful a career as an almost-namesake musical legend. Eddie Kendricks. Or it could be just my imagination running away with me.\u201d \u201cI blame David Attenborough for this disappointment,\u201d says Rob Allen. \u201cAccording to every African wildlife documentary of his I watched as a kid, there was a rule. It only rains right at the end of the programme, when the animals have stared mournfully at a muddy pool for a good 15 minutes. But no, here it is just falling out the sky willy-nilly, with no sense of drama or timing. Tsk.\u201d Ha. Does it count if there are reporters staring mournfully at a soggy pitch for 215 minutes? The umpires are out there, resplendent in red. But the outfield is \u201cpretty wet\u201d, Nick Knight reports, and there will be another inspection at 6pm local time, 4pm in the UK. Which makes you wonder how much will change in 15 minutes. \u201cOne for Bob O\u2019Hara,\u201d says Adam Giles, carrying on the conversation from 14:53. \u201cThe size of the airborne cover would obviously depend on a number of factors. Firstly, the water would have to drain outside of the ground, else you\u2019d just have a sodden shape on the pitch that would map the shape of the cover above. Secondly, the lift that the blimp provides would have to offset the mass of the covers AND the mass of the rain landing on them. This in turn would be relative to ambient air pressure\u2026there would be a noticeable difference in lift between Centurion and Newlands, for example.\u201d I\u2019ll take your word for it. \u201cI personally envisage something akin to the roof of a circus tent, with the central anchor point attached to the blimp, and the tether lines then attached to protrusions extending beyond the floodlights or roof of the stands, which in turn would then have waterproof webbing between them. However, this does not alleviate the safety/practicality issues pointed out by John Starbuck [14:17]. Nor does it account for possible difficulties in high winds!\u201d I\u2019ve just looked up England\u2019s record in ODIs at Kingsmead, Durban. Four matches before today. The first two, they lost, comprehensively. The next two, in 2005 and 2009, were washed out. It never rains, but... What we need, apart from sunshine in Durban, is an email from somewhere completely unexpected. \u201cI see you are asking for correspondence on this washed-out cricket day,\u201d says Steven Kelk. \u201cI am a computer scientist working at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. I have a cricket bat in my office, because there\u2019s nothing like an air-guitar cover drive or leg glide to relieve stress. In the Netherlands a cricket bat is a little-known and apparently highly exotic object. Literally everybody who enters my office comments on it. I have discovered that there are only three comments: \u2018What on earth is that? Do you use that for disciplining students?\u2019 (40%), \u2018Is that a baseball bat?\u2019 (50%) and \u2018Do you play cricket?\u2019 (10%). \u201cI\u2019m sure this tells us something profound about the interplay between cricket, the Netherlands and computer science, but I\u2019ll leave that to the market research boys and girls at the ICC to find out. I\u2019ll be waiting for their call!\u201d Word from an eyewitness at the scene. \u201cGood day Tim.\u201d Good day to you too, Thamsanqa Ndlovu. \u201cBeing at the ground, I doubt there would be any play again today. It\u2019s depressing, I was really looking forward to a Bavuma ton.\u201d Me too \u2013 though he might have his work cut out catching up with Reeza Hendricks, who\u2019s been timing the ball like a superstar. \u201cCharity sale,\u201d says David Gibson. \u201cAre there any jumpers? Size large. I was a bit disappointed at Christmas. Many people think blue suits me. Thanks mate.\u201d Cometh the hour, cometh the email. \u201cIn rainy OBO fashion of finding the tiniest tangents,\u201d says Dan Silk, \u201cI\u2019m wondering about the first name of the \u2018S Sub\u2019 who\u2019s currently completing the England lineup on your scoreboard link... Spare Sub? Surplus Sub? Sub Sub? Or something more leftfield, like Septimus Sub?\u201d I like the sound of him \u2013 a children\u2019s book waiting to happen. \u201cSadly I can\u2019t find any player actually called Sub, but someone must have been tempted to change their name just to confuse and annoy umpire and scorers?\u201d I think you\u2019ll find that S Sub is actually M Ali, resorting to a change of name in a desperate bid to get onto the field. Eoin Morgan wanted an offspinner so badly that he brought Joe Root on for the sixth over (with instant success), yet he didn\u2019t want one badly enough to pick Mo. \u201cIt\u2019s still raining out there,\u201d says Nick Knight. To get a game here, we\u2019re going to need another 33 and a half overs, to make a Twenty20. If I\u2019ve read the rules right, play would have to resume by 7pm local time (5pm in the UK) and go straight through to about 10 (8). It feels like a faint hope. If you\u2019re an OBO reader who\u2019s never got round to sending in an email, now would be a good time to start. The only item in my inbox is an announcement from Guardian Labs about this afternoon\u2019s charity clothes sale. Very Guardian, but not very OBO. Afternoon everyone, thanks Adam and best of luck with the birth. Hope it goes painlessly for your other half and blissfully for you. If that baby is anything like its dad, it\u2019s going to be a bundle of energy. Now, back to the cricket. There isn\u2019t any. The time has come. Everyone, thanks for your company. Five hours and 6.3 overs later, it\u2019s time for Tim de Lisle to take the OBO baton. To a reduced game further reduced? A washout? Time will tell. I\u2019ll be back with you during the T20s, quite possibly with a baby sitting next to me by then. Have nice weekends! Bye! I\u2019m sorry to report, Sky Cricket\u2019s pictures have confirmed the bad news. \u201cAdam Giles\u2019s idea is interesting,\u201d writes Bob O\u2019Hara, \u201cbut can you ask him (or someone else) to calculate how wide they would have to be.\u201d I suspect we\u2019re down a wormhole now! Embrace it. Indeed, this conversation will be Tim\u2019s to embrace when he takes over at 3pm. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Howdy, Robin Hazlehurst. Howdy? I\u2019ve never said that greeting before and certainly never written it. It\u2019s been a long morning, I guess. Hello. Howdy. \u201cSome mates invited me to nick off work this afternoon and watch the cricket, but I declined as I only get one pass per weekend to \u2018watch sport\u2019 in the pub and I\u2019m saving it for the rugby tomorrow. Looks like I\u2019ve made the right call. I agree that rain is just part of life and cricket and we should (and generally do) just accept it, but it can be a nuisance if you\u2019ve made a special effort for a game. Just imagine, I\u2019d have had to actually talk to people while drinking today instead of just shouting at a screen. Dodged a bullet there!\u201d Good shopping. I\u2019m running the gauntlet tomorrow for the rugby too, despite being raised in Melburnian and, therefore, not understanding it. I say gauntlet as we\u2019re well into week 40 of pregnancy - first baby. But I won\u2019t venture too far. Yep, the covers are off. The umpires have been out there taking a look. We must be close to some formal information about a resumption time. Hurrah! No news, bad news? We saw pictures of some covers coming off about quarter of an hour ago, but nothing further. News as it comes to hand I see stuff on twitter. \u201cHello Adam.\u201d Hello, Austin Baird. \u201cTalking about blimps, drones and a roof is a well-trod path on the OBO when rain intervenes. But I\u2019m curious as to why we can\u2019t come to terms with \u2018rain stopped play\u2019? Stuff happens. Yes we would like a day\u2019s play but it\u2019s ok to shrug one\u2019s shoulders and just accept \u2018rain stopped play.\u2019 It\u2019s not the end of the world. Yours, in a state of zen.\u201d Good take! This might be the former club player (and current freelancer) in me, but I don\u2019t mind the occasional weather delay. It\u2019s part of what makes cricket weird. Anyone else watching this Stokes doco on Sky? It\u2019s really good. Ian Ward going through his two 2019 miracles, asking him what he was thinking clip by clip. True story. \u201cJust a reminder that they play cricket under a roof at the Marvel Stadium in Melbourne,\u201d says Bruce in Australia. \u201cSeveral times this season they have had big hitters like Chris Lynn and Phil Salt in the Big Bash whacking the ball - and no one has hit the roof. It\u2019s definitely well worth exploring the potential at other venues.\u201d Good point. I reckon Aaron Finch is the only player to hit the Docklands roof in an actual game? Possibly a Black Caps player too, around 2005? None of that comes close to comparing with the greatest moment at that stadium, of course. \u201cYou can\u2019t wear number 23 at Hawthorn and not be a showman!\u201d WHAT A DAY. John Starbuck also wants to talk blimps. \u201cAll very well, but a blimp-based cover as described would itself need very long tether lines, therefore dangerous. Also, the longer it has to function, the more likely an upset will be. Across an entire day of a Test, you\u2019d need two more blimps ready as back-up. If used only for rain periods, the setting up and taking down actions will introduce a lag of at least one hour each, given that winds are likely too. Perhaps a giant teepee on legs, or just use the gasholder facility at the Oval instead?\u201d I\u2019m telling you... drones and a shadecloth! Adam Giles is with us, tapping into some well-worn OBO territory! \u201cRather than spend my Friday afternoon catching up on paperwork, I decided to deal with the conundrum of rain stopping play, and came to the thought of playing under a roof. Of course, with a sport like cricket, there is always an issue that the roof wouldn\u2019t be high enough to prevent the ball hitting it, which would impact the game.\u201d Before he goes on, if you want about 500 takes on this, I\u2019ll point you to our OBO from the rained out India v New Zealand fixture during the World Cup. Also, there\u2019s our Final Word daily pod from one of those sodden afternoons... after a lot of consideration, we landed on a shadecloth in space held up by drones. Back to Adam... \u201cSo, I crunched the numbers. The fastest ball ever bowled (by one Mr. Akhtar) was clocked at 161km/h, which roughly equates to 45m/s. Assuming that the impact of bat on ball (considering energy lost through sound, heat, kinetic energy dissipated through the bat etc) can add at most at 50% of the incident velocity to the ball, this gives us 67.5m/s as a maximum ball speed off the willow. Using the equations for Kinetic Energy and Gravitational Potential Energy, and assuming 20% of energy lost to air resistance, this would give the ball a maximum possible height off the bat of 181m if it went straight up. Adding a safety factor to balance out the assumptions made, if a blimp were to hang a large cover 200m above the pitch, rain delays would be a thing of the past, and the height of the cover above the pitch would prevent it obstructing the floodlights, thus enabling the continuation of the spectacle that is a day/night match.\u201d A blimp! Yes! This is important work and our game thanks you for it. \u201cMe again, soz.\u201d Not at all, Peter Salmon - your thoughts are welcome here. \u201cRe bands what came and went - ever since Barney Ronay described Matthew Wade as looking like a Tugboat Captain, I\u2019ve had Galaxie 500 on my mind... The lyrics seem so apt to Wade too.\u201d Just spat my water out at that perfect Barney comparison. Let\u2019s give your song a spin as the rain gets heavier at Durban; the bigger covers now on too. Oh well. The square and the pitch are covered. They look to be bringing out the run up tarps as well. So, even if/when this stops, we might have to wait a while. Sorry. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Afternoon, Dave Langlois. \u201cThis is certainly a good opportunity to try out a new set of bowlers, and good on em for that. But they do look a bit toothless, especially on flat slow pitches. Good news that Jimmy\u2019s fit but the news about Jofra is bad. Someone who ambles up and generates almost all his searing pace with his arm action cannot afford to carry any elbow problems. Maybe the poor guy is going to be a false dawn.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, Jof is going to be just fine. He bowled 400 overs last year despite missing five of the Tests England played while he was eligible for service. Needs a good breather, which he gets now. The injury isn\u2019t a major one, we\u2019re told. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d declares Mark Nicholas off-mic, but we can still hear him. \u201cThey won\u2019t play again.\u201d Thanks mate! Way to stay upbeat! Let\u2019s see how this plays out. I\u2019ll boil the kettle. Back to the inbox after that. See you there. 6.3 overs: South Africa 38-1 (Hendricks 24, Bavuma 2) Another tasty drive from Hendricks, off Woakes this time, lashing him through cover. But I\u2019m afraid to say that\u2019s his lot for now because rain has returned. Here come the covers. URRRRGH. 6th over: South Africa 33-1 (Hendricks 20, Bavuma 1) Bavuma has one ball to look at and flicks it to midwicket to get off the mark. Until Root struck, Mark Nicholas was more interested in his clear-cut appearance, the bearded period now over: \u201cHe\u2019s gone from being a Glastonbury regular to an accountant.\u201d Of course, he was in the wickets in England\u2019s win at PE just a few weeks ago. Great captaincy. Masterstroke from Morgan! He gets Root into the attack early in the innings and he gets through de Kock with one that skids on! He made room for himself to slap through cover but misread the bounce and paid the price. Fantastic captaincy to get his part-timer on, skittling the South African captain and talisman. 5th over: South Africa 29-0 (de Kock 10, Hendricks 18) With the game reduced to 45 overs, the power plays are tweaked - this first period, with only two fielders permitted outside the circle, runs for nine overs not ten. Ooh, if England had a second catcher in the cordon he might have been in the game here when Woakes finds a genuine outside edge from the dangerman de Kock. That\u2019s the second time he\u2019s hit the seam and found considerable movement. They come back for a couple after the false stroke, the captain only back in time after a full-length dive. After settling through the middle part of the over, he finds a gap at cover for two more. 4th over: South Africa 25-0 (de Kock 6, Hendricks 18) Shot. Hendricks gets on the front foot and times a cover drive to perfection; the slow outfield isn\u2019t denying a boundary on this occasion, South Africa\u2019s first for the day. He makes it two in the over, hammering Curran\u2019s non-threatening short ball through midwicket - it makes a glorious sound off his blade. Two to finish, past point, makes 11 off it. 3rd over: South Africa 14-0 (de Kock 5, Hendricks 8) de Kock tucks one to begin, Hendricks pushing another single to cover, his captain then doing likewise. Woakes closes out the second half of the over well, sending down three tidy dots. 2nd over: South Africa 11-0 (de Kock 3, Hendricks 7) Sam Curran\u2019s first ball slips down the legside, his second is quite full at Hendricks, driven for two through cover - another shot that would have earned him four on a quicker field. He\u2019s on a better length after that, shaping back into the right hander then angling away. Two more to finish, clipped off middle stump, but all told, a steady start from Curran. 1st over: South Africa 6-0 (de Kock 3, Hendricks 3) I jumped the gun a little bit posting that they were playing as the ground staff were asked to race out to repair some turf but they\u2019ve made it to the first ball of the day, which beats de Kock outside the off stump. Lovely delivery from Woakes. The Proteas captain is off the mark with a tuck second ball, Hendricks then also away with a couple through cover thanks to a misfield on the circle by Honest Joe Denly. Woakes is straight back on his length, finding Hendricks\u2019 edge, through fourth slip for a further single. de Kock once more, who times a lovely push through cover but only gets two for it. \u201cThat shows how much rain we\u2019ve had,\u201d notes Mark Nicholas. We have lost 105 minutes so the game will be played over 45 overs. Reeze Hendricks joins his skipper, Quinton de Kock. For England, Chris Woakes has the ball in his hand. He\u2019ll be bowling at the South African captain to begin. PLAY! A pearler from Pete Salmon! \u201cWith the addition of Bjorn Fortuin to Andile Phehlukwayo, Beuran Hendricks, Jon-jon Smuts, Lutho Sipamla and Tabraiz Shamsi, is this the best named bowling attack in the history of cricket?\u201d Yes! Let\u2019s lay all our love on newcomer Bjorn \u201cBJORN AGAIN\u201d Fortuin today. \u201cAfternoon Adam.\u201d Hi there, Tom Hopkins. \u201cOn the really important issue raised, we park our cars in the same garage re The Like. Are You Thinking What I\u2019m Thinking? still gets a regular run out, but it looks as if you\u2019re classing Release Me as their one proper album?\u201d I guess I am. The one that cut through. I still return to their cover of Why When Love is Gone often. Hidden track on Release Me! Must be a little sub-genre for bands who arrived and were brilliant before leaving just as quickly. Another of mine is [me], who I followed and adored - one and done. Not even on Spotify anymore and their website hasn\u2019t been renewed. Sad. To get through my inbox before we start. \u201cDon\u2019t forget,\u201d writes Bill Bevan, \u201cGreat Britain have won the men\u2019s World Cup Rugby League World Cup three times. Does that count?\u201d It might, I\u2019m afraid, have the tree falling in the woods issue? \u201cHello Adam.\u201d Hi, Andy Shaw. \u201cWhy not a three-year cycle of World Cups \u2013 a T20 one, an ODI one, and a Test one? The 12-team Test tournament would be organised into two round-robin groups of six, with semi-finals and a final. The finalists would therefore play seven matches, which is easily doable within the seven-week span of the 2019 World Cup. That way everyone can play as much or as little bilateral cricket as they like, with a world championship of some sort to fight for every year.\u201d In reality, the WTC is isn\u2019t going to shift far from what we have at the moment. But I\u2019m increasingly persuaded by white-ball World Cups every other year argument. Smylers on email informs me that England haven\u2019t yet formally made the women tri-series final. Either way, it\u2019s the perfect prep and a benefit of being Big Three. On women\u2019s cricket too is Frank Morrish. \u201cWe hear a lot about Women\u2019s T20 games, which is undoubtedly a good thing. I\u2019ve always wondered, though, why don\u2019t women play test matches/so few test matches? In my opinion it\u2019s the superior game format - would like to see women play it too.\u201d A long and complicated story! Summed up in a sentence: scarce funds across the women\u2019s cricket world, so only a few countries can afford the investment. Also, a lack of red-ball/multiday action at domestic level. I can\u2019t see it changing, sadly. And one final email on 1966 (and all that) before I politely close the book on the topic, coming in from Steven Larcombe. \u201cWhen I lived in Germany, if the ball hit the bar, friends would turn to me and say, \u2018ah, in England, that\u2019s a goal, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d Quinton de Kock would have bowled too. The home skipper believes the wicket will be slow after the time under covers. There\u2019s one change to the South African side, Lungi Ngidi rested in favour of Bjorn Fortuin, the left-arm tweaker. England: Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (c), Joe Denly, Tom Banton, Sam Curran, Chris Woakes, Tom Curran, Chris Jordan, Matt Parkinson South Africa: Quinton de Kock (c &amp; wk), Reeza Hendricks, Temba Bavuma, Rassie van der Dussen, JJ Smuts, David Miller, Andile Phehlukwayo, Beuran Hendricks, Lutho Sipamla, Tabraiz Shamsi, Bjorn Fortuin. Eoin Morgan won the toss and has popped the home side in. He says the pitch looks \u201creally good\u201d after all the rain. They have retained the same XI as Tuesday. \u201cIn response to Phil Russell,\u201d adds Adam Giles \u201cSurely England\u2019s prowess in extra time/overs stands testament to that everlasting quality of British stiff-upper-lip-esque grit, and for all those that consistently claim that Stokes isn\u2019t truly English, his strong inclination towards such an attitude (whether with bat or ball) is clearly a large part of what has given him such a heroic status among those of us from Good Ol\u2019 Blighty. Secondly, loving the response to the continued complaints about the manner in which the world cup is won. Clearly my father was right in his old adage that it\u2019s far easier to win an argument when you have L. Everage, despite me misinterpreting him as requiring bargaining chips rather than the notable OBO pundit.\u201d I\u2019m staying out of this one! Mark Gillespie has a bit more on World Cup \u201866, though: \u201cAs we\u2019re getting into full on pedantry, Graeme Thorn isn\u2019t completely correct on the idea that VAR would have ruled out the German equaliser. As he\u2019s talking about the ball \u201chitting the German attackers arm\u201d, the rule change on the ball only needing to hit an arm before the assist or goal only came in this season. It\u2019s been associated with VAR because it often gets checked in that way and came in at the same time in this country, but it\u2019s a separate rule. So in \u201866, VAR would only have been checking for deliberate handball, which probably wouldn\u2019t have been given.\u201d I wonder if 1966 will still get referenced on the OBO in 2066? I do hope so! It will be reduced to a 45-over fixture. So there we have it. Positive pictures from the ground. Might we be heading towards a toss? Stand by. \u201cSo, Sir James Anderson is commentating on Sky,\u201d notes Alistair Connor while we wait. \u201cNice to see he\u2019s preparing a post-player career, but aren\u2019t there any rules covering conflict of interest for active cricketers? Mind games?\u201d Not that I\u2019m aware of. I\u2019m sure permission would need to be sought from his employer given he has a central contract, but it isn\u2019t that novel for players to commentate before they retire. In fact, I think this came up the other week on the OBO... Colin Cowdrey the first, was it? Jimmy\u2019s been very good on TMS. Good news for the England Women who have secured their place in the tri-series final in Australia, beating India by four wickets in Melbourne. Anya Shrubsole picked up three wickets in restricting Harmanpreet Kaur\u2019s side to 123/6. Nat Sciver struck 50 in 38 balls in the successful chase. They\u2019re going nicely ahead of the T20 World Cup, running from 21st of this month through to the 8th of March. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Good morning, Graeme Thorn. \u201cRe World Cup 1966 - England would have won that in normal time had VAR existed then - the ball definitely hit a German attacker\u2019s arm before their last-minute equaliser (rendering whether Hurst\u2019s second crossed the line moot).\u201d Any return of serve from our German OBO readers? No? That\u2019s settled, then! This is, as Vish says, lovely. Worth a look while it continues to rain at Durban. \u201cHello there.\u201d And to you, John Starbuck. \u201cIf we decide to hold a T20I World Cup every other year (11:24 suggestion), why not every year? It should be possible to devise a meaningful T20 sequence between countries all year round, with either points or straight knockouts, to allow quarter-finals, semi-finals and final in October or November. This would have the added benefit of giving more meaning to all the current 3-match series going on already. There could be a three-series minimum to qualify. OK, now and again the finals could be in September to give GB the chance to host them, but it\u2019s a better prospect than a Test World Championship, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I think it is mostly to do with concentrated tournament play. Even take the dearly departed Champions Trophy: when it was on, we are cared quite a bit. Remember too that T20 World Cups were held every other year until the current cycle and worked reasonably well given how infrequently T20Is were being played. Of course, that\u2019s why the women have stuck with that pattern and it works well. I don\u2019t want to bring the WTC into this necessarily but I would say that it is very fashionable to beat up on it now that we have it, however insufficient/quirky in this initial iteration. Until now, the stronger complaints were that bilateral series alone - without a central organising structure - were leaving Test cricket short. For mine, there\u2019s a good fix for the WTC when they revamp in 2023 for cycle three. In short: make every series three Tests and permit four-day fixtures to be played if it means getting to that minimum of three. This wouldn\u2019t preclude the Big Three playing longer series or five-day Tests; the Ashes won\u2019t be diminished by having two Tests that don\u2019t count for points. But it would make all WTC Tests equal. I\u2019d also insist on every country playing each other. Yes, that requires a compromise between India and Pakistan, but if we were in a perfect cricketing world. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d G\u2019day, Phil Russell. \u201c\u2018Fun\u2019 fact - England are the only country to have won a men\u2019s World Cup Final in Football, Rugby and Cricket, and every time they needed extra time to do it!\u201d Okay, there\u2019s an essay in this as well! Sorry, I tempted fate talking about toss times and so on, didn\u2019t I? The shots on Sky then suggest a fair bit of rain over the last ten minutes. We\u2019re back to square one. Years later, I\u2019m still gutted The Like gave it away after one proper album. A lovely return of serve here from Lev Everage. \u201cCan all the people still whinging about England\u2019s World Cup win confirm that they also believe Australia didn\u2019t win in 1999? They progressed from their tied semi with South Africa because of a superior net run rate in the preceding round, which might even be lamer than most boundaries scored.\u201d Oh, my sweet spot! I spent two months researching the 1999 World Cup last year (an essay that lives in The Nightwatchman) and NRR, I strongly agree, is a dreadful way to sort out a tournament where points are skewed to end up level. They actually fixed this for the 2003 comp - by far the best format yet. Sigh! As a (proud) Australian living in London covering the game around the world, my assessment is that there\u2019s no doubt that Aussie fans were far angrier about the 2019 tie-breaker than New Zealanders. There\u2019s probably an essay in that, too. Ground inspection coming up in 15 minutes. We are seeing pictures of the outfield covers coming off the ground with the pitch now clear (very green!). Nick Knight says they understand it will be at least an hour before we\u2019re ready to roll. Progress! The Sky coverage is turning into an excellent chat with Jimmy, specifically about maintaining fitness over his marathon career. He really is in absurd nick. \u201cGidday Adam.\u201d Good morning, Ailstair Connor. \u201cAs a dual French-NZ national, may I the first to draw the obvious analogy between the Cape Town ODI and the Six Nations game in Paris? World champions fail to turn up in Cape Town, vice world champions absent in Paris? (Though England are only co-world-champions really : match drawn, super over drawn, end of story).\u201d Despite coming from Melbourne, even this rugby chat I can (vaguely) understand. It\u2019s a tough little period of ODI cricket for England given all their white-ball focus on the T20 World Cup in October. This is a point Andy Zaltzman made on the BBC Cricket Social when I was on there the other week: why don\u2019t we have more World Cups? His argment is that short-form cricket is defined by tournaments, so hold them every other year. We don\u2019t need to follow the Olympics/football/rugby. Fair? If you\u2019re looking for something to listen to while we wait... Geoff Lemon and I had England World Cup champion Ebony Rainford-Brent on The Final Word this week. She is one of the most impressive people in cricket and her message one of the most inspiring. At Surrey, the work they are doing to integrate black cricketers back into the club is quite outstanding. Well worth a listen, if I do say so myself. Aleem Dar is talking to the ground staff... and he\u2019s looking at his watch. That\u2019s the best sign yet that we might have some toss/start times coming our way shortly. Make of this what you will, but they are moving the car tyres off the covers at Kingsmead. This suggests they might come off soon. Or they\u2019ll trolling us. Jimmy Anderson is on Sky Cricket\u2019s coverage and it will be of interest to many of you that he has declared himself fit for England\u2019s Test tour of Sri Lanka in March. \u201cSteady rain\u201d overnight according to TV. \u201cBetter news,\u201d though, says Ian Ward. \u201cIt is looking a lot brighter and more encouraging.\u201d The shortest game would need to be a T20 starting by 6:30pm local. That\u2019s six (count \u2018em) six hours from now. The ground as it looked half an hour ago. Good morning and welcome to the second ODI from Kingsmead. The bad news off the top: it is raining in Durban. With the TV coverage yet to start, I\u2019m not sure what we are talking about exactly, but twitter is hinting at a delayed start. The forecast isn\u2019t crash hot either, to level with you. But don\u2019t let than dampen your enthusiasm for the OBO - we all know that our rain chats are some of the best. If they play, the task ahead of England is levelling the series after losing the opener on Tuesday. We learned more about the home side in victory than the visitors in defeat, racing away to a comfortable victory with Quinton de Kock saluting for a century at the first time of asking since taking over as skipper. It was the first limited-overs international for the world champions since they held the trophy aloft on that famous day at Lord\u2019s last July, although the XI that played that day barely resembles the side out there this week. Plenty of those frontline white-ball stars (not least a couple of handy blokes called Stokes and Buttler) are having a breather while Archer\u2019s elbow - we have learned since the previous fixture - requires plenty of rehab before he bowls again. Righto, I\u2019m looking forward to your company throughout, rain or otherwise!",

      "bodyText": "New mothers will be given a physical and mental health check six weeks after giving birth, in a victory for campaigners. From April, the 600,000 women a year who have babies in England will undergo an assessment of their health and wellbeing with either a GP or practice nurse at their surgery. The appointments will be dedicated to exploring the mother\u2019s health and be separate to the six-week check that all babies already receive. However, many of them will occur immediately before or after the infant\u2019s check, to make the best use of mothers\u2019 and NHS staff\u2019s time. Until now many women have either not had a postnatal check or had only a very brief one during their baby\u2019s appointment, often because of time pressures. That has left many feeling unable to raise issues about their own health and led to concerns that some conditions are being missed. The change has been widely welcomed. It is expected to lead to better identification of mental health problems that can arise from pregnancy and birth such as postnatal depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and quicker treatment for those who need it. NHS England has agreed to pay the \u00a312m cost of the initiative as part of a new five-year contract with GP leaders in England, under which they will expand the services they offer. Women are expected to have at least 10 minutes with the GP or nurse carrying out the check. \u201cThis additional funding for the six-week postnatal check will enable GPs to ensure that the mother receives a proper maternal check, as well as the baby, which is so crucial. We know that for some women with pregnancy-related mental illness, if identified early by a GP they can be treated close to their home and avoid any condition escalating,\u201d said Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives. Dr Nikita Kanani, a London GP and the NHS\u2019s medical director for primary care, said: \u201cThere are over 600,000 births every year in England and ensuring new mums and their babies have the best start is a key commitment of the NHS long-term plan.

      "bodyText": "As it\u2019s 50 years to the day when George Best scored six goals at Northampton, it only seems right to play you out with this. Best football song ever? Thanks for reading and all your contributions. A few fixtures around Europe for your evening entertainment tonight: Bundesliga: Eintracht Frankfurt v Augsburg (19:30) Serie A: Roma v Bologna (19:45) La Liga: Alaves v Eibar (20:00) Ligue 1: Angers v Lille (19:45) Championship: Bristol City v Birmingham (19:45) League One: Lincoln v Rotherham (19:45) Roy Hodgson has dampened speculation about any immediate exit from Crystal Palace after a poor run of form and rumours of behind-the-scenes unrest following a rather underwhelming transfer window in which only Cenk Tosun was signed on loan from Everton. Here he is talking ahead of Saturday\u2019s trip to Goodison Park: The fact is the chairman (Steve Parish) and I had very positive discussions during the week. I have no reason to doubt the intentions of the club are any different now to how they were: to ask me to stay. I\u2019ll be having further discussions in the coming days and we\u2019ll see where that leads. When it comes to transfers and transfer windows, the last one was a bit disappointing and not least because we thought we were on the way to acquiring a young right-back in [West Brom full-back Nathan] Ferguson, that fell through because of the fact he needs an operation. Had that happened, it would be a lot more positive anyway. Secondly, there\u2019s no difference of opinion about what needs to be done. The 72-year-old was appointed manager in September 2017 and his current contract expires at the end of the season. Back to \u201cit is what it is\u201d and, as suspected, it came from U.S. Sports. But @alexpbloom on Twitter suggests it\u2019s been around for longer than we think, a couple of decades in fact. A late entrant in the \u2018make a word from two goalscorers\u2019 game: From BTL, here\u2019s boomblastandruin: \u201cThere was a distinctly fishy occasion in December when Ismaila Sarr and Troy Deeney score for Watford against Man Utd.\u201d Hmmm. Shame Brian Deane wasn\u2019t still playing. A match preview for Saturday\u2019s early kick-off: A reminder of the truncated Premier League weekend fixtures. Bad news for fans of 3pm kick-offs. Saturday: Everton v Crystal Palace (12:30) Brighton v Watford (17:30) Sunday: Sheffield United v Bournemouth (14:00) Manchester City v West Ham (16:30) All times GMT More on Pep, Messi and Barcelona from Jamie Jackson: While Harry Kane makes gains (every day), it\u2019s time for a bit of a Spurs-flavoured Fiver. Harry Kane has provided an update on his rehabilitation with this video on social media. Anyone else intrigued what\u2019s going on out of shot? The England captain has flown to the Bahamas this week for a stint of warm-weather training as he aims to get fit for Euro 2020. Peter Oh is back with a twist on Frost\u2019s theorem - crafting a goalkeeper from two attackers. \u201cAlli and Son have probably been on scoresheets together for Spurs. Allison. Would that count in Roger Frost\u2019s book?\u201d Or how about footballers named after a personality test - Andy Myers and Gary Briggs. Talking of which, a friend in Spain did a Myers-Briggs analysis on me in midweek and deduced that I was an INFP (one of the 16 personality types). Fellow INFPs include Shakespeare, The Cure\u2019s Robert Smith and Phoebe from Friends. He plans to work out all the managers in the Premier League and, apparently, has classed Jurgen Klopp as an ENFJ. Examples of ENFJs: Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama, Martin Luther King, Jr, Sean Connery, Bono, Freddie Mercury, Cristiano Ronaldo and \u201call these spiritual evangelists you get in America!\u201d ENFJs are sometimes referred to as Teacher personalities because of their interest in helping others develop and grow. Sounds about right. Here\u2019s Roger Frost with another way of getting those mental synapses leaping about. \u201cThis week Shane Long and Danny Ings were on the scoresheet for Southampton. Longings. I can\u2019t think of two other goalscorers who\u2019s surnames make up a word , but I am sure your readers can. Maybe one for The Knowledge, but hey, it\u2019s a slow weekend of football!\u201d West Ham have slipped into the relegation zone and that old rascal, the fixture computer, has given them back-to-back games at Manchester City and Liverpool as their next two assignments. Here is David Moyes putting on a brave face... All I can say is, you play everybody twice in the league and we have got a lot of other teams to play. I don\u2019t think in football there\u2019s many tougher matches, only a few clubs in Europe you would call tougher games. But it\u2019s also a challenge. Whoever the best teams are someone\u2019s out there trying to plot to beat them. All the managers are thinking, \u2018what system can I beat them with, what players can I get?\u2019 You only need to look at City\u2019s success, but Liverpool have gone out to find a way of getting better players and a better team to beat them. So people are now out to beat Liverpool. When I was at Manchester United everyone was out to beat them. Teams improved. That\u2019s the way football goes. We\u2019ll go into both games knowing it\u2019s no easy task, but we\u2019ll try everything we can to get a result. After Manchester City on Sunday and Liverpool on Monday week, West Ham then face Southampton (h), Arsenal (a), Wolves (h), Tottenham (a) and Chelsea (h). Hmmm. And Peter Oh is getting in on the act too with this Man City/Liverpool combo. \u201cSpare a thought for Jesus Jones, named after Man City\u2019s Brazilian striker and Liverpool\u2019s captain of the kids team that knocked out Shrewsbury this week.\u201d A lovely mid-afternoon read from Barry Glendenning, George\u2019s hair in the main photo bridging Rubber Soul Beatles and Vegas Elvis. An incredible response from Chris Hall on the subject of Green Day and West Ham. \u201cGreen Day may well be the only U.S. punk bad to be named after two West Ham goalkeepers, but Slint are the only band to have an EP homophonically named after a West Ham player/manager - one side is Glenn, the other Rhoda.\u201d The Football Association has decided not to continue with an investigation into allegations that Liverpool employees hacked into Manchester City\u2019s scouting system. From PA Media: The FA asked Liverpool and City for information concerning the matter, with Reds employees alleged to have hacked into a player database used by City. However, due to the age of the allegations - which date back to 2013 - and the FA saying the matter was the subject of a settlement between the clubs, the governing body says its investigation will go no further unless new information comes to light. A statement from the FA on Friday afternoon read: \u201cThe FA has carefully considered the evidence it received in this matter, including information provided by both clubs involved, and has decided not to progress the investigation. \u201cThis is due to a number of factors including the age of the alleged concerns and the settlement agreed by the two clubs involved. As per standard protocol, should the FA receive further information or evidence, the decision not to progress the investigation may be reviewed.\u201d A lame-ish claim to fame entry from Matt Dony. \u201cMy father used to play guitar on the local light-entertainment circuit. A long time ago, he was playing at a local football club for a charity night that was attended by John Charles. The great man was convinced to sing a song, so asked them to play Sixteen Tons. My father asked what key he wanted. The reply was, \u2018I haven\u2019t got a clue. You play it and I\u2019ll sing it.\u2019 Apparently, he was brilliant. What a legend.\u201d And more from Pep with City winger Leroy Sane back in training after a lengthy injury. He has started to train with us. He needs to recover tempo and confidence. It needs time. He needs weeks. Here\u2019s more from Pep on Manchester City\u2019s injured list. Random thought. When did \u201cit is what it is\u201d become so prevalent among sportspeople? I think Tiger Woods was one of the first users. Now, it\u2019s everywhere. Psychology Today say this: \u201cThe increased use of \u201cit is what it is\u201d is an indication that people are increasingly resisting the temptation to force things into categories, to be comfortable with the unknown.\u201d Anyway, here\u2019s Pep On Raheem Sterling It\u2019s a hamstring injury. It takes weeks, but I don\u2019t know (how long) right now. It is a problem being without him but we were without Gundo (Ilkay Gundogan) in the first season and (Aymeric) Laporte this season. It is what it is.\u201d Pep Guardiola is playing a straight bat amidst all the Lionel Messi transfer rumours. Manchester City, obviously, have been linked but former Barca boss Pep won\u2019t fuel the frenzy: He is a player for Barcelona and he will stay there. That is my wish. I am not going to talk about players from other clubs. I think he is going to finish his career there. A fan of football and film? Then have a read of this. And if you nip to the Culture section, here\u2019s a piece on Green Day - the only U.S. punk bad to be named after two West Ham goalkeepers. It doesn\u2019t take the sharpest sleuth to figure out that Manchester City\u2019s problems during the current campaign have been at the back. But this is quite the stat: Manchester City have conceded 15.6% of the shots they\u2019ve faced in the Premier League this season \u2013 the highest ratio registered by any team in a single campaign since we have this data available (2003-04). Not Oktoberbest but Prost to Jurgen Klopp. Combining sporting woe and Opta stats, here\u2019s a line ahead of the Sheffield United v Bournemouth clash on Sunday: No Premier League side has benefitted from more Premier League own goals than Sheffield United this season (3, level with Brighton). Two of these three own goals have ended up being the winning goal in the game, including in their most recent match against Crystal Palace. While the Copa del Rey draw evoked memories of 2008, back in the Premier League it\u2019s the mid-80s all over again ... sort of. Liverpool are flying high in top spot and Everton are, erm, ninth. However, take a more recent thermometer check and the two sides to have won most points over the last 10 Premier League games are ... Liverpool (30) and Everton (19). Put on your Frankie Goes To Hollywood records and digest that. Well, many claim it helps pain relief ... From PA Media David McGoldrick could be back in the Sheffield United squad for their game against Bournemouth on Sunday. The former Southampton striker has missed the last four matches with a foot problem but Blades boss Chris Wilder said he had been \u201cback on the grass\u201d this week. I\u2019ll get the ball rolling into an unguarded net with this tweet from a mate after Liverpool\u2019s kids went through to the fifth round of the FA Cup via an own goal winner against Shrewsbury. That was some night for Alfred in 1892. An own goal in a 9-0 defeat. Hello everyone. While we await words of wisdom from the eight Premier League managers not on holiday, here\u2019s a fun activity to get us through the afternoon. We\u2019ll call it lame claims to footballing fame. This is not the place to tell us that your great uncle once scored a brace in an FA Cup final. Nope, that\u2019s far too impressive. We\u2019re looking for tales of woe, mishaps, something more Woody Allen than Tottenham double winner Les Allen. Let\u2019s play... While John goes for a power yomp around the block, Dave Tindall will guide you through the afternoon. After the transfer deadline was rolled back to September 1 by the Premier League, the EFL looks set to do the same in the Championship, though that needs to be ratified at a meeting. For the last two summers, the window has closed for clubs in the top two divisions on the Thursday before the start of the Premier League season. Clubs in League One and Two already have the longer window, but second-tier sides must decide at an EFL meeting at the end of the month whether to come into line with the Premier League, something they are expected to do. A statement from the EFL read: \u201cThe EFL notes the decision taken by Premier League clubs to change the closure date for its summer transfer window. EFL clubs discuss the matter on an annual basis and will do so at a meeting later this month where a determination will be made as to whether there is to be any change moving forwards.\u201d The Copa del Rey semi-finals have been drawn and an all-Basque final is on. Athletic Bilbao v Granada Real Sociedad v Mirand\u00e9s Over two legs First legs: February 11 or 12 Second legs: March 3 or 4 The final will be played at the Estadio de La Cartuja in Seville, which will host the event up until 2023. And for the first time since 2010, neither Real nor Barcelona will be in the final. As we await the Copa del Rey draw, a look back to that 2008 FA Cup semi-final quartet: West Brom v Cardiff, and Portsmouth v Barnsley. Barnsley were in the Mirand\u00e9s role, and had beaten Liverpool *and* Chelsea on their way there. This was the Chelsea team from the quarter-final: Cudicini; Belletti (Pizarro 5), Carvalho, Terry, Bridge; Wright-Phillips, Essien , Ballack, Malouda (Kalou); J Cole, Anelka That team, pretty much, reached the final of that year\u2019s Champions League. And Liverpool\u2019s from the fifth round: Itandje, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Riise, Benayoun, Lucas (Gerrard 75), Alonso, Babel (Kewell 69), Kuyt, Crouch. That team is not too far off a team that challenged for the title the following season. Simon Burnton, expert on all things Watford, spoke to Adam Masina, someone who has been through more than most. Here\u2019s a quiz from earlier in the week. The score to beat is my 16, and I should have done better. And we wondered why has Simeone remained at Atl\u00e9ti. This half-measures winter break has not stopped clubs jetting across the world. Or not, as the case may be. Key quote from Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. \u201cNext year football must rethink this winter break. You ask me about a winter break? For us there is no winter break.\u201d Important development on safe standing from Paul MacInnes. The previews are rolling in. All four of them. 25 years today. Parental guidance: explicit lyrics. Further Tottenham news: happy 85th birthday to this true great and a 1961 Double winner. Troy Parrott, a player my Irish pals says is their best forward talent since Robbie Keane has signed a contract with Tottenham. Now, will Jos\u00e9 Mourinho actually give him some minutes on the field. Parrott celebrated his 18th birthday this week. Tottenham Hotspur corner: Jan Verthongen is happy at the club, says his agent, despite his body language during the FA Cup game with Southampton looking to the contrary. In a chat with Kristof Terreur of Het Laatste Nieuws, Tom De Mul, though, played down suggestions his client was unhappy. Jan still wants to achieve great things with Spurs. He wants to qualify for the Europa or Champions League, to win the FA Cup. He is 32, but still very ambitious. He is focused. He still has so many targets. The Euros are a super important goal too. It\u2019s what I admire in Jan. He wants to play at the top level as long as possible. We haven\u2019t reached an agreement (on a contract extension) as yet, but we don\u2019t rule out anything. There is interest in him as a free agent, but Spurs is a very interesting option for us. The door\u2019s still open. Real Madrid also exited the Copa on Thursday night, and also to a Basque club, meaning that the final four is Mirand\u00e9s of the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, Athletic, La Real and Granada. Very much a 2008 FA Cup vibe to this year\u2019s competition. The draw takes place at 12pm UK time. Barcelona don\u2019t play until Sunday night, when they travel to Real Betis but the vultures are circling, and with even more vigour after last night\u2019s Copa del Rey defeat to Athletic Bilbao. North of the border, the hype machine is fully operational on Ianis Hagi after his goal against Hibs on Wednesday. Per PA Media. Steven Gerrard admits he is struggling to contain the hype around Ianis Hagi after seeing the new Rangers midfielder open his Ibrox account. The Light Blues boss has pleaded for the Rangers support to show Hagi - son of Romania great Gheorghe - patience. But the fans\u2019 excitement has gone into overdrive after seeing the 21-year-old fire a late winner against Hibernian, and Gerrard said: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t helped me there has he?\u201cIt was a fantastic finish. Looking back on the game you can see him coming to terms with the physicality up here in Scotland and getting used to the speed and the pace of the first half. But he grew and grew and grew as the game went on. I\u2019m sure people are going to get carried away now because he\u2019s scored the winner on his first start. But he will still take time to adapt to all the different venues and teams we come against. He\u2019s certainly a talent.\u201d Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi to link up is the ultimate football rumour. It simply has to happen. With Manchester City\u2019s title chances ground to dust, the Champions League is the big target, but there has been bad news on that score ahead of the Real Madrid match. Brighton v Watford on Saturday is the truncated weekend\u2019s relegation six-pointer. Paul Doyle examines the differences between Brighton under Graham Potter and his predecessor Chris Hughton. Suzanne Wrack profiles the Canada women\u2019s international whose record will surely never be beaten. A letter to the editor here. So, here it is, after entire continents of column inches and enough hot air to send a Zeppelin to Jupiter over many, many years, the fabled winter break comes to the Premier League. What does that mean? It\u2019s not like the winter breaks we looked at the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 and wondered how they did without football for an entire month. Thus, a fudge was cooked up so not everybody gets a rest since the Premier League is a content provider like no other, and so there will be four matches this weekend to taper off the dependency. Saturday: Everton v Crystal Palace Brighton v Watford Sunday: Sheffield United v Bournemouth Manchester City v West Ham Somewhat slim pickings but titter not, lest you be tittered, as there is a full run of EFL matches and plenty of storylines to pick up in Europe.",

Although it is vital the forests of Messok Dja are protected from escalating environmental pressures, it cannot come at any cost to indigenous people, their communities, traditions or livelihoods. We know the best way to protect many of the remaining critical landscapes on the planet is by working with the communities that live there.\u201d</p> <p>It said the draft report was based on a field mission in early 2019 and argued that it contained inaccuracies, which it was clarifying with the report\u2019s authors.<br><br>\u201cThe report does not reflect the current position on the ground.

Any breach of our social policies and commitments is unacceptable and we will take all action needed.\u201d</p> <p>A UNDP spokesman added: \u201cThis report was triggered by complaints that were reviewed in October 2018.

Some of that funding will be spent on ecoguards, including for training, salaries and equipment.\u201d Local Congolese WWF officials interviewed by the UNDP team \u201cacknowledged the evidence of abuse against the Baku\u201d by the guards, says the report. \u201cSuch occurrences were presented as isolated incidents due to the existence of a few bad apples among the ecoguards in what was otherwise a successful operation. A WWF staff member \u2026 explained that these incidences were occurring because of the psychological ramifications of putting someone in a uniform and giving him a gun, which for some men represents a licence to commit abuse.\u201d The report adds: \u201cBaka men find they can no longer go into the forest to obtain honey. They fear that they are no longer able to trap small animals without running the risk of being severely punished by the ecoguards. There are numerous reports of Baka caught in the forest being beaten.\u201d The investigators also identified multiple failures of the UNDP to adhere to human rights policies and standards, and said little consideration had been given to the impact of the project on the Baka peoples. Not only were communities given little information that their customary land was to be turned into a protected area, but funders had assumed that the conservation project would bring environmental and social benefits, says the report. Investigators also said they found no evidence that the UNDP had taken into account the risk of co-financing the project with palm oil and logging companies whose work by its nature threatens large-scale biodiversity loss. The report strongly criticises the way conservation is practised in central Africa. \u201cThe goal of establishing Messok Dja as a protected area was pursued by following the established patterns of conservation projects in the Congo Basin, which largely exclude indigenous peoples and treat them as threats rather than partners,\u201d it says. A separate study commissioned by the WWF from the international NGO Forest Peoples Programme (FPP) found that WWF had only consulted the Baka communities likely to be affected by the park seven years after the idea had been conceived and long after discussions with government and logging companies had begun. \u201c[By then] it was far too late in the process. Information provided to communities has been incomplete and provided late,\u201d the FPP report said. Stephen Corry, the director of tribal defence NGO Survival International, said: \u201cThis UNDP report is a devastating indictment which should spell the end ofWWF\u2019s model of \u2018fortress conservation\u2019 which has caused so much damage to people and the environment throughout Africa. \u201cLogging, palm oil and tourism companies, as well as conservation NGOs, are working together to steal Baka land. All the relevant UN policies and laws regarding respect for indigenous peoples and human rights were ignored from the beginning,\u201d he said. In a statement, the WWF said: \u201cWe are appalled by the observations and allegations of the report. Although it is vital the forests of Messok Dja are protected from escalating environmental pressures, it cannot come at any cost to indigenous people, their communities, traditions or livelihoods. We know the best way to protect many of the remaining critical landscapes on the planet is by working with the communities that live there.\u201d It said the draft report was based on a field mission in early 2019 and argued that it contained inaccuracies, which it was clarifying with the report\u2019s authors. \u201cThe report does not reflect the current position on the ground. We have worked tirelessly in recent months with all concerned \u2026 to overhaul practices regarding community engagement and help ensure indigenous groups participate in findings solutions and ensure their way of life is not under threat due to conservation efforts,\u201d it added in the statement. \u201cWe are especially distressed by concerns around the relationship between Republic of Congo-employed rangers and local communities, including allegations of abuse. Any breach of our social policies and commitments is unacceptable and we will take all action needed.\u201d A UNDP spokesman added: \u201cThis report was triggered by complaints that were reviewed in October 2018. Following an initial assessment of the allegations, UNDP suspended the project in March 2019. We are not able to comment on the findings until the report has been published.\u201d",

Mako is back but Jones still does not have the players to blast through Scotland and he has picked what must be the most lightweight backline of his tenure. That means it is time to get creative again.</p> <p>For all the possession England had in Paris, I\u2019m not sure they created any genuine try-scoring opportunities other than two moments of brilliance from Jonny May. I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s an anomaly because England are normally so deadly in the 22 but they weren\u2019t able to convert that possession and territory into points. Losing Manu causes an obvious problem but I also see it as an opportunity.</p> <p>Manu is an obvious handful and his sheer size and presence can create quick ball but there are plenty of other ways to do that. Whether that\u2019s running at shoulders, varying options at the line, slickness of handling, the pace at which you run at the line \u2013 it\u2019s a fallacy to say that you have to be a certain weight or size to get over the gain line. The weather is forecast to be dreadful but that doesn\u2019t mean you cannot be creative.</p> <p>I look at England\u2019s midfield of George Ford, Owen Farrell and Jonathan Joseph. They need to be at their slickest and the blueprint for that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/11/england-jonathan-joseph-scotland-seal-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">against Scotland at Twickenham in 2017</a>. Their detail off first phase was excellent in that 61-21 win and I really hope they have spent all week honing that kind of detail. Joseph scored a hat-trick that day and two of his tries were very similar. England got into a great attacking shape, presented different options, picked the right ones, ran the right lines and at such speed. It was among the most exhilarating performances I\u2019ve seen from this England attack.</p> <p>It is understandable but England have gone away from that in the last couple of years. When Eddie has had so many power athletes at his disposal it has come to dominate the gameplan. It is no wonder when you see how effective it has been against New Zealand at the World Cup or against Ireland in Dublin, but sometimes you can forget the other skillsets you have when you can rely on big ball carriers beating defenders around the corner and getting over the gainline. It can be devastating but England do not have that in their armoury at the moment.</p> <p>So they need to show a bit more guile and bring tempo to everything they do. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/ireland-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">In Dublin last year in that 32-20 victory</a> they had the power athletes but look at how they began that match. The lineout over the top to Manu in the first minute or two \u2026 they did not give Ireland a chance to catch their breath. The stats back up the need for England to start fast because in their last 20 fixtures England have been the team to score first on 15 occasions. Of those matches, they have gone on to win 13, drawing once, against Scotland last year, and losing only once, by a point to New Zealand. In the five matches in which they have gone behind they have gone on to lose three times.</p> <p>The focus needs to be on creativity, speed of ball and line speed. Of course England need front-foot ball to do that and that probably explains why Lewis Ludlam comes in to the side to add another breakdown threat. By the same token, it\u2019s a shame Luke Cowan-Dickie has been ruled out, because he is incredible over the ball.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/wales-dillon-lewis-full-of-beans-successful-six-nations\">Wales\u2019 Dillon Lewis full of beans for another successful Six Nations | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has come about through injury rather than design, but it is also worth noting Joseph\u2019s ability in defence. I believe he is the best defensive outside-centre England have and if Scotland are going to look to go coast-to-coast all the time, he\u2019s the best option Eddie has to shut that down. I\u2019d expect England to get off the line with far greater desire and urgency than last week and Joseph is wonderful at that umbrella defence, shutting down those wider channels, getting into the eyeline of Adam Hastings and making him hesitate. It\u2019s all the more important against a team who don\u2019t kick a lot \u2013 Scotland only kicked 10 times from open play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/01/ireland-scotland-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">in Dublin last Saturday</a>.</p> <p>Finally, what happens if and when the tide does turn against England? When Scotland get on a roll? Whenever you feel like you are under the pump, whether it\u2019s a few mistakes or negative actions in a row, conceding a try or a couple of penalties in a row, you have to manufacture moments of calm and quiet on the pitch. After 10 minutes you must create a break in play, whether it\u2019s a dodgy contact lens or whatever it is, you go into a huddle, you have your generals discussing what they are seeing on the pitch. Against France it might have been: \u201cWe\u2019re getting beaten up at the breakdown and we\u2019ve had X number of penalties against so we have to chuck more space out wide. What\u2019s space looking like out wide? Vakatawa is blitzing up hard from the outside channel so let\u2019s turn them, put pressure on Bouthier.\u201d</p> <p>I have no doubt that this England team is experienced enough to know that, but can they implement it in the moment? Murrayfield will be bouncing so England must show they can be more streetwise.</p>",

Mako is back but Jones still does not have the players to blast through Scotland and he has picked what must be the most lightweight backline of his tenure. That means it is time to get creative again. For all the possession England had in Paris, I\u2019m not sure they created any genuine try-scoring opportunities other than two moments of brilliance from Jonny May. I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s an anomaly because England are normally so deadly in the 22 but they weren\u2019t able to convert that possession and territory into points. Losing Manu causes an obvious problem but I also see it as an opportunity. Manu is an obvious handful and his sheer size and presence can create quick ball but there are plenty of other ways to do that. Whether that\u2019s running at shoulders, varying options at the line, slickness of handling, the pace at which you run at the line \u2013 it\u2019s a fallacy to say that you have to be a certain weight or size to get over the gain line. The weather is forecast to be dreadful but that doesn\u2019t mean you cannot be creative. I look at England\u2019s midfield of George Ford, Owen Farrell and Jonathan Joseph. They need to be at their slickest and the blueprint for that is against Scotland at Twickenham in 2017. Their detail off first phase was excellent in that 61-21 win and I really hope they have spent all week honing that kind of detail. Joseph scored a hat-trick that day and two of his tries were very similar. England got into a great attacking shape, presented different options, picked the right ones, ran the right lines and at such speed. It was among the most exhilarating performances I\u2019ve seen from this England attack. It is understandable but England have gone away from that in the last couple of years. When Eddie has had so many power athletes at his disposal it has come to dominate the gameplan. It is no wonder when you see how effective it has been against New Zealand at the World Cup or against Ireland in Dublin, but sometimes you can forget the other skillsets you have when you can rely on big ball carriers beating defenders around the corner and getting over the gainline. It can be devastating but England do not have that in their armoury at the moment. So they need to show a bit more guile and bring tempo to everything they do. In Dublin last year in that 32-20 victory they had the power athletes but look at how they began that match. The lineout over the top to Manu in the first minute or two \u2026 they did not give Ireland a chance to catch their breath. The stats back up the need for England to start fast because in their last 20 fixtures England have been the team to score first on 15 occasions. Of those matches, they have gone on to win 13, drawing once, against Scotland last year, and losing only once, by a point to New Zealand. In the five matches in which they have gone behind they have gone on to lose three times. The focus needs to be on creativity, speed of ball and line speed. Of course England need front-foot ball to do that and that probably explains why Lewis Ludlam comes in to the side to add another breakdown threat. By the same token, it\u2019s a shame Luke Cowan-Dickie has been ruled out, because he is incredible over the ball. It has come about through injury rather than design, but it is also worth noting Joseph\u2019s ability in defence. I believe he is the best defensive outside-centre England have and if Scotland are going to look to go coast-to-coast all the time, he\u2019s the best option Eddie has to shut that down. I\u2019d expect England to get off the line with far greater desire and urgency than last week and Joseph is wonderful at that umbrella defence, shutting down those wider channels, getting into the eyeline of Adam Hastings and making him hesitate. It\u2019s all the more important against a team who don\u2019t kick a lot \u2013 Scotland only kicked 10 times from open play in Dublin last Saturday. Finally, what happens if and when the tide does turn against England? When Scotland get on a roll? Whenever you feel like you are under the pump, whether it\u2019s a few mistakes or negative actions in a row, conceding a try or a couple of penalties in a row, you have to manufacture moments of calm and quiet on the pitch. After 10 minutes you must create a break in play, whether it\u2019s a dodgy contact lens or whatever it is, you go into a huddle, you have your generals discussing what they are seeing on the pitch. Against France it might have been: \u201cWe\u2019re getting beaten up at the breakdown and we\u2019ve had X number of penalties against so we have to chuck more space out wide. What\u2019s space looking like out wide? Vakatawa is blitzing up hard from the outside channel so let\u2019s turn them, put pressure on Bouthier.\u201d I have no doubt that this England team is experienced enough to know that, but can they implement it in the moment? Murrayfield will be bouncing so England must show they can be more streetwise.",

In a statement issued to the Irish News in Belfast the republican terror group said it had planned for the bomb to go off on the day the UK left the EU.

The bomb, which a senior police officer described as \u201cviable\u201d, was made safe by the army bomb disposal squad. The bomb had been attached to a refrigerated trailer belonging to a haulage firm based at the site. It is understood the Continuity IRA (CIRA) planned to smuggle the bomb across the Irish Sea on a ship destined for Scotland. It would then be transported to an unknown location in England on the day the UK left the EU. CIRA said the bomb had been attached to the lorry \u201cwith magnets underneath a refrigerated trailer\u201d. The dissident group said the bomb was on a timer and was similar to others used by its operatives in recent months. CIRA warned that the chance of the device \u201cdropping off\u201d the trailer were slim. \u201cIt was timed for Britain\u2019s exit from the EU and to bring attention to the sea border,\u201d the CIRA statement added.

Inside, the echoey rooms and hallways feature enviable cornicing and a lot of weird-looking doors.</p> <p>Keyhouse represents the Locke family legacy in more ways than one, as the kids soon uncover a sprawling supernatural mythology that revolves around enchanted keys, each with its own signature power. Bode, most attuned to the occult vibrations of a magical world apparently undetectable to adults, hears them whispering from nooks and crannies. He also strikes up a friendship with a spectral voice (Laysla De Oliveira) at the bottom of Keyhouse\u2019s neglected well.</p> <p>It sounds like an odd thing to say when discussing ancient keys imbued with supernatural powers, but the magical stuff seems innocuous enough at first, even fun. One key turns any door into a gateway to any other door the user has ever seen: fantastical, but easy enough to get your head around as a concept. It is only a few episodes in, once Bode has harvested more of the scattered artefacts, that it is intimated that some keys have the power to unlock people, manifesting Cronenberg-esque holes in their flesh. It hints at how wild the series becomes, mixing haunted house tropes with some of the psychedelic innerspace voyages of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/27/noah-hawley-legion-marvel-x-men-dan-stevens\">Legion</a>.</p> <p>Another useful touchstone is Buffy, since the elder Locke kids are trying to fit in at their new school while also trying to cope with demonic incursions. In this, Locke and Key benefits from two excellent performances at its centre. Jessup, who bears a striking resemblance to a young Ryan Phillippe, is the surprisingly sensitive hockey jock who feels responsible for his father\u2019s death while his introvert artist sister, played by English actor Jones, chooses such a radical shortcut in dealing with her mental pain that she essentially gets a whole new character to play.</p> <p>This first 10-episode season has been overseen by Carlton Cuse (the former Lost co-producer who transformed Bates Motel from desperate-sounding Psycho prequel into something with its own unsettling flavour) and Meredith Averill (producer and writer on The Haunting of Hill House). Both have experience in wringing unexpected new directions out of old tropes.</p> <p>While much of Locke and Key feels superficially familiar, cushioned by the superior production design and a lush score, there are enough deliberately disconcerting or oddball moments to make it a constantly evolving pleasure. And, with multiple volumes of the collected comic series already on bookstore shelves, this reincarnation could just be the start.</p>",

Keyhouse represents the Locke family legacy in more ways than one, as the kids soon uncover a sprawling supernatural mythology that revolves around enchanted keys, each with its own signature power. Bode, most attuned to the occult vibrations of a magical world apparently undetectable to adults, hears them whispering from nooks and crannies. He also strikes up a friendship with a spectral voice (Laysla De Oliveira) at the bottom of Keyhouse\u2019s neglected well. It sounds like an odd thing to say when discussing ancient keys imbued with supernatural powers, but the magical stuff seems innocuous enough at first, even fun. One key turns any door into a gateway to any other door the user has ever seen: fantastical, but easy enough to get your head around as a concept. It is only a few episodes in, once Bode has harvested more of the scattered artefacts, that it is intimated that some keys have the power to unlock people, manifesting Cronenberg-esque holes in their flesh. It hints at how wild the series becomes, mixing haunted house tropes with some of the psychedelic innerspace voyages of Legion. Another useful touchstone is Buffy, since the elder Locke kids are trying to fit in at their new school while also trying to cope with demonic incursions. In this, Locke and Key benefits from two excellent performances at its centre. Jessup, who bears a striking resemblance to a young Ryan Phillippe, is the surprisingly sensitive hockey jock who feels responsible for his father\u2019s death while his introvert artist sister, played by English actor Jones, chooses such a radical shortcut in dealing with her mental pain that she essentially gets a whole new character to play. This first 10-episode season has been overseen by Carlton Cuse (the former Lost co-producer who transformed Bates Motel from desperate-sounding Psycho prequel into something with its own unsettling flavour) and Meredith Averill (producer and writer on The Haunting of Hill House). Both have experience in wringing unexpected new directions out of old tropes. While much of Locke and Key feels superficially familiar, cushioned by the superior production design and a lush score, there are enough deliberately disconcerting or oddball moments to make it a constantly evolving pleasure. And, with multiple volumes of the collected comic series already on bookstore shelves, this reincarnation could just be the start.",

      "bodyText": "A drug used to treat people with HIV, the virus that causes Aids, is being trialled in patients in China as a possible therapy against the coronavirus. News that HIV drugs are being deployed in hospitals, however, has led to panic buying on the black market by people who fear they are ill or are going to get sick. They have been obtaining the drug, Kaletra, from generics companies in India and even from people with HIV in China willing to sell or donate their own stocks. Kaletra, a combination of two anti-HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, has been used on patients in a trial in China since 18 January. The aim is to test it in about 200 patients, whose condition will be carefully monitored. Their outcomes will be compared with those of similar people with the same degree of illness who have not been given the drug. There are no proven treatments for the new coronavirus, nor the others that caused the earlier outbreaks of Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2002 and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) in 2012. There are still cases of Mers. In Saudi Arabia, where they are largely concentrated, there is already a trial of Kaletra, combined with another drug, interferon, but because of the small number of Mers cases it will take a long time to come to conclusions. Gilead, a company that makes HIV drugs, has announced it will trial its drug remdesivir in the coronavirus outbreak. The drug was tested during the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018, but the Congolese authorities announced it was not sufficiently effective against the virus. The new trial of remdesivir will be gold standard, investigating how well it works in both moderately and severely ill patients compared with others given a placebo. Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at Oxford University, said it was impossible to predict whether any of the drugs would be effective against the coronavirus. \u201cNobody honestly knows. Most drugs that go into trials prove to be not effective. It is the more common outcome. One should be very cautious,\u201d said Horby, who pioneered drug trials in the massive Ebola outbreak in west Africa. If drugs are not given under strict trial conditions, he said, \u201cwe end up where we were after the 2009 [influenza] pandemic.\u201d More than 40,000 people were treated for influenza by doctors with experimental drugs, mostly oseltamivir, better known as Tamiflu, which is licensed for seasonal flu but not for use in an epidemic.

But fear of the coronavirus has prompted many people to seek their own supplies of Kaletra, also known as Aluvia, which is drug company AbbVie\u2019s off-patent version of lopinavir/ritonavir and the only one approved for sale in China \u2013 even though there is no evidence at the moment that it can help treat those who fall sick. HIV patients have been offering their pills on Chinese social network Weibo. \u201cWe felt like we were organised for a military mission,\u201d said one of them, Andy Li, who has the nickname Brother Squirrel because he hoards stocks of his drugs.

      "bodyText": "The Barnsley Metrodome is not exactly the first place you think of when it comes to the twists and turns of women\u2019s sport. But on Saturday lunchtime, when Lisa Ashton toes the oche in a moment few darts fans would ever have imagined, it will be the latest step for a sport that has unexpectedly gained a reputation as a trailblazer for breaking down the barriers of gender discrimination at the highest level. Female darts players have competed alongside the men for years. Ashton\u2019s appearance at the PDC World Championship two years ago, when she narrowly lost to Jan Dekker in the first round, emphasised the growing quality in the women\u2019s game. But in recent months, women\u2019s darts has gained more mainstream media attention than ever before. Fallon Sherrock\u2019s memorable run at Alexandra Palace at Christmas sent darts into a new era but this weekend, when Ashton becomes the first woman to play full time on the men\u2019s PDC tour at the first events of 2020, darts will reach a new level, with a woman playing men for the same prize money in the same tournaments on a regular basis. Ashton, a four-time world champion in the British Darts Organisation, is philosophical about what becoming the first woman to come through the gruelling four-day Q School event and earn a two-year tour card means for darts. But as she explains: \u201cI don\u2019t want any special treatment. I don\u2019t want to be thought of as Lisa Ashton, the first woman to play on the men\u2019s tour. No thank you. \u201cI want to be Lisa Ashton, the dart player. If someone beats me, fair enough. Whether I\u2019m a man or a woman shouldn\u2019t come into it.\u201d She has played against men in exhibitions for years and is honest enough to admit there is still some resentment towards ladies darts in dwindling corners of the sport. \u201cThere\u2019s still a fair few male players who I think feel the pressure because they don\u2019t want to lose to a woman \u2013 hopefully that helps me out this year,\u201d she laughs. Ashton will be a full-time professional on the PDC for at least the next two years, opening the door to previously unimaginable riches. There is more than \u00a314m available each year on the PDC tour: a far cry from the recent edition of the BDO World Championship, when Ashton earned only \u00a34,500 as the runner-up. Sherrock has emerged as the face of women\u2019s darts thanks to her run at Alexandra Palace but that does not seem to bother Ashton, who has been the standard-bearer in the BDO for years and has been ready to test herself against the men for a while. \u201cI missed out by a point at Q School last year but this time I came back with the serious intention of getting a card,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the ladies game snowball in recent years and knew this was the next step, one of us getting a card.

Beans have always been a favourite in their house: \u201cThey taste great on their own or in a dish like this,\u201d Brown explains. \u201cThe basil goes deliciously with the tomatoes and beans,\u201d she says, talking about working with flavours, and adding more vegetables helps to get the kids their five a day. The no added sugar version is also something that Brown is pleased about: \u201cIt helps me keep an eye on the amount of sugar we consume in the house.\u201d</p> <p>This dish is also about ease \u2013 it\u2019s a \u201cbung it all in one\u201d dinner. Cooked in one dish, it can be simply brought to the table, and makes cleaning up a breeze. This is a dish that features on the weekends in Brown\u2019s household, when they don\u2019t have to think about work or school and can enjoy spending time together eating a meal in a relaxed way.</p> <h2>Sausage and baked bean bake</h2> <p><strong>Preparation: </strong>10 minutes<br><strong>Cooking time: </strong>40 minutes<br><strong>Total time: </strong>50 minutes<br><em>Serves: 4</em></p> <p><strong>Ingredients<br></strong>8 pork sausages<br>4 garlic cloves, skin on, lightly bashed<br>1 tbsp olive oil<br>2 red onions, cut into wedges<br>1 red pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks<br>1 green pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks<br>2 x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz<br>30g basil leaves, roughly torn<br>300g cherry tomatoes on the vine<br>Freshly cracked black pepper<br>Crusty bread to serve</p> <p><strong>Method<br></strong>Preheat your oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas mark 6.</p> <p>Add the sausages and garlic to a large, deep oven tray and drizzle with the oil.

Roz explains: \u201cMy mother made us minestrone regularly and this is an evolution of her recipe; parmesan rind was suggested by an Italian friend. And baked beans was my addition.\u201d For Zoe\u2019s recipe, it has been about making tiny tweaks. \u201cMum has the recipe nailed so it\u2019s hard to beat, but I add fried bacon, as the flavour melts into the whole dish, giving it a little extra depth and texture. Also, I add a pinch of smoked paprika to suit my Portuguese husband\u2019s palate.\u201d</p> <p>This dish is woven with personal memories. Roz tells how she grew up in the Middle East and had mainly American friends, so Heinz was a familiar brand and is reminiscent of that time. For Zoe, baked beans, and this recipe, are memories of childhood and comfort: \u201cA rainy Sunday afternoon? Soup time. Off school sick? Definitely time to bring out the big guns of Mum\u2019s minestrone. The smell of it cooking is beyond delicious, filling the house.</p> <p>\u201cWhen discussing this recipe with Mum,\u201d Zoe says, \u201cshe revealed its greatest quality \u2013 using what you have.\u201d Utilising leftovers was a key part of the family home when growing up, and an ethos Zoe has continued. This recipe is easy to adapt and uses many basic store cupboard standards \u2013 especially the beans. And, after the extravagance of Christmas, this recipe offers a nourishing and healthier alternative thanks to the no added sugar beans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"71b4d08c0df3b8afc3e93cdb39858256f74808f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71b4d08c0df3b8afc3e93cdb39858256f74808f9/0_0_5792_8688/667.jpg\" alt=\"Minestrone 042\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roz and Zoe Alyssa Cooper\u2019s minestrone soup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuki Sugiura/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Minestrone soup</h2> <p>A store cupboard classic; this is a British take on the famed Italian recipe.

This is a dish that has developed from family tradition and his rich cultural heritage. Rehncy speaks about how his love of cooking started young: \u201cMy parents are Indian but born in east Africa. Growing up in Tanzania I would spend time at my dad\u2019s Indian restaurant with the chefs in the kitchen.\u201d</p> <p>This has stood him in good stead \u2013 on a lads\u2019 getaway he cooked this dish for 20 friends; as the only one able to cook, he was responsible for making sure they were fed for the trip.</p> <p>Rehncy\u2019s mother died when he was young and all hands were on deck in the house; a memory he has is his father\u2019s Saturday tradition of a fry-up, with baked beans being a staple. One Saturday his father added a twist \u2013 onions, spices and chillies \u2013 the beginnings of this recipe. Thadka loosely means to add spice. \u201cWhen you create any Indian dish you need a base to start. Our base is the beans, and any spices added are the thadka,\u201d says Rehncy. \u201cI chose these spices because they\u2019re simple, easy and most importantly, are in every Indian household \u2013 classics.\u201d</p> <p>He says the masala beans go well with toast, eggs, or, as his wife loves them, straight out of the bowl!</p> <p>Rehncy adds that the no added sugar variant is great because most of the adults in his family are diabetic and this allows them to eat baked beans more often than not.</p> <h2>Masala thadka (pronounced thur-dka) beans</h2> <p><strong>Preparation: </strong>10<br><strong>Cooking time: </strong>25<br><strong>Total time: </strong>35<br><em>Serves: 4</em></p> <p><strong>Ingredients (per 2x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz)<br></strong>2 tbsp rapeseed oil<br>1 white onion (finely diced)<br>4 cloves garlic (finely chopped)<br>4cm piece of ginger (grated or finely chopped)<br>2 green chilli (finely chopped)<br>1 tsp turmeric<br>1 tsp cumin powder<br>1 tsp mustard seeds<br>1 tsp coriander powder<br>1 tsp garam masala powder<br>Small bunch of fresh coriander</p> <p><strong>Method<br></strong>Add the oil to a saucepan on a medium heat (enough for the tin of Heinz beans) with the oil and the mustard seeds.

Beans have always been a favourite in their house: \u201cThey taste great on their own or in a dish like this,\u201d Brown explains. \u201cThe basil goes deliciously with the tomatoes and beans,\u201d she says, talking about working with flavours, and adding more vegetables helps to get the kids their five a day. The no added sugar version is also something that Brown is pleased about: \u201cIt helps me keep an eye on the amount of sugar we consume in the house.\u201d This dish is also about ease \u2013 it\u2019s a \u201cbung it all in one\u201d dinner. Cooked in one dish, it can be simply brought to the table, and makes cleaning up a breeze. This is a dish that features on the weekends in Brown\u2019s household, when they don\u2019t have to think about work or school and can enjoy spending time together eating a meal in a relaxed way. Sausage and baked bean bake Preparation: 10 minutes Cooking time: 40 minutes Total time: 50 minutes Serves: 4 Ingredients 8 pork sausages 4 garlic cloves, skin on, lightly bashed 1 tbsp olive oil 2 red onions, cut into wedges 1 red pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks 1 green pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks 2 x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz 30g basil leaves, roughly torn 300g cherry tomatoes on the vine Freshly cracked black pepper Crusty bread to serve Method Preheat your oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas mark 6. Add the sausages and garlic to a large, deep oven tray and drizzle with the oil. Season and toss to coat. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15 minutes. Remove the tray from the oven and add the onions and peppers. Season lightly then roast for an additional 15 minutes. Remove the tray from the oven and stir through the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz and half of the basil, topping with the tomatoes. Put back in the oven and bake for a further 10 minutes or until the tomatoes just start to break down and the sausages are completely cooked through. Garnish with the remaining basil, a final twist of cracked black pepper and serve with some crusty bread. Roz and Zoe Alyssa Cooper and their minestrone soup Mother and daughter, wine writer Roz Cooper and playwriter Zoe Alyssa Cooper, from Henley, have adapted a family recipe, each adding their own twists. Roz explains: \u201cMy mother made us minestrone regularly and this is an evolution of her recipe; parmesan rind was suggested by an Italian friend. And baked beans was my addition.\u201d For Zoe\u2019s recipe, it has been about making tiny tweaks. \u201cMum has the recipe nailed so it\u2019s hard to beat, but I add fried bacon, as the flavour melts into the whole dish, giving it a little extra depth and texture. Also, I add a pinch of smoked paprika to suit my Portuguese husband\u2019s palate.\u201d This dish is woven with personal memories. Roz tells how she grew up in the Middle East and had mainly American friends, so Heinz was a familiar brand and is reminiscent of that time. For Zoe, baked beans, and this recipe, are memories of childhood and comfort: \u201cA rainy Sunday afternoon? Soup time. Off school sick? Definitely time to bring out the big guns of Mum\u2019s minestrone. The smell of it cooking is beyond delicious, filling the house. \u201cWhen discussing this recipe with Mum,\u201d Zoe says, \u201cshe revealed its greatest quality \u2013 using what you have.\u201d Utilising leftovers was a key part of the family home when growing up, and an ethos Zoe has continued. This recipe is easy to adapt and uses many basic store cupboard standards \u2013 especially the beans. And, after the extravagance of Christmas, this recipe offers a nourishing and healthier alternative thanks to the no added sugar beans. Minestrone soup A store cupboard classic; this is a British take on the famed Italian recipe. Without the optional bacon, it works as a main dish for vegetarians, and without the wine and chilli, it\u2019s a great supper for kids. Preparation: 10 minutes Cooking time: 20 minutes Total time: 30 minutes Serves: 4 as a light meal or 6 as a starter Ingredients 1 large red onion, chopped 3 garlic cloves, crushed 2 medium carrots, diced Half a red pepper, diced 1 400g tin chopped tomatoes 1 415g tin of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz 1 handful of orzo or similar small pasta Salt/freshly ground pepper Parmesan cheese (including rind) 1 tsp Heinz tomato ketchup 1 tbsp light olive oil A pinch of dried mixed herbs 1 bay leaf 1 small red chilli or a small pinch of chilli flakes (optional) 125ml wine (red or white) or 2 dsp dry vermouth (optional) 4 rashers of streaky bacon (optional) Method Sweat the onion, carrot and pepper gently in the oil for about 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaf, chilli (if using), mixed herbs and a small piece of parmesan rind. After 2 more minutes, add the wine (if using) and the can of tomatoes. Season well, taste and add ketchup as required to cut acidity. Add water to thin, if necessary; bring the mixture slowly to the boil. Add the pasta once boiling; turn down the heat to a strong simmer. Grate the fresh parmesan; if using, turn on the grill to cook the bacon. Two minutes before serving, add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz and stir; taste again. Remove the bay leaf and parmesan rind before serving. Crumble the streaky bacon; serve the soup with this and the parmesan in small side dishes. Amardeep Rehncy and his masala thadka beans Amardeep Rehncy, an accounts assistant in London\u2019s West End, grew up learning to cook from his father and older brothers. \u201cBeing in a Punjabi household, you tend to pick up what your elders do with food,\u201d Rehncy explains. This is a dish that has developed from family tradition and his rich cultural heritage. Rehncy speaks about how his love of cooking started young: \u201cMy parents are Indian but born in east Africa. Growing up in Tanzania I would spend time at my dad\u2019s Indian restaurant with the chefs in the kitchen.\u201d This has stood him in good stead \u2013 on a lads\u2019 getaway he cooked this dish for 20 friends; as the only one able to cook, he was responsible for making sure they were fed for the trip. Rehncy\u2019s mother died when he was young and all hands were on deck in the house; a memory he has is his father\u2019s Saturday tradition of a fry-up, with baked beans being a staple. One Saturday his father added a twist \u2013 onions, spices and chillies \u2013 the beginnings of this recipe. Thadka loosely means to add spice. \u201cWhen you create any Indian dish you need a base to start. Our base is the beans, and any spices added are the thadka,\u201d says Rehncy. \u201cI chose these spices because they\u2019re simple, easy and most importantly, are in every Indian household \u2013 classics.\u201d He says the masala beans go well with toast, eggs, or, as his wife loves them, straight out of the bowl! Rehncy adds that the no added sugar variant is great because most of the adults in his family are diabetic and this allows them to eat baked beans more often than not. Masala thadka (pronounced thur-dka) beans Preparation: 10 Cooking time: 25 Total time: 35 Serves: 4 Ingredients (per 2x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz) 2 tbsp rapeseed oil 1 white onion (finely diced) 4 cloves garlic (finely chopped) 4cm piece of ginger (grated or finely chopped) 2 green chilli (finely chopped) 1 tsp turmeric 1 tsp cumin powder 1 tsp mustard seeds 1 tsp coriander powder 1 tsp garam masala powder Small bunch of fresh coriander Method Add the oil to a saucepan on a medium heat (enough for the tin of Heinz beans) with the oil and the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds begin to pop (you\u2019ll hear little popping sounds), add the onion. Once the onion has started to soften, add in the ginger, garlic and chilli, cook down until the onion starts to brown slightly. Add in the cumin seeds and gently cook for another 2 minutes. Add the spices \u2013 turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder and garam masala. Cook these down on a medium to low heat for a couple of minutes just to take the harshness out. Once you see the oil separating from the \u201cmasala mix\u201d you can now add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz. Fold in the beans with the mixture until it is thoroughly mixed through and coated. Bring to a simmer, add a couple knobs of butter and mix well. Coarsely chop the coriander, move the Heinz beans to a bowl and garnish. Find out more about Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz here",

Sadly it seems more likely, given his own history and his squabbles with Nicola Sturgeon over the hosting arrangements, that Johnson will put political partisanship first and bow to pressure from the US to downplay climate concerns in return for a trade deal, and from his donors and supporters to weaken EU environmental standards so the UK economy is more competitive after Brexit. Father will not approve. But Corbyn\u2019s brother, at least, will have reason to smile. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 February 2020.

      "bodyText": "In a celebratory speech at the White House after his acquittal on impeachment charges this week, Donald Trump struck a note of complaint about having been put through \u201ca phoney rotten deal by some very evil and sick people\u201d. But the president was smiling, the assembled crowd of fawning Republicans was laughing, and the mood was buoyant. An understanding was passing between Trump and his closest supporters on Capitol Hill that three years into his presidency, he had just enjoyed a very good week \u2013 and more good news might be ahead. On Monday, Democrats failed to declare a winner in the Iowa caucuses, meant to be the first step on the road to picking someone to beat Trump in November. On Tuesday, Trump delivered a thunderous State of the Union address whose applause echoed for days in the conservative pundit-sphere. And on Wednesday, Trump watched as one Republican senator after another stood on the Senate floor and uttered the words \u201cnot guilty\u201d in response to charges that Trump had abused his power and obstructed Congress \u2013 charges that theoretically could have removed Trump from office. In the end, it was not even close. Every Republican senator but one, Mitt Romney of Utah, voted in Trump\u2019s favor, with many of them making speeches that piled on praise for Trump while raging at Democrats for attacking the man. It is by no means clear what the impeachment and acquittal will mean for Trump\u2019s re-election effort, and, given the pace of Trump\u2019s surprises and scandals, the defining issue of the day on 3 November might not yet be on the horizon. But for the moment, in the context of his storm-tossed presidency, Trump is riding high, political strategists agreed. \u201cThis is where we are today: Donald Trump is on a victory lap that could last until November, while the Democrats can\u2019t find their backside with both hands,\u201d said Michael Caputo, a Republican strategist and former Trump communications adviser. \u201cI think this is going to be a very difficult election. But I think he\u2019s destined to win.\u201d Peel back the top layer of good news for Trump last week, and underneath was \u2026 more good news. In a crucial metric for presidents seeking re-election, a historic number of Americans feel good about the economy, with 74% telling Gallup they believe they will be better off next year than they are now \u2013 the highest percentage since 1977. Friday morning brought another good jobs report. Trump\u2019s juggernaut effort to overhaul the judiciary by appointing an unprecedented number of conservative judges was also proceeding apace, with four additional confirmations last week for a grand total of 191 Trump federal judges \u2013 doubling Barack Obama\u2019s pace. About a quarter of the active judges by now have been appointed by Trump. That accomplishment was among those Trump touted in his State of the Union address before a packed House chamber on Tuesday night, in a speech that also highlighted jobs growth and a pair of newly minted international trade agreements with China and with Mexico and Canada. \u201cThree years ago, we launched the great American comeback,\u201d Trump told the audience. \u201cTonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results.\u201d Bob Dole, a former Senate majority leader and Republican presidential nominee, said Trump \u201creally hit a home run\u201d with the speech. \u201cIn my 36+ years serving in Congress,\u201d Dole wrote on Twitter, \u201cI heard quite a few #SOTU [State of the Union] addresses. This was one of the best.\u201d There was more. On Monday, the reputed pollster Gallup released a survey that showed approval of Trump at an all-time high-water mark of 49%. The failure of the Iowa Democratic party to declare a winner days after the caucuses denied any candidate a significant early boost in the primary race. But the candidate Trump seems to fear most, former vice-president Joe Biden, appears to have come in a disastrous fourth. And one candidate who performed well was Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist senator from Vermont \u2013 which some Republican officials also saw as good news for Trump. \u201cBetween the State of the Union, impeachment acquittal and Iowa caucus debacle, America got to see what a socialist train wreck the Democrat Party has become and with Bernie Sanders\u2019 pending nomination, it\u2019s only going to get worse!\u201d said Michael McAdams, national press secretary at National Republican Congressional Committee, in a direct message. Whoever Trump runs against \u2013 with the possible exception of billionaire Michael Bloomberg \u2013 his campaign is likely to enjoy a fat fundraising advantage. The Trump campaign made a record $46m cash haul in three months at the end of last year, compared with $34.5m for Sanders. The national Republican party has seven times the amount of cash on hand as Democrats. \u201cSince the president\u2019s campaign only got bigger and stronger as a result of this nonsense, this impeachment hoax will go down as the worst miscalculation in American political history,\u201d said Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, in a statement after the acquittal vote. Though he may feel that way, Trump is by no means invincible. For years he has proven incapable of expanding on a narrow base of support. The State of the Union address had poor viewership, with an audience that had shrunk 20% from the previous year, according to Nielsen. And it\u2019s a long way to November. But instead of taking steps toward coalescing around a candidate with a clear winning message, Democrats find themselves in the uncomfortable position, nine months out, divided by uncertainty and hoping for a Trump stumble. \u201cI\u2019ve known the president since 1988 and worked with him for years,\u201d said Caputo. \u201cThis is classic rebound Trump. He\u2019ll beat them and he\u2019ll beat them, until he can\u2019t beat them any more. \u201cThe Democrats have fumbled the ball, he picked it up and they may not ever get it back.\u201d",

The installation \u2013 based on the wooden horse in the ancient Greek myth of the siege of Troy \u2013 was timed to coincide with the museum\u2019s latest exhibition, Troy: Myth and Reality, which is described as \u201csupported by BP\u201d. \u201cThe Troy exhibition has inspired us to create this magnificent beast, because the Trojan horse is the perfect metaphor for BP sponsorship,\u201d said Helen Glynn, an activist with the theatrical protest group BP or not BP?. \u201cOn its surface the sponsorship looks like a generous gift, but inside lurks death and destruction.\u201d The activists have asked the museum to allow them to keep the wooden horse outside the front door until Saturday, when a bigger demonstration is planned. In a letter handed to the museum, they said: \u201cHundreds of people have helped to crowdfund this horse because they feel so strongly that the museum should not be promoting and giving legitimacy to an oil company when we are in the midst of a climate emergency. \u201cThe museum has previously said that it will facilitate peaceful protest and we want to work with you to make sure that our interactive artwork enhances tomorrow\u2019s event.\u201d The museum said it was awaiting advice from the police. Saturday\u2019s protests, which organisers say will be one of the biggest so far in the campaign against big oil\u2019s involvement in UK arts, will feature prominent voices from indigenous communities where BP has some of its operations.

I mean, come on! The UK asked for this, they pitched for this responsibility, they must carry it forward.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis needs to be an overarching priority, that needs to come across. I do not see a coherent drive for [the summit] in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK\u2019s handling of COP 26 has not become coherent enough for the UN even to be able to support them,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Robinson, the former UN high commissioner for human rights who chairs the Elders group of former world statespeople, served twice as a UN climate envoy and campaigns for climate justice.</p> <p>Her exasperation reflects a growing disquiet among some leading international experts over the UK government\u2019s leadership of the vital COP 26 summit, which remains without a figurehead after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/05/pm-under-pressure-appoint-cop-26-head-gove-tipped-job\">tumultuous week</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eccf155eee9698fe642fed071f8b1761a5ae07f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eccf155eee9698fe642fed071f8b1761a5ae07f9/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claire O\u2019Neill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire O\u2019Neill has been critical of Boris Johnson since her sacking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last Friday, the former energy minister Claire O\u2019Neill was abruptly sacked as president of the negotiations, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/saving-the-planet-uk-role-vital-if-cop-26-climate-talks-to-succeed\">key role alongside the UN in bringing countries together</a> to agree tougher limits on greenhouse gases.

      "bodyText": "The UK is showing a \u201clack of coherence\u201d in its leadership of vital UN climate crisis talks this year and giving the damaging impression that the talks are not a high priority, one of the world\u2019s leading voices on the climate crisis has said. Mary Robinson, a former UN climate envoy and Ireland\u2019s first female president, also said the perception that major British politicians, including the ex-prime minister David Cameron and former foreign secretary William Hague, were unwilling to take on the role of leading the COP 26 summit was damaging. \u201cIt is not helpful that we are getting the impression that in the UK no one wants the job. I mean, come on! The UK asked for this, they pitched for this responsibility, they must carry it forward.\u201d \u201cThis needs to be an overarching priority, that needs to come across. I do not see a coherent drive for [the summit] in the UK. \u201cThe UK\u2019s handling of COP 26 has not become coherent enough for the UN even to be able to support them,\u201d she added. Robinson, the former UN high commissioner for human rights who chairs the Elders group of former world statespeople, served twice as a UN climate envoy and campaigns for climate justice. Her exasperation reflects a growing disquiet among some leading international experts over the UK government\u2019s leadership of the vital COP 26 summit, which remains without a figurehead after a tumultuous week. Last Friday, the former energy minister Claire O\u2019Neill was abruptly sacked as president of the negotiations, the key role alongside the UN in bringing countries together to agree tougher limits on greenhouse gases. Since then, O\u2019Neill has unleashed vitriolic attacks on Boris Johnson, alleging a lack of interest in the climate crisis, while Johnson\u2019s failure to set out a clear vision of how the UK will get a deal at COP 26 has also been criticised. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge pity this is happening,\u201d said Yvo de Boer, the UN\u2019s top climate official from 2006-2010, who began the push for climate action that resulted in the 2015 Paris agreement. \u201cThe president of the COP really needs to be the force for stability in this process. You need someone in place who is reaching out to key countries to smooth this process.\u201d The sacking of O\u2019Neill reminded him of \u201ca very bad time in my life\u201d, he said, when during the Copenhagen COP in 2009 the Danish prime minister removed the serving COP president, Denmark\u2019s environment minister Connie Hedegaard, and installed himself to lead the process. That was one of the factors that doomed the Copenhagen summit to an acrimonious and chaotic end. In this case, the sacking has happened sooner \u2013 meaning \u201cthis is not irreparable\u201d, said de Boer. \u201cBut if it goes on, I think it will be damaging.\u201d Johnson must also do more to show the UK\u2019s leadership in cutting emissions, beyond the promise to reach net zero by 2050, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that the UK has domestic policies in place that allow them to inspire confidence in other countries,\u201d said de Boer. One long-time observer of COPs, who asked not to be named, said Johnson\u2019s handling of the launch, at which he failed to set out clear stepping stones to a successful outcome for COP 26 or domestic policies to reduce emissions, had hurt his standing among world leaders on the issue. \u201cThere was nothing there, it was a mess,\u201d they said. \u201cIt made me angry.\u201d However, there is still strong support for the UK\u2019s COP 26 presidency and a willingness among many leading figures to assist Johnson and the government in building the coalition of countries needed.

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola has said he hopes Lionel Messi will finish his career at Barcelona amid suggestions Manchester City want to sign the Argentinian on a free transfer in the summer. Messi\u2019s future has been questioned this week after he criticised Eric Abidal following the sporting director\u2019s claim the squad\u2019s form was behind Ernesto Valverde\u2019s sacking as head coach in January. The 32-year-old told Abidal \u201cto name names\u201d and the fallout caused speculation that Messi may leave Bar\u00e7a in the summer. Guardiola, who managed Messi at Barcelona, was asked on Friday if he might be a target for City. \u201cHe is a player from Barcelona and he will stay there, that\u2019s my wish for him to stay there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about players playing for other clubs. I think he will finish his career there, that\u2019s my wish.\u201d As for his forwards, the manager said Raheem Sterling\u2019s hamstring injury is a \u201cproblem\u201d and may cause him to miss the Champions League last-16 tie with Real Madrid. The first leg is on 26 February. \u201cIt\u2019s a hamstring injury and we will see, of course it takes weeks but we\u2019ll see before Leicester [in a fortnight], Madrid and the rest of the games. I don\u2019t know right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem, but it\u2019s a problem we had with [Ilkay] G\u00fcndogan out for six months in the first year [2016-17], and [Aymeric] Laporte this season for four or five months. It\u2019s always a problem. But it is what it is. During the season these kind of things happen unfortunately.\u201d City, who play West Ham on Sunday, are 22 points behind the Premier League leaders, Liverpool, but Guardiola pointed to City\u2019s recent successes. \u201cOne year ago they said we were unstoppable for four or five years,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cThen after two seasons of incredible success [it changes].

But there are other teams too [who can contend].\u201d City have scored 105 goals in all competitions yet failed to score in their last two matches \u2013 a 1-0 loss to Manchester United and Sunday\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Tottenham.

Fast forward a few months and he was making half-ar$ed jumps on the edge of his own box as Divock Origi set about bagging up Big Cup.

City boss Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, has got some cold water and isn\u2019t afraid to pour it, especially if rumours linking Leo Messi with a move are in the vicinity. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about players for another club,\u201d he tooted, talking about a player from another club. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to finish his career there, it\u2019s my wish.\u201d For the first time since 2010, neither Barcelona nor Real Madrid will be in the Copa del Rey final, after Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad did for the pair. They join Granada and wildly over-rated Spanish sitcom Mirand\u00e9s in the last four. Fun and games in South America dept: the Brazilian cup tie between Uni\u00e3o and Atl\u00e9tico Goianiense was delayed when officials were forced to redraw the penalty box after players noted the 18-yard line at one end was nearer a 15-yard one. And with back-to-back trips to Manchester City and Liverpool coming up, West Ham\u2019s David Moyes is bringing the motivation. \u201cAll I can say is, you play everybody twice in the league and we have got a lot of other teams to play,\u201d he chest-thumped. STILL WANT MORE? Dubai, the Maldives, Miami, LA, Marbella, Rush Green and, er, Dubai: what the Premier League is doing on its holidays during the winter break that isn\u2019t really a winter break. It was 50 years ago today that Manchester United beat Northampton 8-2 in the FA Cup. Barry Glendenning remembers when George Best ran riot with six goals. Not much Premier League to savour? There\u2019s always European football, and there are always 10 things. Some match previews for you: Everton v Palace, plus Brighton v Watford. Suzanne Wrack profiles Christine Sinclair, the Canadian with a surely unbeatable total of 186 international goals and counting. Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi together at Juventus? That and not much more in a post-window Mill. Oh, and if it\u2019s your thing \u2026 you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace. And INSTACHAT, TOO! THREAD",

      "body": "<p>Shamima Begum was unable to \u201cplay any meaningful part in her appeal\u201d, according to the British court that nevertheless decided her fate, because of the difficulties in communicating with her while she was stranded in a Syrian refugee camp.</p> <p>The 20-year-old, who fled east London to join Islamic State, was unable to contribute evidence in her own defence, as she was living, her lawyers said, in \u201csqualid\u201d and \u201cwretched\u201d conditions in the crowded al-Roj camp, guarded by Syrian Kurds.</p> <p>As a result, Begum\u2019s story \u2013 and the threat she may or may not pose if she returned to the UK \u2013 played only a small part in the largely technical deliberations of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) in a basement courtroom.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Siac\u2019s decision on Friday \u2013 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/shamima-begum-loses-appeal-against-removal-of-citizenship\">Begum was not rendered stateless</a> by the previous home secretary Sajid Javid last year \u2013 built on the fact that Home Office lawyers had argued she was too dangerous to be allowed to return to the country of her birth.</p> <p>Aged 15, Begum ran away from home and school in Bethnal Green with two friends, stealing an older sister\u2019s passport to reach Syria as Islamic State emerged from the wreckage of the country\u2019s civil war.</p> <p>Begum soon married a 23-year-old Isis fighter called Yago Riedijk, from the Dutch city of Arnhem. Over the next three years the couple had two children, both of whom had died, and Begum was nine months pregnant with their third when, last February, she was rediscovered in another refugee camp <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/shamima-begum-bring-me-home-says-bethnal-green-girl-who-fled-to-join-isis-hgvqw765d\">by a journalist from the Times</a>.</p> <p>Begum had fled the battle of Baghuz, where Isis was making its last stand. \u201cI don\u2019t regret coming here,\u201d she said, referring to her original decision to travel to Syria, but added: \u201cNow all I want to do is to come home to Britain.\u201d</p> <p>Six days later, Javid revoked her British citizenship, arguing that she had the right to take Bangladeshi citizenship via her parents, even though she had never visited the country and did not speak its official language, Bengali.</p> <p>Begum was one of more than 100 Britons who travelled to join Isis to be treated this way, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/19/isis-briton-shamima-begum-to-have-uk-citizenship-revoked\">Javid argued in front of MPs that his response was rational</a>. \u201cWhatever role they took in the so-called caliphate, they all supported a terrorist organisation and in doing so they have shown they hate our country and the values we stand for,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Shortly after Javid\u2019s decision, Begum gave birth to a son, Jarrah. But disease was rife in the insanitary conditions of the sprawling al-Hawl camp where they were living. It was labelled the \u201ccamp of death\u201d because so many children had died there, and Jarrah became one of them, contracting pneumonia and dying 10 days later.</p> <p>The national security argument heard in court was that Begum had aligned with the Islamist group not only by travelling to Syria but by remaining until nearly the last days of the self-styled caliphate, thus showing a high degree of commitment to it.</p> <p>Security sources have gone further, suggesting Begum was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/13/shamima-begum-cruel-enforcer-isils-morality-police-say-syrian/\">a member of al-Hisba, Isis\u2019s morality police</a>, during which time she carried a Kalashnikov and had a reputation for strictness. Begum also allegedly \u201cstitched suicide bombers into explosive vests\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Shamima Begum was unable to \u201cplay any meaningful part in her appeal\u201d, according to the British court that nevertheless decided her fate, because of the difficulties in communicating with her while she was stranded in a Syrian refugee camp. The 20-year-old, who fled east London to join Islamic State, was unable to contribute evidence in her own defence, as she was living, her lawyers said, in \u201csqualid\u201d and \u201cwretched\u201d conditions in the crowded al-Roj camp, guarded by Syrian Kurds. As a result, Begum\u2019s story \u2013 and the threat she may or may not pose if she returned to the UK \u2013 played only a small part in the largely technical deliberations of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) in a basement courtroom. Nevertheless, Siac\u2019s decision on Friday \u2013 that Begum was not rendered stateless by the previous home secretary Sajid Javid last year \u2013 built on the fact that Home Office lawyers had argued she was too dangerous to be allowed to return to the country of her birth. Aged 15, Begum ran away from home and school in Bethnal Green with two friends, stealing an older sister\u2019s passport to reach Syria as Islamic State emerged from the wreckage of the country\u2019s civil war. Begum soon married a 23-year-old Isis fighter called Yago Riedijk, from the Dutch city of Arnhem. Over the next three years the couple had two children, both of whom had died, and Begum was nine months pregnant with their third when, last February, she was rediscovered in another refugee camp by a journalist from the Times. Begum had fled the battle of Baghuz, where Isis was making its last stand. \u201cI don\u2019t regret coming here,\u201d she said, referring to her original decision to travel to Syria, but added: \u201cNow all I want to do is to come home to Britain.\u201d Six days later, Javid revoked her British citizenship, arguing that she had the right to take Bangladeshi citizenship via her parents, even though she had never visited the country and did not speak its official language, Bengali. Begum was one of more than 100 Britons who travelled to join Isis to be treated this way, and Javid argued in front of MPs that his response was rational. \u201cWhatever role they took in the so-called caliphate, they all supported a terrorist organisation and in doing so they have shown they hate our country and the values we stand for,\u201d he said. Shortly after Javid\u2019s decision, Begum gave birth to a son, Jarrah. But disease was rife in the insanitary conditions of the sprawling al-Hawl camp where they were living. It was labelled the \u201ccamp of death\u201d because so many children had died there, and Jarrah became one of them, contracting pneumonia and dying 10 days later. The national security argument heard in court was that Begum had aligned with the Islamist group not only by travelling to Syria but by remaining until nearly the last days of the self-styled caliphate, thus showing a high degree of commitment to it. Security sources have gone further, suggesting Begum was a member of al-Hisba, Isis\u2019s morality police, during which time she carried a Kalashnikov and had a reputation for strictness. Begum also allegedly \u201cstitched suicide bombers into explosive vests\u201d. These are all claims the intelligence community stands by, arguing that women are as capable as men of actively participating in a violent regime. In the citizenship hearing, Begum\u2019s lawyers said it was difficult to obtain information from their client that would enable them to comprehensively defend her. \u201cIt is not possible to take instructions on her intentions, the circumstances in which she left, what she has been doing, family relations and so forth,\u201d her barrister, Tom Hickman QC, said during the four-day hearing in October. The exact truth may never be properly examined, given the immigration tribunal\u2019s verdict on Friday. However, if Begum were to win her appeal against it, and somehow return to the UK, security sources have indicated she would almost certainly face a terrorism trial. That said, they argue, it would be difficult to obtain evidence from Syria that could stand up in a British court. The likelihood is that the most serious charge that could be levied against her would be membership of a banned organisation, Isis, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. Less than a week after the terrorist stabbing in Streatham, and with ministers also pushing through emergency legislation to end mandatory halfway release for terror offenders, Conservative politicians feel their hard line on Begum is not only justified but politically popular. More broadly, the government is refusing to repatriate any of the 60 or so men and women from the UK being held in prisons and camps in Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria \u2013 and depriving them of citizenship where possible. In one case, the Home Office is willing to allow four children, all under 10, to return to the UK, but only if their parents, both whom who have had their citizenship stripped, give them up. It fell to Begum\u2019s lawyers to make an alternative argument. Daniel Furner, of Birnberg Peirce, said some other countries \u201cdealing with similar cases, in particular of very young women, have found safe, sensible and humane ways of returning and reintegrating their citizens quietly, and with expert advice, into a normal existence\u201d. Legal proceedings, Furner concluded, \u201cfail to provide swift and practical answers to such acute human predicaments as this\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The Scottish government faces fresh questions about the Derek Mackay scandal after it emerged it challenged the Sun\u2019s right to publish revelations about his private messages with a schoolboy. Mackay resigned on Wednesday night after the Sun told him and Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, it was publishing some of the 270 messages he sent to the 16-year-old between August last year and 1 February. Mackay told the unnamed schoolboy he was \u201creally cute\u201d, invited him to dinner and to a Scottish parliament event. Opposition leaders and senior Scottish National party figures said the messages were tantamount to grooming, and predatory. Sturgeon said in a statement on Thursday: \u201cI think the conduct is unacceptable and I will not make any attempt to say otherwise or to minimise in any way its seriousness. Based on what I knew about this last night, it was clear to me then that Derek Mackay\u2019s conduct fell far short of what is expected of a minister.\u201d Sturgeon, who is also the SNP leader, told MSPs that Mackay had been suspended from the party. \u201cI say very clearly that I am not aware of any further allegations or any conduct of a similar nature,\u201d she added. As further claims about Mackay\u2019s private life came to light, it emerged that on Wednesday Sturgeon\u2019s office had disputed the Sun\u2019s right to publish the story. Mackay, until then her highly trusted and powerful finance secretary, was due to deliver the Scottish government\u2019s annual budget on Thursday afternoon, setting out billions of pounds in new spending. Two hours after it alerted Sturgeon\u2019s office to the story, the Sun said, her office emailed the paper to claim that publication could be an intrusion into private and family life. The email asked for a guarantee the messages were obtained legally and said the Sun was morally obliged to pass them all to the government. The email said: \u201cGiven you yourself state that there is nothing illegal or unlawful in the messages, can you advise on your justification for publication, given the intrusion into private and family life, and correspondence including digital communication.\u201d The Sun was asked to confirm in writing \u201cthat the material has been obtained by legitimate means\u201d, and for \u201cthe material you are basing this story on to be emailed across to us as soon as possible\u201d. The government said the Sun had a \u201cmoral obligation to share this material in order for us to be in a position to offer any form of substantive response or view\u201d. The Sun insisted that Alan Muir, its Scottish editor, had read out the most significant and damaging messages to Sturgeon\u2019s office in two 15-minute phone conversations at 5.50pm and 6.40pm. Sturgeon\u2019s officials believed they were justified in asking these questions, and in asking for written evidence, because of the seriousness and significance of the allegations. Mackay was allowed to resign later that evening and the Scottish government refused to provide the paper with a response. The Sun published its main story online at 11pm on Wednesday. Until 2018 Mackay was the SNP\u2019s national chairman and business convenor, and in charge of running party conferences. There was gossip within the party about his flirtatious behaviour after hours during conference. The Record reported that Mackay had sent private Facebook messages to a 21-year-old activist, Shaun Cameron, in September 2017 asking whether he had any \u201cnaughty pictures\u201d and suggesting they meet at Mackay\u2019s Edinburgh flat. Another former SNP staff member told the Herald that Mackay was ordered by Sturgeon to stop partying and drinking at conferences after his behaviour was discussed in internal meetings. He allegedly quipped during one conference in 2017 that delegates would not see him in the bar that night because \u201cNicola won\u2019t let me\u201d. Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative leader, said the allegations raised substantial questions for the Scottish government and SNP to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s vital the SNP leadership, instead of spinning, acts to establish a complete picture,\u201d Carlaw said. \u201cThere has been a collective failure of leadership both from the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and the current SNP business convener, Kirsten Oswald. Both now need to respond and act with far greater urgency and understanding.\u201d The government could have set up a hotline to report other concerns about Mackay\u2019s conduct, he added. The Scottish parliament did so after allegations about misconduct by MSPs emerged in 2018. An SNP spokesperson said: \u201cDerek Mackay has been suspended from both the parliamentary group and the party while further investigation takes place. In the interests of due process, no further comment will be made.\u201d Mackay has been approached for comment.",

      "body": "<p>The meticulousness with which even the lowliest football clubs prepare for matches these days makes Northampton\u2019s meeting the day before their FA Cup fifth-round game against Manchester United 50 years ago seem endearingly quaint. Convening in the County Ground boardroom for sherry, the fourth division side\u2019s players were on a promise of a \u00a315-a-man bonus if they could beat their top-flight opponents. Hopeful of an upset, they settled down to be briefed by the club\u2019s scouting department, an elderly local gentleman who had gone to watch United\u2019s most recent match.</p> <p>Facing players of the calibre of Paddy Crerand, Bobby Charlton and Brian Kidd the prognosis was bleak, he told them, but if they could \u201cnobble\u201d Charlton they might have a chance. Sadly, Northampton\u2019s reconnaissance man failed to mention that a 23-year-old by the name of George Best would probably be lining up against them, as the Ballon d\u2019Or and European Cup winner had been serving a month-long ban when the scouting mission was carried out. It would prove, with the benefit of hindsight, quite the oversight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/07/how-premier-league-clubs-are-using-their-winter-break-this-month\">How Premier League clubs are using their winter break this month</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some weeks previously, Best had incurred the wrath of the Football Association for kicking the ball out of referee Jack Taylor\u2019s hands at the end of a League Cup match against Manchester City and been suspended for a month. It was a punishment the mercurial midfielder deemed excessive and attributed to the FA\u2019s disapproval of his playboy lifestyle. He was further peeved by mutterings that during a subsequent five-match unbeaten streak, Manchester United were much improved in his absence.</p> <p>\u201cWhile I\u2019ve been suspended I\u2019ve had letters from cranks saying that the team played better without me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt if we were beaten by Northampton, people would say it was my fault.\u201d</p> <p>Despite struggling against their lowly rivals for the first 20 minutes of the game played on 7 February 1970, United ran out 8-2 winners. Best, on a mission to prove his detractors wrong, chipped in with the winning margin of six goals. \u201cI don\u2019t really class myself as a footballer,\u201d he said in the aftermath of the game. \u201cI call myself an entertainer. I know a lot of people have paid to see me do something spectacular and that\u2019s what I was trying to do on Saturday. It\u2019s my job to do something that will send people away feeling that they\u2019d like to see me play again.\u201d</p> <p>And how. Putting his heroics into context in the following Monday\u2019s Guardian, Albert Barham revealed that Best was the fourth player to score six in an FA Cup match. His double hat-trick wasn\u2019t even a record, he noted, as Bill Minter had scored seven for St Albans against Dulwich Hamlet in the fourth qualifying round in 1922 \u2013 and still finished on the losing side. A little under two years later, Ted MacDougall would eclipse these feats by scoring nine for Bournemouth in an 11-0 first-round win over Margate.</p> <p>In the Observer the day after United\u2019s win<strong>, </strong>John Heilpern had been effusive in his praise for Best. \u201cHis unique contribution made the suggestion that United play better without him look simply insane,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo have seen Best score those six goals is to have seen genius.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c24cfb96e0621ef4e1c04f6db9f221e7faed63e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c24cfb96e0621ef4e1c04f6db9f221e7faed63e6/0_273_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Best heads his and Manchester United\u2019s first goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Best heads his and Manchester United\u2019s first goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Archive/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A capacity crowd of 21,711 was wedged into Northampton\u2019s three-sided stadium, but few had a better view of their team\u2019s main tormentor than Kim Book, the Northampton goalkeeper. \u201cI have to hold my hand up for two of the goals but the rest were brilliant,\u201d he later conceded. \u201cWhen the fourth went in I thought we might just have our backs to the wall. They were a tremendous side. We all felt it was just an honour to be on the same park.\u201d Book, the brother of Manchester City\u2019s captain, Tony, had received a pre-match call from his sibling. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t got anyone who can take care of George, you might have a bit of a problem,\u201d he was advised.</p> <p>On match day, the sun was out but the County Ground was a quagmire, with the pitch markings practically indiscernible and barely a blade of grass to be seen. Best, unfazed by the uneven terrain on which he was forced to work his magic, at times seemed to glide above it as he set about almost single-handedly dismantling the Cobblers.</p> <p>His opener was a gift, Book letting a Kidd cross from the right sail over his outstretched arms and leaving United\u2019s No 7 with a straightforward back-post header towards the Hotel End. Latching on to a through ball from Crerand, the faintest of touches took him past Book before he fired a low diagonal shot into the corner for his second. Kidd, who scored United\u2019s other two goals, turned provider again for goal number three, with Book weakly palming his cross into the path of Best, who roofed it at the second attempt despite the best efforts of three defenders attempting to block its path from six yards. No longer bothering to celebrate, he converted another Kidd cross after getting in front of his man to skim a deft near-post header home for his fourth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b19b36309c1dc597ea1eeb24dd71b2453d60e110\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b19b36309c1dc597ea1eeb24dd71b2453d60e110/0_524_2877_1727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This George Best effort was blocked but from the rebound he scored his third goal in the mud at the County Ground.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This George Best effort was blocked but from the rebound he scored his third goal in the mud at the County Ground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Webb/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Northampton, 5-0 down after Kidd added to United\u2019s tally by stabbing home from a corner, decided to implement their original gameplan by nobbling Charlton, who was forced off with an injury and replaced by Francis Burns. Joining his muddied colleagues, the substitute cut a decidedly incongruous figure in his pristine red and white kit as, with his first touch, he sent Best haring through the middle past two defenders before slotting his fifth and United\u2019s sixth past the increasingly forlorn Book.</p> <p>An exchange of goals \u2013 Kidd\u2019s second and a consolation for Northampton\u2019s Dixie McNeill \u2013 preceded the pick of Best\u2019s half-dozen. Collecting a pass from Crerand on the edge of the penalty area, he ghosted past a defender with a little feint and left Book on his backside gazing in admiration as he spanked home his sixth from a couple of yards. Exhausted, he leaned against the adjacent upright for support as the home crowd acknowledged his genius.</p> <p>\u201cI remember thinking George was going to go one way but he dropped his shoulder and went the other and by then I was already on the deck,\u201d Book recalled. \u201cHe was just too good for me.\u201d A subsequent Frank Large header doubled Northampton\u2019s tally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b73eeb901b460ca00955631b26e87198240be147\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b73eeb901b460ca00955631b26e87198240be147/0_1104_4194_3082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Best at Northampton, whose dressing room he visited after the game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Best at Northampton, whose dressing room he visited after the game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Northampton\u2019s chairman, a local pharmacist by the name of Eric Northover, was not as magnanimous as his players or the home crowd. \u201cIt was disgraceful,\u201d he fumed. \u201cTo lose 8-2 on your own ground is unforgivable. Six of the Best? I would call them six of the easiest.\u201d In the immediate aftermath of a performance that would earn Best an invitation to 10 Downing Street from the prime minister, Harold Wilson, Best and Crerand adjourned to the Northampton dressing room to commiserate with their traumatised opponents. \u201cThey sat down with us and George said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it, mate. There wasn\u2019t much you could do.\u2019 He was a gentleman,\u201d Book recalled. Floating above a Northampton bog on a February afternoon a half-century ago, there was little or nothing George Best could not do.</p>",

Convening in the County Ground boardroom for sherry, the fourth division side\u2019s players were on a promise of a \u00a315-a-man bonus if they could beat their top-flight opponents. Hopeful of an upset, they settled down to be briefed by the club\u2019s scouting department, an elderly local gentleman who had gone to watch United\u2019s most recent match. Facing players of the calibre of Paddy Crerand, Bobby Charlton and Brian Kidd the prognosis was bleak, he told them, but if they could \u201cnobble\u201d Charlton they might have a chance. Sadly, Northampton\u2019s reconnaissance man failed to mention that a 23-year-old by the name of George Best would probably be lining up against them, as the Ballon d\u2019Or and European Cup winner had been serving a month-long ban when the scouting mission was carried out. It would prove, with the benefit of hindsight, quite the oversight. Some weeks previously, Best had incurred the wrath of the Football Association for kicking the ball out of referee Jack Taylor\u2019s hands at the end of a League Cup match against Manchester City and been suspended for a month. It was a punishment the mercurial midfielder deemed excessive and attributed to the FA\u2019s disapproval of his playboy lifestyle. He was further peeved by mutterings that during a subsequent five-match unbeaten streak, Manchester United were much improved in his absence. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve been suspended I\u2019ve had letters from cranks saying that the team played better without me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt if we were beaten by Northampton, people would say it was my fault.\u201d Despite struggling against their lowly rivals for the first 20 minutes of the game played on 7 February 1970, United ran out 8-2 winners. Best, on a mission to prove his detractors wrong, chipped in with the winning margin of six goals. \u201cI don\u2019t really class myself as a footballer,\u201d he said in the aftermath of the game. \u201cI call myself an entertainer. I know a lot of people have paid to see me do something spectacular and that\u2019s what I was trying to do on Saturday. It\u2019s my job to do something that will send people away feeling that they\u2019d like to see me play again.\u201d And how. Putting his heroics into context in the following Monday\u2019s Guardian, Albert Barham revealed that Best was the fourth player to score six in an FA Cup match. His double hat-trick wasn\u2019t even a record, he noted, as Bill Minter had scored seven for St Albans against Dulwich Hamlet in the fourth qualifying round in 1922 \u2013 and still finished on the losing side. A little under two years later, Ted MacDougall would eclipse these feats by scoring nine for Bournemouth in an 11-0 first-round win over Margate. In the Observer the day after United\u2019s win, John Heilpern had been effusive in his praise for Best. \u201cHis unique contribution made the suggestion that United play better without him look simply insane,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo have seen Best score those six goals is to have seen genius.\u201d A capacity crowd of 21,711 was wedged into Northampton\u2019s three-sided stadium, but few had a better view of their team\u2019s main tormentor than Kim Book, the Northampton goalkeeper. \u201cI have to hold my hand up for two of the goals but the rest were brilliant,\u201d he later conceded. \u201cWhen the fourth went in I thought we might just have our backs to the wall. They were a tremendous side. We all felt it was just an honour to be on the same park.\u201d Book, the brother of Manchester City\u2019s captain, Tony, had received a pre-match call from his sibling. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t got anyone who can take care of George, you might have a bit of a problem,\u201d he was advised. On match day, the sun was out but the County Ground was a quagmire, with the pitch markings practically indiscernible and barely a blade of grass to be seen. Best, unfazed by the uneven terrain on which he was forced to work his magic, at times seemed to glide above it as he set about almost single-handedly dismantling the Cobblers. His opener was a gift, Book letting a Kidd cross from the right sail over his outstretched arms and leaving United\u2019s No 7 with a straightforward back-post header towards the Hotel End. Latching on to a through ball from Crerand, the faintest of touches took him past Book before he fired a low diagonal shot into the corner for his second. Kidd, who scored United\u2019s other two goals, turned provider again for goal number three, with Book weakly palming his cross into the path of Best, who roofed it at the second attempt despite the best efforts of three defenders attempting to block its path from six yards. No longer bothering to celebrate, he converted another Kidd cross after getting in front of his man to skim a deft near-post header home for his fourth. Northampton, 5-0 down after Kidd added to United\u2019s tally by stabbing home from a corner, decided to implement their original gameplan by nobbling Charlton, who was forced off with an injury and replaced by Francis Burns. Joining his muddied colleagues, the substitute cut a decidedly incongruous figure in his pristine red and white kit as, with his first touch, he sent Best haring through the middle past two defenders before slotting his fifth and United\u2019s sixth past the increasingly forlorn Book. An exchange of goals \u2013 Kidd\u2019s second and a consolation for Northampton\u2019s Dixie McNeill \u2013 preceded the pick of Best\u2019s half-dozen. Collecting a pass from Crerand on the edge of the penalty area, he ghosted past a defender with a little feint and left Book on his backside gazing in admiration as he spanked home his sixth from a couple of yards. Exhausted, he leaned against the adjacent upright for support as the home crowd acknowledged his genius. \u201cI remember thinking George was going to go one way but he dropped his shoulder and went the other and by then I was already on the deck,\u201d Book recalled. \u201cHe was just too good for me.\u201d A subsequent Frank Large header doubled Northampton\u2019s tally. Northampton\u2019s chairman, a local pharmacist by the name of Eric Northover, was not as magnanimous as his players or the home crowd. \u201cIt was disgraceful,\u201d he fumed. \u201cTo lose 8-2 on your own ground is unforgivable. Six of the Best? I would call them six of the easiest.\u201d In the immediate aftermath of a performance that would earn Best an invitation to 10 Downing Street from the prime minister, Harold Wilson, Best and Crerand adjourned to the Northampton dressing room to commiserate with their traumatised opponents. \u201cThey sat down with us and George said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it, mate. There wasn\u2019t much you could do.\u2019 He was a gentleman,\u201d Book recalled. Floating above a Northampton bog on a February afternoon a half-century ago, there was little or nothing George Best could not do.",

Sadly, Tyrrell\u2019s says it won\u2019t be making much semillon this year. Bird in Hand Sparkling Pinot Noir \u00a315 Booths \u00a315.50 Tanners, \u00a315.99 Waitrose, 12.5%. Charming, pale pink, sparkling fizz from one of the Adelaide Hills wineries affected \u2013 though thankfully not too badly \u2013 by the fires. Perfect for Valentines Day, too. Exquisite Clare Valley Riesling \u00a36.99 Aldi, 11.5%. Joyously limey, consistently delicious, this is one of the best wines in the Aldi range \u2013 try it with Thai noodle salad. Ebenezer &amp; Seppeltsfield Shiraz 2018 \u00a314 Marks &amp; Spencer, 15%. Lush, old-school Barossa shiraz that\u2019s really worth tucking away for a good few years (say, five to six). It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, yes, but this is perfect with barbecue fare. \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com",

We used to go on holiday in Blackpool and the bingo caller was a drag queen called Neville. He\u2019d shout \u201cLegs Eeeeeleven\u201d and give everyone a wink. The funniest word \u2026 \u201cFiscal\u201d. They kept using it in the run-up to the election and it sounds proper saucy. Like a safe word from a terribly written erotic novel. The funniest joke I\u2019ve ever heard \u2026 Victoria Wood: \u201cI once went to one of those parties where everyone throws their car keys into the middle of the room. I don\u2019t know who got my moped but I\u2019ve been driving that Peugeot for years.\u201d Maisie Adam plays Nottingham, Sat; Brighton, Tue",

Joshua Spencer, who received a character reference from the Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns, attended Cooper\u2019s general election count in December as a representative of the Conservative party despite being under investigation by West Yorkshire police after his arrest. The unemployed 25-year-old, a constituent of Cooper\u2019s, was arrested in April last year and stood for the Conservatives in May\u2019s local elections. Spencer pleaded guilty in January to sending malicious messages about Cooper, a former work and pensions secretary who has been MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford since 1997. On Friday he was sentenced to nine weeks in prison and given a restraining order preventing him from contacting Cooper or her former office manager, Jade Boterill, for 10 years. The Tories said \u201cwe extend our sympathies\u201d to Cooper and said Spencer has now been expelled from the party. In a message sent last April to a man he met on a dating website, Spencer suggested Cooper should \u201cpay\u201d for trying to thwart a no-deal Brexit, after MPs voted to stop the UK leaving the EU on 29 March 2019 as planned. \u201cWe should have left no deal on the 29th before the whore Yvette got her hands on to it and voted to revoke democracy.

She said: \u201cI have asked the Conservative party what action they took last year after the investigation began, why Mr Spencer was still able to attend the general election count as their representative ... whether anyone locally or nationally in the party had raised concerns about his behaviour or position and what action they are taking now.\u201d As he was being handcuffed, Spencer said he was \u201cextremely sorry\u201d for what he had done and insisted he never intended to hurt Cooper.

It was the day after his birthday and he was having suicidal thoughts that his father was not there to help him celebrate, Amin said. Jenkyns, who defeated Cooper\u2019s husband, Ed Balls, in the Morley and Outwood constituency in 2015, gave a statement to Leeds magistrates court defending Spencer. In the statement read to the court on Friday, she said Spencer was \u201ca decent and honest person whose heart is in the right place and who always helps people in need\u201d. She said she did not condone what he had done but claimed he had been \u201clet down by the system\u201d and desperately needed help for his mental health problems, including biopolar disorder and suicidal thoughts. As well as attending the count in Cooper\u2019s constituency, at which the Labour MP was present, Spencer was at the \u201cBig Brexit Bash\u201d organised by Jenkyns in Morley on 31 January. In an additional statement, Jenkyns said: \u201cI stand by my decision to have given him a personal reference.\u201d Noting that he had bipolar disorder and saying that she was concerned about his mental health issues, she added: \u201cI will be seeking assurances that he will get the support he clearly needs as part of his rehabilitation.\u201d In a victim impact statement read to the court, Cooper said Spencer was well-known to her and her constituency staff.

But this behaviour is not normal, and we must never treat it as so.\u201d At least 10 people have been cautioned for making threats against Cooper, according to her staff.

In a statement read to the court, Boterill described how she worked for Cooper for six years and loved her job but quit last June because of the threats she received on Cooper\u2019s behalf.

Here, one of them, a 32-year-old English teacher who has lived in Wuhan for the last four years, describes what it has been like living under quarantine.</p> \n<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> \n<p>This morning we were all given a note saying that someone on the second evacuation flight fell ill on the plane and was taken straight to hospital for tests. A couple of people asked if they were OK, but it didn\u2019t cause a panic or anything.

I think the people running this place were expecting loads of families, so they bought loads of games consoles, but there are only three or four children here. So suddenly there were all these brand new games consoles up for grabs \u2013 my friend snatched one up and I haven\u2019t really seen him since.</p> \n<p>What happens to these consoles when we get out of here? I don\u2019t think anyone took a record of who\u2019s got one and I really don\u2019t think anyone will be counting them back in. I hope they get donated to children\u2019s wards or something. It would be great if I could have a laptop of my own. If they gave me Football Manager \u2013 or something you can really get your teeth in to \u2013 the time would fly by.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> \n<p>I woke up and had a bath \u2013 I don\u2019t have a bath in China so that\u2019s quite a nice thing.</p> \n<p>Some local people have donated books to us. I\u2019m a big reader but these are rubbish. That sounds really ungrateful but, I mean, they\u2019re terrible. There\u2019s not even a Dan Brown. Say what you like about Dan Brown \u2013 that guy sold a lot of books \u2013 but these are by people you\u2019ve never heard of.</p> \n<p>I think the place is run by a private company on behalf of the NHS. You can email an order to them and two hours later whatever you asked for shows up. There\u2019s a guy who has ordered bottles of wine, spirits and two crates of beer and he\u2019s keeping them in his bedroom. Tonight he offered me some wine. I felt like I was going into a bar. He gave me a paper cup full of wine. I thought: \u201cAre you kidding me? This is ridiculous!\u201d He\u2019s ordered all of it through this company and they\u2019ve given it to him for free, no questions asked. It\u2019s incredible.</p> \n<p>I watched some daytime BBC soap operas today \u2013 Doctors, it was unbelievably stupid. Christ, that was the highlight of the day \u2013 that\u2019s bleak!</p> \n<p>There is a communal area but people don\u2019t seem to be using it. I\u2019m keeping mostly to myself. I sat with one of my colleagues from Wuhan while he watched some old episodes of Oz, but we\u2019re all just doing the same thing.</p> \n<p>This diary isn\u2019t going to be very interesting, unless someone develops symptoms, which you never know. We\u2019re right in the middle of the optimum time to start showing symptoms, assuming that you got infected on the flight \u2013 I think if anyone is infected that\u2019s probably when it happened.</p> \n<p>People are just counting the time, in any way they can.</p> \n<h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> \n<p>I slept for most of the day today. I seem to be sleeping a lot since I got back here. It\u2019s 7.35pm now and I\u2019ll probably be asleep by 10pm. In my whole life it\u2019s very unusual for me to go to sleep before midnight. Maybe it\u2019s the jet lag but we\u2019ve been back almost a week now.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve got through most of JG Ballard\u2019s short stories now \u2013 I\u2019m reading about seven of those a day \u2013 and I\u2019m watching loads of YouTube videos.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve also been walking the stairs for exercise. You can go outside. There is a garden, but it\u2019s a stone garden, there\u2019s no grass or anything so I\u2019ve been walking up the stairs to my bedroom on the seventh floor \u2013 it\u2019s the only way I can see of getting any exercise. I don\u2019t exercise normally \u2013 I\u2019m notoriously lazy \u2013 but I do try to walk the hour home from my work in Wuhan if the weather\u2019s not bad, just to say that I did.</p> \n<p>The guy who ordered the booze has got even more now. He\u2019s getting more alcohol delivered than any reasonable person could drink every day, and he doesn\u2019t seem to drink it. I think he\u2019s hoarding it to have a party when he gets back home or something. It\u2019s weird.</p> \n<p>My friend says he\u2019s getting really good at Fifa now and I\u2019m still keeping to myself. Everyone else seems to be fine, nobody seems to be ill, which is the main thing.</p> \n<h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27223d24ff470cb696c410d43780424b6652b67b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27223d24ff470cb696c410d43780424b6652b67b/0_133_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bacon breakfast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No more bacon breakfast</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Roddis/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some idiot has complained about the breakfasts. Up until this morning, breakfast has been really good \u2013 a banging bacon and sausage sandwich. That\u2019s the way to start the day, especially when you can\u2019t get good bacon in China. But somebody complained about always having the same thing every day so when I went downstairs for breakfast, there were these dismal-looking Danish pastries, some rubbish-looking Dutch cheese and some salami. I thought: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d When you\u2019re in quarantine, you don\u2019t have much to look forward to. Meals are a big thing \u2013 and then the thing you look forward to has been replaced by a fairly poor effort at a continental breakfast. I don\u2019t know if breakfast is worth going down for anymore.</p> \n<p>We got a release date. As long as nobody\u2019s showing symptoms, we can leave on Thursday morning. I feel good because I was expecting to leave the Saturday after, so that\u2019s two days gained. As of Sunday, it will become very unlikely that anyone will start to show symptoms, so we should know by then if we\u2019ll be leaving on Thursday.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s a huge gender imbalance here. There are far more men than women, and I don\u2019t think there are many single ladies, so as far as I know there are no romances blossoming. But people are organising nightly dinners now. You can\u2019t order takeaways anymore but you can still order food from supermarkets and people have started cooking in their rooms and inviting people to join. As of yet, I haven\u2019t gone because I don\u2019t particularly know them and I want to stay healthy. I\u2019m not worried that I\u2019ll get ill, but it increases the chance. I sit with people I know for half an hour a day to stop me from going insane, but I think it\u2019s best to keep the number of people I interact with small.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"89cc69a6-7caf-46d2-b8e6-1ec5399094b8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qmYoeQGqLas?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> \n<p>Breakfast was back to normal this morning, fortunately. They\u2019ve done a good compromise \u2013 they still had the rubbish, but they put the good stuff back as well. It gets the day off to a flying start.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m 12 hours closer to getting out of here. I have potentially less than a week left in quarantine but it could all go wrong. If somebody develops symptoms between now and Thursday, who knows what\u2019s going to happen. We might all be back to square one \u2013 potentially back to 14 days in quarantine. Nobody\u2019s actually said that but I do know that if anyone displays symptoms we\u2019re not getting out of here on Thursday. And hopefully time goes quickly and they start giving us some ideas of how we get to where we\u2019re going, because I only have Chinese money on me.</p> \n<p>When I do get out, I\u2019m going to see a friend who lives not too far away, and then I\u2019ll travel down south to see my family \u2013 I last saw them a year ago in Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>Going back to Wuhan has not been discussed. The rent is paid on my apartment for a few months, so there\u2019s no rush, but I\u2019ve left my degree and teaching certificates and other things behind, so I will have to go back to Wuhan at some point. I don\u2019t think Wuhan will go back to normal for a while.</p>",

I thought: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d When you\u2019re in quarantine, you don\u2019t have much to look forward to. Meals are a big thing \u2013 and then the thing you look forward to has been replaced by a fairly poor effort at a continental breakfast. I don\u2019t know if breakfast is worth going down for anymore. We got a release date. As long as nobody\u2019s showing symptoms, we can leave on Thursday morning. I feel good because I was expecting to leave the Saturday after, so that\u2019s two days gained. As of Sunday, it will become very unlikely that anyone will start to show symptoms, so we should know by then if we\u2019ll be leaving on Thursday. There\u2019s a huge gender imbalance here. There are far more men than women, and I don\u2019t think there are many single ladies, so as far as I know there are no romances blossoming. But people are organising nightly dinners now. You can\u2019t order takeaways anymore but you can still order food from supermarkets and people have started cooking in their rooms and inviting people to join. As of yet, I haven\u2019t gone because I don\u2019t particularly know them and I want to stay healthy. I\u2019m not worried that I\u2019ll get ill, but it increases the chance. I sit with people I know for half an hour a day to stop me from going insane, but I think it\u2019s best to keep the number of people I interact with small. Friday Breakfast was back to normal this morning, fortunately. They\u2019ve done a good compromise \u2013 they still had the rubbish, but they put the good stuff back as well. It gets the day off to a flying start. I\u2019m 12 hours closer to getting out of here. I have potentially less than a week left in quarantine but it could all go wrong. If somebody develops symptoms between now and Thursday, who knows what\u2019s going to happen. We might all be back to square one \u2013 potentially back to 14 days in quarantine. Nobody\u2019s actually said that but I do know that if anyone displays symptoms we\u2019re not getting out of here on Thursday. And hopefully time goes quickly and they start giving us some ideas of how we get to where we\u2019re going, because I only have Chinese money on me. When I do get out, I\u2019m going to see a friend who lives not too far away, and then I\u2019ll travel down south to see my family \u2013 I last saw them a year ago in Hong Kong. Going back to Wuhan has not been discussed. The rent is paid on my apartment for a few months, so there\u2019s no rush, but I\u2019ve left my degree and teaching certificates and other things behind, so I will have to go back to Wuhan at some point. I don\u2019t think Wuhan will go back to normal for a while.",

That was much higher than a Reuters poll forecasting a 160k rise, and December number which was revised up from 145k to 147k. Luxury goods group Burberry became the latest company to warn that its business is being knocked by the coronavirus outbreak. Burberry\u2019s finance chief said the virus was having a greater impact on business in Hong Kong than recent anti-government protests. Burberry\u2019s stock price fell as much as 3.2% at the market open but pared losses later in the day. Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam was outsed following what was undoubtedly a tense board meeting on Thursday. It follows a bitter boardroom battle that escalated after a spying scandal that engulfed the Swiss bank last year. The Halifax House Price Index came in higher than expected, with prices up 0.4% month-on-month in January to an average of \u00a3240,054. That\u2019s compared with Reuters forecasts for a flat reading. S&amp;P Global Ratings expects Chinese GDP growth will fall to 5% for 2020, down from previous forecasts for 5.7% growth due to the coronavirus outbreak. A quarter of US firms say the coronavirus will hit revenues by 16%, according to a new survey by the American Chambers of Commerce in Shanghai That\u2019s all from us today. Have a great weekend and we\u2019ll be back on Monday -KM Naeem Aslam, a chief market analyst at online trading platform AVA Trade, says excitement about the bumper US jobs figures won\u2019t last long: The US NFP number rocked the markets. Throughout this week, we have seen investors brushing away all ill thoughts about markets and today\u2019s number has put a final seal on this. The bottom line is that the data has confirmed that the US job market is solid and tight. Having said this, we do have concerns that the positive impact of this jobs report may not last long because the fact that China has delayed its release of economic number, and major warnings coming from Burberry, indicates that investors are likely to see tumultuous time. More details on US jobs figures: The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6%, versus forecasts for the rate to remain steady at 3.5%. Average earnings have risen year-on-year by 3.1%, which is higher than estimates for 3.0%. US non-farm payrolls have come in at 225k for the month of January. That compares to a Reuters poll forecasting 160k, and is much higher than December\u2019s tally which was revised up from 145k to 147k. Foxconn, the electronics company that supplies Apple, has begun manufacturing its own surgical masks, allowing Chinese workers to churn out iPhones uninterrupted as the coronavirus crisis continues. The Taiwanese company\u2019s production lines have been shut down because of the disruption caused by the outbreak, slowing down the supply chain that feeds Apple\u2019s global retail network. However, in a statement released via the Chinese social media platform WeChat, Foxconn said it hoped to get around the problem by switching some of its own production lines to make masks, for its own staff and to supply the soaring global demand for them. It hopes to ramp up production to 2m masks by the end of the month. \u201cIn this war against the epidemic, every second counts,\u201d the company said. You can read the full story here: Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments, says the coronavirus could have a long term effect on the stock market: The short-term rally in global stocks has expectedly began to show signs of slowing as the growing death rate and the economic impact the coronavirus has had has become more understood. Despite the efforts of the Chinese government to contain the virus and its wide spreading impact, the death roll has doubled in a week while more than 31,000 have been infected in what is a sign that the situation is not slowing. He added: Investors have wisely been playing a cautious game, but it will take time for any government action to come into effect. However the fact that much still remains unknown about the coronavirus, and the key question whether it has yet reached his peak, could potentially have a long-lasting effect on the markets even if it is contained and dealt with. Nearly a quarter of US companies in China expect their revenues to fall by at least 16% this year due to the coronavirus. That\u2019s one of the stark statistics from a new American Chambers of Commerce in Shanghai survey released today. The \u201cmini-survey\u201d polled 127 companies including 20 that derive $500m of their revenues from China alone. Here are some of the main findings: Thursday\u2019s bounce didn\u2019t last for European stocks. Today, a mix of profit-taking and coronavirus jitters seem to be weighing on markets. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.5% while the French Cac is down 0.3%. The FTSE 100 is the worst performer in Europe and is down 0.7%. All eyes are now on US jobs numbers, with non farm payrolls due at 1:30pm UK time. The Financial Conduct Authority has fired a warning shot at insolvency practitioners (read: administrators) after learning that there have been illegal attempts to sell customers\u2019 personal data after a company goes bust. Passing on that data may breach key data protection rules like GDPR. We are aware that some insolvency practitioners and FCA-authorised firms have attempted to sell clients\u2019 personal data to claims management companies (CMCs) unlawfully. This can happen either before or after a firm has gone into administration and where it is likely claims for compensation will be made to FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme). The terms, conditions and clauses within a standard contract are highly unlikely to constitute sufficient legal consent for personal data to be shared with CMCs to market their services, and may not be lawful. Claims management firms have been looking for the next big earner after the deadline for payment protection insurance claims closed last year. The FCA statement also warned CMCs to \u201cact honestly, fairly and professionally\u201d and in the best interest of customers. CMCs using such personal data may not be acting in the customers\u2019 interests. CMCs seeking to rely on legitimate interest grounds for processing such data are highly unlikely to meet the requirements of the GDPR. CMCs that intend to buy and use such personal data must be able to demonstrate how they have considered the fair treatment of customers and how their actions comply with privacy laws. The statement, which was co-signed by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and FSCS, didn\u2019t name individual companies that may be in breach of data rules. However, it warned that authorities would \u201ctake appropriate action\u201d where they identify illegal sales. Overnight, S&amp;P Global Ratings estimates that Chinese GDP growth will fall to 5% for 2020. That is down from forecasts for 5.7% growth before the outbreak. And this might be a bold prediction, but S&amp;P is also claiming that the virus could be contained by March 2020. It claims most of the impact will be felt in the first quarter, but that a recovery will be in place by the third quarter. China should bounce back in 2021 with 6.4% growth compared to previous forecasts for 5.6%. Shaun Roache, the Asia-Pacific chief economist for S&amp;P Global Ratings, said: We expect the effect to be more drawn out than in SARS given the longer time to reach peak infections and the more vigorous policy response, especially travel restrictions, in this episode. Household consumption will take the main hit, especially spending on discretionary goods and services as individuals avoid public spaces to minimise the risk of infection. One of our readers got in touch with concerns about our post on Halifax house price data for January. He made the point that \u201cbetter than expected\u201d made it sound like higher costs for housing was a positive result, full stop. I agree that it\u2019s more accurate to say \u201chigher than expected\u201d so I\u2019ve made that change. Thanks for making the point, Keith. Burberry\u2019s finance chief Julie Brown has said the impact of the coronavirus on the business has been more significant than recent protests in Hong Kong. Footfall at the 44 stores that are still open in mainland China have dropped by up to 80%, with customers staying home amid the outbreak. Speaking to the FT (\u00a3) this morning, she said: It is more serious in Hong Kong than the protests The story confirms that none of Burberry\u2019s staff have been diagnosed with the virus. One story is rocking the banking world this morning and that\u2019s the surprise resignation of Credit Suisse CEO Tidjan Thiam. It follows a bitter boardroom battle that escalated after a spying scandal that engulfed the Swiss bank last year. With my hands full with the blog today, the banking reigns have been handed to my capable colleague Mark Sweney. He reports: The bank\u2019s board announced on Friday morning that it had \u201cunanimously accepted\u201d the 57-year-old\u2019s resignation and that Thomas Gottstein, the current head of Credit Suisse\u2019s home business in Switzerland, will take over as chief executive. The board also gave its full support to the chairman, Urs Rohner, to complete his term until April 2021. Thiam and Rohner have been in conflict since it emerged that the Zurich-based bank had hired a corporate espionage company to follow Iqbal Khan, the former head of the bank\u2019s wealth management division, shortly after he left for a position at rival UBS. Credit Suisse insisted it was a one-off incident but then months later admitted a second executive had been tracked by private detectives. The full story is here: The Halifax House Price Index has come in higher than expected, with prices rising 0.4% month-on-month compared to Reuters poll for a flat reading. On an annual basis, January house prices were 4.1% higher than the same time last year to reach an average of \u00a3240,054. But Russell Galley, a managing director at Halifax, warned against overblowing the results: A number of important market indicators continue to show signs of improvement. We have seen a pick-up in transactions with more buyer and seller activity consistent with a reduction in uncertainty in the UK economy. However, it\u2019s too early to say if a corner has been turned. The recent positive figures may actually represent activity that would ordinarily have been expected to take place last year, but was delayed by economic uncertainty. So while housing market activity has undoubtedly increased over recent months, the extent to which this persists will be driven by housing policy, the wider political environment and trends in the economy. You can read the full Burberry release here: European markets are back in the red after a bounce yesterday: FTSE 100 down -0.2% French CAC 40 down -0.1% German DAX down -0.3% Spain\u2019s IBEX down -0.25% Burberry\u2019s London-listed shares are down 3.2% at the start of trading, making it the worst performing stock on the FTSE 100. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Luxury goods group Burberry has become the latest company to warn that its business is being knocked by the coronavirus outbreak, which has forced the company to temporarily close more than a third of its 64 stores in mainland China. Its remaining outlets in the country are running with reduced hours and have suffered a significant drop in footfall. In an unexpected update this morning, the British fashion house said the outbreak was having a \u201cmaterial negative effect on luxury demand\u201d, adding: We are taking mitigating actions but the benefit in the current year will be limited given the proximity to our March year end. We also intend to continue our key growth initiatives in preparation for a recovery in luxury demand. We will provide a retail trading update following our financial year end. Burberry assured that while it can\u2019t predict \u201chow long this situation will last\u201d, it was still confident in its strategy. We are extremely grateful for the incredible effort of our teams and our immediate thoughts are with the people directly impacted by this global health emergency. It comes just days after rival luxury group Capri Holdings \u2013 which is behind brands including Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo and Versace \u2013 warned that the disruption could hit revenue by around $100m (\u00a377m). It said estimates \u201ccould materially change if the severity of the situation worsens\u201d. Later today, we are expecting US non-farm payrolls for January. Investec estimates are for the US economy to have added another 180k jobs, which would be an increase from the disappointing 145k logged for December. The agenda 1.30pm GMT: US non-farm payrolls for January, plus average earnings",

Amid anger from the loved ones of some of those who took their lives in circumstances where difficulties with the Department of Work and Pensions played a role, the National Audit Office (NAO) report said that the true number of deaths linked to claims could be far higher. And it said that until recently the DWP had failed to actively seek information from coroners and families, or investigate all of the cases that were reported to it. The government watchdog warned that although the DWP said it regarded the internal investigations as a way of improving the safety and quality of its services, it had admitted that it has no idea whether lessons from the reviews were ever learned or their recommendations ever implemented. Joy Love, the mother of Jodey Whiting, a disabled parent with a history of mental illness who took her life three years ago after her benefits were stopped, told the Guardian that without a full public inquiry into benefit-related deaths there was a danger that \u201cnothing will change and these tragedies would keep happening\u201d. The NAO undertook the investigation last year after the former MP Frank Field \u2013 at the time the chair of the work and pensions select committee \u2013 wrote to it to complain that the DWP had blocked his requests for data on suicide-related deaths on the grounds that to gather the information would be too expensive.

Of nine such cases in recent years known to the Guardian, suicide was identified as the formal cause of death. Last week the Guardian reported the death by starvation in 2018 of Errol Graham, a 57-year-old grandfather with a history of mental illness. Graham died months after his benefits were cut off after he failed to attend a fit-for-work test. A candlelit vigil and protest over Graham\u2019s death was held in Nottingham on Friday night. Alison Turner, Graham\u2019s daughter-in-law, added her voice to calls for a public inquiry saying she had little confidence in the DWP\u2019s ability to change its ways. \u201cThey are going to have to work hard to earn our trust, and they have to start by being open and honest with people.\u201d The NAO\u2019s report published on Friday reveals that 69 internal process reviews (IPRs) into claimant suicides where \u201calleged department activity\u201d may have contributed to the claimant\u2019s death have been completed by the DWP since 2014-15. The figure does not include benefit-related deaths which were not a result of suicide. Of the 69, almost a third were carried out in a seven-month period between April and November last year, reflecting a more proactive approach from the department under former work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd. \u201cThis is partly a result of investigating more cases where information received from the media was the trigger [for the investigation],\u201d the NAO said. However, because there was no clear route for such cases to be communicated to the department, and because there was confusion internally as to whether a reported case should be investigated, it is likely incidents that should have been investigated will have slipped under the radar, the NAO says. \u201cIt is highly unlikely that the 69 cases the department has investigated represents the number of cases it could have investigated in the past six years,\u201d it concludes. The IPRs do not come to a judgment as to whether benefits-related issues were the cause of the suicide, but instead scrutinise departmental processes and \u201cidentify recommendations for change to the customer journey\u201d, which are then in theory passed on to frontline teams. However, the NAO notes there was no systematic tracking or monitoring of the lessons that emerge from the IPRs. \u201cAs a result, the department does not know whether the suggested improvements are implemented.\u201d The DWP does not seek to identify wider trends that emerge from across the IPR reports, the NAO notes, and the reports themselves are restricted internally. This means \u201csystemic issues which might be brought to light through these reviews could be missed\u201d. Michael Paul from Disability Rights UK said: \u201cWe hear repeatedly about improvements to processes. But the stark reality appears very different. It\u2019s yet more evidence that the welfare benefits system is unfit for purpose. The system should be supporting disabled people who need it, not putting them at risk\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

It is still a significant part of the game and England will have wondered how they did not win in Paris having dominated France in that area. \u201cWe had some issues in the set piece last weekend but the main problem was that we took too long to work out what the referee was looking for. We had a pretty good scrum in the World Cup and it is an area we always work hard on. \u201cI started out as a No 8. I was called into the Blues\u2019 Under-16s a year early and one of the coaches sat me down and said I was not fast enough to make it in that position and would be better off in the front row. \u201cMy love for the game stemmed from being constantly involved and I did not want to lose that as a prop. I was 17 when I made my debut for Pontypridd in the Welsh Premiership, chucked in the deep end because of injuries. I played six games in three weeks and learned a lot, finding out why they go on about the dark arts in the front row.\u201d Lewis set up Fat Dragon with Thyer and welcomes the distraction it provides. \u201cBrad was out for 12 months with injury and came to me with the idea of starting a business,\u201d he says. \u201cWe came up with coffee and sell beans. We get half of them roasted in England and the other half in a unit in Wales. We do everything online, supplying coffee shops and gyms. It is a switch-off button even though you are still working and it is a bit of a retirement plan, even if I hope that is a while away. \u201cTokyo was good for coffee shops and so is Dublin, but I doubt I will have the time to visit one. It is always hard at the Aviva Stadium and it is usually raining. We have focused on ourselves this week, tweaking what we did not get right against Italy, and there is no reason why we cannot win.\u201d",

The independent inquiry commissioned by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) shows that one of the two had never been on the team investigating the April 2018 attack in Douma and the other was only on the team for a brief period. Both individuals, referred to in the report as Inspector A and B, may face legal action. More than 40 people were killed on 7 April 2018 in the town of Douma on the outskirts of Damascus. The town was at the time held by rebels but besieged by pro-government forces. Civilians claimed they were the victims of a chemical weapon attack. The assault prompted reprisal missile strikes on Syrian government targets by the US, Britain and France a week later, one of the few direct strikes on Syrian government assets in the nine-year civil war. Russia immediately launched a campaign, including bringing witnesses from Syria to the OPCW headquarters in the Hague to challenge the claim that chemical weapons were used. The charge that Russia permits, or covers up the Syrian president, Bashir al-Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons on Syrian civilians, is one of the most bitter flashpoints between Russia and the west. Following the US strike, the OPCW set up a fact-finding mission to decide whether chemical weapons had been used, but not to attribute responsibility. It ruled in March 2019 that a banned toxic chemical containing chlorine was likely to have been used in Douma. The fact that chemical weapons were delivered through airstrikes effectively meant the OPCW believed the Syrian air force was responsible. Internal OPCW reports questioning whether chemical weapons had been used leaked last May, raising questions about manipulation of the OPCW by the west. But an OPCW inquiry into those leaks published on Thursday found the authors of the internal reports only had a minor supporting role in the Douma team. The OPCW chief Fernando Arias told OPCW states in comments published on Thursday that the two individuals were \u201cnot whistleblowers\u201d.

In practically all the sectors identified by the committee on climate change as requiring decarbonisation policies \u2013 agriculture, power generation, transport \u2013 there will be a push to lock in market mechanisms, enshrine \u201ccompetition\u201d, and head off attempts at regulation. Perhaps most worryingly, the US has also indicated it will push for any agreement to include an investor-state dispute settlement \u2013 a controversial mechanism that gives foreign companies access to a supranational tribunal where they can sue entire countries within the bounds of the trade agreement but outside their own legal system. These have been used by companies to recoup \u201clost profits\u201d when countries try to introduce environmental legislation: for instance, the Canadian province of Quebec was sued by an oil company under the North American Free Trade Agreement after it banned fracking in 2011. With an ISDS, a bad deal for climate would not only harm existing standards, it could also prevent climate policies being made in the future, either because they contradict the agreement or because they could open the government to trade disputes. Climate policy wouldn\u2019t cover a product quite as viscerally unappealing as chlorinated chicken, or an institution as beloved as the NHS, both of which have focused public anger on the usually arcane process of trade negotiation. The risk with climate is that a trade deal would involve death by a thousand cuts for regulation, with changes across the entire economy \u2013 none big enough to contest on their own. It doesn\u2019t have to work this way: the EU is currently proposing a \u201ccarbon border tax\u201d that would force trading partners to comprehensively consider the climate impact of all their products and services, an example of how trade policy can be used to strengthen global climate efforts. But Liz Truss, the minister in charge of negotiations, and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, are deregulators of the highest order. Both were co-authors of the 2012 book Britannia Unchained, which criticised the UK for a \u201cbloated state, high taxes and excessive regulation\u201d. They maintain that the government is committed to its existing climate targets, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll actually back the protections we need in order to meet them. \u2022 Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment",

      "body": "<p>There are few occasions with hard-and-fast dress codes these days. You would think this would make the business of what to wear easier, but in fact it makes it tougher. It\u2019s all very well, in principle, being free to do your own thing, go your own way, choose your own path, etc. But sometimes it would be quite helpful to have guard rails to hang on to when you are at risk of falling flat on your face and making an idiot of yourself in public, you know?</p> <p>So I\u2019m introducing a new dress code, which we can call glasual. Meaning, obviously, glamorous but casual. Glasual is completely different from smart casual, in case you were wondering. Smart casual is about bringing a dash of formality to a casual look. Glasual is about bringing a dash of extra fun, added energy, instead. Smart casual is serving up a vodka tonic with a neat slice of lime and a linen napkin on the side. Glasual is adding an extra slosh of vodka.</p> <p>Glasual is the jazz-hands of the dress code scene. It\u2019s about clothes that bring a bit of joy. These are clothes to wear because you are seeing your friends and your friends are brilliant. Or because you\u2019re going to work, but it\u2019s Friday. Because you are excited to be going to a party. Or because you would actually really rather stay home but you\u2019ve promised you\u2019ll go, and dressing up will help you get in the party mood. It is not about fitting in with any formal rules; it\u2019s about bringing a vibe.</p> <p>You can glasual however you like. Start with a wardrobe template you feel comfortable in (whether that\u2019s jeans and a top, or a dress) and add something extra. The shirt I\u2019m wearing here is an ancient J Crew buy, which has become one of my wardrobe get-out-of-jail-free cards, the piece I always pack because it can turn any number of outfits around. It is fancy, but it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. Layered under a sweater, as here, or on its own under a simple blazer, it adds just the right amount of silliness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/24/how-to-dress-walk-life-balance-jess-cartner-morley\">How to dress for walk-life balance | Jess Cartner-Morley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A fancy skirt is another good glasual option. If there\u2019s a sequined, fringed or feathered skirt in your wardrobe, don\u2019t file it away as eveningwear to be worn with a tuxedo at some hypothetical event: wear it out to lunch with a pristine T-shirt and loafers, or to the pub with a sweatshirt and ankle boots. Major earrings can make a white shirt glasual; a posh jacket can do the same for a pair of jeans.

      "bodyText": "There are few occasions with hard-and-fast dress codes these days. You would think this would make the business of what to wear easier, but in fact it makes it tougher. It\u2019s all very well, in principle, being free to do your own thing, go your own way, choose your own path, etc. But sometimes it would be quite helpful to have guard rails to hang on to when you are at risk of falling flat on your face and making an idiot of yourself in public, you know? So I\u2019m introducing a new dress code, which we can call glasual. Meaning, obviously, glamorous but casual. Glasual is completely different from smart casual, in case you were wondering. Smart casual is about bringing a dash of formality to a casual look. Glasual is about bringing a dash of extra fun, added energy, instead. Smart casual is serving up a vodka tonic with a neat slice of lime and a linen napkin on the side. Glasual is adding an extra slosh of vodka. Glasual is the jazz-hands of the dress code scene. It\u2019s about clothes that bring a bit of joy. These are clothes to wear because you are seeing your friends and your friends are brilliant. Or because you\u2019re going to work, but it\u2019s Friday. Because you are excited to be going to a party. Or because you would actually really rather stay home but you\u2019ve promised you\u2019ll go, and dressing up will help you get in the party mood. It is not about fitting in with any formal rules; it\u2019s about bringing a vibe. You can glasual however you like. Start with a wardrobe template you feel comfortable in (whether that\u2019s jeans and a top, or a dress) and add something extra. The shirt I\u2019m wearing here is an ancient J Crew buy, which has become one of my wardrobe get-out-of-jail-free cards, the piece I always pack because it can turn any number of outfits around. It is fancy, but it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. Layered under a sweater, as here, or on its own under a simple blazer, it adds just the right amount of silliness. A fancy skirt is another good glasual option. If there\u2019s a sequined, fringed or feathered skirt in your wardrobe, don\u2019t file it away as eveningwear to be worn with a tuxedo at some hypothetical event: wear it out to lunch with a pristine T-shirt and loafers, or to the pub with a sweatshirt and ankle boots. Major earrings can make a white shirt glasual; a posh jacket can do the same for a pair of jeans. Think of it like hot sauce for your wardrobe: just a dash, and you\u2019re good and spicy. \u2022 Jess wears red jumper, \u00a359, cosstores.com. Shirt, Jess\u2019s own.

Broadcasting guidelines required both main networks to screen not only sacred song anthologies, but also live church services, and late-night \u201creligious and ethical\u201d discussion shows. The emphasis was almost always on respecting Britain\u2019s residual state religion, Christianity.</p> <p>Increased competition for viewers caused by channel expansion led networks to pray successfully for release from days of holy obligation: Songs of Praise, though relegated to a BBC1 Sunday lunch-time slot, is the last relic of the old-time religion in the schedules, except for specials to mark Christmas, Easter and, now, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh festivals.</p> <p>But, though the God slots have gone, religion seems to be achieving a televisual second coming.

      "bodyText": "Shocking as it may seem to newer viewers of British TV, there used to be a BBC-ITV ratings battle between shows in which viewers sang hymns and told Bible stories. The Sunday stand-off between the public service Songs of Praise and the commercial Highway was the biggest manifestation of what broadcasters called the \u201cGod slots\u201d. Broadcasting guidelines required both main networks to screen not only sacred song anthologies, but also live church services, and late-night \u201creligious and ethical\u201d discussion shows. The emphasis was almost always on respecting Britain\u2019s residual state religion, Christianity. Increased competition for viewers caused by channel expansion led networks to pray successfully for release from days of holy obligation: Songs of Praise, though relegated to a BBC1 Sunday lunch-time slot, is the last relic of the old-time religion in the schedules, except for specials to mark Christmas, Easter and, now, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh festivals. But, though the God slots have gone, religion seems to be achieving a televisual second coming. Two series about American Christian evangelical families have launched coincidentally in the UK this week: HBO\u2019s The Righteous Gemstones (Sky Comedy) and MGM\u2019s Perpetual Grace, Ltd (StarzPlay). On Netflix, Messiah, in which a Christ-like bearded preacher figure appears in the contemporary Middle East, proved a recent hit. Next month, when the 2020 Bafta TV award nominations are announced, there seems sure to be mass recognition of the second season of Fleabag, an agonised \u201clove story\u201d between Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s libidinous singleton and Andrew Scott\u2019s \u201chot priest\u201d. Netflix\u2019s The Young Pope, which won Jude Law an Emmy nomination as a pontiff as likely to be seen in Speedos as white robes and papal tiara, has just been followed by a sequel, The New Pope. The fear of faith-leaders and believers, though, is that this new religious broadcasting sees the obligatory reverence of earlier TV decades replaced by ritual ridicule. The Righteous Gemstones and Perpetual Grace, Ltd are dark comedies that present American evangelical churches as cynical and hypocritical exercises in fleecing the vulnerable out of money while their pastors live like rock stars. John Goodman\u2019s Pastor Eli Gemstone has a fleet of three private jets, named The Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit. Played by Ben Kingsley, who has curiously chosen to channel the accent of Anthony Hopkins, Pastor Byron Brown, CEO of Perpetual Grace, Ltd, says, when finances are mentioned: \u201cWe do alright \u2013our church,\u201d but we know to take this as severe understatement. This suggestion of American evangelism as fraudulent cant and deception descends from Sinclair Lewis\u2019s influential 1927 novel Elmer Gantry, in which a con-man joins a revivalist preacher; it was filmed in 1960, with Burt Lancaster as the fraud for the Lord. A newer influence on the two new American TV variations on this narrative, though, is the present US president. Although Donald Trump has been married three times, and his frequent claims of not having time to read books were assumed to include the Bible, the Christian fundamentalist vote was key to his election, and, as he seeks a second term, he has been filmed praying with believers. So The Righteous Gemstones and Perpetual Grace, Ltd - in exploring the uses and mis-uses of piety - can be seen as part of liberal Hollywood\u2019s response to the shock of the 2016 election. Indeed, while the Bible shows Christ telling secular stories \u2013 about wise and unwise virgins, or the best way to serve wine at a wedding \u2013 to make religious points, this wave of TV dramas are often parables that use religion for secular purposes. Both The Young Pope and The New Pope, Messiah and Riders of the Storm (a Danish church drama by Borgen creator, Adam Price, seen here on Channel 4) all use ecclesiastical power struggles as a proxy for contemporary politics. Each employs thriller tropes, such as conspiracy and espionage: in Messiah, the CIA and Mossad investigate who the rumoured second Jesus really is. Less generically, The Young Pope, The New Pope and Riders of the Storm offer frequent parallels with parties and parliaments. This is tempting because the tensions in church leaderships between orthodoxy and reform, purity and pragmatism, are exactly those that play out in the Commons, Congress, and other legislatures. Although Roman Catholic cardinals are asked to \u201clisten to the Holy Spirit\u201d while choosing the next occupant of the throne of St Peter, director Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s sumptuous big-budget reconstructions make clear that the process is as prone as any other electoral process factions, tactics, and mistakes. By having John Malkovich\u2019s John Paul III serve while Jude Law\u2019s Pius XIII lies in a coma, The New Pope contrives an ideological fight between supporters of two living pontiffs, a strand that would once have seemed absurd but is being played out in the real Vatican as the retired Benedict XVI shadows his successor Pope Francis. (A situation explicitly dramatised in Netflix\u2019s multi-Oscar-nominated film, The Two Popes). Yet Sorrentino\u2019s series, while properly referencing the paedophile and financial scandals that have damaged Catholicism, are not satirical about faith or religion. Law\u2019s Pius XIII is essentially a good man who may justify another character\u2019s description as \u201cthe only pure soul who ever set foot\u201d in the Vatican. In these shows, a Pope is seen as dangerous if he turns the work of the church towards God or human justice rather than priestly power. In the Bible, Christ frequently warns that it is not possible to serve both God and Mammon. Though differing in tone and approach, The Righteous Gemstones, Perpetual Grace, Ltd, and both The Young Popeand The New Pope all critique the contemporary Christian churches for using God as a means to make money. Rightwing and evangelical believers may dismiss this as a leftwing economic agenda, but the message is Biblically respectful. Even Sorrentino\u2019s tendency to risk giving Jude Law a chill \u2013 he is seen wearing only swimming trunks in the first season, his genitals covered by a skimpy hospital towel in the second - might charitably be seen as an acknowledgment that Christ died not in a neck-to-foot cassock but nearly naked in a loincloth. And, although the second run of Fleabag features a Catholic priest breaking his vow of celibacy, the show never doubts the faith of the Andrew Scott character. What is remarkable about the sex scene is that it is retrospectively revealed to have been the priest testing whether sex could ever bring him the rewards that his love of God does.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine.

In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.

A debate over the continued use of mercury in fluorescent lighting has split the 27 member states with Germany\u2019s industrial interests being pitted against the environmental concerns of Sweden, according to leaked correspondence. The European commission is being asked by Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to continue to allow manufacturers to use mercury in light bulbs despite the potential damage to the environment and human health. The three main companies in the sector, General Electric, Philips and Osram, are major employers, particularly of German and Hungarian workers. But critics say that an exemption granted to the lighting industry in 2011 from a general ban on mercury use under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive is no longer justifiable. Sweden, Finland and Bulgaria, among others, say the successful argument nine years ago that there was not a readily available alternative to mercury in the manufacture of fluorescent lamps is defunct. Mercury-free LED light bulbs were said to produce significantly poorer levels of lighting, but it is now claimed that the technology has sufficiently moved on. Brussels\u2019 next move is being billed as a test of its stated commitment to fighting the climate crisis. \u201cSweden\u2019s main concern is that there are no legal grounds for renewing an exemption for the use in questions,\u201d a letter from the Swedish government to the commission stated on 22 January. \u201cToday there are economically viable substitutes available for most of the mercury-containing light sources.\u201d In 2017, the EU signed the Minamata convention obliging it to reduce the use of toxic materials such as mercury. The Swedish government argued in its letter that Brussels risked being in breach of its legal obligations. \u201cSweden also doubts that renewing the exemptions for mercury in question would be in line with the goal on climate neutrality and the ambitions on chemicals of the green deal recently launched by the commission\u201d, its government added, citing the 40.9m metric tonnes of CO2 emissions savings that would be delivered by phasing mercury out by September 2021. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in December that the premise of the so-called European Green Deal targeting a \u201cclimate-neutral continent\u201d by 2050 was that the \u201cold growth model that is based on fossil fuels and pollution is out of date\u201d.

When our house is burning down or the storm waters are flooding in, we hold on to what we value most, and leave the rest behind.</p> <p>A decade ago, the leaders of the European Union found themselves facing such a moment. With the French and German banks falling into a black hole, they did whatever it took to save them.

Whereas the \u20ac4.2tn for the financiers was new, actual funding, the \u20ac1tn that Von der Leyen has promised across 10 years in her green deal \u2013 \u20ac100bn annually \u2013 is mostly smoke and mirrors.</p> <p>Contrary to Von der Leyen\u2019s pledge to deliver a \u201cgreen investment wave\u201d, the green deal is largely composed of reshuffled money from existing EU funds and reheated promises to mobilise private-sector capital down the road. In total, the green deal will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/23/who-pays-for-the-eus-1tn-green-deal\" title=\"\">generate just \u20ac7.5bn</a> in new budget commitments, stretched over seven years.

But this does not reduce risk \u2013 it simply shifts it on to the shoulders of the European public, while ensuring that private investors enjoy all of the gains. Without a plan to coordinate energy production and distribution within a proper energy union, the commission\u2019s commitment to private capital promises only to intensify inequalities within and between member states.</p> <p>This brings us to the green deal\u2019s scope. On paper, the plan looks impressively holistic, from a \u201cfarm to fork\u201d sustainable food strategy to a \u201cnew circular economy action plan\u201d. However, its capacity to transform Europeans\u2019 lives is circumscribed by the commission\u2019s commitment to the austerian straitjacket of the \u201cstability and growth pact\u201d, which has condemned Europe to chronic stagnation.

Will there be \u201cjustice\u201d for the communities across Germany and France that have been asked to shoulder the costs of the climate transition?

The stark answer is no.</p> <p>The just transition mechanism will \u201cmobilise\u201d a total of \u20ac100bn over 10 years towards coal-producing countries such as Hungary and Poland, which expect to see a \u201cvery significant part\u201d of the funding. Support for coal-dependent regions is an essential dimension of the just transition. But it does not take a cynic to see that the deployment of just transition funding in the green deal is a pork-barrel payoff to rightwing governments that supported Von der Leyen\u2019s election and who she fears might throw a spanner into her signature proposal.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>It had felt like something of a no-brainer when the Premier League changed the kick-off of Spurs\u2019 game against last season\u2019s champions, Manchester City, to suit the Sky TV schedules. Why would I want to put myself through the pain of watching my team get annihilated when I also had tickets to see Ermonela Jaho give her debut recital at Wigmore Hall on the same day and there wasn\u2019t enough time to do both?</p> <p>But watching the match on TV (well, all but the last 10 minutes) before we headed off into central London, I began to have my doubts. This was the game in which Spurs managed to concentrate their entire season\u2019s good luck <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/feb/02/tottenham-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live\">into 90 minutes</a>. Man City totally dominated the game, while Spurs, despite playing just as indifferently as they have for most of the season, scored from the only two shots they had in the first 89 minutes. It was the jammiest 2-0 win you will ever see and Spurs now only need another three points to be sure of avoiding relegation. Surely even they can\u2019t screw this up?</p> <p>But once at the concert I knew I had made the right call. Two hours of the most sublime music making. Jaho is the world\u2019s finest soprano.

World King? The PM could be seriously unwell | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A quick recap. At a lobby briefing on Monday, No 10 had divided the journalists into two sections on either side of the carpet and told one lot that they were being kicked out. After a brief row, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/03/political-journalists-boycott-no-10-briefing-after-reporter-ban\">every journalist present walked out</a>. No 10 then tried to spin the walkout as a misunderstanding: the briefing had been for specialists only \u2013 but the only specialist present was among those who had been refused access.</p> <p>Earlier in the day I had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/03/shapeshifter-world-king-the-pm-boris-johnson-could-be-seriously-unwell\">found myself on the wrong end</a> of a Downing Street exclusion order when I was banned from attending the prime minister\u2019s Brexit speech in Greenwich. The official version was that it was \u201cstrictly one journalist per media outlet\u201d and the Guardian already had someone going. Only the Times was mysteriously allowed two journalists. A colleague who was there took a photo of several rows of empty seats.</p> <p>All governments try to control the media agenda by granting special access to favoured journalists who they trust not to question their side of the story, but Boris and Classic Dom are taking it to new levels. Even when her government was imploding Theresa May never tried to exclude me from anything to which other sketch writers were invited.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Preparations to host COP 26, the UN climate change conference, in Glasgow later this year appear to be in total disarray <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/04/sacked-cop-26-chair-claire-oneill-berates-boris-johnson-over-climate-record\">following the sacking of former Tory minister</a>, Claire O\u2019Neill, as head of the UK\u2019s organisation team. No 10 has claimed O\u2019Neill was not up to the job, while she has told the media that the government was hopelessly disengaged from COP26 and Boris Johnson didn\u2019t really understand the realities of climate change. Since then it has emerged that David Cameron was offered O\u2019Neill\u2019s job but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/05/david-cameron-turns-down-offer-of-cop-26-climate-summit-job\">turned it down on the grounds he was a bit busy</a>. Maybe, too, the money on offer just wasn\u2019t enough for him to rearrange his diary. It\u2019s now emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/david-cameron-accounts-brexit-vote-2016\">Cameron has made at least \u00a31.6m</a> \u2013 probably a great deal more \u2013 from various well-paid gigs that appear to have required little effort between leaving office in 2016 and April last year. Brexit has certainly been extremely kind to his bank balance. As it has to May. For the current register of interests shows that since stepping down as prime minister in July last year, May has earned \u00a3400,000 in addition to her MP salary. Bizarrely, the bulk of that money has come from public speaking. For one speech to JP Morgan Chase in London that would have taken up a maximum of five hours in preparation, travel and delivery time, May trousered a mere \u00a375K. Since there can\u2019t be anyone who hasn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/21/theresa-may-proves-herself-the-woman-who-has-nothing-for-everyone\">heard her give a speech</a>, one can only assume the former PM was hired as a comedy or curiosity act. There are few people who can lose an audience quite so quickly as May. So, as someone who has done as much anyone to publicise May\u2019s difficulties with sentence construction and absence of meaning, I\u2019m now waiting for my 15% commission. It would be my own Brexit bounce.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>Don Powell, Slade\u2019s drummer for the best part of 60 years, claims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/05/slade-drummer-don-powell-fired-over-email-after-57-year-partnership\">he has been fired from the group by email</a>. You\u2019d have thought the frontman, Dave Hill, might have at least chosen to end such a long relationship by FaceTime but perhaps he only does that for people he has known for 75 years. Presumably, Dave still considered Don to be a relative newcomer to the band. Bizarrely, for someone who was pathologically unreliable and totally disengaged throughout my 20s while doing a series of jobs in which my employers clearly regretted my existence almost as much as I did, I have only ever been sacked once. And that was totally deserved and done face to face. It was during the heatwave of 1976 and I was working an ice cream machine, that would have failed all current health and safety legislation, outside a souvenir shop in Leicester Square. After a couple of months my time-keeping had become increasingly erratic \u2013 principally because I was up most nights taking large quantities of every drug on offer and was finding it harder and harder to fit in a job around my antisocial life. One afternoon I was startled to get a tap on my shoulder. My boss had been doing his rounds \u2013 he owned numerous concessions in the West End \u2013 and had found me passed out while propped up against the ice cream machine. He didn\u2019t even bother to shout at me. He just gave me a weary look of resignation and politely told me it was time I went home and didn\u2019t come back. I could only agree. I\u2019m not sure who was more relieved, him or me.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>It seems hard to believe that it is still only early February as the year seems to be dragging by. Not that I have managed to achieve that much while time has slowed down. Rather, my inner world has been dominated with feelings of acute anxiety, depression and a sense of futility. On many days it has been a real battle to get out of bed. Things that should provide pleasure have felt increasingly transient and out of reach while even my dreams have given me no respite from a feeling of dread. At times I have felt as if I was doing little more than existing. Going through the motions of being John. Or a barely remembered version of John. I\u2019ve been too depressed even to worry about getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/what-is-coronavirus-wuahn-china-outbreak-doctor\">the coronavirus</a>. As ever, my family have done more than their fair share of holding me together. As have friends and work colleagues, and seeing the garden coming to life each day always gives me a moment\u2019s buzz. If the bananas, palms and echiums can survive the winter, then so can I. But I\u2019ve also had so much support from so many readers. Some have sent random gifts, such as old Spurs photographs from the 60s and 70s, others have written emails of encouragement. Just last week I had dozens of emails telling me where I could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/leavers-brexit-night-bash-sounds-like-a-question-time-from-hell\">find a red squirrel</a>. Come the spring, I\u2019m off to either Brownsea Island or the Isle of Wight and will report back. Only last night at a book event in Haslemere, a reader gave me a pot made from the clay under the old White Hart Lane pitch more than 100 years ago. The gift couldn\u2019t have been more perfect, combining my passion for football and ceramics. So a big thank you to all of you for helping keep me sane.

      "body": "<p>Last weekend\u2019s 3-2 defeat by Everton, to a stoppage-time goal having at one stage been two up and apparently in control, was a particularly bitter experience even for a Watford side accustomed to disappointment this season. But for Adam Masina at least the cloud had a silver lining. For the first time in England he had started four successive matches; shortly before kick-off he was presented with an award as the club\u2019s player of the month, and shortly afterwards he scored his first Premier League goal.</p> <p>The Italian was an ever-present in Watford\u2019s matchday squads last season but started 27 of their league games on the bench and on 24 of those occasions he ended the game there, too. He recommitted over the summer, determined to play more, but then did not see a minute of league action until October. Starts, goals and player of the month trophies seemed very distant only weeks ago.</p> <p>\u201cThis year started so bad because I was out of the squad every weekend and I was so sad,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know why I was out because my level of commitment was high as always. It was so, so hard for me. When I joined I was sure that in maybe three, four months I would start to play, and it was so disappointing for me to finish the season as the second left-back. I know now, it\u2019s the past. We look forward. One thing my grandmother taught me is that you have to look after yourself and keep fighting until the end because, if you want something, you have to take it. No one will give it to you.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the battles Masina has had to face this one is comparatively trivial. His remarkable story starts in Khouribga, a town about 100km south-east of Casablanca, to which his parents returned, having moved to Italy, so his mother could give birth and raise her baby with the help and support of her family. She died when Adam was a few months old. \u201cI don\u2019t know what actually happened,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was told she got an infection and unfortunately she left us.\u201d He, his older brother, Zakaria, and his father, Mustafa, returned to Italy but his father struggled with alcoholism and the children were taken into care. They passed through several foster homes and, when finally they found one where they felt comfortable, the couple divorced and they had to leave.</p> <p>The boys ended up in Maran\u00e0tha, a shelter for struggling families and children in Bologna, and spent a year there before being reunited with their father. Unfortunately his troubles with alcohol were not over and after one particularly harrowing evening when he dragged his children \u2013 Adam was perhaps four or five \u2013 from bar to bar while they cried and pleaded to return to their last foster home, they were separated for the final time.</p> <p>The only question that Masina refuses to answer during a long and frank conversation is about his current relationship with Mustafa or if there even is one. He has another family now; that last foster couple had divorced but the ex-husband, Raffaele, and his own mother, Teresa, took the boys in and raised them. Eventually they were adopted and both took Raffaele\u2019s surname.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I think about myself, about my life, I realise that in the end I was lucky,\u201d says Masina. \u201cI went through something, something different from normal life, but now I\u2019m happy. I have a baby, my girlfriend, my family. For me, I have to be honest, it was easy. It\u2019s not the right word but I\u2019ve realised how lucky I was.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a199d59f20be66cada7f81c2e0807beb549b1cef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a199d59f20be66cada7f81c2e0807beb549b1cef/0_58_2760_1656/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Masina scores his first Watford goal, against Everton last Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Masina scores his first Watford goal, against Everton last Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chloe Knott - Danehouse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne man took me and my brother and looked after us like sons. Now I\u2019m a father and I\u2019m thinking if I could adopt someone, and it\u2019s hard. You have to work with these kids, to give them discipline, to be right with them. And my father did this with two children. It\u2019s unbelievable, incredible. To have enough love for these two children, the children of strangers. I don\u2019t know what term I can use, more than incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Zakaria has written a book of poetry about their childhood. \u201cNo, about his childhood,\u201d Masina corrects me. \u201cWe were together but we had a different experience. If you read his poetry, you could compare our stories. As I said before, for me it was easy, because I have got to where I wanted to be. For my brother it was tougher. As of this moment he hasn\u2019t come out the other side. He hasn\u2019t found serenity.\u201d</p> <p>It was at Maran\u00e0tha that Masina was introduced to football, which soon became an obsession. At 11 he was spotted by Bologna and joined their academy, becoming a promising striker, but at 17 he was told he could leave.</p> <p>\u201cThat summer was so tough,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI remember as if it was yesterday. My grandmother, my father and my brother were in a little flat we had rented by the seaside and I cried for an entire month. My grandmother told me not to worry. I remember I said to her: \u2018I want to be a footballer.\u2019 And she said: \u2018OK, but second option, what else do you want to do?\u2019 And I said: \u2018My second option is to be a footballer.\u2019 For her, for me, for my father it was tough.\u201d</p> <p>He ended up at Giacomense, a club in Italy\u2019s regional fourth division based 60km \u2013 a gruelling commute of about an hour and a half each way, by train and bus \u2013 from Masina\u2019s home, where he was converted into a defender. At the end of his first year with them Giacomense played a friendly against Bologna\u2019s Under-23s, a game of, literally, three halves. Masina sat out the first, played the second as striker and the third at left-back, and by the final whistle his old club wanted him back.</p> <p>Masina refused to go, believing that he would benefit from a season of senior football, but when they returned for him a year later there was no hesitation. Two strokes of luck followed: they were relegated to Serie B in 2014, when he was 20, and that December their left-back and captain, Archimede Morleo, was injured and Masina was thrust into the team.</p> <p>\u201cIn my head I was ready to go on loan, maybe to the third division, because I wanted to play. I was going to leave in just one month,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I got an opportunity, and I took it. That season we got promoted but fucking hell it was hard. By the end we were out of gas, running on fumes, everyone dead. We went up through the play-offs and that night was crazy. I loved it. We were driven through the city on a bus and it was crazy. What a memory. This is the story of my life: highs and lows.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He spent three years as Bologna\u2019s first-choice left-back and played six times for Italy\u2019s Under-21s before moving to Watford in 2018. \u201cIt was hard to leave. So hard. But the first day I came here I said: \u2018OK, I like this.\u2019 Because it was like the next level. In Bologna we had a good team but here everyone has quality, everyone is fighting, everyone is running. Everyone has a fire inside.\u201d</p> <p>Now they have to show it. After a run of four wins in six unbeaten games over Christmas hauled Watford out of the relegation places, a couple of defeats have seen them slip back in. From here every game, starting at Brighton on Saturday, is potentially crucial. \u201cWe can\u2019t be relegated with this team,\u201d Masina says. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. This team has quality, strength, everything. We have everything. I know in the Premier League the level is so high but I think this team is a very good team. This season started so bad. I think with Nigel Pearson we fixed it a little bit, but we have to finish the work, because it\u2019s not possible for us to even think about relegation.\u201d</p> <p>It is going to be a struggle but not one Masina is afraid of. \u201cI\u2019m still fighting, every day. This is my way,\u201d he says. \u201cI know where I\u2019ve come from and I know that you get nothing for free in this life. So I\u2019ll keep fighting.\u201d</p>",

The Italian was an ever-present in Watford\u2019s matchday squads last season but started 27 of their league games on the bench and on 24 of those occasions he ended the game there, too. He recommitted over the summer, determined to play more, but then did not see a minute of league action until October. Starts, goals and player of the month trophies seemed very distant only weeks ago. \u201cThis year started so bad because I was out of the squad every weekend and I was so sad,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know why I was out because my level of commitment was high as always. It was so, so hard for me. When I joined I was sure that in maybe three, four months I would start to play, and it was so disappointing for me to finish the season as the second left-back. I know now, it\u2019s the past. We look forward. One thing my grandmother taught me is that you have to look after yourself and keep fighting until the end because, if you want something, you have to take it. No one will give it to you.\u201d Of all the battles Masina has had to face this one is comparatively trivial. His remarkable story starts in Khouribga, a town about 100km south-east of Casablanca, to which his parents returned, having moved to Italy, so his mother could give birth and raise her baby with the help and support of her family. She died when Adam was a few months old. \u201cI don\u2019t know what actually happened,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was told she got an infection and unfortunately she left us.\u201d He, his older brother, Zakaria, and his father, Mustafa, returned to Italy but his father struggled with alcoholism and the children were taken into care. They passed through several foster homes and, when finally they found one where they felt comfortable, the couple divorced and they had to leave. The boys ended up in Maran\u00e0tha, a shelter for struggling families and children in Bologna, and spent a year there before being reunited with their father. Unfortunately his troubles with alcohol were not over and after one particularly harrowing evening when he dragged his children \u2013 Adam was perhaps four or five \u2013 from bar to bar while they cried and pleaded to return to their last foster home, they were separated for the final time. The only question that Masina refuses to answer during a long and frank conversation is about his current relationship with Mustafa or if there even is one. He has another family now; that last foster couple had divorced but the ex-husband, Raffaele, and his own mother, Teresa, took the boys in and raised them. Eventually they were adopted and both took Raffaele\u2019s surname. \u201cWhen I think about myself, about my life, I realise that in the end I was lucky,\u201d says Masina. \u201cI went through something, something different from normal life, but now I\u2019m happy. I have a baby, my girlfriend, my family. For me, I have to be honest, it was easy. It\u2019s not the right word but I\u2019ve realised how lucky I was. \u201cOne man took me and my brother and looked after us like sons. Now I\u2019m a father and I\u2019m thinking if I could adopt someone, and it\u2019s hard. You have to work with these kids, to give them discipline, to be right with them. And my father did this with two children. It\u2019s unbelievable, incredible. To have enough love for these two children, the children of strangers. I don\u2019t know what term I can use, more than incredible.\u201d Zakaria has written a book of poetry about their childhood. \u201cNo, about his childhood,\u201d Masina corrects me. \u201cWe were together but we had a different experience. If you read his poetry, you could compare our stories. As I said before, for me it was easy, because I have got to where I wanted to be. For my brother it was tougher. As of this moment he hasn\u2019t come out the other side. He hasn\u2019t found serenity.\u201d It was at Maran\u00e0tha that Masina was introduced to football, which soon became an obsession. At 11 he was spotted by Bologna and joined their academy, becoming a promising striker, but at 17 he was told he could leave. \u201cThat summer was so tough,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI remember as if it was yesterday. My grandmother, my father and my brother were in a little flat we had rented by the seaside and I cried for an entire month. My grandmother told me not to worry. I remember I said to her: \u2018I want to be a footballer.\u2019 And she said: \u2018OK, but second option, what else do you want to do?\u2019 And I said: \u2018My second option is to be a footballer.\u2019 For her, for me, for my father it was tough.\u201d He ended up at Giacomense, a club in Italy\u2019s regional fourth division based 60km \u2013 a gruelling commute of about an hour and a half each way, by train and bus \u2013 from Masina\u2019s home, where he was converted into a defender. At the end of his first year with them Giacomense played a friendly against Bologna\u2019s Under-23s, a game of, literally, three halves. Masina sat out the first, played the second as striker and the third at left-back, and by the final whistle his old club wanted him back. Masina refused to go, believing that he would benefit from a season of senior football, but when they returned for him a year later there was no hesitation. Two strokes of luck followed: they were relegated to Serie B in 2014, when he was 20, and that December their left-back and captain, Archimede Morleo, was injured and Masina was thrust into the team. \u201cIn my head I was ready to go on loan, maybe to the third division, because I wanted to play. I was going to leave in just one month,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I got an opportunity, and I took it. That season we got promoted but fucking hell it was hard. By the end we were out of gas, running on fumes, everyone dead. We went up through the play-offs and that night was crazy. I loved it. We were driven through the city on a bus and it was crazy. What a memory. This is the story of my life: highs and lows.\u201d He spent three years as Bologna\u2019s first-choice left-back and played six times for Italy\u2019s Under-21s before moving to Watford in 2018. \u201cIt was hard to leave. So hard. But the first day I came here I said: \u2018OK, I like this.\u2019 Because it was like the next level. In Bologna we had a good team but here everyone has quality, everyone is fighting, everyone is running. Everyone has a fire inside.\u201d Now they have to show it. After a run of four wins in six unbeaten games over Christmas hauled Watford out of the relegation places, a couple of defeats have seen them slip back in. From here every game, starting at Brighton on Saturday, is potentially crucial. \u201cWe can\u2019t be relegated with this team,\u201d Masina says. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. This team has quality, strength, everything. We have everything. I know in the Premier League the level is so high but I think this team is a very good team. This season started so bad. I think with Nigel Pearson we fixed it a little bit, but we have to finish the work, because it\u2019s not possible for us to even think about relegation.\u201d It is going to be a struggle but not one Masina is afraid of. \u201cI\u2019m still fighting, every day. This is my way,\u201d he says. \u201cI know where I\u2019ve come from and I know that you get nothing for free in this life. So I\u2019ll keep fighting.\u201d",

The short story takes the form of a secret diary written by a young married woman who is suffering from a \u201ctemporary nervous depression \u2013 a slight hysterical tendency\u201d. Actually, the diagnosis has been made by her husband, who also happens to be \u201ca physician of high standing\u201d. In line with fashionable medical practice, \u201cJohn\u201d has prescribed a radical rest cure that involves separating the narrator from her small baby and confining her to the top-floor nursery of a rented country house: \u201cI \u2026 am absolutely forbidden to \u2018work\u2019 until I am well again.\u201d</p> <p>Gilman was writing out of her own agonising experience: five years earlier, and felled by postnatal depression following the birth of her daughter, she had been sent for treatment to America\u2019s leading expert in women\u2019s mental health, Dr Silas Weir Mitchell. His punishing regime for depressed middle-class female patients involved strict bed rest with no reading, writing, painting and, if it could be managed, thinking. His theory was grounded in the pervasive belief that if modern girls stopped wanting things \u2013 education, the vote but, above all, \u201cwork\u201d \u2013 they would become happy, which is to say docile, again. Mitchell instructed Gilman to live as domestic a life as possible \u201cand never to touch pen, brush or pencil as long as you live\u201d. Gilman wrote later of her treatment, which felt more like a prison sentence, \u201cI \u2026 came perilously close to losing my mind.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9b7d027607d37d949e769d0e72863b72f728a82d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b7d027607d37d949e769d0e72863b72f728a82d/0_0_907_1360/667.jpg\" alt=\"The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Which is exactly what happens to the narrator of \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d, as she discovers that having \u201cno congenial work, with excitement and change\u201d leaves her ravenous imagination at the mercy of unnamed terrors. As her mood darkens, she starts to notice unsettling things about her room: there are bars at the windows, iron rings on the walls and her bed has been nailed to the ground.

Can it really be, as she is now suggesting, that her husband and his sister are acting, not as her caretakers, but as her jailers?

Are we to interpret this as a potent symbol of the narrator\u2019s repressed creative desires, her psychic shadow?

It has lent itself to radio drama and has made it several times on to television, once even providing the plot for an episode of <em>The Twilight Zone</em>.

There is no crude physical violence in evidence here, not even a cross word. Instead what the narrator describes is a kind of psychological torture, in which her own sense of reality is constantly assaulted: \u201cJohn does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no REASON to suffer, and that satisfies him.\u201d Here, Marshall suggests, is a textbook account of what we have only recently come to recognise, let alone give a name to: \u201ccoercive control\u201d.

The Yale-trained artist, who grew up in South Central Los Angeles, is best known for his hyperreal portraits of mostly working-class men and women of colour dressed in vibrant streetwear. His monumental figures gleam with health and confidence, a world away from the pale, neurasthenic Wasp-ish woman whom we picture as the narrator of \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d \u2013 someone who looks a lot like Gilman in fact. </p> <p>For his new show, Wiley and his team went looking for female subjects in nearby Dalston. \u201cThe streetcasting went extremely well,\u201d remembers the curator, Rowan Bain. \u201cWomen were invited back to the gallery to be photographed, and Kehinde worked from those images.\u201d Yet the figures that will go on show are much more than character sketches drawn from contemporary streetlife. Wiley\u2019s practice has always depended on self-consciously inserting his subjects into the formal traditions of European high art. </p> <p>This is swagger portraiture, done in the tradition of a Rococo master such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/australia-culture-blog/gallery/2014/may/16/italian-masterpieces-from-spains-royal-court-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Giovanni Battista Tiepolo</a> or with the silky suggestiveness of a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/10/john-singer-sargent-national-portrait-gallery-review\" title=\"\"> John Singer Sargent</a>.

The tendency, ever since Gilman\u2019s short story was rediscovered by second-wave feminists in the 1970s, has been to read it as the escape of a bourgeois white woman from the prison of the patriarchy. But look carefully, Marshall suggests, and you will see that something more complex is going on. The building in which the narrator is imprisoned is an old \u201ccolonial\u201d mansion, dating from the age of slave-keeping in America. The shackles in the room hint at the violent physical restraint of black bodies. And it is not just one woman crawling under the wallpaper. By the end of the story the narrator has spotted \u201cso many\u201d women who she believes have scrabbled free from the garish yellow prison. \u201cWhat we are looking at here is a powerful moment of women coming together to act collectively,\u201d Marshall says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I couldn\u2019t do anything, but the less I did, the more ill I became.

Not without asking: \u201cOi, tattoos, where\u2019s the rest of it?\u201d</p> <p>So, without further ado, it is time for How to Eat (HTE) to put the fun in fungi and adjudicate on mushrooms on toast.</p> <p>Disclaimer: much as HTE loves the picture of Britain painted <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-for-any-meal-mushrooms-on-toast-177630\">in this American article</a>, of a nation of Siobhans habitually foraging their own mushrooms, please don\u2019t. It will likely be a waste of time in built-up Bolton or Birmingham (pro tip: try the supermarket), or you may die. Eight years in, HTE cannot afford to lose any more readers. We are barely quorate here as it is.</p> <h2>Mushrooms</h2> <p>The meatier the mushrooms, the mightier the dish; that is, both meaty in texture and in their bosky woodland flavours. They have their uses elsewhere, but in this case avoid mushrooms that can take on a flabby, chewy consistency, such as oyster, hen of the woods, girolles and shimeji. Instead, use stocky, muscular varieties such as chestnut or shiitake, bulked out if necessary with field or cup, and, perhaps, given a given a bit of extra bottom-end weight in the bass cabinets (note: it is often useful to think of a dish as a dub reggae soundsystem), by adding a few dried, rehydrated wild porcini.</p> <p>Chop everything into broadly uniform bite-sized chunks. You do not want a jumble of mushrooms ranging from minuscule to XXL pieces you struggle to manoeuvre into your mouth. Cook with care so that, beyond their silky surfaces, those earthy mushrooms retain a toothsome bite.</p> <h2>Flavourings and additions</h2> <p>To be precise, this entry should be titled <em>creamed</em> mushrooms on toast. You can fry your mushrooms in A Fat of Your Choosing (it should be butter and plenty of it) and simply plonk them on toast, but why deny yourself the pleasure of also enrobing them in something creamy? Preferably, half-fat creme fraiche, as its lactic twang is useful as we build flavour into this dish.</p> <p>Adding cream of some sort also helps overcome a major issue: during frying, mushrooms disgorge so much water you will struggle to drive it off. Served naked, wet mushrooms will create an unedifying damp patch in the middle of your toast. The addition of creme fraiche, however, seems to hold the sauce atop the toast for longer, slowing the rate of absorbency, preventing the bread from turning into a rank wet mulch. How does that work, you ask? Let\u2019s call it an emulsion-cum-viscosity-type-thing-maybe. If you came here for hard science, you are reading the wrong column.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb39090c6967962827a6a3c9d8a84851b35b9c6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb39090c6967962827a6a3c9d8a84851b35b9c6c/0_135_3900_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garlicky mushrooms with herbs on toasts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garlicky mushrooms with herbs on toast</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: martinturzak/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of additional flavourings, garlic is key, shallots or onion less so. You can crush, smoosh and generally obliterate the former into a melting paste, but, no matter how finely chopped, onions bring an itty-bitty texture to the dish that detracts from its velvet smoothness (see also, bacon shrapnel, pine nuts, chopped chives etc). For extra umami impact and/or general interest, you should also vigorously reduce a splash of soy sauce, dry Marsala or other wine in your mushrooms. HTE\u2019s preference is for soy early doors, then a squeeze of lemon just before serving to give it some top-line zip.</p> <p>You will see recipes advising you to garnish your mushrooms on toast with chives or flat-leaf parsley but will no one think of the food waste? Globally, 97.2% of fresh herb garnishes are removed and discarded after serving. They add nothing. Except a huge carbon footprint. Maybe. Probably. Either way, such decorative shrubbery is nonsense.</p> <p>Grated cheese is more tempting but similarly inessential. Deploy your soy efficiently and you will not need a sprinkling/avalanche of parmesan or cheddar to ramp up this dish\u2019s umami levels. In fact, go too heavy on the cheese and your \u2019shrooms will turn into a greasy quagmire.</p> <p>Adding an egg creates a similar issue. Yolk running in creamy sauce is not the sublime diary duet it appears on paper. It turns your hillock of creamed mushrooms into an overly thickened mess, while the egg white turns this already rich dish into something that eats like a precursor to gout.</p> <p>You could add a green side salad to make yourself feel virtuous but it will taste disgusting. Is there anything more dispiriting in food than eating iron-packed, chlorophyll-stacked leaves that have wilted in a hot, creamy sauce? It is a truly jarring experience. Like Thom Yorke supporting Taylor Swift, a misplaced Manchester City pass, Paddy McGuinness fronting Newsnight.</p> <p>Adding anything more substantial or radical to mushrooms on toast (please click past suggestions such as goat\u2019s cheese, crab meat, prosciutto or leeks), turns this into an irreconcilably different animal. The only thing worse would be dressing your plate with that Brian Blessed of condiments, truffle oil. No matter how little you use, it shouts down every other flavour. Less a finishing flourish, more aerial bombardment.</p> <h2><strong>Bread</strong></h2> <p>Take two inch-thick slices from the middle of a circular off-white sourdough <em>boule</em> and after toasting them to a Mediterranean tan, arrange them in a crossed V-shape*, one on top of the other. That way, you can drape your mushrooms over the \u201cjoint\u201d in that V and ensure that a section of the bottom piece of toast remains dry. This is the section, along with the indestructibly robust crusts, that you can then use to mop up any remnants of sauce or stray mushrooms. It is the best of both worlds: the generously buttered toast will be gently softened by the creamy sauce yet, elsewhere, will remain dry enough that you can taste its lightly sour, long-fermented complexity.</p> <p>You could try other breads. You could try ones that appear to make sense, such as ciabatta or English muffins (too woolly, too absorbent, ultimately). If you really hate yourself, you could also try those that don\u2019t, too (dark rye, worthy wholemeal, supermarket white sliced that will drown and disintegrate beneath those mushrooms). But with the exception of Simon Hopkinson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/23/observer-food-monthly-20-best-easy-autumn-recipes\">beloved fried bread</a> \u2013 worth trying, but just <em>too much</em>, frankly \u2013 you will always come back to sourdough.</p> <p>* Please invert the V so its apex is facing away from you as you eat. Only a monster would eat food that is pointing aggressively at them. And why have you made your food so angry? Because you are eating it upside down.</p> <h2><strong>Equipment</strong></h2> <p>A flat plate with a low lip to retain the sauce, but nothing deeper or curved that exists in that growing grey zone where bowls meet plates. You need a proper flat surface to work on, one that in no way inhibits your movements with a knife and fork. Put the kitchen roll on the table, too. Let\u2019s go all out. This is a saucy dish. It can get messy.</p> <h2><strong>When</strong></h2> <p>Historically, mushrooms on toast was regularly described as the ultimate \u201clight supper\u201d, that middle-class meal eaten mid-evening (in lieu of a proper tea, the bohemian layabouts) that baffled working-class northerners who, by that hour, had already eaten their supper \u2013 cornflakes in front of Coronation Street. But now we all work and eat at increasingly irregular hours and that confusion no longer opens up the seam of comic gold it once did. The light supper is toast. Eating a main(ish) meal at 8pm (or 4pm or 10pm) has been normalised.</p> <p>That is good news for mushrooms on toast, because other than before 9am, when a deeply savoury version can be a bit over-facing, it works at any time. It is big enough to fill any hunger gap, but not so heavy it will leave you prone and groaning. Quite the opposite. It is a relatively easily digestible livener. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jan/09/savoury-course-endorse\">a fan of the savoury course</a>, HTE also recommends it as dessert, albeit in a half-size version.</p> <h2><strong>Drink</strong></h2> <p>I know this is Britain. I know this is How to Eat. But, hey guys, we don\u2019t have to drink alcohol with every meal, right? Because in a very satisfying case of serendipity, vis-a-vis the Oz-style brunch cafe, the flat white is the perfect partner for mushrooms on toast. In a Venn diagram they would overlap in their creaminess, but then the coffee\u2019s smoothly modulated bitterness clears the palate of any overbearing greasiness. It\u2019s perfection. For 20 minutes. Then you can go for a pint.</p> <p>So, mushrooms on toast, how do you eat yours?</p>",

Packed with beneficial nutrients and so sustainable you can grow them in spent coffee grounds (creating a virtuous breakfast circle), mushrooms are set to play an ever bigger part in our mornings. Like the bacon sandwich or boiled egg, mushrooms on toast is a dish of such seeming simplicity you may wonder how it warrants How to Eat\u2019s attention. How will it support 1,500 words of painfully verbose, serio-comic riffing? But at How to Eat the deliciousness is in the detail. For instance, two plain, baked flat mushrooms on Warburton\u2019s toastie loaf is, technically, mushrooms on toast. But is that the dish that celebrity fans such as Nigel Slater, Timothy Spall and Victoria Coren fell in love with? It is certainly not a plate you would happily pay \u00a37 for in your local hipster caf\u00e9 (after drone yoga, Weds 7.30am).

      "bodyText": "Spain is abandoning people in poverty and failing to take social rights seriously despite its post-recession recovery, according to a UN expert who has finished a 12-day fact-finding visit to the country. Philip Alston, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said that while Spain had largely bounced back from the economic crisis of 2008, poverty rates remained \u201cappallingly high\u201d and urgent action was required. \u201cSpain is a country with a grand history, a global leader in some areas, and a cultural beacon,\u201d he said in a preliminary report published on Friday. \u201cBut Spain today needs to take a close look at itself in the mirror. What it will see is not what most Spaniards would wish for. The self-image of a close family-based society rooted in deeply shared values and social solidarity has been badly fractured by an economic crisis and the implementation of neoliberal policies. The local and familial safety nets that had been historically important continue to work for the well-off, but have been undermined for a large part of the population.\u201d He noted that 26.1% of people \u2013 and 29.5% of children \u2013 were at risk of poverty or social exclusion in Spain in 2018. The unemployment rate, which stands at 13.85%, is more than double the EU average, while youth unemployment is at 30.5%. Alston, who visited Madrid, Galicia, the Basque country, Extremadura, Andaluc\u00eda and Catalonia, said he had seen areas that \u201cmany Spaniards would not recognise as parts of their own country\u201d: a shantytown with \u201cfar worse conditions than a refugees camp\u201d; poor neighbourhoods \u201cwhere families raise children with a dearth of state services, health clinics, employment centres, security, paved roads or legal electricity\u201d, and a segregated school where all the students are Roma and which has a 75% rate of early leaving. The special rapporteur said the word he had heard most frequently during the trip was \u201cabandoned\u201d, adding that the benefits of the economic recovery had mainly gone to corporations and the wealthy, while the public services and protections slashed during the economic crisis had in many cases not been restored. Part of the problem, he said, was that the social assistance network was \u201cfragmented and impossible to navigate\u201d, and too many officials were complacent or keen to pin the blame on other parts of the system. Alston called for more to be done to help vulnerable groups such as Spain\u2019s Roma population of 750,000 people and its 6 million migrants. He mentioned visiting a migrant settlement in Andaluc\u00eda whose conditions \u201crival the worst I have seen anywhere in the world\u201d and whose residents have almost no access to government support. He said that low-cost social housing was \u201calmost nonexistent\u201d and detailed the challenges facing those in rural poverty, those with disabilities and the hundreds of thousands of people who work as live-in maids or carers. Alston paid tribute to the \u201cincredible work\u201d done by the third sector in Spain and noted that the new coalition government \u2013 between the Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party and the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance \u2013 had \u201chigh hopes and impressive ambitions, especially in the social sphere\u201d. But he said it faced \u201cdaunting challenges\u201d and that Spain needed \u201cinnovative leadership\u201d from the central government and properly funded reforms at a regional level. Alston said the new government needed to focus on the housing crisis, decent working conditions for those in low-paid jobs, a national minimum incomes scheme, early childhood education programme for all children aged up to three, and far-reaching fiscal reforms to improve redistribution, tackle fraud and bring transparency to corporate tax arrangements. \u201cIf strategic plans, action programmes, and voluminous but unreadable reports could solve poverty, Spain would be riding high,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the absence of a meaningful commitment to uphold people\u2019s social rights to housing, education, and an adequate standard of living, these grand designs will continue to be as ineffectual as they have been over the past decade.\u201d He added: \u201cPoverty is ultimately a political choice, and governments can, if they wish, opt to overcome it.\u201d",

Their key observation in the interim report is that safe standing \u201chas had a positive impact on spectator safety, particularly in mitigating the risk of crowd collapse.\u201d</p> <p>The SGSA also observe that safe standing has not caused tension between supporters or between supporters and stewards. \u201cThere has been very little conflict as a result of standing,\u201d it said.</p> <p>While the findings are still provisional, they have met with approval from the government Every political party endorsed the idea of safe standing in their manifestos during last year\u2019s election and the sports minister Nigel Adams reinforced that view in light of the report.</p> <p>\u201cI welcome the latest findings from the Sports Grounds Safety Authority\u2019s research. As we made clear in our election manifesto, we will work with fans and clubs towards introducing safe standing at football grounds.</p> <p>\u201cHowever it is imperative that football remains as safe as it has become over the past 25 years.

Since 1994 all clubs in the Premier League and Championship have been obliged to have all-seater stadia.</p> <p>Standing is possible in Leagues One and Two, where traditional terracing still remains at many grounds. The trials observed by the SGSA involve one particular type of standing arrangement, rail seating, which involve seats that can be folded away to allow standing and form a barrier at each level of the ground.</p> <p>The EFL commented on the SGSA report stating: \u201cThe EFL is encouraged by the direction of travel being taken on what remains an important issue for the League and its membership. Our position remains consistent in that EFL Clubs, across all three divisions, should be able to provide supporters with the matchday experience they want in accordance with the relevant safety requirements, whether it is sitting or standing in stadiums.\u201d</p> <p>The SGSA\u2019s research will now continue until the end of the season.

      "bodyText": "Safe standing across English football has come a step closer after a report found it had \u201ca positive impact on spectator safety\u201d. The findings, made by the Sports Grounds Safety Authority (SGSA) in an interim report, have been welcomed by government. They could herald the return of standing to the top two divisions in England for the first time since the implementation of the Taylor report, should they be borne out in the final version of the report due this summer. The SGSA has this season studied behaviour at Celtic Park and Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Westfalenstadion as well as at English clubs Shrewsbury Town, Wycombe Wanderers and Oxford United which are trialling the technology. Their key observation in the interim report is that safe standing \u201chas had a positive impact on spectator safety, particularly in mitigating the risk of crowd collapse.\u201d The SGSA also observe that safe standing has not caused tension between supporters or between supporters and stewards. \u201cThere has been very little conflict as a result of standing,\u201d it said. While the findings are still provisional, they have met with approval from the government Every political party endorsed the idea of safe standing in their manifestos during last year\u2019s election and the sports minister Nigel Adams reinforced that view in light of the report. \u201cI welcome the latest findings from the Sports Grounds Safety Authority\u2019s research. As we made clear in our election manifesto, we will work with fans and clubs towards introducing safe standing at football grounds. \u201cHowever it is imperative that football remains as safe as it has become over the past 25 years. Robust evidence that this change will provide equivalent or improved safety for supporters, will be absolutely paramount to this process. \u201cThere is more work that needs to be done. The SGSA is continuing to gather evidence over the course of this season, and I have asked them to work with the football authorities to consider next steps as we work with clubs and fans to introduce safe standing.\u201d Standing in the top two flights of English football has been banned since the implementation of the Taylor report which followed the Hillsborough tragedy of 1989. Since 1994 all clubs in the Premier League and Championship have been obliged to have all-seater stadia. Standing is possible in Leagues One and Two, where traditional terracing still remains at many grounds. The trials observed by the SGSA involve one particular type of standing arrangement, rail seating, which involve seats that can be folded away to allow standing and form a barrier at each level of the ground. The EFL commented on the SGSA report stating: \u201cThe EFL is encouraged by the direction of travel being taken on what remains an important issue for the League and its membership. Our position remains consistent in that EFL Clubs, across all three divisions, should be able to provide supporters with the matchday experience they want in accordance with the relevant safety requirements, whether it is sitting or standing in stadiums.\u201d The SGSA\u2019s research will now continue until the end of the season. Should the final report prove positive, it could pave the way to the return of safe standing by the 2021-22 season.",

      "bodyText": "Foxconn, the electronics company that supplies Apple, has begun manufacturing its own surgical masks, allowing Chinese workers to churn out iPhones uninterrupted as the coronavirus crisis continues. The Taiwanese company\u2019s production lines have been shut down because of the disruption caused by the outbreak, slowing down the supply chain that feeds Apple\u2019s global retail network. However, in a statement released via the Chinese social media platform WeChat, Foxconn said it hoped to get around the problem by switching some of its own production lines to make masks, for its own staff and to supply the soaring global demand for them. It hopes to increase production to 2m masks by the end of the month. \u201cIn this war against the epidemic, every second counts,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe earlier we take precautionary actions, the earlier we can prevent the virus, the earlier we can save lives, the sooner we can overcome this.\u201d Foxconn, which has previously come under scrutiny over poor conditions endured by workers making iPhones, said it had already begun a test run of masks at its main manufacturing plant in Shenzhen, southern China. They will initially be produced for internal use by its hundreds of thousands of employees, the majority of whom work in factories in mainland China. After that, it will begin supplying masks to the wider public, from whom soaring demand has caused shortages as people trying to protect themselves from the virus. Several other Chinese companies have said they will divert some of their production capacity to mask-making. They include the clothing firm Hongdou Group and the carmaker SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co Ltd, a joint-venture automaker formed by General Motors and two Chinese partners. The outbreak, which began in Wuhan, Hubei province, has claimed 636 lives in mainland China and infected more than 30,000 people. A number of multinational companies have said they expect significant disruption to their supply chains or their Chinese sales, while economists have predicted the virus will reduce output in China and nearby countries such as Thailand, which relies heavily on tourism from the country.",

Long-Bailey said she was in the Labour leadership race to win, but she would work with whoever became the next leader, saying that she liked all the candidates. \u201cI want to win,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got nine weeks to go and a lot will happen and it will hopefully become a battle of ideas.\u201d Long-Bailey is one of the frontrunners in the Labour leadership contest, in which she has been characterised as the leftwing heir to Jeremy Corbyn, standing against Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry. The result will be announced on 4 April.",

      "bodyText": "Arsenal (13 days) A week off, and a four-day Dubai training camp. Mikel Arteta: \u201cThese last few months have been tough for these players. They\u2019ve really been through a lot.\u201d Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang started his recovery by posting a private jet champagne shot en route to Abu Dhabi. Aston Villa (14 days) Eight days off. Jack Grealish and Tyrone Mings shared beach photos \u2013 overlaying an image of a tubby man in pants on one of them, with injured teammate John McGinn\u2019s face photoshopped on top. Villa coach John Terry clicked the like button, then posted laughing emojis. Bournemouth (12 days) After Sheffield United, a careful blend of days off and training, as Eddie Howe aims to lift the mood. \u201cIt\u2019s been the most difficult period in our Premier League history. But these players really care.\u201d Brighton (13 days) Plans for a Dubai training camp were shelved last month after instability in the region. Graham Potter plans to use the time instead to focus on building team spirit. \u201cWe\u2019ll fight. We\u2019ll show character.\u201d Burnley (12 days) Sean Dyche dropped his plan for an overseas camp due to the risk of a possible FA Cup replay ruining it. Instead he\u2019s offering his players \u201cjust a few days off \u2026 It\u2019s entirely up to them what they do with it\u201d. Chelsea (16 days) \u201cWe\u2019re not travelling abroad as a group,\u201d says Frank Lampard. \u201cThe players can go back to their countries or do whatever they want to do, it\u2019s their choice.\u201d Tammy Abraham chose a Dubai mini-break, Jorginho\u2019s been back in Brazil. Crystal Palace (13 days) Also no grand plans. \u201cI\u2019d just like the players to be able to get away from football, to be with their families,\u201d says Roy Hodgson. \u201cIt\u2019ll give people that breather to get a second wind for the second part of the season.\u201d Everton (14 days) \u201cThey can have maybe four, five days off. Then we train again,\u201d says Carlo Ancelotti. \u201cI want to stay here in Finch Farm. We don\u2019t need to move around the world. We stay here.\u201d Leicester (13 days) Feeling more upbeat about it all: third-in-the-table Brendan Rodgers. \u201cI just see this as a great chance for the players to not train, a chance for them to recover mentally.\u201d A chance also for James Maddison to show off his Dubai infinity pool. Liverpool (10 days) First-teamers spent the Shrewsbury replay holidaying in the Maldives, Miami, LA, Dubai, and, in James Milner\u2019s case, Liverpool. \u201cIt\u2019s about welfare, they need rest,\u201d says J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cA mental, physical rest.\u201d Manchester City (12 days) Pep Guardiola says he considered a warm-weather get-together, but then thought better of it. \u201cIn the end I just wanted the guys to be with their families. We\u2019ll have a few days off, then we\u2019ll train here again.\u201d Manchester United (16 days) Fred\u2019s been on a waterslide in the Maldives, Marcus Rashford was at the Super Bowl with Jay-Z, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kevin Hart. The squad will be meeting up again for some shuttle runs in Marbella. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a good camp together,\u201d says Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cWe\u2019ll get our energy back.\u201d Newcastle (11 days) \u201cWe\u2019re not going away as a group, I\u2019ve had enough of them,\u201d says Steve Bruce. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve had enough of me, by the way. So let them go. Some of them are going to see their family. Some are going to find the sun.\u201d Norwich (14 days) Also keeping it low-key, Daniel Farke says he\u2019s just focused on using the time to plan for Liverpool\u2019s visit on the 15th. \u201cWe want to give ourselves the chance to win. We are greedy for wins. We don\u2019t play just to avoid losing.\u201d Sheffield United (12 days) United are pressing ahead with their Dubai trip. Chris Wilder says it\u2019ll be serious work, with no time for basking in success. \u201cThe key now is not to pat yourself on the back.\u201d Southampton (9 days) After their Cup replay defeat at Spurs, it\u2019s best not to ask Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl about winter breaks. \u201cNext year football must rethink this winter break. You ask me about a winter break? For us there is no winter break.\u201d Tottenham (10 days) See also Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. \u201cMy players will have some days off \u2026 but I don\u2019t like this break. For me, the break doesn\u2019t make any sense the way it is. But I don\u2019t complain.

It\u2019s never an easy journey.\u201d West Ham (14 days) Last time David Moyes was in charge West Ham wintered in Miami. No such plans this time. Their tense break starts after they play Manchester City, and ends with a trip to Liverpool. Wolves (12 days) Warm-weather training in Marbella. Conor Coady insists it\u2019s serious stuff. \u201cWe train and we do things every day, it\u2019s not just switching off and doing nothing. We\u2019re grown men.

It\u2019s Sabrina Frederick who goes into the history books, and a rare uncluttered piece of lead-up play.

It\u2019s over the head of Frederick, giving her space to run back and lose her opponent to mark. Then Frederick goes back from 40 out and thumps the long kick through!

There\u2019s a scrum inside 50 leading to a ball-up, with Harris in the ruck, then fighting for the ball in the pocket. Rebecca Miller outwrestles her this time around. Brennan is floating down into defence, just trying to have some influence on the contest. Tayla Stahl for Richmond wins a free for a hard tackle on the wing, but the Tigers turn it over and concede a 50-metre penalty for kicking the ball away. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3d32ca8f08e1332473ecdb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-07T09:51:24.460Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>3rd quarter, 8 mins remaining: </strong>a throw-in for Carlton after the ball trickles into the behind post, and Vescio grabs the crumb heading towards the boundary line, but her snap from the pocket bounces the wrong way.

A couple of handpasses, a fake-out, then Georgia Gee runs the ball out of defence. Finds McEvoy on the wing, who kicks to Harris at half-forward.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s the season underway as well. More teams, more players, more stories, and all going on at the same time as the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup in the cricket will be hosted in Australia too. We\u2019ll have plenty of coverage from that, so look out for the blogs and reports and columns. As for the footy, Kirby Fenwick is at Princes Park right now writing a piece on the atmosphere of the game and the event tonight, which will be waiting on your sport pages tomorrow morning Australian time. So look out for that and Kirby\u2019s other writing throughout the season. The match ends as it proceeded all night, in Carlton\u2019s forward line. Lauren Brazzale ends up with a shot at goal late in the piece, but pushes it wide. Plenty of behinds for the Blues tonight, but they managed to get enough shots through the middle to make for a comfortable victory. They looked like a team that has spent some time together: not complete polish as yet, but stitching together good sequences of passes and moving well at times. Richmond couldn\u2019t match that, rarely getting much in the way of quality possession together. The Tigers created pressure early by being hard at the ball, but found themselves locked in desperate defence for too much of the night, and eventually wore themselves out. Still, that\u2019s their first game played, and they\u2019re underway in the AFLW. 4th quarter, 3 mins remaining: Vescio sells a dummy, slick move, then drives toward goal, but a late and well-timed first denies the major score. She\u2019s up in the centre square now, getting in everything. Sets up Prespakis for a flying shot at goal with her 20th touch. Another miss. The kick-in ends up at the half-back boundary, with Richmond\u2019s Stahl seeing it over. She\u2019s been fierce at the contest all night, wearing the helmet a la Nathan Burke. 4th quarter, 7 mins remaining: A second goal for Richmond! Courtney Wakefield makes up for her earlier miss by slotting her first and the Tigers\u2019 second from open play. The celebrations are almost as good this time around. 4th quarter, 9 mins remaining: A quick goal back for Carlton, after a scrappy push forward as Downie receives a pass over the top and dinks it through. Doesn\u2019t matter how they come. Richmond\u2019s glow of happiness gets a little dimmed. 4th quarter, 11 mins remaining: Richmond\u2019s women score their first goal! It\u2019s Sabrina Frederick who goes into the history books, and a rare uncluttered piece of lead-up play. Brennan receives the ball in space on the half-forward flank, and has the time to measure her kick long into the forward line. It\u2019s over the head of Frederick, giving her space to run back and lose her opponent to mark. Then Frederick goes back from 40 out and thumps the long kick through! The Tigers celebrate fiercely, and it\u2019s good to see how much that means despite a tough night. Vescio tries to wriggle free on the boundary for one more run at goal but Sarah Sansonetti hangs onto her tight and defuses the threat. That\u2019s the end of the quarter, with the Blues now out by 37 points. 3rd quarter, 1 min remaining: Carlton have dropped the hammer now. Their forward-line pressure and dominance in territory was always likely to take its toll eventually. Richmond just can\u2019t get out of defence. At this point there\u2019s a ruck infringement and Maddie Prespakis ends up with the free. From 30 metres out she sends it through and celebrates accordingly. 3rd quarter, 2 mins remaining: from that 50 penalty, the Blues come forward cleanly. Prespakis gets the entry into the forward line once again, kicking to the advantage of Harris. Mark! At the top of the square, and Harris goes back and slots her set shot this time around. 3rd quarter, 4 mins remaining: Grace Egan gets done for holding the ball for a third time tonight. She\u2019ll have to do some work on speed of disposal. The Tigers can\u2019t get clear though, and give up possession after that through a free for high contact. There\u2019s a scrum inside 50 leading to a ball-up, with Harris in the ruck, then fighting for the ball in the pocket. Rebecca Miller outwrestles her this time around. Brennan is floating down into defence, just trying to have some influence on the contest. Tayla Stahl for Richmond wins a free for a hard tackle on the wing, but the Tigers turn it over and concede a 50-metre penalty for kicking the ball away. 3rd quarter, 8 mins remaining: a throw-in for Carlton after the ball trickles into the behind post, and Vescio grabs the crumb heading towards the boundary line, but her snap from the pocket bounces the wrong way. Carlton threatening to blow the Tigers away as the new team tires. 3rd quarter, 8 mins remaining: There\u2019s the goal that Richmond missed out on, going to the Blues. Running play into the pocket, Prespakis with time and calm, looping the handball over the top to Brooke Walker who has made good space and receives the ball unmarked to pop through a simple score. 3rd quarter, 9 mins remaining: Richmond should have their first goal now, but that\u2019s a shocker of a miss from Courtney Wakefield. Marks strongly about 15 from goal, shoots from 20, but leans back on her kick and screws it across the face of goal for no score. 3rd quarter, 12 mins remaining: Richmond start the quarter well, pressing forward, but Carlton come up with one of their best moves of the night from half-back. A couple of handpasses, a fake-out, then Georgia Gee runs the ball out of defence. Finds McEvoy on the wing, who kicks to Harris at half-forward. She\u2019s about to mark but Makur Chuot makes amazing ground running back to spoil. But Richmond are pinged after that for diving on the ball, and a short pass finds Vescio in the pocket. She lines up her set shot and drills it! Almost that opening goal for Richmond in the dying seconds of the quarter, as they race forward from a turnover, get it long inside 50, and have Laura McClelland run back onto the loose ball and screw a snap around her body at goal. But it\u2019s offline, and the Tigers will have to keep waiting. 2nd quarter, 1 min remaining: Egan done for holding the ball again in the forward pocket, trying to break a tackle but stripped of the ball. The Tigers get the ball to half-forward but McEvoy arrives to take a tough contested mark for the Blues. They work their way up the field carefully this time, mark to mark rather than trying to surge through the lines. It goes through Sarah Hosking to end up with Harris taking a set shot from the pocket, but misses again. The Blues are 1.8 (14) at the moment. 2nd quarter, 7 min remaining: A long kick towards the 50 for the Blues puts the Tigers under pressure. Vescio strips the ball at the arc and thumps it forward, but through the hands of Harris near the goalsquare with three to beat. The Blues get possession again, back for a mark to Loynes who drives to the square, but a quick kick is touched through for a behind. Then as the game keeps being played in Carlton\u2019s half, Tayla Harris marks about 45 out and launches a long set shot with that high-kicking action, but it fades right of goal and Vescio can\u2019t keep it in. 2nd quarter, 9 min remaining: Tigers are on the board! Not that much to cheer about yet, but Brennan grabs the loose ball at 50, runs laterally to the goal, then lets loose a booming shot at the sticks. It fades left for a point, but they\u2019re away. Desperate stuff from Monahan again, who races back to make a tackle on Joanne Doonan as the Carlton player was racing from the pocket towards goal. The ball comes back in and Vescio is claiming a pack mark but the umpire says it was touched. Finally Richmond get a clearing kick and Conti marks to relieve the pressure in the final seconds of the quarter. It\u2019s been a tough one for Richmond, and the advantage is clearly with the more experienced Blues. 1st quarter, 1 min remaining: A clean run of marks from Carlton out of defence, Downie to Dalton to McEvoy at centre-half forward. But the final kick only finds a contest. Cleared out, comes back in, and Katie Loynes gets a free kick for high contact! There was a hand clearly grabbing the top of her shoulder. Loynes takes her shot from 25 out and dobs it. 1st quarter, 3 mins remaining: Bernardi has the Tigers\u2019 first shot at goal after a mark up forward, but her shot falls short. Brennan takes the crumb but is wrestled over a boundary line. 1st quarter, 4 mins remaining: Maddie Prespakis comes off the field looking dazed after an accidental head bump. Bad news. Vescio has her thigh strapped. Katie Brennan gives away a 50-metre penalty as the Tigers try to go forward. 1st quarter, 7 mins remaining: Opening round last season was a jumble of nerves, a lot of fumbles.

      "body": "<p>My grandfather, Ben Hooberman, who has died aged 98, was a leading expert in employment and industrial law, helping to guide the development of workplace rights.</p> <p>The son of Barnett Hooberman, a wholesale dairy importer, and his wife, Ada (nee Shackman), Ben was born and grew up in Stamford Hill, north London. He studied law at Trinity College Dublin, where his world opened up and his desire for keen political debate flowered. His studies were interrupted in 1941 by service in the second world war.</p> <p>He joined the newly formed Intelligence Corps, serving in mainland Europe and in India. Though proud of his time in the forces, he rarely discussed his duties, which included reuniting families following the liberation of death camps.</p> <p>Upon his return, Ben finished his law degree in Dublin and embarked on a remarkable life.

      "bodyText": "My grandfather, Ben Hooberman, who has died aged 98, was a leading expert in employment and industrial law, helping to guide the development of workplace rights. The son of Barnett Hooberman, a wholesale dairy importer, and his wife, Ada (nee Shackman), Ben was born and grew up in Stamford Hill, north London. He studied law at Trinity College Dublin, where his world opened up and his desire for keen political debate flowered. His studies were interrupted in 1941 by service in the second world war. He joined the newly formed Intelligence Corps, serving in mainland Europe and in India. Though proud of his time in the forces, he rarely discussed his duties, which included reuniting families following the liberation of death camps. Upon his return, Ben finished his law degree in Dublin and embarked on a remarkable life. With a partner, Michael Kelly, he set up the legal firm Lawford &amp; Co in 1954. In 1957 he met Ellen Rosenthal at a party at the Oxford and Cambridge Club, and they were married later that year. Ben acted as the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor in the 1961 high court case Byrne and Chapple v Foulkes, working to uncover communist ballot-rigging within the Electrical Trades Union. Ben went on to act for, and help democratise, many unions, ensuring representation and justice for workers.

      "bodyText": "Well, that wraps up our live coverage of the Matildas\u2019 bumper 7-0 opening Olympic qualifying win over Taiwan. Thanks for joining us, and keep an eye out for Sam Lewis\u2019 take on the game early tomorrow morning AEDT. Ciao for now. There\u2019s some serious high-fiving going on between Kerr and a glut of kids. Just reward for a wet night out. That, and the fact the Matildas sit top of their group ahead of second-placed China. Foord is happy to have \u201cexecuted the game plan\u201d after all the turmoil and constant changes that left the team \u201cfeeling like it was matchday minus five for ages\u201d. More specifically, she\u2019s content her extra finishing training is paying dividends. \u201cI\u2019ve been really working on it personally in front of goal. I felt like that was an area where I wasn\u2019t confident,\u201d she told Fox Sports. \u201cAs a team we\u2019ve always kind of dropped our level against teams like this so we wanted to really play our level of football and keep that at a high intensity.\u201d FT: Australia 7-0 Taiwan The full-time whistle has blown and it marks a sound start for the Matildas\u2019 Tokyo qualification campaign. It wasn\u2019t perfect, and more challenging opposition awaits, but the women in green and gold provided some fine football that will, in turn, spike confidence ahead of clashes with Thailand and China. Take a bow Caitlin Foord, the newly signed Arsenal player who hit a hat-trick, and Steph Catley, Hayley Raso, Sam Kerr and Katrina Gorry who added a goal apiece in style. 92 min Australia 7-0 Taiwan Well, it\u2019s been a long time since Gorry last scored for the Matildas, but just reward for the substitute\u2019s shift tonight. Kellond-Knight floats one forward for Gielnik as Logarzo and co surge into the box. But it\u2019s Raso who steers the ball into the area and hugs the byline before her cutback deflects off the \u2018keeper and flies into the path of Gorry. Mini sticks out her right peg for the volley and picks out the bottom corner with all the precision of somebody who hasn\u2019t scored an international goal in nearly three years and wants a ticket to Tokyo. 90 min Australia 6-0 Taiwan Another brief squiz at the stats tells me Australia have played out this contest with 80 per cent possession. Given the clear discrepancy in quality, the Matildas might - perhaps should - have hit double figures by now. As I type, Gielnik is denied again by Taiwan\u2019s custodian, who has single-handedly saved her team from an even more embarrassing scoreline. 87 min Australia 6-0 Taiwan Logarzo dispatches a delightful ball into the path of Gielnik, who blazes into the area and cuts back for Kerr, but the Chelsea striker\u2019s less-favoured left foot (if that\u2019s possible) isn\u2019t quite particular enough and she diverts agonisingly wide of the net. 84 min: Australia 6-0 Taiwan Taiwan earn a corner after a backpass from McCormick gets Williams into a fumble. No sooner than Chen Yen-Ping has taken the set piece the ball is back in Australian possession at the halfway mark. 80 min Australia 6-0 Taiwan Kerr takes another swipe at goal but it\u2019s collected cleanly, before Gielnik makes her presence known via physical runs in behind. Milicic is on the sideline imploring his side to keep up the intensity. 75 min Australia 6-0 Taiwan The night is over for hat-trick heroine Foord, replaced by Bayern Munich forward Emily Gielnik. As she comes on there\u2019s more concern, this time for Catley, whose knee is being checked. 72 min: Australia 6-0 Taiwan Logarzo is down after landing awkwardly and clutching worryingly at her knee. The midfielder is attended to by officials but appears to pull up okay and looks as if she will continue to play on. Here\u2019s Kerr\u2019s goal ... 65 min: Australia 6-0 Taiwan CHANCE! Kerr very nearly makes it two goals in two minutes but for the offside flag, which was correctly raised. Kerr laughs as if to acknowledge she knew. 64 min: Australia 6-0 Taiwan It takes Kerr three minutes on the field to deliver. A beauty of a through ball from Logarzo provides the foundation but it\u2019s Kerr\u2019s composed first touch and incisive left-footed finish that ensures the chance is not wasted. That\u2019s why she\u2019s global star. 63 min: Australia 5-0 Taiwan Foord plays in Kerr and the poor battered Zhuo Li-Ping gets battered again by Raso as the Everton\u2019s latest signing puts her body on the line. 61 min: Australia 5-0 Taiwan Foord is relentless, this time ambushing two players and squeezing another top-drawer save out of Chen Si Yu. And Kerr is coming, replacing Simon and eliciting a cheer from the fans who have braved the wet to watch their team. 58 min: Australia 5-0 Taiwan Foord is hunting a fourth goal and Catley feeds, but she skews wide. Undoubtedly much to the fans\u2019 delight, Kerr is warming up. 54 min: Australia 5-0 Taiwan The underdogs have a free-kick and Zhuo Li-Ping cops a back-hander from Logarzo as she goes for the ball. And the Matildas are suddenly away on the counter-attack, Gorry with a lovely pass forward and Raso racing at full pelt into the box and around the goalkeeper to deposit the ball into an open net. That missed opportunity in the previous minute will be all but forgotten for now. 53 min: Australia 4-0 Taiwan Missed chance! And it would have been a sitter for Foord had Simon squared the ball to her inside the box. Except that she doesn\u2019t, hungry for a goal of her own, and misses. The Matildas then get a corner and Gorry has opted for a short corner (which rarely seems to have any effect whatsoever) to Raso, who embarks on a one-two with KK before being taken out by a defender. 49 min: Australia 4-0 Taiwan SAVE! Raso draws the save of the match from Chen Si Yu, who somehow gets a glove to it. Simon then has a crack herself and brushes the side netting. The chances are coming thick and fast for Australia in a frenetic start to this second half. The players are back out on the pitch and Milicic has replaced van Egmond with Katrina Gorry. What can \u2018Mini\u2019 do with this opportunity? It also must be said that may have been van Egmond\u2019s best display of the past 12 months. All in all a good half of football from the Matildas. Milicic has to be happy with four goals in 38 minutes. If anything, he\u2019ll want his side to pass more accurately and maintain the intensity - easier said than done against inferior opposition. While there were some errant passes the overall passing accuracy was at 86 per cent in the first half and the Matildas completed 404 passes to Taiwan\u2019s 96, to give you some idea of the way this contest has tilted. Here\u2019s Catley\u2019s goal ICYMI! HT: Australia 4-0 Taiwan Simon embarks on another foray forward and she really is in lovely touch, the striker who\u2019s injury problems ruled her out of last year\u2019s World Cup in France. Raso, meanwhile, is called offside and the referee\u2019s halftime whistle blows. 45 min: Australia 4-0 Taiwan Australia have a throw-in and it\u2019s misplaced by McCormick. The Matildas reset and the backline passes between themselves before van Egmond goes to Roestbakken and then Simon goes for a long-range strike but doesn\u2019t have enough on it. There\u2019ll be two minutes of added time in this first half. 42 min Australia 4-0 Taiwan It\u2019s difficult to ignore Taiwan\u2019s decidedly underwhelming defence in some moments of this game. But tell you what, Foord is thriving in that front wide role. She has been shuffled around throughout her already decorated career and even done defensive shifts, and Milicic tested her at No 10 earlier in his tenure before perhaps fully realising how to balance this squad best. 38 min Australia 4-0 Taiwan Foord has her hat-trick! Simon has her head up as she chips a well-placed long ball forward and the marginally onside van Egmond\u2019s first touch to Foord is equally as delicate. Foord takes it from there, barrelling inside the far post for her second international hat-trick. 34 min: Australia 3-0 Taiwan Logarzo is having beef with defender Zhuo Li-Ping and is pulled up just as the camera closes in on Kerr keeping warm on the sideline. She duly offers a wink. 33 min: Taiwan captain Ting Chi has a massive chance to pull a goal back and keep her side in this contest but her finishes sails marginally wide. 31 min: This time it\u2019s Catley, and the stand-in skipper doesn\u2019t miss. Chloe Logarzo is whipping in and out and passes to van Egmond, who pokes a through ball as Catley runs in behind two defenders and takes on goalkeeper Chen as she does. Chen trips her as she unleashes her finish, and had it not tucked into the net Catley may well have earned a penalty for Australia regardless. But it does, and the 26-year-old is on the turf flying an imaginary aeroplane in celebration of her third international goal. 30 min: Raso cuts inside this time and finds van Egmond, but the midfielder sprays wide. 26 min: Yet another chance goes begging as swathes of gold whir up the field, but Raso is caught out and dispossessed. 24 min: In the very next passage of play Foord has her brace, barely halfway through the first half. Catley finds Simon, who offloads to KK and then forward to Foord. It amounts to nothing but Australia win the ball back quickly and van Egmond is there for the reverse pass. Foord is all quick feet dancing around the \u2018keeper and prodding home right on the line. Life at the Gunners could be very sweet for the former Sydney FC star. Here\u2019s Foord\u2019s earlier effort: 23 min: We\u2019re not seeing much of Lydia Williams tonight, and Milicic will hope it stays that way. She\u2019s briefly called into action as Roestbakken tracks back and delivers a backpass and the Matildas are back up the pitch again. 20 min: Wang Hsiang Huei wins a free-kick and it should be noted that, while having only 22 per cent possession, Taiwan aren\u2019t afraid to get forward themselves, often through Chen Yen-Ping. 17 min: This pitch is clearly wet and heavy but it doesn\u2019t seem to be bothering the green and gold as Raso rinses Yu Chen-Lan inside the box and cuts back but there\u2019s confusion as Simon and Emily van Egmond both go for a shot that never eventuates. 9 min: It only takes nine minutes for Australia\u2019s No 9 to put her country on the board. Foord starts and finishes the move, passing the ball short to Simon and racing into a pocket of space to receive it back before slotting past the onrushing Chen. Solid start for the Matildas and something to build on against a side that haven\u2019t scored in their past five meetings with Australia. Come excellent collective movement helps Polkinghorne finds Raso, who has peeled off to her wide position on the right. Her cross is perfect and Logarzo is waiting at the back post, but her attempt to steer it home on the acute angle is in vain. Caitlin Foord, the ultimate utility, has drifted in from the left to get involved as Simon drops off the frontline and KK makes a lovely turn but it\u2019s tonight\u2019s captain Steph Catley who makes more metres with a pass that forces Taiwan\u2019s defence into action and goalkeeper Chen Si Yu to punch the ball safely away. Peep! And we\u2019re off! Roestbaken looks for an opening but is challenged by Chen Yen-Ping and Taiwan are back in possession. And the Matildas are just pinging the ball around patiently, Elise Kellond-Knight attempting to link up with Kyah Simon but forced to retreat. Expect Australia to dominate possession tonight. Weather update! Well the deluge has well and truly arrived in Sydney and its surrounds (wondering if it has anything to do with the lack of a pre-game show on Fox Sports?), but FFA remained confident with Campbelltown Stadium\u2019s drainage system that we\u2019re told will keep the pitch playable. We\u2019ll know for sure once the ball starts moving, but China have already played on it and made embarrassing work of Thailand to the tune of a 6-1 scoreline. The teams are out there now for the national anthems. Team news ... Sam Kerr\u2019s quad, which this week generated even more media interest than its owner, was deemed niggly enough for Milicic to rest his captain. But the 26-year-old Chelsea star, who has now been injured for three consecutive Olympic qualifiers dating back to 2012, will be a good shot at featuring in the other games, especially after new Football Federation Australia chief executive James Johnson took time out from studying the minutiae of office coffee pods to convince FIFA, the AFC, Chinese Football Association et al to push back the China fixture by 24 hours. Leading the line in her place will be Kyah Simon, who is rediscovering fitness and form at Melbourne City following her own longer-term injury woes, and flanked by two recent UK emigrants in Caitlin Foord (Arsenal) and Hayley Raso (Everton). There are regular defensive faces absent too, with right-back Ellie Carpenter making way for World Cup breakout Karly Roestbakken. Alanna Kennedy is also on the bench, allowing recent debutant Jenna McCormick to slot into central defence alongside Clare Polkinghorne. Good evening, and welcome to live coverage of the Matildas\u2019 first Olympic qualifying clash against Taiwan. Had all proceeded as planned in the land of the Matildas they\u2019d be readying to leave China bound for their respective clubs tomorrow morning, quite possibly with qualification already in the bag. But plans, as we know, are made to be broken. And the coronavirus was made to mutate, making way for a hurried cross-continental hop for the tournament that carries Australia\u2019s Tokyo hopes. Which leads us to tonight\u2019s location: Campbelltown Stadium. The place where, after weeks of uncertainty that included three scheduling changes and the Chinese team\u2019s quarantine at a Brisbane hotel, Ante Milicic\u2019s side will finally kick off their campaign against world No 40 Taiwan, who upset Thailand 1-0 earlier this week. Following that they\u2019ll face Thailand on Monday night in Campbelltown, before heading to Bankwest Stadium for Thursday night\u2019s crucial final showdown with China. For those unaware, the top two from Australia\u2019s Group B will play off against the top two from Group A (hosts South Korea, Vietnam, Myanmar, North Korea), with the two winners of that home-and-away tie qualifying for the Olympics starting in July.

      "bodyText": "A Syrian passenger plane was forced to make an emergency landing at a Russian-controlled airbase in Syria during Israeli airstrikes on Damascus earlier this week, the Russian defence ministry said. An Airbus A-320 carrying 172 passengers from Tehran was diverted from Damascus airport in the early hours of Thursday to nearby Khmeimim airbase after Syrian air defences nearly hit it during an attempt to repulse the alleged Israeli attack, according to Russian state news agency RIA. Initial reports in Russian media indicated the plane was Russian, but Flight Radar data showed the plane was a Syrian-operated Cham Wings flight. The incident in Syria\u2019s skies took place a month after a Ukraine International Airlines passenger plane crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board, after it was shot at in error by Iranian forces. At 2am on Thursday four Israeli F-16 fighter jets struck eight air-to-ground missiles in the suburbs of Damascus without entering Syrian airspace, a military spokesperson told RIA. Russia\u2019s defence ministry denounced what it said was Israel\u2019s \u201ccommon practice\u201d of using civilian aircraft as a \u201cshield\u201d, Russia Today reported. Syria has to date struggled to repel Israeli airstrikes. In 2018, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces accidentally shot down a reconnaissance plane belonging to its Russian allies while responding to an Israeli attack with anti-aircraft missiles, killing 15 crew members. Moscow held the Israeli air force accountable for the incident for allegedly using the Russian plane as cover. Spokespeople for the Israeli military and foreign ministry declined to comment. Israel does not normally comment on its military activity in Syria. Since the civil war broke out in 2011 it has carried out hundreds of airstrikes targeting Assad\u2019s Iranian and Hezbollah allies, whose presence in Syria is regarded as an existential threat by Israel. Strikes normally target supply routes and infrastructure such as weapons depots. The Israel Defence Forces recently confirmed it has also begun operations in Iraq to stop Iran and its proxies from entrenching inside the country. Thursday\u2019s pre-dawn strikes in Syria were the most intense in months, targeting al-Kiswah, Marj al-Sultan and the Baghdad Bridge in the vicinity of Damascus and South Izra in the Daraa countryside. The attack killed at least 23 Syrian and allied Iranian fighters, according to war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Unconfirmed reports said the senior Syrian Maj Gen Ismail Badran, chief commander of Mezzeh airbase, was killed. Syrian state media reported eight injuries and no deaths. In July last year Damascus accused Israel of \u201cheinous aggression\u201d after strikes south of Damascus and in Homs province led to the deaths of at least six civilians. Syria\u2019s foreign ministry filed a complaint to the United Nations security council over the attack, demanding accountability, although the Observatory said the deaths could have occurred in the aftermath of the attack by the remnants of missile parts or the Syrian counter-attack itself.",

We\u2019ll just have to see how things go and, hopefully, he might make it back for Punchestown. \u201cDouvan started the season so well when winning the Clonmel Oil Chase in good style in November on his return from a lengthy absence, but he hasn\u2019t run since and we\u2019re just not happy with him. Whether he\u2019ll be right to go to Punchestown remains to be seen.\u201d Friday\u2019s best bets Nefyn Point (3.50) should go well at around 6-1 on the Bangor card, while Fantastic Flyer (7.15) is worth an interest at decent odds to return to form at Chelmsford City this evening. Dean Ivory\u2019s mare is generally consistent and only 2lb higher than for her latest win over course and distance. Jorvik Prince (8.15), meanwhile, will take all the beating in the finale having returned to form in convincing fashion on his first start for Mick Appleby last time. GW",

      "body": "<p>This week, Barnes &amp; Noble unveiled a new book series \u2013 \u201cDiverse Editions\u201d \u2013 which reprinted classic titles like Frankenstein, Romeo and Juliet, and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but with one crucial difference: the covers had black and brown characters on them. With the exception of Alexandre Dumas, who was partly black, all the books selected were by white authors. Let\u2019s just call this what it is: literary blackface.</p> <p>It is mind-boggling that in 2020 \u2013 during Black History Month, no less \u2013 readers and writers of color still need to explain the most basic tenets of diversity to the media and publishing industry. This is so racially insensitive that it is hard to believe many \u2013 or any \u2013 black people were present in the room when this idea was approved. Apparently internet outcry is still the only way to get through.</p> <p>The bookstore, whose initiative has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/barnes-and-noble-diverse-classics-backlash\">since been canned</a> following a series of justly angry tweets, apparently used a computer program to scan novels considered classic and to choose ones where the ethnicity of the protagonists is unidentified. Hence: a black Captain Ahab on the cover of the \u201cnew\u201d Moby Dick. A black Frankenstein\u2019s monster.</p> <p>Of course, that\u2019s ridiculous. You don\u2019t need to be a brilliant detective to discern what phrases like \u201cporcelain skin\u201d or \u201cflaxen hair\u201d mean.

      "bodyText": "This week, Barnes &amp; Noble unveiled a new book series \u2013 \u201cDiverse Editions\u201d \u2013 which reprinted classic titles like Frankenstein, Romeo and Juliet, and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but with one crucial difference: the covers had black and brown characters on them. With the exception of Alexandre Dumas, who was partly black, all the books selected were by white authors. Let\u2019s just call this what it is: literary blackface. It is mind-boggling that in 2020 \u2013 during Black History Month, no less \u2013 readers and writers of color still need to explain the most basic tenets of diversity to the media and publishing industry. This is so racially insensitive that it is hard to believe many \u2013 or any \u2013 black people were present in the room when this idea was approved. Apparently internet outcry is still the only way to get through. The bookstore, whose initiative has since been canned following a series of justly angry tweets, apparently used a computer program to scan novels considered classic and to choose ones where the ethnicity of the protagonists is unidentified. Hence: a black Captain Ahab on the cover of the \u201cnew\u201d Moby Dick. A black Frankenstein\u2019s monster. Of course, that\u2019s ridiculous. You don\u2019t need to be a brilliant detective to discern what phrases like \u201cporcelain skin\u201d or \u201cflaxen hair\u201d mean. Changing these covers is also blatantly deceptive; young readers may be misled. But those are hardly the most infuriating aspects of this whole story. The most infuriating is: if Barnes &amp; Noble really wanted to honor black history, the company could promote books by black authors. Booksellers were \u201cconvinced\u201d that the cover-swapping scheme \u201cwould help drive engagement with these classic titles\u201d, Barnes &amp; Noble explained in its mea culpa. What the bookstore\u2019s executives are essentially saying in this poorly crafted statement is that they thought they could lure readers under false pretexts to drive more book sales to white books. According to Barnes &amp; Noble, the initiative was intended to \u201ccreate more awareness and discussion during Black History Month\u201d. Well, it certainly sparked discussion, if not the kind they were hoping for. If the company really wanted to celebrate racial diversity in literature for Black History Month, then they should only have promoted books from black authors or that have black and brown characters. The statement said that the covers \u201care not a substitute for black voices or writers of color\u201d. But isn\u2019t that exactly what it is? We encourage you to read Herman Melville\u2019s Moby Dick because this one has a black Captain Ahab on the cover. The audacity. This whole disaster reflects not just insensitivity, but a lack of awareness of how much young readers want and crave to see themselves reflected on the page.

The next morning, Michelle found me having a seizure, choking on my vomit. At the time, I worked as a tyre salesman and had always enjoyed good health.

      "body": "<p>Buried in the endearingly manic jumble of thoughts and dedications in Olivia Colman\u2019s dumbfounded Oscar acceptance speech last year \u2013 the one sealed as a classic by its panicked shoutout to Lady Gaga at the very end \u2013 was a telling thank-you that went largely overlooked. \u201cAnd to Bryna,\u201d Colman said, \u201cwho made me do things that I said \u2018no\u2019 to, but she was right.\u201d It underlined the fact that Colman\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/olivia-colman-wins-best-actress-oscar-for-the-favourite\" title=\"\"> surprise victory</a> over the frontrunner, Glenn Close, was not just a happy stroke of luck, but the result of a long and expertly calculated campaign.</p> <p>The Bryna in question was <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2017/12/liz-mahoney-megan-moss-pachon-bryna-rifkin-heidi-lopata-form-narrative-pr-company-1202228277/\" title=\"\">Bryna Rifkin</a>, the Hollywood publicist extraordinaire and dab hand at steering stars through the almost six-month marathon of \u201cawards season\u201d, from the essential autumn trio of buzz-building autumn festivals (Venice, Telluride, Toronto) to Oscars night. Rifkin\u2019s client list is elite: in addition to Colman, she has in recent years carried the likes of Marion Cotillard, Ruth Negga, Willem Dafoe and Michael Shannon to against-the-odds Oscars recognition. All would have been put on a rigorous circuit of interviews, roundtables, talkshow spots and dressy appearances at umpteen precursor events and lesser award ceremonies \u2013 the very things a perennially working and not especially attention-seeking character actor such as Colman might have \u201csaid \u2018no\u2019 to\u201d, only to be persuaded by a determined PR team that visibility is the key to victory.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUytvAg_hE4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YUytvAg_hE4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Olivia Colman\u2019s Oscar speech.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Merit isn\u2019t the sole factor that launches a contender in the race, even when it may seem otherwise. This year\u2019s six nominations for Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite, the first Korean film ever to receive Oscar recognition in any category, may have been applauded by detractors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 generally insular ways. But they didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. Neon, the film\u2019s hip US distributor, has run a tireless campaign for the film that has succeeded by promoting the subtitled black comedy as a buzzy mainstream event, touting its <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/parasite_2019/reviews\" title=\"\">99% Rotten Tomatoes score</a> on its marketing materials (in some cases, more prominently than the film\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/25/bong-joon-hos-parasite-wins-palme-dor-at-cannes-film-festival\" title=\"\">big Cannes win</a>) and \u2013 in something of a PR miracle \u2013 getting Bong (and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/02/lust-in-translation-how-we-fell-for-the-people-giving-arthouse-auteurs-a-voice\" title=\"\">trusty interpreter, Sharon Choi</a>) a guest spot on Jimmy Fallon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TtC5JKip00\" title=\"\">late-night NBC talkshow in December</a>. That\u2019s an unheard-of coup for a foreign-language film-maker in the US: one can only imagine the frenzy of publicist negotiations it took to pull it off. A week later, when I asked him about the Fallon experience, Bong laughed and shrugged: \u201cIt\u2019s not my world.\u201d</p> <p>Such promotion does not come cheap \u2013 $5m (\u00a33.8m) is a typical cost for a single Oscar campaign, although for studios hungry and deep-pocketed enough, the sky is the limit. It is estimated that Netflix, still a relative newcomer to this game, spent upwards of $25m last year in its efforts to secure a best picture win for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma \u2013 another critically adored, non-English-language arthouse film that didn\u2019t look or feel much like a typical Oscar frontrunner, and thus needed a concerted push from its distributor to make voters view it as such.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d663e467c1658b54aee6390f35b52221992712cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d663e467c1658b54aee6390f35b52221992712cd/0_0_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yalitza Aparicio in Roma \u2026 Netflix spent more than $25m promoting it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yalitza Aparicio in Roma \u2026 Netflix spent more than $25m promoting it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The all-out campaign included all manner of Roma-related swag, from throw cushions to <a href=\"https://www.goldderby.com/article/2019/roma-making-of-book-oscar-news/\" title=\"\">lush coffee table books</a>, sent out to voters and journalists. And it worked \u2013 up to a point. It won three Oscars, but fell at the final hurdle to the cosily old-fashioned and very American Green Book \u2013 which not only spent a bit less money on the way, but weathered a variety of PR crises, including excavated #MeToo stories of the film\u2019s director, Peter Farrelly, flashing his penis on the set of past productions, and an Islamophobic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/11/green-book-nick-vallelonga-anti-muslim-tweet\" title=\"\">tweet</a> from the screenwriter, Nick Vallelonga.</p> <p>When Roma lost, some pundits speculated that voters had been put off by Netflix\u2019s overeager campaigning, although given the obstacles the film was already up against \u2013 including industry wariness of the streaming model and the Academy\u2019s general phobia of subtitles \u2013 it can\u2019t have lost more than it gained.</p> <p>The Golden Globes are another kind of race entirely.<strong> </strong>Eyebrows were raised last month when Taron Egerton won the Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy \u2013 not because his committed performance as Elton John in Rocketman was undeserving of the honour, but because of <a href=\"https://www.datalounge.com/thread/25302237-taron-egerton-invited-every-voting-member-for-the-golden-globes-to-his-birthday-party.\" title=\"\">reports circulating on social media</a> that all 90 voting members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) had been invited to a reception for the film that also happened to be on his birthday. Nine years ago, an unlikely best-picture Globe nomination for the riotous Cher/Christina Aguilera campfest Burlesque probably had a little <a href=\"https://www.ifc.com/2010/12/bribe-golden-globes\" title=\"\">something</a> to do with the fact that Sony had flown out HFPA members for a Cher concert and hotel stay in Las Vegas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd7bbe83c73a30cd1b9320d16d92ca35c3b4f771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd7bbe83c73a30cd1b9320d16d92ca35c3b4f771/2_0_1464_878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taron Egerton as Elton John in Rocketman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taron Egerton as Elton John in Rocketman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paramount.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Egerton didn\u2019t get an Oscar nomination. (Nor did Burlesque, for that matter, to this writer\u2019s eternal disappointment.) Wooing Academy members is a subtler art; more about making them believe they love your film on their own terms. The disgraced Harvey Weinstein, once the master of opportunistic Oscar campaigning, knew this better than anyone. Spending an alleged $15m (at the time, a jaw-dropping industry record) on campaigning for the frothily charming period romcom Shakespeare in Love was the gamechanger that shaped the awards-season machine as we know it today: it beat Steven Spielberg\u2019s solemnly macho frontrunner, Saving Private Ryan, to the prize on the strength of a cynically ingenious <a href=\"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/lifestyle/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-movie-mogul-with-an-oscars-midas-touch/\" title=\"\">\u201clove v war\u201d</a> campaign line that persuaded voters that the lighter contender was the one truly in their hearts. (The same year, a similarly button-pushing Miramax campaign for Life Is Beautiful netted it three wins, proving the Academy\u2019s aversion to foreign-language fare can be overcome if the film is sweetened enough.)</p> <p>Weinstein may be persona non grata, but his tactics endure. A recent campaign pivot for Joker, which leads the field with 11 Oscar nominations \u2013 but is also one of the most polarising contenders in recent memory \u2013 is worthy of the character himself: yes, the violent, nihilistic supervillain origin story is attempting a touchy-feely rebrand. Last week, as Oscar voting opened, a glossy sheaf of Warner Bros-sponsored content on the film\u2019s behalf appeared in the industry trade bible, Variety, headed by a feature titled <a href=\"https://feature.variety.com/joker/joker-proves-the-power-of-empathy\" title=\"\">A Case for Empathy</a>, talking up the film\u2019s themes of class division and mental health awareness, and going so far as to conclude with a Gandhi quote: \u201cThe true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.\u201d</p> <p>It was the most brazen development yet in a campaign that has even turned the rebellious, publicity-shy nature of its star, Joaquin Phoenix (now the best-actor favourite), into a strategic advantage \u2013 with his unpredictable acceptance speeches (including his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/02/joaquin-phoenixs-attack-on-baftas-for-systemic-racism-meets-industry-wide-praise\" title=\"\">scorching attack</a> on industry racism at the Baftas) and interview walkouts projecting the very image of anxious outsider-hood that Joker\u2019s admirers respond to in its troubled hero. Is that just Phoenix being Phoenix or is it his own kind of anti-campaign strategy, the equally winning opposite of Colman\u2019s funny, agreeable compliance? In this racket, it\u2019s increasingly hard to tell. If he loses in an upset to Marriage Story\u2019s star, Adam Driver, however, look no further than Driver\u2019s publicist \u2013 one Bryna Rifkin \u2013 for an explanation.</p> <h2>The five biggest Oscars upsets \u2013 and why they happened</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsE1P9-nZOk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HsE1P9-nZOk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Grace Kelly wins.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Grace Kelly wins best actress (1955)</h2> <p>Judy Garland was the one to beat. Her all-stops-out, career-best performance in a Star Is Born movingly reflected her own career ups and downs, and the Oscars ceremony directors were so confident of her victory that they sent a camera crew to the hospital room where she had just given birth to her third child. Kelly emerged the winner for her against-type role as a dowdy, put-upon housewife in The Country Girl, proving the Academy\u2019s eternal preference for unblemished ingenues over complicated legends \u2013 particularly when they are \u201cbrave\u201d enough to strip away their glamour on screen.</p> <h2>Marisa Tomei wins best supporting actress (1993)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej8EpWYFhnw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ej8EpWYFhnw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Marisa Tomei</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It looked like a tight race between the four highbrow non-US stars nominated: Judy Davis was the critics\u2019 choice, Joan Plowright the sentimental favourite, Miranda Richardson the ubiquitous breakout who was in everything that year and Vanessa Redgrave the beneficiary of best-picture heat for Howards End. Instead, in a classic vote-split scenario, they gave way to the one nominee who was not like the others: the Brooklyn-born newcomer Marisa Tomei for a brashly hilarious comic turn in the very mainstream My Cousin Vinny.

      "bodyText": "Buried in the endearingly manic jumble of thoughts and dedications in Olivia Colman\u2019s dumbfounded Oscar acceptance speech last year \u2013 the one sealed as a classic by its panicked shoutout to Lady Gaga at the very end \u2013 was a telling thank-you that went largely overlooked. \u201cAnd to Bryna,\u201d Colman said, \u201cwho made me do things that I said \u2018no\u2019 to, but she was right.\u201d It underlined the fact that Colman\u2019s surprise victory over the frontrunner, Glenn Close, was not just a happy stroke of luck, but the result of a long and expertly calculated campaign. The Bryna in question was Bryna Rifkin, the Hollywood publicist extraordinaire and dab hand at steering stars through the almost six-month marathon of \u201cawards season\u201d, from the essential autumn trio of buzz-building autumn festivals (Venice, Telluride, Toronto) to Oscars night. Rifkin\u2019s client list is elite: in addition to Colman, she has in recent years carried the likes of Marion Cotillard, Ruth Negga, Willem Dafoe and Michael Shannon to against-the-odds Oscars recognition. All would have been put on a rigorous circuit of interviews, roundtables, talkshow spots and dressy appearances at umpteen precursor events and lesser award ceremonies \u2013 the very things a perennially working and not especially attention-seeking character actor such as Colman might have \u201csaid \u2018no\u2019 to\u201d, only to be persuaded by a determined PR team that visibility is the key to victory. Merit isn\u2019t the sole factor that launches a contender in the race, even when it may seem otherwise. This year\u2019s six nominations for Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite, the first Korean film ever to receive Oscar recognition in any category, may have been applauded by detractors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 generally insular ways. But they didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. Neon, the film\u2019s hip US distributor, has run a tireless campaign for the film that has succeeded by promoting the subtitled black comedy as a buzzy mainstream event, touting its 99% Rotten Tomatoes score on its marketing materials (in some cases, more prominently than the film\u2019s big Cannes win) and \u2013 in something of a PR miracle \u2013 getting Bong (and his trusty interpreter, Sharon Choi) a guest spot on Jimmy Fallon\u2019s late-night NBC talkshow in December. That\u2019s an unheard-of coup for a foreign-language film-maker in the US: one can only imagine the frenzy of publicist negotiations it took to pull it off. A week later, when I asked him about the Fallon experience, Bong laughed and shrugged: \u201cIt\u2019s not my world.\u201d Such promotion does not come cheap \u2013 $5m (\u00a33.8m) is a typical cost for a single Oscar campaign, although for studios hungry and deep-pocketed enough, the sky is the limit. It is estimated that Netflix, still a relative newcomer to this game, spent upwards of $25m last year in its efforts to secure a best picture win for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma \u2013 another critically adored, non-English-language arthouse film that didn\u2019t look or feel much like a typical Oscar frontrunner, and thus needed a concerted push from its distributor to make voters view it as such. The all-out campaign included all manner of Roma-related swag, from throw cushions to lush coffee table books, sent out to voters and journalists. And it worked \u2013 up to a point. It won three Oscars, but fell at the final hurdle to the cosily old-fashioned and very American Green Book \u2013 which not only spent a bit less money on the way, but weathered a variety of PR crises, including excavated #MeToo stories of the film\u2019s director, Peter Farrelly, flashing his penis on the set of past productions, and an Islamophobic tweet from the screenwriter, Nick Vallelonga. When Roma lost, some pundits speculated that voters had been put off by Netflix\u2019s overeager campaigning, although given the obstacles the film was already up against \u2013 including industry wariness of the streaming model and the Academy\u2019s general phobia of subtitles \u2013 it can\u2019t have lost more than it gained. The Golden Globes are another kind of race entirely. Eyebrows were raised last month when Taron Egerton won the Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy \u2013 not because his committed performance as Elton John in Rocketman was undeserving of the honour, but because of reports circulating on social media that all 90 voting members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) had been invited to a reception for the film that also happened to be on his birthday. Nine years ago, an unlikely best-picture Globe nomination for the riotous Cher/Christina Aguilera campfest Burlesque probably had a little something to do with the fact that Sony had flown out HFPA members for a Cher concert and hotel stay in Las Vegas. Egerton didn\u2019t get an Oscar nomination. (Nor did Burlesque, for that matter, to this writer\u2019s eternal disappointment.) Wooing Academy members is a subtler art; more about making them believe they love your film on their own terms. The disgraced Harvey Weinstein, once the master of opportunistic Oscar campaigning, knew this better than anyone. Spending an alleged $15m (at the time, a jaw-dropping industry record) on campaigning for the frothily charming period romcom Shakespeare in Love was the gamechanger that shaped the awards-season machine as we know it today: it beat Steven Spielberg\u2019s solemnly macho frontrunner, Saving Private Ryan, to the prize on the strength of a cynically ingenious \u201clove v war\u201d campaign line that persuaded voters that the lighter contender was the one truly in their hearts. (The same year, a similarly button-pushing Miramax campaign for Life Is Beautiful netted it three wins, proving the Academy\u2019s aversion to foreign-language fare can be overcome if the film is sweetened enough.) Weinstein may be persona non grata, but his tactics endure. A recent campaign pivot for Joker, which leads the field with 11 Oscar nominations \u2013 but is also one of the most polarising contenders in recent memory \u2013 is worthy of the character himself: yes, the violent, nihilistic supervillain origin story is attempting a touchy-feely rebrand. Last week, as Oscar voting opened, a glossy sheaf of Warner Bros-sponsored content on the film\u2019s behalf appeared in the industry trade bible, Variety, headed by a feature titled A Case for Empathy, talking up the film\u2019s themes of class division and mental health awareness, and going so far as to conclude with a Gandhi quote: \u201cThe true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.\u201d It was the most brazen development yet in a campaign that has even turned the rebellious, publicity-shy nature of its star, Joaquin Phoenix (now the best-actor favourite), into a strategic advantage \u2013 with his unpredictable acceptance speeches (including his scorching attack on industry racism at the Baftas) and interview walkouts projecting the very image of anxious outsider-hood that Joker\u2019s admirers respond to in its troubled hero. Is that just Phoenix being Phoenix or is it his own kind of anti-campaign strategy, the equally winning opposite of Colman\u2019s funny, agreeable compliance? In this racket, it\u2019s increasingly hard to tell. If he loses in an upset to Marriage Story\u2019s star, Adam Driver, however, look no further than Driver\u2019s publicist \u2013 one Bryna Rifkin \u2013 for an explanation. The five biggest Oscars upsets \u2013 and why they happened Grace Kelly wins best actress (1955) Judy Garland was the one to beat. Her all-stops-out, career-best performance in a Star Is Born movingly reflected her own career ups and downs, and the Oscars ceremony directors were so confident of her victory that they sent a camera crew to the hospital room where she had just given birth to her third child. Kelly emerged the winner for her against-type role as a dowdy, put-upon housewife in The Country Girl, proving the Academy\u2019s eternal preference for unblemished ingenues over complicated legends \u2013 particularly when they are \u201cbrave\u201d enough to strip away their glamour on screen. Marisa Tomei wins best supporting actress (1993) It looked like a tight race between the four highbrow non-US stars nominated: Judy Davis was the critics\u2019 choice, Joan Plowright the sentimental favourite, Miranda Richardson the ubiquitous breakout who was in everything that year and Vanessa Redgrave the beneficiary of best-picture heat for Howards End. Instead, in a classic vote-split scenario, they gave way to the one nominee who was not like the others: the Brooklyn-born newcomer Marisa Tomei for a brashly hilarious comic turn in the very mainstream My Cousin Vinny. Cruel rumours persisted for years that the award\u2019s presenter, Jack Palance, had read the wrong name; in retrospect, voters simply chose the most entertaining performance. Crash wins best picture (2006) Jack Nicholson\u2019s ever-expressive eyebrows shot up a mile when he opened the best picture envelope to reveal the title of Paul Haggis\u2019s tortuously contrived \u201ceveryone\u2019s a little bit racist\u201d parable. Ang Lee\u2019s acclaimed cowboy love story, Brokeback Mountain, had swept all the other prizes that season, and seemed poised to make history as the first overtly LGBT film to win the top Oscar. But word of a homophobic backlash from the Academy\u2019s more conservative members had been circulating in the industry: veteran stars Ernest Borgnine and Tony Curtis evidently spoke for many when they said they refused to see Lee\u2019s film, and that faction tipped the balance. Ex Machina wins best visual effects (2016) Two types of films tend to win the best visual effects Oscar these days: lavishly expensive blockbuster spectacles or best-picture contenders looking to add another trophy to their haul. (Ideally, both.) Nominated against Star Wars: The Force Awakens, The Martian, The Revenant and Mad Max: Fury Road, Alex Garland\u2019s low-budget, minimalist British sci-fi didn\u2019t seem to have a prayer. But the work that went into creating Alicia Vikander\u2019s sentient humanoid robot was so plainly ingenious and essential to her much-admired performance \u2013 it helped she was that year\u2019s It-girl, winning that night for another film \u2013 that it pulled off a true David-v-Goliath shocker. Moonlight wins best picture (2017) The circumstances of Moonlight\u2019s win were themselves so stunning \u2013 as Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway erroneously declared La La Land the victor, only to be corrected minutes later \u2013 it\u2019s easy to forget just how breathtaking a moment it would have been anyway. Barry Jenkins\u2019 melancholy study of gay black masculinity seemed destined all season long to finish second to Damien Chazelle\u2019s vibrant LA musical, which landed a record 14 nominations and led 6-2 in wins as the final envelope was opened.

      "body": "<p>During the arduous run-up to the UK leaving the EU, I thought about the <a href=\"https://www.angellanechippie.co.uk\" title=\"\">Angel Lane Chippie in Penrith</a> often. \u201cBritish food is rubbish\u201d was a phrase I heard incessantly, and in our imminent splendid isolation, we were told, all we\u2019d be left with was bloody fish and chips.</p> <p>In fact, this was the only part of Project Fear that didn\u2019t make me fearful. Because there are few things nicer than ambling hungry into a sweet, vinegar-scented chip shop to find the fryer bubbling, chips being methodically shovelled on to paper and a glass-fronted warmer cabinet rammed with mystery items decked out in batter. That shape, for example, could be a burger, while that one might be a black pudding. And that\u2019s definitely a fish. But who cares? It\u2019s all hot right now, ready to be smothered in vinegar, pelted with salt and served with a generous stack of chips.</p> <p>Some people swear by chips straight from the fryer, but I think chip-shop chips benefit from being carried, still wrapped, for two or three streets, allowing the surface area of each chip to soften slightly, the malt vinegar to permeate and your mind mentally to begin eating them at least six times. Then, the moment the paper\u2019s unwrapped, one should begin involuntary grazing immediately, so that by the time you eventually sit on a bench to eat, you\u2019re virtually full already. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6070d67d4f0604583ec23c859015970789d1c28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6070d67d4f0604583ec23c859015970789d1c28/0_0_5500_5500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish, chips mushy peas, wedge of lemon, pleasingly orange curry sauce at Angel Lane Chippie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Proper: fish, chips, mushy peas and curry sauce on the side at Penrith\u2019s Angel Lane Chippie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joanne Crawford/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dan Harding\u2019s Angel Lane Chippie crossed my mind as a shining example of British brilliance, and not merely because there has been a chippie of some sort registered at this address since 1928, nor because the place has won 30 national awards over the past 10 years and is widely considered to be one of the north-west\u2019s best. It\u2019s all the tiny things: the white-on-black peg letterboard that\u2019s there in an entirely non-ironic, non-retro fashion; it\u2019s simply never not been. The jars of pale pickled eggs, the excellent, stodgy mushy peas, the flat cartons of slightly fruity \u201cchip shop curry\u201d (which, in case you\u2019re wondering, people of genteel Britain, should be roughly the shade of <a href=\"https://www.farrow-ball.com/colour-by-nature/dutch-orange\" title=\"\">Farrow </a><a href=\"https://www.farrow-ball.com/colour-by-nature/dutch-orange\" title=\"\">&amp; Ball Dutch Orange</a>) and the fact that sausage comes in the four timeworn genres: \u201csmall\u201d, \u201cjumbo\u201d, \u201ccumberland\u201d and \u201csmokey\u201d. Where else can you ask for anything in \u201cjumbo\u201d without blushing?</p> <p>Each time I visit Angel Lane, its stone floor, stainless-steel cabinets and spam fritters whisk me straight back to British chippies in the 1970s, when I struggled on tiptoes to see into the cabinet. It gives me a Brownie uniform, nit nurse and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Gymnastics\" title=\"\">BAGA badges-era</a> sort of Proustian rush back to a time when my biggest concern was finding bric-a-brac for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peter\" title=\"\">Blue Peter</a> bring-and-buy.</p> <p>Perhaps everything was better in the olden days, I think each time I size up Angel Lane\u2019s cod, which is always curly, firm-fleshed and clogged with extra globs of thick batter. Or the wodges of homemade cheese-and-onion pie, or sometimes steak, with cartons of \u201cAngels [sic] own gravy\u201d.

      "bodyText": "During the arduous run-up to the UK leaving the EU, I thought about the Angel Lane Chippie in Penrith often. \u201cBritish food is rubbish\u201d was a phrase I heard incessantly, and in our imminent splendid isolation, we were told, all we\u2019d be left with was bloody fish and chips. In fact, this was the only part of Project Fear that didn\u2019t make me fearful. Because there are few things nicer than ambling hungry into a sweet, vinegar-scented chip shop to find the fryer bubbling, chips being methodically shovelled on to paper and a glass-fronted warmer cabinet rammed with mystery items decked out in batter. That shape, for example, could be a burger, while that one might be a black pudding. And that\u2019s definitely a fish. But who cares? It\u2019s all hot right now, ready to be smothered in vinegar, pelted with salt and served with a generous stack of chips. Some people swear by chips straight from the fryer, but I think chip-shop chips benefit from being carried, still wrapped, for two or three streets, allowing the surface area of each chip to soften slightly, the malt vinegar to permeate and your mind mentally to begin eating them at least six times. Then, the moment the paper\u2019s unwrapped, one should begin involuntary grazing immediately, so that by the time you eventually sit on a bench to eat, you\u2019re virtually full already. Dan Harding\u2019s Angel Lane Chippie crossed my mind as a shining example of British brilliance, and not merely because there has been a chippie of some sort registered at this address since 1928, nor because the place has won 30 national awards over the past 10 years and is widely considered to be one of the north-west\u2019s best. It\u2019s all the tiny things: the white-on-black peg letterboard that\u2019s there in an entirely non-ironic, non-retro fashion; it\u2019s simply never not been. The jars of pale pickled eggs, the excellent, stodgy mushy peas, the flat cartons of slightly fruity \u201cchip shop curry\u201d (which, in case you\u2019re wondering, people of genteel Britain, should be roughly the shade of Farrow &amp; Ball Dutch Orange) and the fact that sausage comes in the four timeworn genres: \u201csmall\u201d, \u201cjumbo\u201d, \u201ccumberland\u201d and \u201csmokey\u201d. Where else can you ask for anything in \u201cjumbo\u201d without blushing? Each time I visit Angel Lane, its stone floor, stainless-steel cabinets and spam fritters whisk me straight back to British chippies in the 1970s, when I struggled on tiptoes to see into the cabinet. It gives me a Brownie uniform, nit nurse and BAGA badges-era sort of Proustian rush back to a time when my biggest concern was finding bric-a-brac for the Blue Peter bring-and-buy. Perhaps everything was better in the olden days, I think each time I size up Angel Lane\u2019s cod, which is always curly, firm-fleshed and clogged with extra globs of thick batter. Or the wodges of homemade cheese-and-onion pie, or sometimes steak, with cartons of \u201cAngels [sic] own gravy\u201d. I mean, yes, back then, of course, we ate cod without giving a flying fig for the oceans, carried our chips home in a cheap plastic bag that we hurled in the bin and flooded the planet with toxic chemicals, and ate them in front of Jim Davidson\u2019s Too Risky on VHS. The good old days do not hold up well to scrutiny, so I\u2019ll stick to discussing the chips. Thankfully, Angel Lane is nostalgic, but it\u2019s also forward-reaching: they\u2019re committed to using haddock and cod that\u2019s sustainably sourced from Iceland and Norway.

Parasite is both a satire on the haves and have-nots, and a suspenseful thriller about what happens when they all move in together. Amazingly, it has become a major force in awards season \u2013 and deservedly so.</p> <h2>The Lighthouse (15)</h2> <p><em>(Robert Eggers, 2019, Can/US) 109 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyag7lR8CPA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hyag7lR8CPA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Robert Pattinson fully justifies his status as cinema\u2019s coming man in this berserk horror-thriller, in which he is the equal of veteran scene-dominator Willem Dafoe. They play lighthouse keepers descending into a delusional nightmare in 19th-century New England, the black-and-white visuals perfectly complementing the bleak, shifting mood.</p> <h2>Mr Jones (15)</h2> <p><em>(Agnieszka Holland, Pol/UK/Ukraine, 2019) 116 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj2Cn1N9iAU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gj2Cn1N9iAU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There is a Guardian connection to this account of the activities of courageous Welsh journalist Gareth Jones; the paper published Jones\u2019s eyewitness reports of the horrific famine in Ukraine in the mid-1930s that led to more than 3 million deaths and was denied by the Soviet government. James Norton plays Jones, and veteran Polish director Agnieszka Holland orchestrates events with clarity and flair.</p> <h2>Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (15)</h2> <p><em>(Cathy Yan, 2020, US) 109 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3HbbzHK5Mc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x3HbbzHK5Mc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Enough people were presumably knocked out by Suicide Squad that a sequel is in the works; in the meantime here\u2019s a spin-off containing arguably its most memorable character: Margot Robbie\u2019s Harley Quinn, inspiration for a thousand dubious Halloween costumes. Here, Harley has been ditched by Joker and is out to rescue fellow lawbreaker Cassandra Cain; it all leads to the start of the female vigilante squad of the title.</p> <h2>A Streetcar Named Desire (12A)</h2> <p><em>(Elia Kazan, US, 1951) 120 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9YgJjSCT08\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u9YgJjSCT08?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In providing a great early role for Marlon Brando, as well as a much parodied showcase for Vivien Leigh as traumatised, faded belle Blanche DuBois, Elia Kazan\u2019s Tennessee Williams adaptation has earned its place in film history. It might be a bit on the stagey side, but those performances pull it through.</p> <p><em>AP</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 rock, pop &amp; jazz</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a44460154e5d06ed5a895a6d9dec7e19b4107db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a44460154e5d06ed5a895a6d9dec7e19b4107db/0_0_5071_3043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angel Olsen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Top larks... Angel Olsen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Angel Olsen</h2> <p>Last year\u2019s fourth album, All Mirrors, propelled the Missouri alt-rock maven Angel Olsen into something approaching the big leagues. A Top 30 hit in the UK, it built on the success of the preceding My Woman by constantly keeping the listeners on their toes, showcased perfectly by its lead single Lark\u2019s jet-black, string-drenched cacophony.<br><em><a href=\"https://angelolsen.com/\">Bristol, Monday 10; London, Tuesday 11; Manchester, Thursday 13; Glasgow, Friday 14 February</a></em></p> <h2>Mae Muller</h2> <p>Everything you need to know about north London\u2019s Mae Muller is neatly tied up in new single Therapist. Over a jazz-inflected, Frank-era Amy Winehouse backing, she calmly eviscerates some poor, no-mark boyfriend, lyrically channelling early Lily Allen. Expect an abundance of attitude during her biggest UK dates yet.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.maemuller.com/live/\">Dublin, Saturday 8; Glasgow, Sunday 9; Manchester, Tuesday 11; Birmingham, Wednesday 12; London, Thursday 13 February</a></em></p> <h2>Gengahr</h2> <p>Finding themselves without a manager or label, north London indie waifs Gengahr started the sessions for third album Sanctuary at a bit of a crisis point. Eventually settling on Bombay Bicycle Club\u2019s Jack Steadman as producer, they came up with a record that adds some much-needed pop lightness to lyrics inspired by death and loss. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.gengahr.com/tour-dates\">Manchester, Thursday 13; Leeds, Friday 14; touring to 21 February</a></em></p> <h2>Sigala</h2> <p>Norwich\u2019s Bruce Fielder, AKA the DJ, producer and remixer Sigala, has been single-handedly keeping Capital FM going, clogging up its playlists with perfectly pitched Ibiza anthems. Since 2015 he has scored seven UK Top 10 singles, and worked with everyone from Nile Rodgers to Fuse ODG to Meghan Trainor. Would you recognise him if he passed you in the street? No you would not.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.sigalamusic.com/\">Glasgow, Sunday 9 &amp; Monday 10; Dublin, Wednesday 12; Belfast, Thursday 13; touring to 22 February</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Julian Arg\u00fcelles Quartet</h2> <p>Since his early-80s days making himself heard in the UK big band Loose Tubes, Julian Arg\u00fcelles has made his signature sound as a sax improviser and composer \u2013 merging postbop, classical and Celtic and Spanish folk traditions \u2013 more distinctive with every passing year. Arg\u00fcelles\u2019s quartet on this rare British tour includes the powerful pianist Ivo Neame. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.julianarguelles.com/calendar\">London, Tuesday 11; Wells-next-the-Sea, Wednesday 12; touring to 23 February</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a886029dcee6e3308f28c1dadf724d01a60ce9d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a886029dcee6e3308f28c1dadf724d01a60ce9d2/0_150_3413_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Jurowski.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bit of the old Ludwig van\u2026 Vladimir Jurowski.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roman Gontcharov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2020 Vision</h2> <p>The London Philharmonic\u2019s way of marking this year\u2019s unavoidable Beethoven anniversary is more original than most. The 2020 series will bring together Beethoven\u2019s symphonies with scores composed exactly 100 and 200 years after. The first concert, conducted by Vladimir Jurowski, juxtaposes his First Symphony from 1801 with Scriabin\u2019s 1901 Symphony No 2 and P\u00e9ter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019s Snatches of a Conversation from 2001. Later concerts include the second symphonies of both Sibelius and Beethoven, and the Eroica Symphony with Ravel\u2019s Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/festivals-series/classical-season/london-philharmonic-orchestra/2020-vision\">Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Saturday 8 February</a></em></p> <h2>Les V\u00eapres Siciliennes</h2> <p>It is a special week for Verdi fans, with productions of two of his more rarely seen mature works.

The strength of character McQueen displayed in the film that won him the Turner prize in 1999 has enabled him to bust out of the art world and make real, Oscar-winning cinema. Now he brings it all back home in a major show among Tate Modern\u2019s greats.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/steve-mcqueen\">Tate Modern, SE1, Thursday 13 February to 11 May</a></em></p> <h2>James Turrell</h2> <p>No artist alive contemplates the cosmic as intently as this American visionary. Turrell can make colours congeal in space or send your head on a rocket trip to the stars. His installations are like walking into Rothko paintings. Turrell\u2019s project to turn a giant Arizona crater into an astral artwork links all his mesmerising experiments.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.pacegallery.com/artists/james-turrell/\">Pace, W1, Tuesday 11 February to 27 March</a></em></p> <h2>Katherina Radeva</h2> <p>This Bulgaria-born, Scotland-based artist and designer shows drawings that explore the nature of performance and creativity. Radeva works with the theatre company Two Destination Language, and this exhibition came out of devising its latest performance, Fault Lines (which is touring to 15 Feb). Here are drawings to prompt the imagination, sketches that suggest characters and scenarios and provoke you to fill in the blanks. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.summerhall.co.uk/event/\">Summerhall, Edinburgh, to 1 March</a></em></p> <h2>Cerith Wyn Evans</h2> <p>The oldest of the Young British Artists of the 1990s \u2013 he was born in 1958 \u2013 had a background in avant-garde cinema. It shows: his installations are Fellini-like spectacles of romantic desolation. When his art hits the spot, it is an operatic aria expressed in light and heat. He brings his pale fire to bear here in glowing and scorching artworks that should bring winter warmth to the gallery\u2019s huge spaces.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/cerith-wyn-evans-2662?gclid=Cj0KCQiA7OnxBRCNARIsAIW53B_aO_UAl00FImk81zFOUHzIh5cRYUz94nrJPrX-ztTffs_d0RdIi5QaAuVxEALw_wcB\">White Cube Bermondsey, SE1, to 19 April</a></em></p> <h2>Isa Genzken</h2> <p>The spirit of dada lives in Genzken\u2019s brilliantly throwaway installations. In 1919, dadaists in Germany used random stuff including tailor\u2019s dummies and newsprint to make furiously satirical anti-art. She proves this can still be a potent method as she uses everything from fashion to \u2013 in this exhibition \u2013 airline seats to mock capitalism. And, as this show at a leading art dealer proves, the capitalists love her for it.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/2784-isa-genzken\">Hauser &amp; Wirth, W1, to 2 May</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e78947c8742f98a72657ca74dbe110480b5f6860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e78947c8742f98a72657ca74dbe110480b5f6860/0_0_4657_2795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adrian Scarborough in Leopoldstadt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oh, Vienna...

Even better, Leopoldstadt doesn\u2019t just showcase Stoppard\u2019s wit, it is also deeply moving. Set in Vienna in the first half of the 20th century, the play follows one family over 50 years as they wrestle with their Jewish identity. Patrick Marber directs a cast of 24 actors, including Adrian Scarborough, Yasmin Paige and Alexis Zegerman.<br><em><a href=\"https://leopoldstadtplay.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA7OnxBRCNARIsAIW53B_nnizgg5vVL0sngnzkcPw4CY6eDvGGTAk1yYZtoEkV_ZtdwvUCzGwaAoAFEALw_wcB\">Wyndham\u2019s Theatre, WC2, to 13 June</a></em></p> <h2>The Visit</h2> <p>Some shows are almost dead-cert winners. This has got to be one of them, largely because it stars the extraordinary Lesley Manville. Here, she plays the world\u2019s richest woman, intent on revenge. Tony Kushner has transported Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt\u2019s visionary play into the mid-20th century in a production directed by Jeremy Herrin (People, Places and Things).<br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-visit\">National Theatre: Olivier, SE1, to 13 May</a></em></p> <h2>The Whip</h2> <p>Former BBC journalist Juliet Gilkes Romero\u2019s play is about the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act. As morality and corruption split parliament, two women fight for political influence. Meanwhile, a slave-owning home secretary endeavours to protect his own interests. Will the price of freedom turn out to be a multi-billion-pound payoff to the slave owners? A shockingly underexplored area of history is brought to life by director Kimberley Sykes. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/the-whip/\">Royal Shakespeare Theatre: Swan, Stratford-Upon-Avon, to 21 March</a></em></p> <h2>Far Away</h2> <p>Lyndsey Turner directs Caryl Churchill\u2019s haunting play, 20 years after its premiere. In a cottage far away, a child wakes to the sound of screaming. What is really going on, and will these ugly memories haunt the child\u2019s future? This startling 50-minute play touches on terror, trauma, responsibility and revolt \u2013 and endless other rumbling feelings and ideas. The cast features Jessica Hynes, Aisling Loftus and Simon Manyonda. <br><em><a href=\"https://donmarwarehouse.queue-it.net/?c=donmarwarehouse&amp;e=ml3seasonpublic&amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.donmarwarehouse.com%2Fproduction%2F7419%2Ffar-away%2F&amp;cid=en-GB\">Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 28 March</a></em></p> <h2>Lorca\u2019s Blood Wedding</h2> <p>Lorca\u2019s explosive tragedy set in Wiltshire?

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films Parasite (15) (Bong Joon-ho, 2019, South Korea) 132 mins After impressively breaking into (mostly) English-language pictures with Snowpiercer and Okja, Bong Joon-ho has returned home to South Korea with even more brilliant results. Parasite is both a satire on the haves and have-nots, and a suspenseful thriller about what happens when they all move in together. Amazingly, it has become a major force in awards season \u2013 and deservedly so. The Lighthouse (15) (Robert Eggers, 2019, Can/US) 109 mins Robert Pattinson fully justifies his status as cinema\u2019s coming man in this berserk horror-thriller, in which he is the equal of veteran scene-dominator Willem Dafoe. They play lighthouse keepers descending into a delusional nightmare in 19th-century New England, the black-and-white visuals perfectly complementing the bleak, shifting mood. Mr Jones (15) (Agnieszka Holland, Pol/UK/Ukraine, 2019) 116 mins There is a Guardian connection to this account of the activities of courageous Welsh journalist Gareth Jones; the paper published Jones\u2019s eyewitness reports of the horrific famine in Ukraine in the mid-1930s that led to more than 3 million deaths and was denied by the Soviet government. James Norton plays Jones, and veteran Polish director Agnieszka Holland orchestrates events with clarity and flair. Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (15) (Cathy Yan, 2020, US) 109 mins Enough people were presumably knocked out by Suicide Squad that a sequel is in the works; in the meantime here\u2019s a spin-off containing arguably its most memorable character: Margot Robbie\u2019s Harley Quinn, inspiration for a thousand dubious Halloween costumes. Here, Harley has been ditched by Joker and is out to rescue fellow lawbreaker Cassandra Cain; it all leads to the start of the female vigilante squad of the title. A Streetcar Named Desire (12A) (Elia Kazan, US, 1951) 120 mins In providing a great early role for Marlon Brando, as well as a much parodied showcase for Vivien Leigh as traumatised, faded belle Blanche DuBois, Elia Kazan\u2019s Tennessee Williams adaptation has earned its place in film history. It might be a bit on the stagey side, but those performances pull it through. AP Five of the best \u2026 rock, pop &amp; jazz Angel Olsen Last year\u2019s fourth album, All Mirrors, propelled the Missouri alt-rock maven Angel Olsen into something approaching the big leagues. A Top 30 hit in the UK, it built on the success of the preceding My Woman by constantly keeping the listeners on their toes, showcased perfectly by its lead single Lark\u2019s jet-black, string-drenched cacophony. Bristol, Monday 10; London, Tuesday 11; Manchester, Thursday 13; Glasgow, Friday 14 February Mae Muller Everything you need to know about north London\u2019s Mae Muller is neatly tied up in new single Therapist. Over a jazz-inflected, Frank-era Amy Winehouse backing, she calmly eviscerates some poor, no-mark boyfriend, lyrically channelling early Lily Allen. Expect an abundance of attitude during her biggest UK dates yet. Dublin, Saturday 8; Glasgow, Sunday 9; Manchester, Tuesday 11; Birmingham, Wednesday 12; London, Thursday 13 February Gengahr Finding themselves without a manager or label, north London indie waifs Gengahr started the sessions for third album Sanctuary at a bit of a crisis point. Eventually settling on Bombay Bicycle Club\u2019s Jack Steadman as producer, they came up with a record that adds some much-needed pop lightness to lyrics inspired by death and loss. Manchester, Thursday 13; Leeds, Friday 14; touring to 21 February Sigala Norwich\u2019s Bruce Fielder, AKA the DJ, producer and remixer Sigala, has been single-handedly keeping Capital FM going, clogging up its playlists with perfectly pitched Ibiza anthems. Since 2015 he has scored seven UK Top 10 singles, and worked with everyone from Nile Rodgers to Fuse ODG to Meghan Trainor. Would you recognise him if he passed you in the street? No you would not. Glasgow, Sunday 9 &amp; Monday 10; Dublin, Wednesday 12; Belfast, Thursday 13; touring to 22 February MC Julian Arg\u00fcelles Quartet Since his early-80s days making himself heard in the UK big band Loose Tubes, Julian Arg\u00fcelles has made his signature sound as a sax improviser and composer \u2013 merging postbop, classical and Celtic and Spanish folk traditions \u2013 more distinctive with every passing year. Arg\u00fcelles\u2019s quartet on this rare British tour includes the powerful pianist Ivo Neame. London, Tuesday 11; Wells-next-the-Sea, Wednesday 12; touring to 23 February JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts 2020 Vision The London Philharmonic\u2019s way of marking this year\u2019s unavoidable Beethoven anniversary is more original than most. The 2020 series will bring together Beethoven\u2019s symphonies with scores composed exactly 100 and 200 years after. The first concert, conducted by Vladimir Jurowski, juxtaposes his First Symphony from 1801 with Scriabin\u2019s 1901 Symphony No 2 and P\u00e9ter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019s Snatches of a Conversation from 2001. Later concerts include the second symphonies of both Sibelius and Beethoven, and the Eroica Symphony with Ravel\u2019s Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Saturday 8 February Les V\u00eapres Siciliennes It is a special week for Verdi fans, with productions of two of his more rarely seen mature works. Welsh National Opera\u2019s staging of Les V\u00eapres Siciliennes is brand new, and follows La Forza del Destino and Un Ballo in Maschera to complete a Verdi trilogy directed by the company\u2019s recently departed artistic director David Pountney and conducted by its former music director Carlo Rizzi; Jung Soo Yun as Henri and Anush Hovhannisyan as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne lead the cast. Cardiff Millennium Centre: Donald Gordon Theatre, Saturday 8, 15 &amp; 22 February; touring to 9 May Luisa Miller English National Opera\u2019s production of Verdi\u2019s Luisa Miller comes to the Coliseum from Wuppertal, where it was first seen in 2018. The updated staging marks the UK debut of director Barbora Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1; Alexander Joel conducts and heading the cast are Elizabeth Llewellyn, Olafur Sigurdarson and David Junghoon Kim. London Coliseum, WC2, Wednesday 12 February to 6 March AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Steve McQueen Once he stood stock still as a house fell around him. The strength of character McQueen displayed in the film that won him the Turner prize in 1999 has enabled him to bust out of the art world and make real, Oscar-winning cinema. Now he brings it all back home in a major show among Tate Modern\u2019s greats. Tate Modern, SE1, Thursday 13 February to 11 May James Turrell No artist alive contemplates the cosmic as intently as this American visionary. Turrell can make colours congeal in space or send your head on a rocket trip to the stars. His installations are like walking into Rothko paintings. Turrell\u2019s project to turn a giant Arizona crater into an astral artwork links all his mesmerising experiments. Pace, W1, Tuesday 11 February to 27 March Katherina Radeva This Bulgaria-born, Scotland-based artist and designer shows drawings that explore the nature of performance and creativity. Radeva works with the theatre company Two Destination Language, and this exhibition came out of devising its latest performance, Fault Lines (which is touring to 15 Feb). Here are drawings to prompt the imagination, sketches that suggest characters and scenarios and provoke you to fill in the blanks. Summerhall, Edinburgh, to 1 March Cerith Wyn Evans The oldest of the Young British Artists of the 1990s \u2013 he was born in 1958 \u2013 had a background in avant-garde cinema. It shows: his installations are Fellini-like spectacles of romantic desolation. When his art hits the spot, it is an operatic aria expressed in light and heat. He brings his pale fire to bear here in glowing and scorching artworks that should bring winter warmth to the gallery\u2019s huge spaces. White Cube Bermondsey, SE1, to 19 April Isa Genzken The spirit of dada lives in Genzken\u2019s brilliantly throwaway installations. In 1919, dadaists in Germany used random stuff including tailor\u2019s dummies and newsprint to make furiously satirical anti-art. She proves this can still be a potent method as she uses everything from fashion to \u2013 in this exhibition \u2013 airline seats to mock capitalism. And, as this show at a leading art dealer proves, the capitalists love her for it. Hauser &amp; Wirth, W1, to 2 May JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows Leopoldstadt A new Tom Stoppard play is always Big Theatre News. Even better, Leopoldstadt doesn\u2019t just showcase Stoppard\u2019s wit, it is also deeply moving. Set in Vienna in the first half of the 20th century, the play follows one family over 50 years as they wrestle with their Jewish identity. Patrick Marber directs a cast of 24 actors, including Adrian Scarborough, Yasmin Paige and Alexis Zegerman. Wyndham\u2019s Theatre, WC2, to 13 June The Visit Some shows are almost dead-cert winners. This has got to be one of them, largely because it stars the extraordinary Lesley Manville. Here, she plays the world\u2019s richest woman, intent on revenge. Tony Kushner has transported Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt\u2019s visionary play into the mid-20th century in a production directed by Jeremy Herrin (People, Places and Things). National Theatre: Olivier, SE1, to 13 May The Whip Former BBC journalist Juliet Gilkes Romero\u2019s play is about the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act. As morality and corruption split parliament, two women fight for political influence. Meanwhile, a slave-owning home secretary endeavours to protect his own interests. Will the price of freedom turn out to be a multi-billion-pound payoff to the slave owners? A shockingly underexplored area of history is brought to life by director Kimberley Sykes. Royal Shakespeare Theatre: Swan, Stratford-Upon-Avon, to 21 March Far Away Lyndsey Turner directs Caryl Churchill\u2019s haunting play, 20 years after its premiere. In a cottage far away, a child wakes to the sound of screaming. What is really going on, and will these ugly memories haunt the child\u2019s future? This startling 50-minute play touches on terror, trauma, responsibility and revolt \u2013 and endless other rumbling feelings and ideas. The cast features Jessica Hynes, Aisling Loftus and Simon Manyonda. Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 28 March Lorca\u2019s Blood Wedding Lorca\u2019s explosive tragedy set in Wiltshire? Why the heck not? With Barney Norris doing the adaptation, this should be interesting and truthful. In a small rural town, Rob and his fiancee Georgie are checking out the village hall for their wedding reception. Rob\u2019s mum thinks they\u2019re rushing into things, and when a figure from Georgie\u2019s past turns up, the couple\u2019s wedding plans \u2013 and lives \u2013 hang in the balance. Jeff Rawle and Teresa Banham star. Salisbury Playhouse, to 22 February MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch: Bluebeard One of German dance-theatre pioneer Pina Bausch\u2019s trailblazing early works, never before seen in the UK, gets a belated premiere 43 years after its creation. Its illustration of the violence, tenderness, fear and sexual obsession of one couple\u2019s relationship is likely to be just as startling as it was in 1977. Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1, Wednesday 12 to 15 February Phoenix Dance Theatre: Black Waters Phoenix\u2019s Sharon Watson and Kolkata-based Shambik Ghose and Mitul Sengupta explore two shameful incidents from British colonial history: the massacre on the Zong slave ship in 1781 and abuses at the Kala Pani prison in early 20th-century India. Leeds Playhouse, Wednesday 12 to 15 February; touring to 20 June BLKDOG Hip-hop choreographer Botis Seva won an Olivier award for the first incarnation of this piece, a dark, powerful work of oppression and depression. Now Seva has expanded it for a UK tour, inspired by his own struggles as a young artist confronting adulthood. Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry, Tuesday 11 February; touring to 30 April LW",

It\u2019s a pilgrim\u2019s progress for a sensitive young man in a place unsuited to such a temperament, told in a scattered way in short chapters, each themed \u2013 hence the title \u2013 by a childhood object: floppy disk, cassette, toy soldier. This iconographic form is apt to describe a place where symbols such as flags hold such sway, and gives a loose structure in keeping with Northern Ireland\u2019s essentially provisional status.</p> <p>The memoir of an \u201cordinary person\u201d must combine universality and idiosyncrasy to succeed, and Anderson\u2019s childhood in Derry sounds familiar: he played the same street games that I did on the other side of the country. But jumpers-for-goalposts nostalgia is avoided as his upbringing diverged from the traditional working-class picture: his parents were hippies, had a Japanese-themed room in their house, and generally failed to conform at a time \u201cwhen having long hair was an invitation to get your head kicked in\u201d. After all \u2013 a good joke, this, on the Ulster strain of Christianity \u2013 \u201cthese were decent, God-fearing Catholics, and the last thing a Catholic would respect is someone with a beard and long hair\u201d.</p> <p>His parents also fed Anderson\u2019s interest in elsewhere (\u201cmy father was always distant \u2026 like he was living somewhere else, in his mind\u201d), though <em>Inventory</em> is a reminder of how much is going on under our noses if we care to think.

Anderson observes that time has a special status here: it\u2019s the \u201cthin ice\u201d that acts as a barrier but fails to protect. Living in a traumatised homeland exerts a force on those growing up: Northern Ireland to this day has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/20/northern-ireland-suicides-troubles-death-toll\" title=\"\">suicide epidemic</a> \u2013 double the rate in England \u2013 that Anderson describes as \u201cdrowning on dry land\u201d. It may have moved on from the Troubles, but not all its people can.</p> <p>As the subtitle indicates, this is a book about Anderson\u2019s family as well as his city. And although the family material holds promise \u2013 one grandfather was an army deserter, the other was a smuggler \u2013 he struggles to enliven these stories, going a bit <em>Who Do You Think You Are?</em> with pages filled contemplating old photographs or fiddling with microfiche. Here, in the absence of the insights he can draw from his own life, he resorts to fuzzy language (\u201climinal\u201d is a favourite word) and don\u2019t-look-too-closely aphorisms (\u201ctime is the spreading of ink on a page wet with rain\u201d). Also frustrating is Anderson\u2019s refusal to give the reader the satisfaction of narrative flow. At different points we learn that his grandmother drowned and his father served jail time for terrorist offences, but each time the focus switches back to reveries and reflections and the pull of the story is squandered, to be picked up only briefly later in the book with the air of an afterthought.</p> <p>Whether this is a comment on the chaos of memory, or a reluctance to provide anything so basic as pageturning pleasure, it\u2019s disappointing, particularly given Anderson\u2019s understanding of how stories and histories work. The idea that we are sitting on top of the historical past is misconceived, he writes, as one who lived alongside enough of it. \u201cWe might equally say that we\u2019re actually beneath the great staggering scrap-pile of history, and we\u2019re scrambling to get out.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Inventory is published by Chatto (RRP \u00a316.99).

Also frustrating is Anderson\u2019s refusal to give the reader the satisfaction of narrative flow. At different points we learn that his grandmother drowned and his father served jail time for terrorist offences, but each time the focus switches back to reveries and reflections and the pull of the story is squandered, to be picked up only briefly later in the book with the air of an afterthought. Whether this is a comment on the chaos of memory, or a reluctance to provide anything so basic as pageturning pleasure, it\u2019s disappointing, particularly given Anderson\u2019s understanding of how stories and histories work. The idea that we are sitting on top of the historical past is misconceived, he writes, as one who lived alongside enough of it. \u201cWe might equally say that we\u2019re actually beneath the great staggering scrap-pile of history, and we\u2019re scrambling to get out.\u201d \u2022 Inventory is published by Chatto (RRP \u00a316.99).

      "bodyText": "America might be a big country but American rugby is still a small world. It can seem that everyone in the game knows each other, from billionaires to White House advisers and down. Chris Dunlavey and Paul Sheehy may be the exceptions that prove the rule. Dunlavey is a stalwart of the Washington Irish club, Sheehy played for Washington. Both are well connected in a very political town but somehow, until a couple of summers ago, they had never managed to meet. \u201cI think we were on the pitch together once or twice,\u201d Dunlavey said, one recent afternoon in his office on Connecticut Avenue. \u201cBut back in the day his club beat the hell out of mine so bad we didn\u2019t spend a lot of time hanging out.\u201d Dunlavey, who still plays, is a partner in a leading programme management firm. Sheehy, who played for the USA at the 1991 World Cup, is a successful car dealer who was linked to Pro14 ambitions in the city. In June 2018, when Wales played South Africa at RFK Stadium, the two men were introduced. Soon they were partners in Old Glory DC, the Major League Rugby team which will make its debut in New Orleans on Saturday. \u201cWe think we\u2019re exactly 10 days from being ready to go,\u201d Dunlavey said, 10 days out from kick-off and joined by head coach Andrew Douglas, a Kiwi out of Waikato, and operations manager John Manson, over from Glasgow Warriors and the Scottish Rugby Union, which holds a minority stake. \u201cWe did have the good fortune of having done an exhibition season last spring [which] was a nice test run for everything, ranging from what Andrew\u2019s doing, putting the team together and coaching it, to how we\u2019re putting together our gameday plan for operations. \u201cI think we were able to take some lessons learned into the new season, and be as ready as we can be.\u201d The support of local clubs has been sought and warm-up games won. But in a league rapidly finding its feet, Old Glory, like the New England Free Jacks and Rugby ATL, based in Atlanta, will not have long to get up to speed. There will be 16 regular-season games before the knockout playoffs. In another echo of the NFL, MLR\u2019s 12 teams are now split into regional conferences. In the way of things in a vast country where the Dallas Cowboys somehow play in the NFC East, the NOLA Gold, more than 1,000 miles away, count as local rivals. Seattle Seawolves, nearly 3,000 miles distant and daunting double champions, must fly in for DC\u2019s home opener on 16 February but Douglas and Manson insist their players will relish their own flights to San Diego, Houston, Austin and Toronto. Elsewhere in the rugby world, such places seem exotic. Old Glory\u2019s overseas hires are seasoned pros and among them looms Tendai Mtawarira, a world champion Springbok prop. The Beast has been delayed at home but according to Douglas: \u201cHe\u2019s always in great shape physically, even with the Sharks, he\u2019ll only do one week of preseason and he\u2019ll play Super Rugby. So I\u2019m pretty sure he can do one week here and play MLR. \u201cHe\u2019s training hard, he\u2019s been in touch with us, he\u2019s sending us videos. He rang me yesterday, excited, he just wants to get here and he wants that visa in his hand. And so I think if he\u2019s ready and he tells me he wants to play, he\u2019ll play.\u201d As the England front row will attest while shuddering over memories of the World Cup final in Yokohama, Mtawarira can really play.

Recently, there have not been as many national contending top clubs as there was \u2026 but there\u2019s still a pretty rich culture.\u201d Old Glory have invested in that culture: their captain is Josh Brown, a firefighter and paramedic as well as a back-rower out of Rocky Gorge, a club from Columbia, Maryland. Over the phone the next day, before a dash back up the Acela corridor to New York \u2013 a train route that has a day of presidential primaries named after it, no less \u2013 Sheehy enthused about carving a place for rugby in DC. \u201cAndrew Douglas did a great thing,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had a training day where the players had to run to all the memorials on the Mall and around the Basin and learn a little bit.

      "body": "<p>Gas and electricity bills will fall for about 15m households this summer after the energy regulator, Ofgem, reduced its price cap on standard bills in response to falling global energy markets.</p> \n<p>The price of the average dual-fuel energy bill will fall by \u00a317, from \u00a31,179 to \u00a31,162, for 11m households that use a standard variable energy tariff to buy their energy. There will be a similar cut for the 4m homes that have a prepay meter, with the average price of gas and electricity to fall from \u00a31,217 to \u00a31,200.</p> \n<p>Ofgem has lowered the cap, which is designed to guarantee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/energy\">a fair price for energy customers</a>, in line with the falling price of gas and power on the wholesale energy markets. It will take effect from 1 April and remain in place for six months.</p> \n<p>The energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng said: \u201cThe price cap is saving the average bill payer between \u00a375 and \u00a3100 per year, helping everyone get through the cold weather without worrying about costs.\u201d </p> \n<p>Ofgem\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/03/ofgem-sets-out-nine-point-plan-to-prioritise-climate-crisis\">new chief executive</a>, Jonathan Brearley, said the cap had saved households about \u00a31bn since it was introduced at the beginning of last year but energy billpayers could make bigger savings by \u201cshopping around for a better deal\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"acf5fd97-28ab-4971-96f2-2acaab08b5e9\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>How does the energy price cap work?</b></p>\n    <p>The cap, one of the biggest shake-ups of the energy market since privatisation,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/31/millions-to-see-annual-energy-bills-drop-as-price-cap-takes-effect\">came into effect on 1 January 2019</a>&nbsp;for 11m households on default tariffs, known as standard variable tariffs (SVTs). The government told the energy regulator, Ofgem, to set the cap because ministers argued people on SVTs were being ripped off by big energy firms capitalising on consumer loyalty. The limit is not an absolute one but the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy and for a standing charge. There is a separate cap for 4m homes on prepayment meters.</p>\n    <p><b>Does that mean energy bills will never go up?</b></p>\n    <p>No. It is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/23/energy-prices-tory-cap-miliband-freeze\">a freeze</a>, it is a movable cap. The energy cap has fallen twice since it was put in place because the wholesale price of electricity and gas, the biggest variable influencing prices, have fallen. But if energy market prices climb higher, the cap would move higher, too. Homes may also face higher bills if they use more energy because the cap applies to the price of each unit of energy - not the whole bill.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Is there any way to avoid the increase?</b></p>\n    <p>Yes. Homes can save hundreds of pounds a year by spending a few minutes on one of the many comparison sites, or sign up to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/feb/02/energy-bills-will-these-sites-save-you-a-flipping-fortune\">auto-switching service</a>, and move to a cheaper tariff, either with your existing supplier or a rival one. Fixed tariffs, which are not covered by the cap, are almost always much cheaper than SVTs, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/22/third-dual-fuel-tariffs-break-government-price-cap\">there are exceptions</a>, so watch out. Several smaller suppliers also offer good customer service and variable tariffs that are well below the cap.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Could bills fall again?</b></p>\n    <p>It looks likely. Energy market experts believe gas prices will continue to fall in 2020 because a record number of gas cargoes are expected to be delivered into European ports this year. But wholesale costs are not the only factor in setting the level of the cap. Ofgem, the regulator, includes the cost of using energy networks and paying for government policies, too. These costs are expected to keep rising.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Cheaper fixed-term deals can help homes save several hundred pounds a year if they switch from a default tariff, compared with a \u00a317 saving from the lower price cap.</p> \n<p>Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said switching to a new energy deal could do \u201cfar more good than the cap ever will\u201d.</p> \n<p>The cap fell by less than some industry commentators had predicted because the tumbling cost of wholesale energy last year was offset by the rising cost of maintaining the energy networks and paying for government policies \u2013 all of which must be paid for through energy bills.</p> \n<p>Robert Buckley, an energy expert at Cornwall Insight, said early predictions that the cap might fall by as much as \u00a360 a year \u201cfocused largely on the wholesale element and did not factor in some of these extra policy and network costs\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said Ofgem had made some \u201ctechnical adjustments\u201d to its price cap calculations to update the typical consumption of UK homes and the costs of supplying energy, to reflect changes in the industry.</p> \n<p>The Guardian reported late last year that millions of homes could look forward to lower energy bills in 2020 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/26/energy-bills-for-millions-of-households-to-fall-after-gas-prices-halve\">the market price for gas fell by half</a> to reach lows not seen in a decade.</p> \n<p>In the UK the market price for gas hit 10-year lows of 24.75p a therm in September, compared with an average price of 55.63p the year before after a record number of gas cargoes from the US, Russia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/03/qatar-pulls-out-of-opec-to-focus-on-gas-production\">Qatar</a> poured into Europe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>S&amp;P Global Platts has predicted the price of gas could fall by a further 30% to an average of 27p a therm in 2020 as more seaborne gas cargoes make their way to UK shores.</p> \n<p>Buckley said if wholesale energy markets remained similar to what was seen in the winter, customers could expect \u201canother slight reduction\u201d to the cap later this year.

      "bodyText": "Gas and electricity bills will fall for about 15m households this summer after the energy regulator, Ofgem, reduced its price cap on standard bills in response to falling global energy markets. The price of the average dual-fuel energy bill will fall by \u00a317, from \u00a31,179 to \u00a31,162, for 11m households that use a standard variable energy tariff to buy their energy. There will be a similar cut for the 4m homes that have a prepay meter, with the average price of gas and electricity to fall from \u00a31,217 to \u00a31,200. Ofgem has lowered the cap, which is designed to guarantee a fair price for energy customers, in line with the falling price of gas and power on the wholesale energy markets. It will take effect from 1 April and remain in place for six months. The energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng said: \u201cThe price cap is saving the average bill payer between \u00a375 and \u00a3100 per year, helping everyone get through the cold weather without worrying about costs.\u201d Ofgem\u2019s new chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said the cap had saved households about \u00a31bn since it was introduced at the beginning of last year but energy billpayers could make bigger savings by \u201cshopping around for a better deal\u201d. Cheaper fixed-term deals can help homes save several hundred pounds a year if they switch from a default tariff, compared with a \u00a317 saving from the lower price cap. Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said switching to a new energy deal could do \u201cfar more good than the cap ever will\u201d. The cap fell by less than some industry commentators had predicted because the tumbling cost of wholesale energy last year was offset by the rising cost of maintaining the energy networks and paying for government policies \u2013 all of which must be paid for through energy bills. Robert Buckley, an energy expert at Cornwall Insight, said early predictions that the cap might fall by as much as \u00a360 a year \u201cfocused largely on the wholesale element and did not factor in some of these extra policy and network costs\u201d. He said Ofgem had made some \u201ctechnical adjustments\u201d to its price cap calculations to update the typical consumption of UK homes and the costs of supplying energy, to reflect changes in the industry. The Guardian reported late last year that millions of homes could look forward to lower energy bills in 2020 after the market price for gas fell by half to reach lows not seen in a decade. In the UK the market price for gas hit 10-year lows of 24.75p a therm in September, compared with an average price of 55.63p the year before after a record number of gas cargoes from the US, Russia and Qatar poured into Europe. S&amp;P Global Platts has predicted the price of gas could fall by a further 30% to an average of 27p a therm in 2020 as more seaborne gas cargoes make their way to UK shores. Buckley said if wholesale energy markets remained similar to what was seen in the winter, customers could expect \u201canother slight reduction\u201d to the cap later this year. However, households should still consider switching their tariff or supplier to find the best energy deal, according to consumer groups. Ed Dodman of the Energy Ombudsman said the regulator\u2019s falling energy price cap \u201cshouldn\u2019t discourage people from shopping around for better deals. We would encourage consumers to look at the customer service they can expect to receive as well as how much money they could save.

The London Ambulance Service (LAS) said the first medics arrived in four minutes, but waited at the assigned rendezvous point until the Metropolitan police confirmed it was safe to move in. Like the perpetrators of the London Bridge attacks in both 2017 and 2019, Amman was wearing a hoax suicide vest.

The inevitable chaos of a bomb or an attack by several people, such as the 2017 attacks in London Bridge and Borough market, means it can take a long time to be sure all the perpetrators are accounted for. But last summer, the London Bridge inquest heard it took three hours for paramedics to reach some of the wounded.

The experts writing in the BMJ believe the UK approach would have delayed any medical care reaching these victims for three hours. These are perilously hard judgment calls. Policymakers and commanders on the scene have to balance the likelihood that long delays in intervening will lead to more victims dying from their injuries against the increased risk to the lives of medical staff who are potentially putting themselves in the line of fire by entering the so-called \u201chot zone\u201d. The stilted prose of the inquests and inquiries that follow each attack can never capture the pandemonium, panic and fear in the midst of which decisions have to be taken, while the false clarity of hindsight can give the unfair impression that first responders \u2013 particularly the people in charge \u2013 lacked courage or behaved irrationally. But the Bataclan example is instructive. Virtually everyone who was evacuated survived. UK procedures risk leaving members of the public and the police battling to keep people alive while paramedics waiting just metres away are prevented from doing their job. Of course these protocols are reviewed in the wake of each new atrocity, and improvements have been made over the years. But there is growing evidence that more substantial changes need to be considered. First responders themselves need to be at the forefront of this debate. As the people who have the experience, face the risks and want more than anyone to save as many lives as possible, their leadership and insights are vital. In the wake of the Streatham attack the government is looking at everything from sentencing policy to deradicalisation. Deciding how best to save the wounded needs equal priority in the response to terrorism. \u2022 Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst",

Central America is one of the world\u2019s most dangerous regions outside a warzone, where a toxic mix of violence, poverty and corruption has forced millions to flee north in search of security. Now, drought, famine and the battle for dwindling natural resources are increasingly being recognized as major factors in the exodus.

Worsening hunger across the region is a factor in the rise in migrant caravans trying to reach the US overland, according to both analysts and migrants themselves. The caravans have been met with repression and hostility by Mexican and American authorities who accuse the migrants and refugees of political subversion and criminality. Hunger is not a new phenomenon in Guatemala: at least 60% of the population live in poverty, hundreds of thousands rely on food aid, and almost 50% of children suffer stunted physical and cognitive development due to chronic malnourishment. But experts warn that the additional burden of extreme weather is overwhelming these communities, which have been long ignored and repressed by the government.

      "bodyText": "Antarctica has logged its hottest temperature on record, with an Argentinian research station thermometer reading 18.3C, beating the previous record by 0.8C. The reading, taken at Esperanza on the northern tip of the continent\u2019s peninsula, beats Antarctica\u2019s previous record of 17.5C, set in March 2015. A tweet from Argentina\u2019s meteorological agency on Friday revealed the record. The station\u2019s data goes back to 1961. Antarctica\u2019s peninsula \u2013 the area that points towards South America \u2013 is one of the fastest warming places on earth, heating by almost 3C over the past 50 years, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Almost all the region\u2019s glaciers are melting. The Esperanza reading breaks the record for the Antarctic continent. The record for the Antarctic region \u2013 that is, everywhere south of 60 degrees latitude \u2013 is 19.8C, taken on Signy Island in January 1982. Prof James Renwick, a climate scientist at Victoria University of Wellington, was a member of an ad-hoc World Meteorological Organization committee that has verified previous records in Antarctica. He told Guardian Australia it was likely the committee would be reconvened to check the new Esperanza record. He said: \u201cOf course the record does need to be checked, but pending those checks, it\u2019s a perfectly valid record and that [temperature] station is well maintained.\u201d \u201cThe reading is impressive as it\u2019s only five years since the previous record was set and this is almost one degree centigrade higher. It\u2019s a sign of the warming that has been happening there that\u2019s much faster than the global average. \u201cTo have a new record set that quickly is surprising but who knows how long that will last? Possibly not that long at all.\u201d He said the temperature record at Esperanza was one of the longest-running on the whole continent. Renwick said higher temperatures in the region tended to coincide with strong northwesterly winds moving down mountain slopes \u2013 a feature of the weather patterns around Esperanza in recent days. He said there were complex weather patterns in the area, but the Esperanza reading was likely a combination of natural variability and background warming caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. He said: \u201cThe reason the peninsula is warming faster than other places is a combination of natural variations and warming signals.\u201d Prof Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University, has carried out research at James Ross Island at the northern tip of the peninsula. \u201cIt\u2019s an area that\u2019s warming very quickly,\u201d she said, adding it can occasionally be warm enough to wear a T-shirt. Previous research from 2012 found the current rate of warming in the region was almost unprecedented over the past 2000 years. Abram said: \u201cEven small increases in warming can lead to large increases in the energy you have for melting the ice. The consequences are the collapse of the ice shelves along the peninsula.\u201d Meltwater can work its way through cracks in ice shelves, she said. Because ice shelves already float on the ocean, their collapse does not directly contribute to rising sea levels. But Abram said the shelves acted as plugs, helping to keep the ice sheets behind them stable. Melting of ice sheets does contribute to rising sea levels because they are attached to land. Dr Steve Rintoul, a leading oceanographer and Antarctic expert at CSIRO, said: \u201cThis is a record from only a single station, but it is in the context of what\u2019s happening elsewhere and is more evidence that as the planet warms we get more warm records and fewer cold records.\u201d The lowest temperature ever recorded in Antarctica \u2013 and anywhere on Earth \u2013 was at the Russian Vostok station, when temperatures dropped to -89.2C on 21 July 1983.",

Credit Suisse insisted the use of private detectives was a one-off incident but then in December admitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/23/credit-suisse-admits-second-executive-was-followed-by-private-detectives\">a second executive, the bank\u2019s former head of HR, had also been tracked</a>. Rohner said on Friday that the emergence of the second spying case had \u201cmade the situation worse\u201d and had forced the board to act.</p> <p>As rumours swirled about the genesis of the affair, sources told the Financial Times last year that Khan\u2019s departure from Credit Suisse followed a period in which he and Thiam had developed a personal animus towards one another.</p> <p>Khan was a rising star within the bank who was often talked about as a potential successor to Thiam, thanks to his success leading a wealth management division that enjoyed increasing profits and a burgeoning global reputation. While the pair got on well at first, they allegedly clashed outside the office over issues that arose between them as next-door neighbours in the Herrliberg area of the so-called \u201cgold coast\u201d of Lake Zurich.</p> <p>Thiam complained to the bank about the inconvenience caused by lengthy renovations to Khan\u2019s home, the FT said.</p> <p>Khan later clashed with Thiam\u2019s partner during a cocktail party, in a disagreement that supposedly revolved around some trees planted on the Thiam property. During a subsequent confrontation, the two men had to be physically separated, Khan told the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.</p> <p>As a result of their personal feud, Khan, who was also said to have been frustrated with his lack of profile at the bank, was reportedly allowed to leave with a shorter notice period than would usually apply. The bank then hired private investigators to follow him, amid concern he might poach talented staff from Credit Suisse.</p> <p>Khan has alleged that three men employed by private security firm Investigo chased him and his wife through the streets of Zurich in a car, leading to a physical confrontation. Investigo has said there was only one man, that it was Khan who did the chasing and that its staff kept their distance.</p> <p>Rohner initially supported Thiam over the affair but when it emerged that a second executive had been under surveillance \u2013 Peter Goerke, the former head of HR at Credit Suisse \u2013 relations between the two became strained.</p> <p>In an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, Credit Suisse\u2019s largest investor suggested that Thiam may have encountered racial bias in the Swiss banking industry.</p> <p>David Herro of Harris Associates said: \u201cTo be very frank, it seems [like] envy from competitors or perhaps something else given that Mr Thiam looks a little bit different than the typical Swiss banker. Either one of these two rationales behind these attacks against him, to me are extremely distasteful.\u201d Herro added on Friday that he believed Rohner should follow Thiam out of the bank.</p> <p>An investigation by an external law firm in October formally cleared Thiam of involvement in the Khan spying affair and resulted in Pierre-Olivier Bou\u00e9e, the chief operating officer and Thiam\u2019s closest ally, being fired over the Khan dispute.</p> <p>It also emerged that a private security consultant who had helped Bou\u00e9e organise the spying had apparently killed himself.</p> <p>Earlier this week Thiam appeared to have the upper hand in Rohner\u2019s attempt to oust him, gaining the backing of several top Credit Suisse shareholders.</p> <p>However, on Friday he said he had agreed with the board to step down as chief executive. \u201cI had no knowledge of the observation of two former colleagues. It undoubtedly disturbed Credit Suisse and caused anxiety and hurt.

The bank\u2019s board announced on Friday that it had \u201cunanimously accepted\u201d the 57-year-old\u2019s resignation and that Thomas Gottstein, the head of Credit Suisse\u2019s domestic business in Switzerland, will take over as chief executive. While directors backed the departure of the bank\u2019s French-Ivorian boss, who was paid Sfr 12.7m (\u00a310m) last year for his services, they swung behind Urs Rohner, its Switzerland-born chairman. Rohner is expected to complete a term scheduled to last until April 2021, despite the intervention of the bank\u2019s biggest investor on Friday, who called for the chairman to fall on his sword as well. Thiam and Rohner have been at loggerheads since it emerged last year the Zurich-based bank had hired a corporate espionage company to follow Iqbal Khan, the former head of the bank\u2019s wealth management division. Khan was on leave from Credit Suisse before taking a job at arch-rival UBS. Credit Suisse insisted the use of private detectives was a one-off incident but then in December admitted a second executive, the bank\u2019s former head of HR, had also been tracked. Rohner said on Friday that the emergence of the second spying case had \u201cmade the situation worse\u201d and had forced the board to act. As rumours swirled about the genesis of the affair, sources told the Financial Times last year that Khan\u2019s departure from Credit Suisse followed a period in which he and Thiam had developed a personal animus towards one another. Khan was a rising star within the bank who was often talked about as a potential successor to Thiam, thanks to his success leading a wealth management division that enjoyed increasing profits and a burgeoning global reputation. While the pair got on well at first, they allegedly clashed outside the office over issues that arose between them as next-door neighbours in the Herrliberg area of the so-called \u201cgold coast\u201d of Lake Zurich. Thiam complained to the bank about the inconvenience caused by lengthy renovations to Khan\u2019s home, the FT said. Khan later clashed with Thiam\u2019s partner during a cocktail party, in a disagreement that supposedly revolved around some trees planted on the Thiam property. During a subsequent confrontation, the two men had to be physically separated, Khan told the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger. As a result of their personal feud, Khan, who was also said to have been frustrated with his lack of profile at the bank, was reportedly allowed to leave with a shorter notice period than would usually apply. The bank then hired private investigators to follow him, amid concern he might poach talented staff from Credit Suisse. Khan has alleged that three men employed by private security firm Investigo chased him and his wife through the streets of Zurich in a car, leading to a physical confrontation. Investigo has said there was only one man, that it was Khan who did the chasing and that its staff kept their distance. Rohner initially supported Thiam over the affair but when it emerged that a second executive had been under surveillance \u2013 Peter Goerke, the former head of HR at Credit Suisse \u2013 relations between the two became strained. In an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, Credit Suisse\u2019s largest investor suggested that Thiam may have encountered racial bias in the Swiss banking industry. David Herro of Harris Associates said: \u201cTo be very frank, it seems [like] envy from competitors or perhaps something else given that Mr Thiam looks a little bit different than the typical Swiss banker. Either one of these two rationales behind these attacks against him, to me are extremely distasteful.\u201d Herro added on Friday that he believed Rohner should follow Thiam out of the bank. An investigation by an external law firm in October formally cleared Thiam of involvement in the Khan spying affair and resulted in Pierre-Olivier Bou\u00e9e, the chief operating officer and Thiam\u2019s closest ally, being fired over the Khan dispute. It also emerged that a private security consultant who had helped Bou\u00e9e organise the spying had apparently killed himself. Earlier this week Thiam appeared to have the upper hand in Rohner\u2019s attempt to oust him, gaining the backing of several top Credit Suisse shareholders. However, on Friday he said he had agreed with the board to step down as chief executive. \u201cI had no knowledge of the observation of two former colleagues. It undoubtedly disturbed Credit Suisse and caused anxiety and hurt. I regret that this happened and it should never have taken place.\u201d Thiam will step down after presenting the bank\u2019s annual results next week. The news of his departure sent Credit Suisse\u2019s share price down 4% in early trading but the stock later recovered its losses. Rohner told Swiss radio: \u201cAt some point we realised that we couldn\u2019t get out of this situation unless we made a change and Tidjane Thiam understood that too. \u201cTidjane has made an enormous contribution to Credit Suisse since he joined us in 2015. It is to his credit that Credit Suisse is standing on a very solid foundation and has returned successfully to profit.\u201d Dismissing suggestions of xenophobia in appointing a Swiss successor to Thiam, Rohner said of Gottstein: \u201cOne thing that was not a factor was the colour of his passport,\u201d he said.",

its position at 6.30pm on Thursday night.</p> <p>The report was prepared by EY for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) so that Westpac could comply with a prudential standard, CPS 220, that requires it to have systems in place to monitor and mitigate its risk.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill said: \u201cEY\u2019s overall conclusion was the design of Westpac\u2019s risk management framework was overall adequate, appropriate and partially effective for an institution of the size and complexity of Westpac.\u201d</p> <p>However, EY found that \u201crisk identification, assessment and management of non-financial risk was evaluated as partially effective and partially adequate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWestpac has noted that financial crime is an area that requires improvement,\u201d she said, reading from the report.</p> <p>She continued: \u201cThe risk of breaching AML-CTF obligations has at times been outside of appetite and we observe there have been issues across several jurisdictions reflecting heightened regulatory expectations and an acknowledgment by Westpac that its current AML-CTF capabilities require improvement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOutside of appetite\u201d is a term meaning that the risk of a breach of the law was higher than management of the bank was willing to accept.</p> <p>\u201cWestpac are investing in the roll-out of a new transaction monitoring system \u2026 to enhance its financial crime capability,\u201d O\u2019Neill said, again reading from the report.</p> <p>Westpac\u2019s chief risk officer, David Stephen, who was giving evidence to the hearing, repeatedly complained that the report had been provided to the committee on a confidential basis.</p> <p>He and the acting chief financial officer, Gary Thursby, declined to answer most of

<p>Australia\u2019s financial intelligence agency, Austrac, launched federal court legal action against Westpac over the alleged breaches on 20 November last year, sending the bank\u2019s share price into a steep decline.</p> <p>While most of the 23m breaches alleged by Austrac relate to its treatment of international funds transfer instructions, the regulator also alleged it failed to stop a dozen customers making more than 3,000 low-value payments to the Philippines that were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">consistent with child exploitation</a>.</p> <p>These customers included six who had repeatedly travelled to the Philippines or south-east Asia and one who had a prior conviction for child abuse, Austrac said in court documents.</p> <p>The lawsuit resulted in the former chief executive Brian Hartzer, chairman Lindsay Maxsted and the non-executive director responsible for oversight of risk, Ewen Crouch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/26/westpac-chief-executive-brian-hartzer-resigns-over-money-laundering-scandal\">tendering their resignations</a>.</p> <p>Thursby was elevated into his current role as a temporary replacement for Peter King, who is acting as CEO until a new boss is found.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill savaged the bank over its lack of cooperation with the committee, saying that despite its ability to command legions of lawyers it had failed to make a proper application for public interest immunity against production of documents.</p> <p>\u201cYour counsel simply doesn\u2019t understand the rights of parliament to demand that information,\u201d she told Stephen and Thursby.</p> <p>Stephen apologised for the lateness of Westpac\u2019s letter on

      "bodyText": "Westpac knew its ability to fight financial crime was inadequate two years before legal action in November in which authorities accused it of 23m breaches of the law that included allowing customers to pay for child exploitation in the Philippines, federal parliament has heard. The bank\u2019s risk of breaching anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism finance (AML-CTF) laws was unacceptably high and the bank accepted it needed to improve its systems, the prudential regulator was told in a secret report delivered by accounting firm EY in 2017. On Friday, Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill read out sections of the report during a committee inquiry into auditors, steamrolling through objections from Westpac executives and warnings from the chair of the committee, Liberal James Paterson. O\u2019Neill also blasted Westpac for refusing to give the committee a list of documents she requested on 28 January, and only informing the committee of its position at 6.30pm on Thursday night. The report was prepared by EY for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) so that Westpac could comply with a prudential standard, CPS 220, that requires it to have systems in place to monitor and mitigate its risk. O\u2019Neill said: \u201cEY\u2019s overall conclusion was the design of Westpac\u2019s risk management framework was overall adequate, appropriate and partially effective for an institution of the size and complexity of Westpac.\u201d However, EY found that \u201crisk identification, assessment and management of non-financial risk was evaluated as partially effective and partially adequate\u201d. \u201cWestpac has noted that financial crime is an area that requires improvement,\u201d she said, reading from the report. She continued: \u201cThe risk of breaching AML-CTF obligations has at times been outside of appetite and we observe there have been issues across several jurisdictions reflecting heightened regulatory expectations and an acknowledgment by Westpac that its current AML-CTF capabilities require improvement.\u201d \u201cOutside of appetite\u201d is a term meaning that the risk of a breach of the law was higher than management of the bank was willing to accept. \u201cWestpac are investing in the roll-out of a new transaction monitoring system \u2026 to enhance its financial crime capability,\u201d O\u2019Neill said, again reading from the report. Westpac\u2019s chief risk officer, David Stephen, who was giving evidence to the hearing, repeatedly complained that the report had been provided to the committee on a confidential basis. He and the acting chief financial officer, Gary Thursby, declined to answer most of O\u2019Neill\u2019s questions on the basis that Westpac was facing multiple investigations and lawsuits over the breaches. Australia\u2019s financial intelligence agency, Austrac, launched federal court legal action against Westpac over the alleged breaches on 20 November last year, sending the bank\u2019s share price into a steep decline. While most of the 23m breaches alleged by Austrac relate to its treatment of international funds transfer instructions, the regulator also alleged it failed to stop a dozen customers making more than 3,000 low-value payments to the Philippines that were consistent with child exploitation. These customers included six who had repeatedly travelled to the Philippines or south-east Asia and one who had a prior conviction for child abuse, Austrac said in court documents. The lawsuit resulted in the former chief executive Brian Hartzer, chairman Lindsay Maxsted and the non-executive director responsible for oversight of risk, Ewen Crouch, tendering their resignations. Thursby was elevated into his current role as a temporary replacement for Peter King, who is acting as CEO until a new boss is found. O\u2019Neill savaged the bank over its lack of cooperation with the committee, saying that despite its ability to command legions of lawyers it had failed to make a proper application for public interest immunity against production of documents. \u201cYour counsel simply doesn\u2019t understand the rights of parliament to demand that information,\u201d she told Stephen and Thursby. Stephen apologised for the lateness of Westpac\u2019s letter on Thursday night. \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight that communication wasn\u2019t appropriate,\u201d he said. O\u2019Neill had requested documents including all the drafts of the EY report, and information about remediation efforts following on from it. The drafts are potentially significant because the recent financial services royal commission heard allegations that AMP put pressure on law firm Clayton Utz to change a review it was conducting for the company. In its Thursday night letter, obtained by Guardian Australia, Westpac said it received a draft of the EY report on 30 June 2017 \u201cto enable verification of the factual accuracy of the report\u201d. It said it had \u201ccorrected factual inaccuracies\u201d in the report, \u201csought clarification of the wording in the report where EY\u2019s drafting was not clear or needed additional context\u201d and provided \u201cadditional information and evidence to EY to ensure that their report and recommendations were based on a full assessment of Westpac\u2019s current risk framework and practices\u201d.",

Invariably, the countryside fauna suffered as rare plants were ripped out of the ground. The sadness of it all is that, behind these crazes, there usually lie good intentions. Millennials cling to succulents and other houseplants because it is a tangible way of connecting with nature that is absent from an increasingly screen-based world. Those Victorian young women had been given societal permission to go outside and engage, grubbily, with nature for the first time in generations. Both groups had to put up with shrinking gardens and unreliable rented accommodation \u2013 the quiet satisfaction of watching green leaves unfurl around the place was, in short, much needed. Like all animals, humans are hard-wired to react to nature. Exposure to the outside world has been shown to be so beneficial that in Shetland, \u201cgreen prescriptions\u201d are issued to those with mental-health conditions. What ends up in cactus criminality often begins with a simple, and understandable, craving for a little greenery. \u2022 Alice Vincent is an author and journalist",

Reusable bags \u2013 defined by the government as having a thickness of 40 micrometres and a capacity of more than 30 litres \u2013 will remain in circulation.</p> \n<p>Discarded plastic bags have become a common blight on the Tunisian landscape, blown across the countryside, enmeshed in trees and impacting the country\u2019s land and marine ecosystems. Often used to transport household waste to local collection areas, they are commonly piled by the side of the road, where they lie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/may/13/tunisia-poorest-towns-hazardous-toxic-landfill-sites\">awaiting collection by the local municipality</a>.</p> \n<p>An attempt to introduce a ban <a href=\"https://www.webmanagercenter.com/2016/04/14/169164/tunisie-environnement-le-decret-interdisant-la-fabrication-de-sacs-en-plastique-ne-plait-aux-industriels/\">in 2016</a> failed following vocal resistance from industry. However, it was enough to stop many of the country\u2019s leading supermarkets issuing free bags. Instead, the stores started charging for a smaller number of more durable bags, resulting in a dramatic reduction in the overall number of bags in circulation.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have become addicted to single-use or disposable plastic \u2014 with severe environmental consequences,\u201d said Wassim Chaabane, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ATME.Tunisia\">Association Tuniso-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9enne de l\u2019Environnement</a>, an environmental group.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn Tunisia, more than 4.2bn single-use plastic bags are consumed, where 1.2bn bags are imported informally.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5e155483-4485-4570-8ff9-f5cae230d3a1\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong>Why the sudden focus on plastics?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Mankind produces roughly its entire body weight in plastics every year. But the vast majority of it is either not recycled, unrecyclable, or doesn't get reused once it's been recycled. Volumes ending up in the natural environment are surging. Plastic can take as much as 500 years to decompose.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the implications?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Plastic is ubiquitous \u2013 and often deadly. It kills sea creatures that eat it but cannot digest it. It gets into the human food chain by contaminating the fish that we eat. It is even in our tap water. There is no science about the long-term impact of humans ingesting plastic.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is to be done?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taxing plastic bags \u2013 or even banning them outright as Kenya has done \u2013 has changed consumer and producer behaviour. But what next? Deposit return schemes for plastic bottles work well in several countries. Charging for one-time coffee cups also seems to be on the agenda. But the real solutions may not be top down but ...<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>... bottom up?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Yes. Grassroots movements led the way on plastic bags, and have spawned others such as Refill, which emphasises reusing bottles, and A Plastic Planet, which urges plastic-free aisles in supermarkets. Popular culture remains hugely important: it's just possible that the British series The Blue Planet has changed attitudes overnight.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Plastic bags can take anywhere between <a href=\"https://conservingnow.com/plastic-bag-environmental-impact/\">400 </a><a href=\"https://conservingnow.com/plastic-bag-environmental-impact/\">and 1,000 years to break down</a> through exposure to light.

Negotiations over the wider ban, to be introduced next year, are ongoing.</p> \n<p>The move was welcomed by campaigners in Tunis and the environmental pressure group <a href=\"https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/\">Break free from Plastic</a>.

      "bodyText": "Tunisia has announced plans to stop its supermarkets and pharmacies from using single-use plastic bags from next month before phasing them out completely in 2021. Plastic pollution has been a growing problem in the north African country in recent years, along with the challenges presented by its ancient industrial plants and barely managed household waste. Under government plans, major supermarkets and pharmacies will stop issuing the bags from 1 March, with all bags banned by January 2021. Reusable bags \u2013 defined by the government as having a thickness of 40 micrometres and a capacity of more than 30 litres \u2013 will remain in circulation. Discarded plastic bags have become a common blight on the Tunisian landscape, blown across the countryside, enmeshed in trees and impacting the country\u2019s land and marine ecosystems. Often used to transport household waste to local collection areas, they are commonly piled by the side of the road, where they lie awaiting collection by the local municipality. An attempt to introduce a ban in 2016 failed following vocal resistance from industry. However, it was enough to stop many of the country\u2019s leading supermarkets issuing free bags. Instead, the stores started charging for a smaller number of more durable bags, resulting in a dramatic reduction in the overall number of bags in circulation. \u201cWe have become addicted to single-use or disposable plastic \u2014 with severe environmental consequences,\u201d said Wassim Chaabane, founder of the Association Tuniso-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9enne de l\u2019Environnement, an environmental group. \u201cIn Tunisia, more than 4.2bn single-use plastic bags are consumed, where 1.2bn bags are imported informally.\u201d Plastic bags can take anywhere between 400 and 1,000 years to break down through exposure to light. Once reduced to tiny particles, they continue to contaminate the soil and waterways, endangering local habitats and polluting seas and rivers. Chebli Hedi, the general director of environment and quality of life at the ministry of local affairs and the environment in Tunis, explained: \u201cSince the revolution we have had serious difficulty in different areas and different cities with plastic bags, which are small and have been thrown away and disturb the environment.\u201d Unlike the earlier attempt to ban their use, Hedi stressed, this latest initiative came following extensive consultation with the public and the commercial Utica union, and also involved voluntary participation by most supermarkets and pharmacies. Negotiations over the wider ban, to be introduced next year, are ongoing. The move was welcomed by campaigners in Tunis and the environmental pressure group Break free from Plastic. All cautioned against its introduction without adequate monitoring and support. Most vulnerable will be small shopkeepers who rely on regularly issuing bags to their customers. Even here, however, the government\u2019s proposals found support, albeit cautious. \u201cThis news definitely makes me happy,\u201d said Mohammad El Weti, a shopkeeper in Tunis\u2019s ancient medina. \u201cWe\u2019re used to politicians giving vague promises, but I\u2019m happy they managed to pass an actual law this time. I hope they will manage to apply it.\u201d Tunisia faces other significant environmental challenges. Single-use plastics, such as drinking straws and plastic used in commercial packaging, remains commonplace. Elsewhere, Tunisia\u2019s reliance on often antiquated heavy industry, not least phosphate production, has left entire swathes of the country and coastline unusable. While the government is making some headway on limiting pollution, in a country where unemployment sits at 15% nationally any measure that could be perceived as damaging to industry, and therefor a danger to jobs, is likely to prove controversial. Hedi nonetheless remains optimistic. \u201cWith the environment, you cannot say: \u2018This is very big, so we need to start with it,\u2019 or: \u2018This is very small, so I can ignore it.\u2019 With the environment, everything counts.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The advisory panel of a review into the Windrush scandal, including a former senior immigration judge, has warned against the resumption of mass deportation flights to Jamaica until after its report is published. Up to 50 people are due to be deported on Tuesday in what will be the second immigration removal charter flight to Jamaica since the Guardian exposed the scandal of the wrongful deportation of Commonwealth citizens from the Caribbean in 2018. MPs, support services for migrants and activists have criticised the flight, pointing out that it is taking place before the publication of the long-delayed \u201cWindrush lessons learned\u201d review. On Thursday night BBC Newsnight reported that it had seen a leaked copy of the review and it recommended that the government consider ending the deportation of foreign-born offenders who came to the UK as children. MP David Lammy told the programme: \u201cI think it is extraordinary that it is even happening. There is a young man who was about to be deported who did two months for GBH, and the young man I spoke to was groomed \u2026 he was groomed into selling drugs, he got 15 months for selling, he was let out in 2015 and is about to be deported in 2020. We stopped deporting criminals to Australia in 1868, why have we started doing it through the back door this way?\u201d Earlier British officials and their counterparts in Jamaica continued to insist that all those set for removal are criminals, and that no Windrush victims are involved. However, the Guardian understands, that other recommendations in the review may include a broadening of who counts as a Windrush victim. Asked about that possibility, James Hanratty, a former president of the Council of Immigration Judges, who sat on the review\u2019s advisory panel, drew a distinction between people being deported for criminal offences and people who had suffered due to the Windrush scandal. But, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s possible \u2013 but I don\u2019t know the facts \u2013 that some of the people on the deportation flight may indeed be Windrush victims. \u201cTherefore \u2013 although it\u2019s not for me to set out policy or advise the government \u2013 on the face of it, it would seem wise to postpone that flight until after the Windrush report is published.\u201d Wendy Williams, HM inspector of constabulary, was commissioned to oversee the Lessons Learned review in 2018, and its findings was originally intended to be published by the end of March last year. However, it has been repeatedly delayed. Last June, extracts of a leaked draft was published that said the Home Office failed in its duty to counter racism, and accused officials of recklessness and reluctance to acknowledge mistakes. The report is currently undergoing a process of \u201cMaxwellisation\u201d, where those criticised are given the opportunity to respond, and is expected to be published soon. In the interim, the Home Office does not know whether it is committing similar mistakes to those that led to the Windrush scandal in the first place, said Omar Khan, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, who also sat on the panel. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got to the bottom of the previous injustices, and here they are possibly making more,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cGiven that deportations were one of the sources of the injustice of the initial Windrush scandal, until the lessons learned review has been published, and until the compensation scheme has run its course, there should be no more deportations [to Jamaica].\u201d Jacqui McKenzie, an immigration lawyer also on the panel, said on Wednesday she was concerned about the mass deportation going ahead before the review was published. Meanwhile, many of those due to be removed from the UK next week are trying to build cases to prevent their deportation. However, they have been hampered by a lack of network coverage for their Home Office-issued mobile phones in the area around Heathrow where many are being detained. On Thursday, after an order issued by the high court earlier in the week, it is understood that the Home Office admitted there were ongoing problems with the 02 phone network affecting up to 678 detainees in the Harmondsworth and Colnbrook removal centres, and pledged to provide 1,000 new sim cards by Sunday. Detainees with tickets for the Jamaican charter flight have been prioritised for new sim cards. Initially the Home Office told the Guardian that the problem had been resolved last month.

This is causing utter chaos for patients, clinicians and pharmacists,\u201d said Kasliwal.</p> <p>There was no true equivalent for the Sayan Press self-injectable contraceptive, she said. This means women would have to go to their doctor or practice nurse to be given an injection on a monthly basis instead.

      "bodyText": "The electoral commission has said it will look into the Liberal party\u2019s bizarre declaration and subsequent removal of a $165,000 donation from a Scott Morrison ally who is also vying for a $1bn visa processing contract. The Liberals still have not explained how they came to mistakenly declare the donation from a largely-inactive company named Southern Strategy, which had never donated to any political party before. The party\u2019s declaration to the electoral commission included Southern Strategy\u2019s business address, the specific amount donated and the date of the donation, but it now claims the donation did not happen and was mistakenly reported. Southern Strategy is a dormant political consultancy business set up by Scott Briggs, a friend of Morrison\u2019s and former deputy director of the NSW Liberals, who is part of a consortium bidding for the controversial contract to privatise the Australian visa processing system. The Liberals asked to have the donation removed from its disclosure to the AEC following Guardian questions on Tuesday. Briggs says he never made the donation, and left it to the party to explain why it was listed on its disclosures. The Liberals have also now said he gave them nothing, either via a cash donation or an in-kind gift, which could include the provision of free consultancy services. On Thursday Labor\u2019s shadow assistant immigration minister, Andrew Giles, wrote to the Australian electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers, requesting an investigation. It is understood the AEC has told Labor it will look into the matter. A spokesman said the commission would not provide an \u201congoing public commentary\u201d on its handling of the complaint. \u201cI can confirm that we have received correspondence from Mr Giles regarding this matter, which we are considering,\u201d he said. \u201cConsistent with previous compliance matters, the AEC will not provide an ongoing public commentary.\u201d Giles described the matter as \u201cserious\u201d and said the Liberals should come clean and explain how a $165,000 donation could have been mistakenly declared. \u201cThe Liberal party have a statutory obligation to report donations correctly \u2013 that\u2019s why the AEC should take a look at this,\u201d he said. The original donation disclosure placed Southern Strategy\u2019s business address at the same office as the consortium bidding for the visa contract, Australian Visa Processing. That consortium includes Briggs\u2019s investment firm, Pacific Blue Capital, contracting giant PwC Australia, software multinational Oracle and the fund manager Ellerston. The plan to privatise the visa processing system has prompted concern from the Community and Public Sector Union, which has said the plan will put jobs and sensitive personal information at risk. Labor said the procurement process suffered from unavoidable conflicts of interest \u2013 a charge the Coalition denied. Morrison and the immigration minister, David Coleman, a former colleague of Briggs, have reportedly removed themselves from cabinet deliberations on the contract. The Liberal party\u2019s disclosures to the AEC remained unchanged on Friday. It typically takes some time for the commission to process requests to amend disclosure returns.",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: S-bahn around Freiburg, Germany You\u2019d usually only find an S-bahn network (commuter train) in a big metropolis in Germany, but just outside Freiburg im Breisgau in the Black Forest, a small S-bahn network connects the medieval towns of the Kaiserstuhl hills. The S-bahn grid across the Kaiserstuhl runs in a circle, with stops in Riegel, home to malty Riegeler Landbier helles beer, and Breisach, a hilltop town with views across the Rhine into France. Brightly coloured Alsatian-style houses greet visitors in each town along the route, and winding Kaiserstuhl vineyards provide a magnificent backdrop. Tickets valid for 24 hours start at \u20ac6.70. Ashlyn Ljubljana-Kranj, Slovenia The local train from Ljubljana Central to Kranj (on the Jesenice line, which extends into Austria) is well-worth it for a day trip: it takes around half an hour and costs about \u20ac3.50 for an adult return (book at the station on the day). Kranj, Slovenia\u2019s fourth-largest city, is at the foot of the Julian Alps and on a clear day the view from the train is stunning, complete with snow-capped mountains and gorgeous scenery. In Kranj itself, be sure to sample the local coffee and beer, and talk a stroll in the Kokra river canyon, which can be reached easily from the station. Rose Tatra Electric railway from Poprad, Slovakia We spent a week travelling by the Tatra Electric railway around the small towns, resorts and walking trails of the High Tatra mountains in Slovakia. A seven-day pass is only \u20ac14 per adult. It\u2019s clean, simple and cheap with beautiful views in a stunning environment. It\u2019s not fast travel; it\u2019s slow and atmospheric and we loved it. We arrived in Poprad by \u201cnormal\u201d train, which was scenic enough, then used the electric train to take us into the mountains and for all travel while there for a week. It links on to equally lovely cog railways too. Could not recommend it more highly! Christina Evans Ragusa-Scicli, Sicily We travelled on the line from Ragusa to Scicli last October to connect two of the locations \u2013 both superb baroque towns \u2013 used in Inspector Montalbano. The return trip for two was under \u20ac12, a bargain given the glorious countryside we travelled through and the walkability and character of the destination. Yes, the train itself needed a refurb, but that didn\u2019t matter as we\u2019d had good food, beer and coffee in town and been in a certain policeman\u2019s office too. Keith Rickaby Bilbao-Guernica, Spain After a few days indulging myself in Bilbao\u2019s pintxos bars and visiting the Guggenheim Museum I took the hour-long train trip to Guernica. The direct narrow-gauge service passes through lush countryside and is a window on the region\u2019s attractive small towns. Guernica, which is in the Urdaibai biosphere reserve, and immortalised by Picasso, is now a place dedicated to peace, with sculpture by Eduardo Chillida and Henry Moore. Visit the Guernica Tree, and the ceramic tile mural of Picasso\u2019s warning to the world about the suffering caused by war. Take the Euskotren E4 from one of four Bilbao stations bound for Bermeo. It takes about an hour and costs \u20ac3. Angela Buckley Yellow train, Pyrenees, France Le Petit Train Jaune crosses the eastern side of the Pyrenees, up into the beautiful Cerdagne Valley.

Flights were regularly scheduled then cancelled after negotiations broke down. \u201cWe would only be told, the flight was cancelled,\u201d Senan, 40, says. \u201c[Ayman\u2019s] mother started telling me to quit, that we would never get it.\u201d</p> <p>Behind the scenes, international officials worked to build consensus between the parties involved. \u201cFor two years, every time there was a breakthrough, one of several of the parties backtracked from their commitment,\u201d a source familiar with the process said.</p> <p>The logistics presented another set of hurdles, including finding airlines willing to take out war insurance to conduct the flight, and finding a UN plane that might be free amid a global scramble to evacuate citizens from coronavirus-hit China.</p> <p>Nursing his daughter in a hotel room, Abdulwahab said he struggled to understand why getting a 10-year-old girl into surgery was so fraught: \u201cWhat is the fault of those who are suffering from sickness to be dragged into the politics of the world?\u201d</p> <p>For instance, in October, dozens of families with sick children were summoned to Sana\u2019a and told to prepare to fly. A few days later, they were informed that negotiations had broken down and the airlift was cancelled. \u201cWe were devastated,\u201d Abdalwahab said.</p> <p>Over the next weeks, new flights were repeatedly scheduled then cancelled at the last minute. International officials were reluctant to send the families home, and by that point, Senan said, he would not have left anyway. \u201cI was either going to get my son treated or die with him,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot imagine what it was like, psychologically, for those waiting at that hotel,\u201d said Lutfallah. \u201cOne woman had cancer, and because she couldn\u2019t get medical care in time, she lost her eyesight. Another father of a young girl was told that they would have to amputate both her legs, but he refused, because he knew she wouldn\u2019t get proper care in Yemen.\u201d</p> <p>For two children, Khalid and Abdullah, authorities agreed to the flight too late \u2013 and just in time. Khalid, 9, had entered the first stage of renal failure. \u201cWithout dialysis, his kidney would have totally failed,\u201d said Ashraf Shami, a paediatrician overseeing his case in Jordan.</p> <p>Abdullah, 13, had found a donor in Yemen to give him a healthy kidney, but no place there to perform the surgery. The pair were onboard the first flight to Jordan on Monday. \u201cHe had months to live,\u201d Shami said. \u201cMaybe less.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Jassar Al-Tahat</em></p>",

The Houthi health ministry says 32,000 people in the territory it holds are unable to receive proper medical care due to the blockade, which has been blamed for exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that has displaced 4.3 million people and left 80% of the population without enough food, safe water or sanitation. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it was really happening until the plane took off,\u201d said Majdi Abdulwahab, whose daughter Samira, 10, underwent reconstructive ear surgery at Amman\u2019s Speciality hospital on Wednesday morning, five years after being injured in a motorcycle accident. Even before the war, Yemen\u2019s health system was one of the least developed in the region. Once the fighting started, cases such as Manal\u2019s traumatic shoulder injury became impossible to treat. \u201cI submitted her case to a rehabilitation centre and after three months they told us they couldn\u2019t help her,\u201d Lutfallah, 40, said. \u201cWe took her back to the doctor, and he said he couldn\u2019t help her either.\u201d Wahib Senan took his son, Ayman, 10, to several doctors and lobbied high officials to find treatment for the scoliosis that started curving the boy\u2019s spine four years ago. \u201cThey always told us he had to fly abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t sleep or live his life normally \u2026 Seeing your son dying is crushing.\u201d Getting registered on a list of patients eligible to be flown overseas was the start of a torrid new chapter. Flights were regularly scheduled then cancelled after negotiations broke down. \u201cWe would only be told, the flight was cancelled,\u201d Senan, 40, says. \u201c[Ayman\u2019s] mother started telling me to quit, that we would never get it.\u201d Behind the scenes, international officials worked to build consensus between the parties involved. \u201cFor two years, every time there was a breakthrough, one of several of the parties backtracked from their commitment,\u201d a source familiar with the process said. The logistics presented another set of hurdles, including finding airlines willing to take out war insurance to conduct the flight, and finding a UN plane that might be free amid a global scramble to evacuate citizens from coronavirus-hit China. Nursing his daughter in a hotel room, Abdulwahab said he struggled to understand why getting a 10-year-old girl into surgery was so fraught: \u201cWhat is the fault of those who are suffering from sickness to be dragged into the politics of the world?\u201d For instance, in October, dozens of families with sick children were summoned to Sana\u2019a and told to prepare to fly. A few days later, they were informed that negotiations had broken down and the airlift was cancelled. \u201cWe were devastated,\u201d Abdalwahab said. Over the next weeks, new flights were repeatedly scheduled then cancelled at the last minute. International officials were reluctant to send the families home, and by that point, Senan said, he would not have left anyway. \u201cI was either going to get my son treated or die with him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot imagine what it was like, psychologically, for those waiting at that hotel,\u201d said Lutfallah. \u201cOne woman had cancer, and because she couldn\u2019t get medical care in time, she lost her eyesight. Another father of a young girl was told that they would have to amputate both her legs, but he refused, because he knew she wouldn\u2019t get proper care in Yemen.\u201d For two children, Khalid and Abdullah, authorities agreed to the flight too late \u2013 and just in time. Khalid, 9, had entered the first stage of renal failure. \u201cWithout dialysis, his kidney would have totally failed,\u201d said Ashraf Shami, a paediatrician overseeing his case in Jordan. Abdullah, 13, had found a donor in Yemen to give him a healthy kidney, but no place there to perform the surgery. The pair were onboard the first flight to Jordan on Monday. \u201cHe had months to live,\u201d Shami said. \u201cMaybe less.\u201d Additional reporting by Jassar Al-Tahat",

Totals as high as 200mm were forecast for Saturday, and 150mm for Sunday.</p> <p>The last time the city had more than 100mm of rain in one day was 28 November 2018.</p> <p>The city could also receive more rainfall over a three-day period than it has has at any point in the past three and a half years, with as much as 120-150mm forecast for Saturday and another 90-150mm expected on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cThe last three-day event when we saw rainfall totals potentially this high was 226mm and that was in June 2016,\u201d Dean Sgarbossa, a senior meteorologist, said.</p> <p>The heavy falls are due to a trough that is making its way from south-east Queensland and northern NSW down the coast.

The BoM said the small scale of these low pressure centres was making precise forecasting of rainfall levels in some areas difficult.</p> <p>The heavy falls are expected to move into fire-affected parts of the NSW south coast over the weekend. There could also be significant falls in areas with active fires near the ACT and in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland region.</p> <p>But those heavy falls come with warnings of water contamination from ash and silt.</p> <p>Increased run-off could also lead to flash flooding and land slips, which may block access trails and roads in some areas.</p> <p>WaterNSW has been monitoring areas around the Warragamba Dam, the source of 80% of untreated supply for greater Sydney.</p> <p>Two silt curtains designed to trap material that could pose a risk to water quality have been in place since January.</p> <p>On Friday WaterNSW said the Warragamba catchment was expected to receive 200mm of rain over the weekend, but the advice from the Bureau of Meteoroglogy was that rain would not be at such a level as to raise major concerns about water quality in the Warragamba dam storage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SydneyWaterNews/status/1225657976003776516\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019re really pleased to see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/sydneyrain?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#sydneyrain</a> falling across our catchment.

      "bodyText": "Torrential rain in New South Wales has reduced the number of active fires in the state by a third, from more than 60 down to 42, but parts of the east coast now face a new threat from flooding, with Sydney facing one of its wettest three-day periods in years. The commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service, Shane Fitzsimmons, said on Friday there had been a \u201cdramatic shift\u201d in the hot, dry and windy conditions that have driven the unprecedented fire season for months. \u201cThis has been an absolute welcome disruption to that weather pattern and a massive reprieve and relief to so many people right across New South Wales,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want to see lots of widespread damage and destruction from flooding, but it is certainly a welcome change to the relentless campaign of hot, dry weather resulting in widespread damaging, destructive fires that we\u2019ve experienced for too long now.\u201d The RFS is taking advantage of the conditions to strengthen containment lines and, where possible, conduct back-burning operations. Fitzsimmons said of the 42 fires still burning in NSW, 17 were uncontained. He said there was optimism that rainfall over the next week would result in many of those being declared contained, and \u201chopefully going to the status of out\u201d. The largest effect has been on fires in the north and north-east of the state. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not across all the fire grounds at this stage. We\u2019ve seen it concentrated largely up through the north-east of the state, it is slowly moving south-eastwards toward Sydney and parts of the Illawarra,\u201d Fitzsimmons said. Coastal areas of NSW, including Sydney, could receive their highest rainfall levels in more than three years as a trough makes its way down the state. Multiple severe weather and flood warnings were in place across NSW on Friday, with emergency services warning of possible land slips in areas near fire grounds cleared of vegetation. The Bureau of Meteorology said on Friday could see Sydney receive its largest amount of rainfall over a 24-hour period since 2018, with 60mm to 90mm forecast. Totals as high as 200mm were forecast for Saturday, and 150mm for Sunday. The last time the city had more than 100mm of rain in one day was 28 November 2018. The city could also receive more rainfall over a three-day period than it has has at any point in the past three and a half years, with as much as 120-150mm forecast for Saturday and another 90-150mm expected on Sunday. \u201cThe last three-day event when we saw rainfall totals potentially this high was 226mm and that was in June 2016,\u201d Dean Sgarbossa, a senior meteorologist, said. The heavy falls are due to a trough that is making its way from south-east Queensland and northern NSW down the coast. The bureau warned conditions were likely to develop into an east coast low, which can be characterised by \u201cdestructive winds, torrential rainfall and rough seas\u201d. Mitchell Harley, a coastal researcher at the University of NSW, said 5.5m waves forecast for high tide on Sunday morning in Sydney could potentially replicate conditions similar to the 2016 east coast low, when parts of houses in the northern beaches suburb of Collaroy were destroyed and large sections of the beach were washed away. In Newcastle, 45 tonnes of sand were brought in to protect Stockton beach, the ABC reported. The beach has suffered dramatic erosion in recent years, forcing the closure of a childcare centre and threatening other beachside buildings. Within the trough there are smaller low pressure centres that are leading to intense rainfall over some areas. The BoM said the small scale of these low pressure centres was making precise forecasting of rainfall levels in some areas difficult. The heavy falls are expected to move into fire-affected parts of the NSW south coast over the weekend. There could also be significant falls in areas with active fires near the ACT and in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland region. But those heavy falls come with warnings of water contamination from ash and silt. Increased run-off could also lead to flash flooding and land slips, which may block access trails and roads in some areas. WaterNSW has been monitoring areas around the Warragamba Dam, the source of 80% of untreated supply for greater Sydney. Two silt curtains designed to trap material that could pose a risk to water quality have been in place since January. On Friday WaterNSW said the Warragamba catchment was expected to receive 200mm of rain over the weekend, but the advice from the Bureau of Meteoroglogy was that rain would not be at such a level as to raise major concerns about water quality in the Warragamba dam storage. \u201cHowever some debris/ash is likely to be transported into the storage.\u201d The chief executive of WaterNSW, David Harris, said the organisation had sophisticated models that could predict what was coming into water storages. He said the full impact would be clearer in coming days. \u201cManaging water quality in our dam storages is what we as an organisation do, and our water quality scientists are highly-regarded experts. Some debris/ash is likely to be transported into the storage, but we are well-placed to manage the risk,\u201d he said. Brogo dam, on the south coast, which supplies Bermagui, is also close to a fire ground. On Friday, the flooding led to road closures in some areas, including several in Sydney. In the northern rivers region, a car was washed off the road and two people had to be rescued from a caravan due to rising floodwaters. The road to the Jenolan Caves, south-west of Katoomba, was also closed due to fears the heavy rain could cause landslides. The RFS said there were still some areas west of the ranges around Canberra, where a number of fires were burning and yet to see rainfall. Crews were back-burning where possible, but very heavy rain could make that difficult in some places. However, Fitzsimmons said the wet weather was putting much needed moisture back into the landscape and this would help firefighting efforts, even if hot, dry weather returned. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not going to have the underlying conditions of such profound moisture deficit and drought situations dominated by this massive heat event that\u2019s been sitting there literally for months,\u201d he said.",

It\u2019s about Hollywood, obviously; no film since The Artist has lavished so much airtime on the mechanics of the movie biz, nor riffed so lovingly on its folklore.</p> <p>It stars men \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/22/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-tarantino-lashes-out-at-criticism-over-female-actors\">a woman</a> \u2013 that the industry adores. It flatters its audience with the assumption of enough cultural knowledge to indulge its spoof inserts and that final act rug-pull. Aside from some fairly uncontroversial scepticism about Charles Manson, it studiously avoids politics. And it offers voters an opportunity to fete Tarantino, one of their own, slightly-unsung prodigal sons \u2013 a tamed yet still spunky enfant terrible who\u2019s just about to become a dad.</p> <p>To be honest, I have long harboured a loathing for Tarantino \u2013 the man maybe more than his movies, though I\u2019ve never gone nuts for those either. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/15/pulp-fiction-review\">Pulp Fiction</a> is overcooked; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/oct/10/quentintarantino\">Kill Bill</a> tension free; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/19/inglourious-basterds-review-brad-pitt-quentin-tarantino\">Inglorious Basterds</a> flat-out awful.

Leonardo DiCaprio, centre, in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cooper/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think that\u2019s mostly on account of pace: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is so relaxed as to be barely a film at all, while also being the most obviously cinematic contender. It is both an episodic meander and a formally stringent genre fairytale. It is all about the feeling: of being a hot and charming washed-up stuntman with the warm breeze flowing through your gorgeous hair as you fix an aerial on a Beverley Hills mansion. Of being a hot and charming 26-year-old starlet, married to Roman Polanski, feeling the warm breeze flow through your gorgeous hair as you zip through traffic-free freeways in an open-top motor, off to the hottest party in town.</p> <p>And if its actual narrative is all over the shop, it functions just fine as a delivery vehicle for scenes that stay with you for days: the humbling of Leonardo DiCaprio by a child star; Pitt scoping out a derelict movie ranch; Margot Robbie gleeful at seeing her own character up on the big screen (hat-tip to Tarantino for leaving Sharon Tate in the movie, rather than artfully substituting his own star).</p> <p>In its extreme auteurish extravagance, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is absolutely uncompromising. It is also a manifesto: baked into the movie is the line Tarantino has been trotting since its release \u2013 that he, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/02/martin-scorsese-the-irishman-dont-watch-on-phone-netflix\">like Scorsese</a>, is a celluloid defender, a crusader against the dark forces of the franchise.

      "bodyText": "One of the highlights of the final furlong of awards season is the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot series, in which Scott Feinberg talks outrageous truths out of an anonymous voter (whose identity Twitter then scurries to guess). The first one this year was quite the corrective for all those who thought 1917 was a lock-in for best picture \u2013 unless Parasite were to dazzlingly pip it. Turns out, both of those movies are just too goddamn foreign. Sam Mendes\u2019s 1917 might be fine for the Baftas but the Oscars are an American bash and a Yank has got to win in order to make Hollywood great again. It\u2019s a reminder that Quentin Tarantino\u2019s ninth film really does tick a lot of Oscar boxes. It\u2019s about Hollywood, obviously; no film since The Artist has lavished so much airtime on the mechanics of the movie biz, nor riffed so lovingly on its folklore. It stars men \u2013 and a woman \u2013 that the industry adores. It flatters its audience with the assumption of enough cultural knowledge to indulge its spoof inserts and that final act rug-pull. Aside from some fairly uncontroversial scepticism about Charles Manson, it studiously avoids politics. And it offers voters an opportunity to fete Tarantino, one of their own, slightly-unsung prodigal sons \u2013 a tamed yet still spunky enfant terrible who\u2019s just about to become a dad. To be honest, I have long harboured a loathing for Tarantino \u2013 the man maybe more than his movies, though I\u2019ve never gone nuts for those either. Pulp Fiction is overcooked; Kill Bill tension free; Inglorious Basterds flat-out awful. But the problems I had with his back catalogue \u2013 especially the fetish-level self-indulgence and sniggering revisionism \u2013 evaporated here. I think that\u2019s mostly on account of pace: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is so relaxed as to be barely a film at all, while also being the most obviously cinematic contender. It is both an episodic meander and a formally stringent genre fairytale. It is all about the feeling: of being a hot and charming washed-up stuntman with the warm breeze flowing through your gorgeous hair as you fix an aerial on a Beverley Hills mansion. Of being a hot and charming 26-year-old starlet, married to Roman Polanski, feeling the warm breeze flow through your gorgeous hair as you zip through traffic-free freeways in an open-top motor, off to the hottest party in town. And if its actual narrative is all over the shop, it functions just fine as a delivery vehicle for scenes that stay with you for days: the humbling of Leonardo DiCaprio by a child star; Pitt scoping out a derelict movie ranch; Margot Robbie gleeful at seeing her own character up on the big screen (hat-tip to Tarantino for leaving Sharon Tate in the movie, rather than artfully substituting his own star). In its extreme auteurish extravagance, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is absolutely uncompromising. It is also a manifesto: baked into the movie is the line Tarantino has been trotting since its release \u2013 that he, like Scorsese, is a celluloid defender, a crusader against the dark forces of the franchise. That might ring a little hollow. But it will still be music to many voters\u2019 ears. Mine too, for once. Few, it seems, can carry a tune quite like Tarantino.",

A teenage girl with red hair and glasses, pouting at the camera against an outdoor backdrop. These photographs are the sort that saturate our online world, ones that you might find on a Facebook profile or LinkedIn page. The only difference? These people don\u2019t exist. They are the product of an algorithm, a network of images competing against each other to create convincing fakes \u2013 and experts believe that they could soon replace pictures of real people in everything from the profiles that we match with on dating apps to the bodies that we watch in porn. Designed by former Uber engineer Phil Wang, thispersondoesnotexist.com makes use of a code called StyleGAN (short for generative adversarial network). Wang has utilized this code to create a seemingly endless stream of faces. \u201cOur sensitivity to faces, when you really think about it, is a product of evolution for successful mating,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat the site really demonstrates is that even for a data distribution that we are so well crafted to understand as human beings, the machine can pick apart all the relevant features and recompose them in a way that\u2019s coherent.\u201d Wang\u2019s innovation is fascinating and seemingly innocuous and yet it shares the same technological basis as much more sinister creations. Over the past few years GANs have been almost endemically misused to create malicious content, such as material mapping the faces of celebrities on to existing, often pornographic, footage \u2013 known as deepfakes. \u201cA recent study found that 96% of all deepfake videos were pornographic and in many cases are being used to harass and terrorize women,\u201d says Rachel Thomas founder of fast.ai and expert in applied data ethics. \u201cIn general, our legal system has been slow to catch up with addressing [this kind of] sexual imagery and the use of AI is deepening and accelerating this problem.\u201d With this technology already inextricably and often problematically intertwined with sexual content, some are predicting that even more spurious videos making use of the same fake-face technology might be the next avenue that the adult industry looks to. A growing body of research into creating full-body deepfakes also raises questions about the potential uses and misuses of GANs.

      "body": "<p>Green Day are in their modest rehearsal space in their hometown of Oakland, California, a little haven in a country on the turn. The trio of 47-year-olds \u2013 still the world\u2019s biggest punk band \u2013 are posing for photos with singer-guitarist-songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong\u2019s prized Triumph motorcycle. Then someone remembers that the band\u2019s forthcoming <a href=\"https://hellamegatour.com/\" title=\"\">Hella Mega Tour</a>, alongside fellow alt-rock survivors Fall Out Boy and Weezer, is sponsored by Harley-Davidson. The Triumph is put back under its protective sheet.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome to Trump\u2019s America,\u201d sighs bassist Mike Dirnt when I tell him of my journey via San Francisco, where I was shocked to see so much desperate homelessness. \u201cA place where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

How did that happen?\u201d Recently, he attended a show only to be confronted by a young punk with giant liberty-spiked hair, \u201clooking like he\u2019d just walked out of a squat\u201d, asking for a selfie on a brand-new iPhone. \u201cIt\u2019s cool and it\u2019s weird,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m just excited people are still doing cool shit.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXv00PJ9IQM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eXv00PJ9IQM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Green Day\u2019s new album is titled Father of All Motherfuckers and yet, surprisingly for a band best known for delivering 2004\u2019s George Bush-baiting rock opera <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/sep/17/popandrock.shopping2\" title=\"\">American Idiot</a>, they say Donald Trump had little influence on the new record. At the same time, they insist it is political.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all there in the songs,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cI\u2019m singing about \u2018looking out for the jingoes and heathens\u2019 or \u2018another black kid shot in town\u2019.\u201d There\u2019s a lyric about bulletproof backpacks designed as protection during school shootings, \u201cone of the most absurd ideas I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d. But Armstrong doesn\u2019t want to be on the nose. \u201cEverything that is happening in the world is right there on Twitter. It\u2019s so confusing and it\u2019s so depressing. I really wanted to create some kind of escape for people; I didn\u2019t want to be so obvious.\u201d Satirical punk site <a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/\" title=\"\">The Hard Times</a> wrote a story the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration titled <a href=\"https://thehardtimes.net/news/future-green-day-concept-album-sworn-office/\" title=\"\">Future Green Day Concept Album Sworn Into Office</a>. \u201cIt was funny, but I didn\u2019t want us to do that.

I\u2019ve got tons of feelings about it. I think Trump is a piece of shit. I think [Senate majority leader] Mitch McConnell is pure evil. All they care about is looking after the rich and they don\u2019t care about the common people. But I find no inspiration there. It\u2019s so depressing.

No punk band has made it this far. The Sex Pistols lasted three years, the Clash 10, the Ramones 22. Green Day are writing the blueprint while living it, so it is no surprise that they have sometimes made mistakes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/01/morrissey-collaborators-respond-to-his-politics\" title=\"\">Last year Armstrong duetted with Morrissey</a> on his covers album California Son \u2013 a terrible look in the wake of Morrissey\u2019s vocal support for far-right organisations and individuals.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware until the song came out,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cWe do the song, and he was very lovely, and then the song comes out and a lot of Brits were like: what the hell are you doing? I really did not have a clue \u2026 \u201d Bewitched by the singer\u2019s status as an 80s indie godhead, he simply failed in his due diligence. Cool pipes up, giggling: \u201cHey, we\u2019ve all got our Ted Nugents, right?\u201d \u2013 a reference to the US rocker and gun enthusiast.</p> <p>Green Day have endured major wobbles and are now in \u201cuncharted territory,\u201d as Armstrong puts it. \u201cPeople get over their high school bands. They don\u2019t go on to spend every day in their orbit for the next 20 years.\u201d</p> <p>After two records on the late, great East Bay punk imprint Lookout!, in 1994 the young band signed with major label Reprise. The punk scene was aghast. 924 Gilman Street, the puritanical Berkeley-based all-ages headquarters of said scene banned the group from performing. Green Day released Dookie in February of that year and it sold 20m copies. They wouldn\u2019t return to play Gilman Street until 2015.</p> <p>Old friends and fellow scenesters might not have wanted to talk to them any more, but everyone else did. Along with Smash, the third album by fellow Californians the Offspring (at 11m sales, the biggest-selling record on an independent label ever) and the rise to prominence of the Berkeley band Rancid, Dookie spearheaded an interest in American punk rock not seen since the birth of the New York CBGB scene 20 years earlier \u2013 but with the sales to match the cultural impact.</p> <p>\u201cWe were always thinking about legacy,\u201d Cool says. \u201cWe never wanted songs to sound like we\u2019d relied too much on whatever recording techniques were in vogue. We knew we were in this for the long haul.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnQ8N1KacJc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CnQ8N1KacJc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Then came, if not decline, then some cooling off. The excellent Insomniac arrived in 1995 and struggled on account of not being Dookie. Nimrod followed in 1997; another strong collection of songs that became most notable for featuring a coda, the purely acoustic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=CnQ8N1KacJc\" title=\"\">Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)</a>, that suggested there might be more to Armstrong\u2019s songwriting than three chords and fuzz. The song soundtracked the Seinfeld finale and became a hit at US high school proms, its melancholy dovetailing with events that marked a passing of time. And yet by 2000\u2019s Warning, the mall had been relinquished to the nu-metal kids. Warning became the first release of Green Day\u2019s major-label career not to go multi-platinum. They wouldn\u2019t release an album for another four years.</p> <p>\u201cI find it hard between records thinking what I\u2019m going to write about,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cI get a lot of self-doubt.

      "bodyText": "Green Day are in their modest rehearsal space in their hometown of Oakland, California, a little haven in a country on the turn. The trio of 47-year-olds \u2013 still the world\u2019s biggest punk band \u2013 are posing for photos with singer-guitarist-songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong\u2019s prized Triumph motorcycle. Then someone remembers that the band\u2019s forthcoming Hella Mega Tour, alongside fellow alt-rock survivors Fall Out Boy and Weezer, is sponsored by Harley-Davidson. The Triumph is put back under its protective sheet. \u201cWelcome to Trump\u2019s America,\u201d sighs bassist Mike Dirnt when I tell him of my journey via San Francisco, where I was shocked to see so much desperate homelessness. \u201cA place where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Sadly, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything yet.\u201d The band own a number of Oakland businesses \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s important for us to do what we can to lift up our local area,\u201d Dirnt says \u2013 while Armstrong still goes on protests and attends local punk shows. Armstrong is a fan of new bands such as ShitKid, the Chats and White Reaper, though is often confused by what he sees. \u201cI\u2019ll see kids wearing leather jackets and a Grateful Dead T-shirt. How did that happen?\u201d Recently, he attended a show only to be confronted by a young punk with giant liberty-spiked hair, \u201clooking like he\u2019d just walked out of a squat\u201d, asking for a selfie on a brand-new iPhone. \u201cIt\u2019s cool and it\u2019s weird,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m just excited people are still doing cool shit.\u201d Green Day\u2019s new album is titled Father of All Motherfuckers and yet, surprisingly for a band best known for delivering 2004\u2019s George Bush-baiting rock opera American Idiot, they say Donald Trump had little influence on the new record. At the same time, they insist it is political. \u201cIt\u2019s all there in the songs,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cI\u2019m singing about \u2018looking out for the jingoes and heathens\u2019 or \u2018another black kid shot in town\u2019.\u201d There\u2019s a lyric about bulletproof backpacks designed as protection during school shootings, \u201cone of the most absurd ideas I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d. But Armstrong doesn\u2019t want to be on the nose. \u201cEverything that is happening in the world is right there on Twitter. It\u2019s so confusing and it\u2019s so depressing. I really wanted to create some kind of escape for people; I didn\u2019t want to be so obvious.\u201d Satirical punk site The Hard Times wrote a story the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration titled Future Green Day Concept Album Sworn Into Office. \u201cIt was funny, but I didn\u2019t want us to do that. It wasn\u2019t where our heads were at \u2013 at all.\u201d Where were your heads at? \u201cI was listening to Little Richard.\u201d He continues: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m ignoring it, it\u2019s just that the current political climate is something I just can\u2019t draw any inspiration from. I\u2019ve got tons of feelings about it. I think Trump is a piece of shit. I think [Senate majority leader] Mitch McConnell is pure evil. All they care about is looking after the rich and they don\u2019t care about the common people. But I find no inspiration there. It\u2019s so depressing. It\u2019s hard to dance when you can\u2019t get out of bed.\u201d \u201cAnd the world has become so divisive,\u201d says drummer and band goof Tr\u00e9 Cool. \u201cWe wanted to try to bring people together. It\u2019s become something of a far-out concept to love each other!\u201d This year the band will turn 34. No punk band has made it this far. The Sex Pistols lasted three years, the Clash 10, the Ramones 22. Green Day are writing the blueprint while living it, so it is no surprise that they have sometimes made mistakes. Last year Armstrong duetted with Morrissey on his covers album California Son \u2013 a terrible look in the wake of Morrissey\u2019s vocal support for far-right organisations and individuals. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware until the song came out,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cWe do the song, and he was very lovely, and then the song comes out and a lot of Brits were like: what the hell are you doing? I really did not have a clue \u2026 \u201d Bewitched by the singer\u2019s status as an 80s indie godhead, he simply failed in his due diligence. Cool pipes up, giggling: \u201cHey, we\u2019ve all got our Ted Nugents, right?\u201d \u2013 a reference to the US rocker and gun enthusiast. Green Day have endured major wobbles and are now in \u201cuncharted territory,\u201d as Armstrong puts it. \u201cPeople get over their high school bands. They don\u2019t go on to spend every day in their orbit for the next 20 years.\u201d After two records on the late, great East Bay punk imprint Lookout!, in 1994 the young band signed with major label Reprise. The punk scene was aghast. 924 Gilman Street, the puritanical Berkeley-based all-ages headquarters of said scene banned the group from performing. Green Day released Dookie in February of that year and it sold 20m copies. They wouldn\u2019t return to play Gilman Street until 2015. Old friends and fellow scenesters might not have wanted to talk to them any more, but everyone else did. Along with Smash, the third album by fellow Californians the Offspring (at 11m sales, the biggest-selling record on an independent label ever) and the rise to prominence of the Berkeley band Rancid, Dookie spearheaded an interest in American punk rock not seen since the birth of the New York CBGB scene 20 years earlier \u2013 but with the sales to match the cultural impact. \u201cWe were always thinking about legacy,\u201d Cool says. \u201cWe never wanted songs to sound like we\u2019d relied too much on whatever recording techniques were in vogue. We knew we were in this for the long haul.\u201d Then came, if not decline, then some cooling off. The excellent Insomniac arrived in 1995 and struggled on account of not being Dookie. Nimrod followed in 1997; another strong collection of songs that became most notable for featuring a coda, the purely acoustic Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), that suggested there might be more to Armstrong\u2019s songwriting than three chords and fuzz. The song soundtracked the Seinfeld finale and became a hit at US high school proms, its melancholy dovetailing with events that marked a passing of time. And yet by 2000\u2019s Warning, the mall had been relinquished to the nu-metal kids. Warning became the first release of Green Day\u2019s major-label career not to go multi-platinum. They wouldn\u2019t release an album for another four years. \u201cI find it hard between records thinking what I\u2019m going to write about,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cI get a lot of self-doubt. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever realistically thought the band might be done, but I have questioned whether I could do it any more.\u201d Green Day re-emerged amid war in the Middle East under Bush. Young people who might once have been fans were returning in body bags. \u201cSieg heil to the President Gasman,\u201d Armstrong sang on Holiday from the album American Idiot, and if punks weren\u2019t supposed to sign to major labels, they certainly weren\u2019t supposed to release double albums that became Broadway musicals. It sent them stratospheric and the weight of expectation since has never truly lifted: 2009\u2019s 21st Century Breakdown felt ordinary in the shadow of its predecessor; the release of three albums in a year \u2013 2012\u2019s \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos! and \u00a1Tr\u00e9! \u2013 favoured quantity over quality. An ill-fated festival appearance saw Armstrong, his set about to be cut short, destroy his guitar and rant: \u201cI\u2019m not Justin Bieber!\u201d He subsequently went into rehab for the abuse of alcohol and prescription pills. The band slunk into another period of near-irrelevance. They had emerged from the previous one with a genre-defying, generation-defining reboot \u2013 this time all they had was a good record, 2016\u2019s Revolution Radio.

At 26min 16sec, it is their shortest album, featuring a collection of songs as fast and furious as any in their discography.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s eight most prominent universities have dismissed media reports that they are planing to quarantine international students on regional campuses as a result of the federal government\u2019s travel ban. Since 1 February foreign nationals have been barred from entering Australia within 14 days of leaving China, as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak. On Friday, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Australian universities were \u201cdrawing up plans to quarantine thousands of international students\u201d on regional campuses or in student accommodation to reduce disruption to the start of semester. The University of Sydney\u2019s campus in Camden, 50km from its main site, was listed as a potential site. But Vicki Thompson, the chief executive of the Group of Eight (Go8), told Guardian Australia this was not under consideration by its universities. The Go8 comprises the University of Sydney, UNSW, ANU, the University of Melbourne, Monash, the University of Queensland, the University of Adelaide and the University of WA. A spokeswoman for the University of Sydney said it had \u201cno plans to use our Camden campus for isolation purposes\u201d. Under the current travel restrictions, any student who had left China and had been outside the country for 14 days without showing symptoms would not need to be further quarantined. International students contributed $34bn to the Australian economy last year, and the sector faces major losses from students cancelling enrolments. The travel ban has left nearly 100,000 Chinese students with valid visas stranded outside Australia, according to the latest figures from the Department of Home Affairs. Almost 59,000 Chinese international students are in Australia. As of Friday, there had been 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus across Australia, of which five people had recovered. Many universities have extended the deadline to enrol for the first semester, or to defer studies for a semester, or are offering online classes. On Thursday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told Radio National there \u201cmight be opportunities for some of the universities to provide quarantine for those Chinese students who are coming to Australia\u201d \u2013 but did not mention regional campuses. On Friday, the Go8 said it was implementing other measures to \u201cminimise the disruption to study\u201d. Thompson said where possible semester one programs could \u201cjoin seamlessly\u201d to semester two programs, especially for students close to completing their degrees. Monash University has pushed back the start date of the semester by a week, while more than 4,000 students at the University of Sydney signed a petition to delay theirs by a fortnight. The University of Sydney said it had arranged temporary accommodation for the \u201csmall number of students living in student accommodation that need to self-isolate\u201d. Financial analysts Moody\u2019s said on Friday that the financial hit of coronavirus and travel restrictions would be \u201cmanageable\u201d if it was contained within the next few months. But it noted that Australian universities were more dependent on international students from China than other OECD countries. Among the Go8, 60% of international student enrolments are from China, and they represent 40% across all universities. \u201cIf coronavirus is quickly contained \u2013 meaning within several months \u2013 the effect on Australian universities is likely to be manageable, with revenue deferred (not lost) and no change to credit quality,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. \u201cHowever, if the current outbreak is not contained quickly, the revenue effect and drawdown of cash reserves has the potential to be significant.\u201d The co-secretary of the NSW branch of the National Tertiary Education Union, Michael Thomson, said academics and teachers were worried by universities\u2019 confusing responses to the ban. \u201cThere is concern that university authorities are not being completely clear about what is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cPutting something back two weeks \u2013 does that mean a 13-week semester becomes an 11-week semester? \u201cIn a sense the concern is the unknown. It\u2019s almost like policy is being made on the hop.\u201d On Friday, the NSW NTEU and the University of Sydney\u2019s student representative council organised a protest against the travel ban. SRC president Liam Donohoe said earlier in the week the travel ban went against the advice of the World Health Organisation and led to international students \u201closing out on learning, work, relationships and communities\u201d to the extent that they \u201cmay never return\u201d.",

The central commission for discipline inspection, the Communist party\u2019s powerful internal anti-corruption body, and the national supervisory commission, the country\u2019s highest anti-corruption agency, issued a one-sentence statement on their joint website that investigators will be sent to Wuhan to carry out \u201ca comprehensive investigation into the problems reported by the public concerning Doctor Li Wenliang\u201d.</p> <p>Fearing that the uproar over Li\u2019s death could spill over onto the streets, the authorities quickly deleted posts calling for action.

      "bodyText": "The death of a whistleblowing Chinese doctor who was punished for trying to raise the alarm about coronavirus has sparked an explosion of anger, grief and demands for freedom of speech among ordinary Chinese. Li Wenliang, 34, died in the early hours of Friday local time after he was infected during the fight against the outbreak, said Wuhan central hospital, where he worked, in a statement. Li warned colleagues on social media in late December about a mysterious virus that would become the coronavirus epidemic and was detained by police in Wuhan on 3 January for \u201cspreading false rumours\u201d. He was forced to sign a police document to admit he had breached the law and had \u201cseriously disrupted social order.\u201d \u201cThey owe you an apology, we owe you our gratitude. Take care, Dr Li,\u201d said a Weibo post from Xiakedao, an account under the overseas edition of Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily. \u201cGood people don\u2019t live long, but evil lives for a thousand years,\u201d said another post mourning Li\u2019s death, with a candle emoji. An image also posted on Weibo showed a message, \u201cfarewell Li Wenliang\u201d, carved into the snow on a riverbank in Beijing. His death crystallised the outrage and frustration felt across China over the initial cover-up of the deadly virus. On Friday, China\u2019s social media was awash with posts expressing immense anger and grief. Li\u2019s death became the top-read topic on China\u2019s microblogging site Weibo overnight on Friday, with more than 1.5bn views, and was also heavily discussed in private WeChat messaging groups, where people expressed outrage and sadness. Even blog posts from state media outlets mourned his death and issued veiled attacks on the Wuhan authorities who censured him. The strong public reaction appeared to have drawn the top leadership\u2019s attention. The central commission for discipline inspection, the Communist party\u2019s powerful internal anti-corruption body, and the national supervisory commission, the country\u2019s highest anti-corruption agency, issued a one-sentence statement on their joint website that investigators will be sent to Wuhan to carry out \u201ca comprehensive investigation into the problems reported by the public concerning Doctor Li Wenliang\u201d. Fearing that the uproar over Li\u2019s death could spill over onto the streets, the authorities quickly deleted posts calling for action. A post forwarded on Wechat but now deleted said: \u201cI hope one day we can stand on the street holding Li Wenliang\u2019s picture.\u201d In Li\u2019s last blog post on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like microblog, on 1 February, Li poignantly wrote: \u201cThe test results come out positive today. Everything is settled. It is confirmed.\u201d Li was one of eight people who were detained for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d about the deadly disease\u2019s outbreak \u2013 the fates of the other seven, also believed to be medical professionals, are not known. Images of Li were ubiquitous on Weibo and messaging app WeChat; a last photo of him lying on his hospital bed wearing a breathing mask; a pencil sketch of Li; a photo of the humiliating police warning document on which he signed \u201cI understand\u201d to admit \u201cspreading false rumours\u201d along with images of candles and white flower. Many posts referenced his \u201cconfession\u201d, with people posting photos of themselves wearing surgical masks emblazoned with the words: \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d. Others swore \u201cWe will not forget\u201d. The outpouring of grief quickly turned into demands for freedom of speech, but those posts were swiftly censored by China\u2019s cyber police. The trending topic \u201c#we want freedom of speech\u201d had nearly 2m views on Weibo by 5am local time, but was later deleted. The phrase \u201c#Wuhan government owes Dr Li Wenliang an apology\u201d also attracted tens of thousands of views before it too disappeared. Caixin, a Beijing-based financial publication, posted a black-and-white selfie of Li wearing a mask with the title \u201cA healthy society shouldn\u2019t have just just one voice: Novel Coronavirus whistleblower Li Wenliang dies\u201d. In its Weibo post, the Economic Observer, a state-affiliated financial newspaper, demanded the vindication of all of the Wuhan \u201crumour mongers\u201d. \u201cDr Li is telling us [through his death] what kind of future we will face if we lose the ability to express ourselves. In the eyes of the people, Dr Li was the hero who bravely told the truth,\u201d the post said. \u201cWuhan [authorities] should vindicate them and pursue those who abused their powers to suppress the \u2018rumour mongers\u2019.\u201d Elsewhere, posts from ordinary Chinese people continue to direct their outrage towards the authorities. \u201cYou and I both know that the ones who killed were not bats,\u201d said one. \u201cThe virus has infiltrated those people high up,\u201d said another. \u201cThose who won\u2019t let you speak won\u2019t let you live either,\u201d fumed another. Johnny Lau, a veteran China watcher and former journalist at Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po, said Li\u2019s death has become an emotional flashpoint amid the tight control of speech under Xi Jinping\u2019s rule. \u201cHere is a doctor with a conscience \u2026 people on the frontline have been sacrificed but the officials have not been held to account,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an example of how evil has triumphed over the good.\u201d He said the quick deletion of posts demanding speech freedom has aroused further anger. \u201cThe authorities are anxious that his death would trigger a huge wave of anger, so felt the need to maintain stability and suppress people\u2019s voices,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this has aroused further pushback.\u201d Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst and China Media Bulletin Director at Freedom House, said the public outcry over Li looked \u201cwidespread and unified\u201d, but it still unclear how big a turning point it could be. As many inside China seethed, the death toll inside the country passed 630, with more then 31,000 people infected. Another 41 people on a cruise ship quarantined off Yokohama in Japan tested positive for the virus. Australia became the latest country to advise any citizens inside China to leave as soon as possible. On Friday, North Korea recorded its first confirmed case of the virus.

As one wag put it in a letter to the Irish Times: \u201cHave Leo and Miche\u00e1l met their Mary Lou?\u201d</p> <p>In Cabra, a working-class area of McDonald\u2019s Dublin Central constituency, many root for her to shake up what they consider an an ossified party duopoly past its expiry date.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She\u2019s better than any of the men. She really fights. I love the way she talks to people</p> <footer> <cite>Ann Smith</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe\u2019s better than any of the men,\u201d said Ann Smith, 75, a grandmother out walking her dog. \u201cShe really fights. I love the way she talks to people, especially the men. She\u2019s well able for them.\u201d</p> <p>For a movement that dates from the 1916 Easter Rising it is quite an arc: a succession of leaders with a whiff of sulphur culminating in a mother-of-two who studied English literature at Trinity College Dublin.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s very bright, articulate, self-confident and a good debater,\u201d said Deagl\u00e1n de Br\u00e9ad\u00fan, the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Play-Rise-Modern-Sinn/dp/1785370316\">Power Play: The Rise of Modern Sinn F\u00e9in</a>. \u201cI\u2019d say Sinn F\u00e9in couldn\u2019t believe their luck when she joined. She\u2019s such a good performer on radio and TV and it\u2019s probably a help with southern voters that she doesn\u2019t have a northern accent. All in all, it\u2019s very hard for her political opponents to pick holes in her image.\u201d</p> <p>Talk of seismic breakthrough may be overdone. McDonald is not about to become taoiseach. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s results traditionally underperform opinion polls. The party fielded just 42 candidates for the 160-seat D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament, so will not fully translate support into seats.</p> <p>Analysts expect Fianna F\u00e1il to win about 50 to 55 seats, Fine Gael perhaps 35, and Sinn F\u00e9in 26 or at most 30. The two establishment parties have ruled out forming a coalition government with Sinn F\u00e9in, but it may yet play kingmaker.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not revolution, it\u2019s evolution,\u201d said Dr Theresa Reidy, a political scientist and election expert at University College Cork. \u201cFor Sinn Fein it\u2019s more about consolidation.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, McDonald finds herself leading a remarkable turnaround. A party Irish voters used to shun as radioactive, an off-putting mix of Northern Ireland accents and Troubles vibes, has overtaken leftwing rivals and established itself as a voice for those who view Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael as the Tweedledum/Tweedledee stasis.</p> <p>McDonald grew up in Rathgar, a middle-class suburb of Dublin, and attended a Catholic school, Notre Dame des Missions, before studying Sylvia Plath and metaphysical poets at Trinity, formerly a Protestant bastion.</p> <p>She worked as a researcher at the Institute of International and European Affairs, a thinktank, before joining Fianna F\u00e1il, the party of her parents, before switching to Sinn F\u00e9in in 1999, a year after the Good Friday agreement.</p> <p>One version says she left because a Fianna F\u00e1il bigwig stymied her advancement. McDonald\u2019s version is she wanted a better fit for her principles about social justice and Irish unity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She\u2019s very bright, articulate, self-confident, a good debater. Sinn F\u00e9in couldn\u2019t believe their luck when she joined</p> <footer> <cite>Deagl\u00e1n de Br\u00e9ad\u00fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not lacking in political ambition but has fully converted to Sinn F\u00e9in ideology. You don\u2019t thrive in that party without buying into its Irish republican mindset,\u201d said De Br\u00e9ad\u00fan.</p> <p>The party fast-tracked McDonald up the ranks: an MEP in 2004, a TD (MP) in 2011, then succeeding Adams as party leader in 2018. She praised him as her \u201cpolitical mentor\u201d and ended a speech with \u201ctiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1\u201d.</p> <p>McDonald can be \u201cwooly\u201d on detail but speaks with a passion that distinguishes Sinn F\u00e9in from other parties, said Reidy, the professor.</p> <p>Voters at first seemed unmoved. They abandoned Sinn F\u00e9in in a 2018 presidential election and in 2019 council and European parliamentary elections. The party braced for more losses in the general election, so fielded few candidates. Then the poll numbers started rising \u2013 and rising.</p> <p>The economy hums at near full-employment but voters are fatigued with the Fine Gael-led government, which was propped up by Fianna F\u00e1il, and angry at hospital bed shortages and soaring rents. McDonald, ably supported by party colleagues Pearse Doherty and Eoin \u00d3 Broin, has cast Sinn F\u00e9in as a vehicle for change.</p> <p>The party keenest on unification paradoxically benefitted from voter indifference towards Northern Ireland. Barely a blip in the campaign, it let Sinn F\u00e9in focus on bread-and-butter issues.</p> <p>That changed this week when a notorious 2007 murder returned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/05/conor-murphy-paul-quinn-comments-calls-for-sinn-fein-minister-to-be-sacked\">haunt the party</a>, forcing McDonald to revisit Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s links with the IRA since the Troubles.</p> <p>Some voters recoiled. \u201cToo many unanswered questions,\u201d said Michelle Walsh, 51, a Dublin Central constituent who does not plan to vote for McDonald.</p> <p>Claire Beatty, 45, another constituent, said history had \u201cleaked\u201d out but that McDonald\u2019s party still represented change. \u201cThe past has stuck with them but people are being left with no alternative.\u201d</p>",

The IRA slogan \u201ctiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1\u201d means \u201cour day will come\u201d, but not even Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 the terrorism group\u2019s political wing during the Troubles \u2013 anticipated the surge. It has captured a mood for change and wrongfooted Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, and Miche\u00e1l Martin, the leader of Fianna F\u00e1il. At the core stands McDonald, 50, the personable Dubliner who succeeded Gerry Adams and may turn Sinn F\u00e9in into a party of government. As one wag put it in a letter to the Irish Times: \u201cHave Leo and Miche\u00e1l met their Mary Lou?\u201d In Cabra, a working-class area of McDonald\u2019s Dublin Central constituency, many root for her to shake up what they consider an an ossified party duopoly past its expiry date. \u201cShe\u2019s better than any of the men,\u201d said Ann Smith, 75, a grandmother out walking her dog. \u201cShe really fights. I love the way she talks to people, especially the men. She\u2019s well able for them.\u201d For a movement that dates from the 1916 Easter Rising it is quite an arc: a succession of leaders with a whiff of sulphur culminating in a mother-of-two who studied English literature at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cShe\u2019s very bright, articulate, self-confident and a good debater,\u201d said Deagl\u00e1n de Br\u00e9ad\u00fan, the author of Power Play: The Rise of Modern Sinn F\u00e9in. \u201cI\u2019d say Sinn F\u00e9in couldn\u2019t believe their luck when she joined. She\u2019s such a good performer on radio and TV and it\u2019s probably a help with southern voters that she doesn\u2019t have a northern accent. All in all, it\u2019s very hard for her political opponents to pick holes in her image.\u201d Talk of seismic breakthrough may be overdone. McDonald is not about to become taoiseach. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s results traditionally underperform opinion polls. The party fielded just 42 candidates for the 160-seat D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament, so will not fully translate support into seats. Analysts expect Fianna F\u00e1il to win about 50 to 55 seats, Fine Gael perhaps 35, and Sinn F\u00e9in 26 or at most 30. The two establishment parties have ruled out forming a coalition government with Sinn F\u00e9in, but it may yet play kingmaker. \u201cIt\u2019s not revolution, it\u2019s evolution,\u201d said Dr Theresa Reidy, a political scientist and election expert at University College Cork. \u201cFor Sinn Fein it\u2019s more about consolidation.\u201d Even so, McDonald finds herself leading a remarkable turnaround. A party Irish voters used to shun as radioactive, an off-putting mix of Northern Ireland accents and Troubles vibes, has overtaken leftwing rivals and established itself as a voice for those who view Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael as the Tweedledum/Tweedledee stasis. McDonald grew up in Rathgar, a middle-class suburb of Dublin, and attended a Catholic school, Notre Dame des Missions, before studying Sylvia Plath and metaphysical poets at Trinity, formerly a Protestant bastion. She worked as a researcher at the Institute of International and European Affairs, a thinktank, before joining Fianna F\u00e1il, the party of her parents, before switching to Sinn F\u00e9in in 1999, a year after the Good Friday agreement. One version says she left because a Fianna F\u00e1il bigwig stymied her advancement. McDonald\u2019s version is she wanted a better fit for her principles about social justice and Irish unity. \u201cShe\u2019s not lacking in political ambition but has fully converted to Sinn F\u00e9in ideology. You don\u2019t thrive in that party without buying into its Irish republican mindset,\u201d said De Br\u00e9ad\u00fan. The party fast-tracked McDonald up the ranks: an MEP in 2004, a TD (MP) in 2011, then succeeding Adams as party leader in 2018. She praised him as her \u201cpolitical mentor\u201d and ended a speech with \u201ctiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1\u201d. McDonald can be \u201cwooly\u201d on detail but speaks with a passion that distinguishes Sinn F\u00e9in from other parties, said Reidy, the professor. Voters at first seemed unmoved. They abandoned Sinn F\u00e9in in a 2018 presidential election and in 2019 council and European parliamentary elections. The party braced for more losses in the general election, so fielded few candidates. Then the poll numbers started rising \u2013 and rising. The economy hums at near full-employment but voters are fatigued with the Fine Gael-led government, which was propped up by Fianna F\u00e1il, and angry at hospital bed shortages and soaring rents. McDonald, ably supported by party colleagues Pearse Doherty and Eoin \u00d3 Broin, has cast Sinn F\u00e9in as a vehicle for change. The party keenest on unification paradoxically benefitted from voter indifference towards Northern Ireland. Barely a blip in the campaign, it let Sinn F\u00e9in focus on bread-and-butter issues. That changed this week when a notorious 2007 murder returned to haunt the party, forcing McDonald to revisit Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s links with the IRA since the Troubles. Some voters recoiled. \u201cToo many unanswered questions,\u201d said Michelle Walsh, 51, a Dublin Central constituent who does not plan to vote for McDonald. Claire Beatty, 45, another constituent, said history had \u201cleaked\u201d out but that McDonald\u2019s party still represented change. \u201cThe past has stuck with them but people are being left with no alternative.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A second Qantas coronavirus evacuation flight is scheduled to fly overnight on Friday to rescue more Australians from virus-hit Wuhan and take them to a quarantine site outside Darwin. On Friday the flight was still awaiting final approval from Chinese authorities to take people out of the locked down city in China\u2019s central Hubei province, but preparations were being made for Australians to leave for the new quarantine centre rather than Christmas Island, where the first Qantas evacuees were taken. Scott Morrison confirmed on Friday that a vacated former construction workers\u2019 village outside Darwin will be used as quarantine site for the evacuees. Australian citizens and permanent residents in Wuhan who have been approved for the flight have been told they must make their own way to the airport. Check-in for the flight was due to open just after 6pm Wuhan time on Friday. The flight was scheduled to leave just after midnight. In correspondence from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, passengers have been told: \u201cPlease allow sufficient time to arrive at the airport noting there will be a number of checkpoints en route. We are aware that there may be long delays at the checkpoint. \u201cAs a reminder you need to meet both Chinese and Australian government conditions, you will be subject to immigration checks by both governments.\u201d The flight is likely to be the last charter the Australian government is able to organise to leave Wuhan. Speaking in Townsville, Morrison said: \u201cWe will be moving to the contingency plans for overflow that we have been working on \u2026 we will be using a mining camp facility in the Northern Territory near Darwin and we are working through the consultation phase with local community and others about the implications of those arrangements.\u201d When the Australian government\u2019s initial charter flight, which left Wuhan Monday, was first announced, some Australians chose to stay in the city, preferring to wait for the outbreak to subside, but as it has spread and intensified, many are now taking the chance to leave. Globally, the outbreak has infected more than 31,000 people and killed 636, the vast majority of those in Hubei province. The first Qantas flight evacuated 243 Australian citizens and permanent residents to Christmas Island on Monday. Thirty-six Australians who left Wuhan on a NZ-government chartered flight on Wednesday were also eventually taken to Christmas Island. The second Australian flight appeared to be over-subscribed, the foreign affairs department said. \u201cThe number of people wanting to secure their return to Australia is far more than there are seats available on the flight.\u201d Some Australians in Wuhan approved for the flight are already making plans for the unpredictable journey through police and military checkpoints to reach the airport. Identification checks are being carried out up to three kilometres from the airport. On previous international evacuation flights, some passengers have not been able to reach the airport. Others have been refused boarding at final medical screenings. \u201cIf someone in your family has a fever or other symptoms, we advise they consider their options before they leave home,\u201d Dfat has advised. \u201cIf a fever is detected at a checkpoint it is possible they will be directed to a Chinese medical facility and not allowed to board the flight. The Chinese authorities consider 37.3 degrees temperature as the point you will require medical assistance.\u201d Passengers have been warned to expect long delays. \u201cThere are limited facilities at the airport.

Restaurants and shops are closed at check-in and inside the terminal. \u201cWe recommend you bring some food provisions for you and your families at the airport to last you up to 10 hours. You will not be able to take food on the plane.\u201d Nearly 280 Australians are currently being held in isolation inside the Christmas Island immigration detention centre. The centre can house more than 1000 people, but because of the medical necessity to isolate coronavirus evacuees from each other, as well as the general community, to minimise the impact of any possible outbreak, the capacity of the centre is significantly reduced. The government\u2019s preference \u2013 advised by doctors managing the cohort on Christmas Island \u2013 was for a second quarantine facility elsewhere. The Manigurr-ma village, 30km outside Darwin, was built in 2012 by Japanese energy giant Inpex as accommodation for its workers. At the peak of construction work on Inpex\u2019s $55b gas plant on Darwin Harbour it housed around 3,500 workers. One student from the Good Shepherd Lutheran College, which shares a fence with the mining village, told Guardian Australia students were worried about being potentially so close to the infectious virus. The village has a medical centre, industrial kitchen, dining hall, cinema, library, gym and swimming pool. It was handed over to the NT government, on a peppercorn rent, in 2019. NT chief minister Michael Gunner confirmed he had had discussions with the federal government about using the facility as a quarantine site. \u201cObviously we are happy to help to make sure Australians are looked after,\u201d he said. \u201cOur priority in any of those conversations will be how do we make sure Territorians remain safe and healthy.\u201d Gunner said the federal government\u2019s now-defunct Wickham Point immigration detention centre could also be repurposed to house evacuees.",

      "bodyText": "The British government has changed the policy of flying flags on royal birthdays, with local authorities no longer required to raise the Union Flag for Prince Andrew. Officials earlier said they were considering how the policy applied \u201cin changing circumstances, such as when members of the royal family step back from their duties\u201d, according to a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The government later said it would be advising councils \u201cthat there is no requirement to fly flags on the 19th February following the decision by the Duke of York to step back from public duties for the foreseeable future\u201d. The Sun newspaper had published a leaked email sent to local authorities reminding them to fly the British flag for Andrew\u2019s 60th birthday on 19 February. The Queen\u2019s second son withdrew from public life and royal duties after a disastrous television interview defending his friendship with the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Flying flags on government buildings in his honour \u201cwould be wholly inappropriate\u201d, Labour MP Wes Streeting told the newspaper. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the email, sent by a civil servant in the local government ministry, was an \u201cadministrative email about long-standing policy\u201d. He said discussions were under way between the ministry and the royal household about a change. Designated days for flying the British flag on UK government buildings include the birthdays of the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, their wedding day, the birthdays of their four children and of their grandson Prince William and his wife Kate. Andrew has strenuously denied claims he had sex with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, who was procured by Epstein, a financier found dead in prison in August last year while awaiting charges of trafficking minors. But there was a public outcry after the prince gave a BBC interview in November, where he failed to adequately explain why he did not cut off ties with his friend earlier, or express much empathy with Epstein\u2019s alleged victims. A US prosecutor said last month Andrew had provided \u201czero co-operation\u201d to the investigation into Epstein\u2019s activities. On Thursday Buckingham Palace said the Duke of York had asked to defer a military promotion to Admiral until he is able to fully resume royal duties. \u201cBy convention, the Duke of York would be in line for military promotion on his 60th birthday,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cFollowing the decision by His Royal Highness to step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, the Duke of York has asked the Ministry of Defence if this promotion might be deferred until such time that His Royal Highness returns to public duty.\u201d A spokeswoman for Westminster Abbey said the Duke\u2019s birthday would still be marked by the traditional ringing of bells. \u201cThere are no plans to change these arrangements,\u201d she said.

Appearing before the House of Representatives economics committee in Canberra on Friday, Lowe said China\u2019s economy was now much bigger and more integrated into the world economy. \u201cOur links with China are much more extensive than they were, the Chinese population is much more mobile than it was in 2003 and the Chinese economy in 2003 was growing very strongly. \u201cIt took a hit of 2% in one quarter but bounced back quickly. Growth now is slower and the capacity to bounce back and have stimulus measures isn\u2019t as great.\u201d He said the response of Chinese authorities in stopping people moving around China was also greater than during the Sars epidemic. \u201cSo the interruption to normal life in China is much bigger than in Sars,\u201d he said. He agreed with committee chair, Liberal MP Tim Wilson, that coronavirus was likely to have a greater impact on the Australian economy than Sars.

This was needed to get wages moving again and inflation back up into the RBA\u2019s target band of between 2% and 3%. He said he did not have a \u201ccrystal ball\u201d on the outlook for inflation, but assured committee members the central bank won\u2019t be raising interest rates until inflation is consistently within the target band. Inflation has consistently fallen short of the 2-3% target band, and is one factor why the cash rate is at a record low of 0.75%. The consumer price index was 1.8% at the end of 2019. \u201cWe will not be raising interest rates until we are very confident that inflation is sustainably in the two to three per cent range,\u201d Lowe told the House of Representatives economic committee in Canberra on Friday.

But a handful of states hold caucuses \u2013 complicated, hours-long meetings, which continue until one candidate emerges as victor. And the process is different for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>How do the Democratic caucuses work and why are they important?</strong></h2> \n<p>Iowans aged 18 and over who are registered with the party will gather in caucus venues such as school gyms and churches in their designated precinct. They start voting publicly at 7pm CT (8pm ET) by splitting into groups based on their preferred candidate. <br><br>Voters have to go and stand in the area where their candidate is represented. So <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> supporters would be in one corner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a> in another and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders </a>supporters in another. Everyone is tallied.</p> \n<p>If a particular candidate does not attract 15% of total voters present, they are taken off the ballot, and their voters are free to throw their weight behind another candidate.<br><br>Once voting is over at a caucus site, the support for viable candidates (those with more than 15% of the votes) is translated into a number of \u201cstate delegate equivalents\u201d. That result is used to calculate the number of national delegates each candidate receives. National delegates eventually choose the nominee at the Democratic convention in July.<br><br>On the night of the caucuses, the candidate with the most SDEs is considered the winner.</p> \n<h2><strong>How do the Republican caucuses work?</strong></h2> \n<p>With all the attention being paid to the Democratic side, it is easy to forget that there is a Republican primary happening, too.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> is facing challenges from the former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld and former US representative Joe Walsh, but it\u2019s extremely unlikely that they, or the others (according to the Federal Election Commission, 153 people are running for president as Republicans) will win against the president.</p> \n<p>In the Iowa Republican caucus, people still have to physically show up at a location. They then cast a straightforward vote, secretly. The votes are tallied up, and the delegates are dished out in the same manner. </p> \n<p>In the Republican caucuses, there is no 15% threshold, meaning candidates with relatively little support could still pick up delegates.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Iowa voters kicked off the long process of choosing the Democratic and Republican party\u2019s presidential nominees Monday, ahead of the November election. Following a shock delay, the first partial results were released on Tuesday and continued to trickle in through Wednesday and Thursday. The Associated Press said it was unable to declare a winner Thursday evening. *Election results source: Associated Press What is a caucus and how is it different to a primary? Most US states hold primary elections, in which voters go to a polling place, mail in their ballots or otherwise vote remotely. But a handful of states hold caucuses \u2013 complicated, hours-long meetings, which continue until one candidate emerges as victor. And the process is different for Democrats and Republicans. How do the Democratic caucuses work and why are they important? Iowans aged 18 and over who are registered with the party will gather in caucus venues such as school gyms and churches in their designated precinct. They start voting publicly at 7pm CT (8pm ET) by splitting into groups based on their preferred candidate. Voters have to go and stand in the area where their candidate is represented. So Joe Biden supporters would be in one corner, Elizabeth Warren in another and Bernie Sanders supporters in another. Everyone is tallied. If a particular candidate does not attract 15% of total voters present, they are taken off the ballot, and their voters are free to throw their weight behind another candidate. Once voting is over at a caucus site, the support for viable candidates (those with more than 15% of the votes) is translated into a number of \u201cstate delegate equivalents\u201d. That result is used to calculate the number of national delegates each candidate receives. National delegates eventually choose the nominee at the Democratic convention in July. On the night of the caucuses, the candidate with the most SDEs is considered the winner. How do the Republican caucuses work? With all the attention being paid to the Democratic side, it is easy to forget that there is a Republican primary happening, too. Trump is facing challenges from the former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld and former US representative Joe Walsh, but it\u2019s extremely unlikely that they, or the others (according to the Federal Election Commission, 153 people are running for president as Republicans) will win against the president. In the Iowa Republican caucus, people still have to physically show up at a location. They then cast a straightforward vote, secretly. The votes are tallied up, and the delegates are dished out in the same manner. In the Republican caucuses, there is no 15% threshold, meaning candidates with relatively little support could still pick up delegates.",

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Friday\u2019s blog: The White House confirmed the killing of Qassim al-Rimi, an al-Qaida leader who claimed responsibility for last year\u2019s deadly shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Trump celebrated his acquittal with a triumphant, profane speech at the White House this morning. \u201cIt was all bullshit,\u201d the president said. Earlier while, speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump attacked the faith of House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mitt Romney, the only Republican senator who voted to convict the president. The Treasury Department is reportedly complying with Republicans\u2019 investigation based on a conspiracy theory about Hunter Biden and Ukraine interference in the 2016 elections, in sharp contrast with the Trump administration\u2019s stonewalling of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation. Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are nearly tied in the Iowa caucuses. With 97% of precincts reporting, the AP has said the race is still too close to call. Amidst fresh claims of reporting inconsistencies and technical issues, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez called for a \u201crecanvass\u201d of the tally . in Iowa. Ahead of the New Hampshire debate tomorrow, candidates are participating in a CNN town hall. Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer spoke yesterday. Bernie Sander\u2019s has kicked off the town tall today. Both Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders have claimed victory in Iowa, even as technical delays and reporting issues have prolonged the delay in tallying the Democratic caucus votes. Sanders has touted his raw vote tally; Buttigieg holds a narrow lead in the number of state delegate equivalents he\u2019s amassed. Both candidates will be speaking tonight in a CNN town hall ahead of the New Hampshire primary contest next week. Deval Patrick and Amy Klobuchar will be participating as well, answering questions from supporters and network hosts. Yesterday, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang, and Tom Steyer had a turn to make their case, during the first half of the town hall. And tomorrow, all the candidates (except for Patrick, who didn\u2019t qualify) will face off directly during the New Hampshire Democratic debate. Several women of color have reportedly left Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Nevada campaign, complaining of a work environment that tokenizes minorities, Politico reports. The six staffers have left the roughly 70-person Nevada team since November, during a critical stretch of the race. Three of them said they felt marginalized by the campaign, a situation they said didn\u2019t change or worsened after they took their concerns to their superiors or to human resources staff. \u201cDuring the time I was employed with Nevada for Warren, there was definitely something wrong with the culture,\u201d said Megan Lewis, a field organizer who joined the campaign in May and departed in December. \u201cI filed a complaint with HR, but the follow-up I received left me feeling as though I needed to make myself smaller or change who I was to fit into the office culture.\u201d Another recently departed staffer, also a field organizer, granted anonymity because she feared reprisal, echoed that sentiment. \u201cI felt like a problem \u2014 like I was there to literally bring color into the space but not the knowledge and voice that comes with it,\u201d she said in an interview. The staff departures come at a crucial time for Warren\u2019s campaign, ahead of the Nevada caucuses this month. Responding to the report, Warren apologized. \u201cFor me this is about taking personal responsibility which I do and being determined that we will have accountability in this organization and keep doing better every day,\u201d she said in an interview with WBTS. With 97% of precincts reporting, Pete Buttigieg is in the lead, with Bernie Sanders trailing by three state delegate equivalents \u2014 a margin of .14 percentage points. State officials have yet to count results from some satellite caucus sites, which could push reorder the leading candidates. Earlier today, the Democratic National Committee\u2019s chairman Tom Perez called for an \u201cimmediate recanvass\u201d of the tally, following a days-long delay due in part to problems with a mobile app that the state\u2019s Democratic party used to could votes. \u201cThe Associated Press calls a race when there is a clear indication of a winner. Because of a tight margin between former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders and the irregularities in this year\u2019s caucus process, it is not possible to determine a winner at this point,\u201d said Sally Buzbee, the AP\u2019s executive editor. The Trump administration has confirmed reports that it carried out a strike against the leader of Al Qaida\u2019s affiliate in Yemen, known as Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). In a series of tweets on Saturday, the president appeared to verify reports that the US had killed Qassim al-Rimi, the group\u2019s leader but the Department of Defense officials would not offer confirmation. The United States, our interests, and our allies are safer as a result of his death,\u2019 the White House said in a statement. \u201c We will continue to protect the American people by tracking down and eliminating terrorists who seek to do us harm. Background on Rimi the Guardian\u2019s earlier report: Rimi reportedly became leader of AQAP following a 2015 drone strike that killed Nasir al-Wuhayshi. In 2017, days after a special forces raid on a compound in Yemen in which a US soldier was killed, Rimi taunted Trump, saying in a recorded message: \u201cThe new fool of the White House received a painful slap across his face.\u201d In an attempt to prevent al-Qaida from establishing a secure base in Yemen, the US recorded 131 strikes there in 2017 but only 36 in 2018. In that year, US officials said a CIA drone strike killed Ibrahim al-Asiri, a senior al-Qaida bomb maker behind the \u201cunderwear bomb\u201d attempt on a flight on Christmas Day in 2009. In January last year, a US strike killed Jamal al-Badawi, an al-Qaida operative linked to the 2000 attack on the USS Cole while it was being refuelled in Aden. Report: Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign plagiarized policy plans The former New York mayor and billionaire businessman\u2019s presidential campaign appears to have lifted exact passages and fact sheets from media outlets and non-profit groups, The Intercept reports: Mike Bloomberg\u2019s presidential campaign plagiarized portions of its plans for maternal health, LGBTQ equality, the economy, tax policy, infrastructure, and mental health from research publications, media outlets, and a number of nonprofit, educational, and policy groups. The Intercept found that exact passages from at least eight Bloomberg plans or accompanying fact sheets were direct copies of material from media outlets including CNN, Time, and CBS, a research center at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, the American Medical Association, Everytown for Gun Safety, Building America\u2019s Future Educational Fund, and other organizations. Bloomberg co-founded Everytown for Gun Safety, a political organization focused on gun control, and Building America\u2019s Future Educational Fund, a nonprofit working on infrastructure investment and reform, and has chaired them in the past, and he was listed as a co-author on the educational fund\u2019s reports. He is not clearly affiliated with the other sources. The plagiarized sections ranged in length from entire paragraphs to individual sentences and fragments in documents that were between five and 14 pages long. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio \u2013 a close ally of Donald Trump \u2013 has been named the new ranking member of the House judiciary committee, replaying Doug Collins of Georgia. Collins has stepped down so he can challenge Senator Kelly Loeffler for her seat, according to reports. Jordan is the founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. During the impeachment inquiry, he was temporarily added to the House intelligence committee. He was noted for his auctioneer intonation and aggressive questioning-style and became the president\u2019s chief defender throughout the impeachment. When William Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, testified before lawmakers, Jordan asked, in his characteristic style, \u201cYou\u2019re their first witness? You\u2019re the guy? I\u2019ve seen church prayer chains that are easier to understand than this.\u201d A former wrestler, Jordan faced allegations last year that he ignored sexual misconduct during his time as a wrestling coach at Ohio State University. Republican Mark Meadows \u2013 another staunch Trump supporter \u2013 will take over Jordan\u2019s post as ranking member of the House oversight committee. The treasury department is complying with Republicans\u2019 request for information as part of an investigation into Hunter Biden and his business in Ukraine. The Republican senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson requested information from the department in November as part of their investigation into \u201cpotentially improper actions\u201d during the Obama administration. The department\u2019s compliance, in this case, stands in sharp contrasts to the Trump administration\u2019s stonewalling of Democrats\u2019 requests for information during the impeachment investigation. Grassley and Johnson are looking into Hunter Biden\u2019s business affairs and Ukrainian officials\u2019 alleged interventions in the 2016 election, which is exactly what Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani tried to push Ukrainian officials to investigate. Per Yahoo News, which first reported the story: The \u201crapid\u201d production of sensitive financial information from the Treasury Department in response to congressional requests is apparently uncommon. A source familiar with the matter said the Treasury began turning over materials less than two months after Grassley and Johnson wrote to FinCEN on Nov. 15, 2019, requesting any SARs and related documents filed by financial institutions regarding Hunter Biden, his associates, their businesses and clients. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Donald Trump delivered a divisive, profane and unapologetic response to his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial, as Republicans continue to insist the president has learned a lesson from the process. Speaking earlier today at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump attacked the faith of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Mitt Romney, the only Republican senator to support an article of impeachment. The Democratic National Committee chair, Tom Perez, called for a recanvass of the Iowa caucuses to ensure the accuracy of the results. Bernie Sanders declared victory in the Iowa caucuses, even though results currently show him slightly trailing Pete Buttigieg. House Democrats killed a Republican resolution to condemn Pelosi for tearing up Trump\u2019s State of the Union address on Tuesday night. During her weekly press conference, Pelosi said she did not regret tearing up Trump\u2019s speech. \u201cI tore up a manifesto of mistruths,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIt was necessary to get the attention of the American people to say, \u2018This is not true.\u2019\u201d Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. After declaring victory in the Iowa caucuses despite trailing Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders said the raw vote total, or the \u201cpopular vote,\u201d justified his announcement. But as the blog has previously stated, the Associated Press and other outlets made clear before the caucuses that the winner would be determined using a different metric, the state delegate equivalents. On that front, Sanders is very slightly behind Buttigieg. \u201cThe rules were changed,\u201d Sanders told CNN. \u201cThis is the first time in the Iowa caucus that the popular vote has been made public. That was not the case before.\u201d Sanders blamed some \u201cconfusion on the part of the media\u201d for the focus on SDEs, even though that is the officially recognized metric for determining a winner, and noted he and Buttigieg would likely come out of Iowa with the same number of delegates for the party\u2019s nominating convention, which is true. The White House is now reportedly sending out talking points aimed at criticizing Mitt Romney after the Republican senator supported one of the articles of impeachment. The idea of attacking Romney for not hacing principles seems particularly noteworthy, considering the Utah Republican cast his decision on impeachment as a matter of duty. Explaining his decision yesterday, Romney said, \u201cMy vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate, but irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability believing that my country expected it of me.\u201d In a new statement, Democratic senator Patrick Leahy criticized Trump\u2019s rambling, divisive response to his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial. Leahy contrasted Trump\u2019s remarks with those of Bill Clinton, who told the nation after his acquittal that he was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d for his actions. \u201cIn stark contrast, today President Trump held a White House campaign rally and was entirely unrepentant,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cSadly, the only lesson he\u2019s learned is how almost the entire Senate Republican Caucus let him get away with misconduct.\u201d Even though every House Democrat voted to kill a Republican resolution to condemn Nancy Pelosi for tearing up Trump\u2019s State of the Union, two more moderate members of the caucus chastized the House speaker for her actions. The Washington Post reports: Reps. Joe Cunningham (S.C.) and Ben McAdams (Utah) together spoke to Pelosi for several minutes on the House floor before they cast votes to block the attempted reprimand. McAdams said he told Pelosi that he thought the gesture \u2018was inappropriate and that we deserve better than that.\u2019 \u2018I thought it was disrespectful,\u2019 he said. \u2018I found things that I agreed with and things that I didn\u2019t agree with in the president\u2019s speech, but I thought that that was beneath us.\u2019 Other House Democrats have blamed Trump for the tension between him and Pelosi, citing the president\u2019s apparent refusal to shake the speaker\u2019s hand when he arrived to deliver his State of the Union address. Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign said in an email to supporters that it has raised $2.7 million since the Iowa caucuses. It\u2019s an impressive haul for the former Indiana mayor, who is currently leading in the Iowa caucuses, although Bernie Sanders is close on his heels with 97% of precincts reporting. Buttigieg will need those funds to get him through New Hampshire and on to the later voting states, especially because he is currently polling at 7% nationally, according to the RealClearPolitics average. Pete Buttigieg is clearly enjoying a surge in voter interest after his strong showing in the Iowa caucuses. The former Indiana mayor is hosting an event in Merrimack, New Hampshire, today that is so crowded even some reporters haven\u2019t been able to get inside. New Hampshire polls released in recent days have also shown Buttigieg jumping into second place, trailing only Bernie Sanders, in the second voting state, which will hold its primary on Tuesday. Speaking to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week, Trump was reportedly \u201capoplectic\u201d about the UK\u2019s decision to allow the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei to participate in building up the country\u2019s 5G network. The Financial Times reports: The UK prime minister spoke to the US president last week soon after he announced his decision to allow the Chinese manufacturer to participate in the UK\u2019s next-generation cellular network. This was in spite of vocal opposition from senior figures in the Trump administration, which is opposed to Huawei on national security grounds. Following the decision, the UK and US tried to gloss over their differences with muted public statements. But one individual briefed on the contents of the call said Mr Trump was \u2018apoplectic\u2019 with Mr Johnson for his Huawei decision and expressed his views in livid terms. A second official confirmed that the Trump-Johnson call was \u2018very difficult\u2019. British officials with knowledge of the exchange said they were taken aback by the force of the president\u2019s language towards Mr Johnson. The White House said in a statement shortly after the announcement of the UK\u2019s decision that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the move, and attorney general WIlliam Barr suggested today that the US and its allies should invest in Huawei\u2019s rivals like Nokia and Ericsson to counter the company\u2019s strength. Long-shot 2020 candidate Andrew Yang has fired dozens of campaign staffers after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses this week - a result that was obvious despite the ongoing (and in some ways deepening) debacle over the collation and reporting of results. Among those dismissed were the national political and policy directors of the campaign, as well as the deputy national political director \u2014 all senior-level positions. The people who were fired worked across Yang\u2019s organization, from his headquarters in New York to the now-disbanded Iowa operation, Politico reports. The House has voted along party lines to table (or kill) the Republican resolution condemning Nancy Pelosi for tearing up Trump\u2019s State of the Union on Tuesday night. Republican congresswoman Kay Granger, who introduced the resolution, said Pelosi\u2019s bold move was \u201ca breach of decorum\u201d that \u201cdegraded the proceedings of the joint session.\u201d But Pelosi defended her actions during a press conference today, saying she was justified in tearing up the speech because it contained falsehoods. \u201cI tore up a manifesto of mistruths,\u201d Pelosi told reporters. \u201cIt was necessary to get the attention of the American people to say, \u2018This is not true. And this is how it affects you.\u2019 And I don\u2019t need any lessons from anyone, especially the president of the United States, about dignity.\u201d The Iowa Democratic Party has issued a statement in response to Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez\u2019s call for a recanvass of the caucus results. \u201cShould any presidential campaign in compliance with the Iowa Delegate Selection Plan request a recanvass, the IDP is prepared,\u201d the statement concluded, indicating the party will not conduct a recanvass based solely off Perez\u2019s statement. Jonathan Turley, the legal expert who criticized the impeachment inquiry during the House\u2019s public hearings and has been repeatedly quoted by Republicans, expressed disapproval of Trump\u2019s \u201cvictory marathon\u201d speech. Addressing reporters in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders claimed \u201cstrong victory\u201d in the Iowa caucuses, even though he is currently trailing Pete Buttigieg in the first voting state. The Vermont senator pointed to his lead in the state\u2019s raw vote total, or \u201cpopular vote,\u201d to argue he is the true winner of the caucuses, although another metric (state delegate equivalent) is actually used to determine the state\u2019s top finisher. Buttigieg currently leads in SDEs. Sanders\u2019 announcement comes as Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez has called for a recanvass of Iowa to ensure accuracy of the results. Well, that was an experience. Here\u2019s where the day stands after Trump\u2019s remarks on the impeachment: Showing no remorse and using profanity to attack his enemies, Trump celebrated his acquittal in the Senate trial with an hour-long speech at the White House. Trump described the acquittal as a complete vindication of his actions, even as Republican senators continue to claim the president learned a lesson from his impeachment. Trump earlier attacked House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mitt Romney, the only Republican senator to support an article of impeachment, at the National Prayer Breakfast. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said the party would conduct a \u201crecanvass\u201d of the Iowa caucuses to ensure accuracy of the results. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump offered a small apology to his family as he concluded his remarks about his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial. \u201cI want to apologize to my family for having them have to go through a phony, rotten deal by some very sick, evil people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that includes Barron,\u201d he added, referring to his youngest son. With that, Trump concluded his remarks after speaking for a little over an hour. Trump said he is concluding his remarks now, calling today a \u201cday of celebration\u201d after he \u201cwent through hell\u201d with the impeachment. Trump then gave two of his closest House allies, congressmen Mark Meadows and Jim Jordon, a chance to make some comments. Meadows said Trump\u2019s reception today was a \u201cstrong reflection of the support you have all across the country.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back,\u201d Trump said. Trump seems to have wrapped up his praise of his congressional allies and has returned to attacking his perceived enemies. He referred to former FBI director James Comey as a \u201csleazebag\u201d and attacked \u201cthe top scum\u201d at the FBI, referring to the bureau\u2019s top leadership. In his remarks that are ostensibly meant to celebrate his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial, Trump offered a play-by-play account of the 2017 shooting at a congressional baseball practice, complete with hand motions to immitate gunfire. Trump turned his praise to congressman Steve Scalise, who was severely wounded when a shooter opened fire in 2017 on a Republican baseball practice. The president marveled at how upset Scalise\u2019s wife was when she learned he was shot. \u201cA lot of wives wouldn\u2019t give a damn,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe was a total mess.\u201d Trump said Scalise had probably \u201cset a record for blood loss\u201d and complimented the congressman that he was \u201cbetter-looking now.\u201d The president has reportedly made the comment about Scalise\u2019s wife, and used it as a joke to mock his own marriage, before: In the latest twist of the Iowa caucuses debacle that has been unfolding this week, the DNC chairman Tom Perez has called for a \u201crecanvass\u201d of the vote. After initial confusion about what a \u201crecanvass\u201d means, Perez then clarified: As it stands, Buttigieg leads Sanders in the tally of state delegate equivalents by 26.22% to 26.07%. Meanwhile, Sanders leads Buttigieg in the popular vote. Trump thanked congressman Jim Jordan, one of his closest House allies in the impeachment inquiry, by praising his workout routine \u201cI thought, huh, never wears a jacket. He\u2019s obviously very proud of his body,\u201d Trump said of Jordan, who often declines to wear a suit jacket in the House. \u201cWhen he works out,\u201d Trump added, \u201cthe machine starts burning.\u201d Trump also praised Jordan as a \u201cchampion top-top wrestler\u201d and a \u201cwarrior.\u201d While speaking at the White House, Trump appeared to raise the possibility that he could be impeached again. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to do it again,\u201d Trump said, claiming that his critics \u201chave gone stone cold crazy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve beaten them all my life, and I\u2019ll beat them again,\u201d he added. Trump told the audience at the White House that his children could \u201cmake a fortune\u201d if Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities in Ukraine were legal. (US and Ukrainian officials have said the former vice president\u2019s son did not break any laws.) \u201cIs Ivanka in the audience?\u201d Trump asked, looked for his eldest daughter, who was present for his remarks. \u201cMy kids could make a fortune,\u201d Trump said of Biden\u2019s business activities. The Washington Post reported in 2018: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, brought in at least $82 million in outside income while serving as senior White House advisers during 2017, according to financial disclosure forms released Monday. Trump is unsurprisingly lashing out against the House Democrats who led the impeachment inquiry, namely speaker Nancy Pelosi and lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff. \u201cAdam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNancy Pelosi is a horrible person.\u201d Trump also once again scoffed at Pelosi\u2019s repeated comments about praying for the president. \u201cI doubt she prays at all,\u201d Trump said. Trump took a shot at Mitt Romney after the Republican senator voted to convict the president on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. The Utah Republican said of his decision yesterday, \u201cAs a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\u201d But Trump was completely dismissive of that rationale. \u201cThen you have some who used religion as a crutch,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cThey never used it before. Never heard him use it before. ... But you know it\u2019s a failed presidential candidate, but things can happen when you fail so badly.\u201d The president\u2019s allies were silent as Trump criticized Romney and only cheered when he turned his attention to other Republican senators. But Trump wasn\u2019t done. As he praised Utah senator Mike Lee, Trump asked him to tell the residents of his state, I\u2019m sorry about Mitt Romney.\u201d Trump addressed his controversial comments at this morning\u2019s National Prayer Breakfast, during which he issued thinly veiled insults against Nancy Pelosi and Mitt Romney. \u201cI had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away, and I\u2019m saying things that a lot of people wouldn\u2019t have said, but I meant them,\u201d Trump said. Pelosi has repeatedly said she prays for the president, and Trump said this morning, \u201cNor do I like people who say, \u2018I pray for you,\u2019 when they know that that\u2019s not so.\u201d Trump specifically thanked Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who organized Republican senators to block witness testimony and ensure the president\u2019s acquittal in the impeachment trial. \u201cMitch McConnell, I want to tell you, you did a fantastic job,\u201d Trump said, prompting another standing ovation. For comparison, when Bill Clinton addressed the public after his Senate acquittal in 1999, he began by expressing how \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d he was for actions. Trump\u2019s remarks after his Senate acquittal is turning into a screed against all of the probes into his administration, starting with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference. \u201cWe first went through Russia, Russia, Russia,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was all bullshit.\u201d That last comment will likely rankle the television networks who are carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live. Even Trump described his remarks not as a speech but as a \u201ccelebration\u201d after the Senate acquitted him in the impeachment trial. \u201cThis is really not a news conference, it\u2019s not a speech,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything. It\u2019s just we\u2019re sort of ... it\u2019s a celebration, because we have something that just worked out. I mean, it worked out. We went through hell unfairly, did nothing wrong.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve done things wrong in my life, I\u2019ll admit,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cBut this is what the end result is,\u201d he added, holding up a copy of the Washington Post\u2019s front page, reading, \u201cTrump Acquitted.\u201d Trump immediately launched into attacks on his critics as he started delivering his remarks on the Senate impeachment trial. \u201cIt was evil, it was corrupt, it was dirty cops, it was leakers, it was liars,\u201d Trump said. The president even mentioned former FBI director James Comey, who was fired by Trump nearly three years ago. \u201cHad I not fired James Comey, who was a disaster by the way, it\u2019s possible I wouldn\u2019t even be standing here right now,\u201d Trump said. Trump has arrived in the East Room to deliver remarks on his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial and was greeted with a prolonged standing ovation from his allies sitting in the audience. The president\u2019s legal team, who defended him during the Senate impeachment trial, was greeted with a standing ovation as they arrived to witness Trump\u2019s remarks. As we await the president\u2019s arrival for his remarks on the impeachment trial, Capitol Police issued a statement saying officers responded to a report of a suspicious substance in the Rayburn House office building. According to Politico, the suspicious substance was near the office of lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff. In just a few minutes, the president is scheduled to deliver remarks about his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial at the White House. Some of the members of Trump\u2019s impeachment defense team have already arrived to witness the speech. During her press conference, Nancy Pelosi said House Democrats \u201chave no plans right now\u201d to subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton. The former Trump administration official said he would testify in the Senate trial if subpoenaed, but the Senate voted against calling new witnesses in the trial. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler said yesterday that his panel \u201cwill likely\u201d subpoena Bolton. Nancy Pelosi brushed off a question about whether she had stepped on her own message about Democrats remaining composed in the face of Trump\u2019s taunts when she ripped up the president\u2019s State of the Union address. \u201cThat was not a state of union, that was his state of mind.\u201d Pelosi said, arguing her actions were \u201centirely appropriate.\u201d She added that Trump\u2019s apparent rejction of her handshake at the onset of the speech meant \u201cnothing to me.\u201d \u201cI feel very liberated,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve extended every possible courtesy, I\u2019ve shown every level of respect.\u201d When she was earlier asked about whether she can still work with Trump, Pelosi said, \u201cThat would be up to him. ... We\u2019ve had a strained relationship for a while, and we were able to keep the government open.\u201d Nancy Pelosi was particularly critical of Trump\u2019s comments this morning at the National Prayer Breakfast, where he implicitly insulted the House speaker and Republican senator Mitt Romney. Pelosi has said she prays for the president, and Trump seemed to take a shot at that when he said at the prayer breakfast, \u201cNor do I like people who say, \u2018I pray for you,\u2019 when they know that that\u2019s not so.\u201d On Romney, who invoked his faith yesterday to explain his vote to convict Trump, the president said, \u201cI don\u2019t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong.\u201d Pelosi said Trump\u2019s comments about Romney were \u201cparticularly without class.\u201d \u201cI dont know if the president understands about prayer or the people who do pray,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about things he knows little about: faith and prayer.\u201d Speaking to reporters at her weekly press conference, Nancy Pelosi applauded Republican senator Mitt Romney for voting to convict Trump on the first article of impeachment. \u201cGod bless him for his courage,\u201d the House speaker said of Romney. Pelosi also reiterated that Trump would be impeached \u201cforever,\u201d arguing the president\u2019s legacy would be permanently marred by the House vote. \u201cYou\u2019re never getting rid of that scar,\u201d Pelosi said. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s criticism extended beyond Trump to include the Republican lawmakers who chanted \u201cFour more years!\u201d during Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address. The House speaker said the chant was a \u201cserious breach\u201d of protocol and was \u201ctotally inappropriate.\u201d A number of commentators said the State of the Union had the atmosphere of one of Trump\u2019s campaign rallies. Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of taking credit for the economic accomplishments of the Obama administration in his State of the Union address, which the House speaker called \u201cappalling.\u201d Pelosi read off some statistics about US economic growth under the Obama administration to underscore her point. \u201cThe president didn\u2019t inherit a mess,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cHe inherited a momentum.\u201d She also took aim at Trump\u2019s repeated boasting about the stock market. \u201cHe still hasn\u2019t even matched President Obama\u2019s growth in the stock market,\u201d Pelosi said. Nancy Pelosi has arrived for the House speaker\u2019s weekly press conference, her first appearance since Trump was acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial. But Pelosi opened her remarks by taking aim at Trump\u2019s claims in the State of the Union address on Tuesday. (The House speaker caused a stir when she ripped up her copy of the president\u2019s remarks after he wrapped up the speech.) Pelosi\u2019s staff handed out a factsheet about Trump\u2019s false claims, and the House speaker accsued Trump of having \u201cused the Congress of the United States as a backdrop for a reality show.\u201d She added Trump had \u201ca state of mind that had no context with reality whatsoever.\u201d The White House has said Trump\u2019s 12 pm ET remarks about his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial are \u201cnot a perss conference,\u201d so don\u2019t expect the president to take any questions. According to a pool report, the White House has also made clear there will not be seats for press during the remarks. Despite Trump\u2019s acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said he plans on \u201cramping up\u201d his investigations into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The Daily Beast reports: Giuliani did not go into details regarding what these continued private probes would entail, but the former New York mayor wasn\u2019t alone in his enthusiasm. In Giuliani\u2019s quest to uncover dirt on, or provoke a Ukrainian announcement of an investigation into, the then-frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, he openly collaborated with the fervently pro-Trump cable news outlet One America News Network. ... OAN President Charles Herring said in an interview Wednesday that his network has more investigations forthcoming on the Bidens, as well. ... Additionally, Trump allies on Capitol Hill have already made clear that they\u2019re itching for some payback. About an hour after Wednesday\u2019s acquittal, GOP senators Chuck Grassley (IA) and Ron Johnson (WI) announced a review regarding \u2018potential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates during the Obama\u2019 era. Following the Senate\u2019s vote to acquit Trump, Republican senator Rick Scott is now proposing raising the voting threshold for the House to approve articles of impeachment. This effort is a long shot at best, considering constitutional amendments can only be approved at a constitutional convention (which won\u2019t be called anytime soon) or by a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and the Senate (which won\u2019t happen as long as Democrats control the House). But it\u2019s notable that Republicans are still trying to cast a cloud of illegitimacy over the House\u2019s impeachment of Trump, even after he was acquitted by the Senate. The results that are still coming in from the blighted Iowa caucuses on Monday night are littered with errors, an analysis by the New York Times has found. The results released by the Iowa Democratic Party on Wednesday were riddled with inconsistencies and other flaws. According to a New York Times analysis, more than 100 precincts reported results that were internally inconsistent, that were missing data or that were not possible under the complex rules of the Iowa caucuses. In some cases, vote tallies do not add up. In others, precincts are shown allotting the wrong number of delegates to certain candidates. And in at least a few cases, the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s reported results do not match those reported by the precincts. Trump tilts at Romney and Pelosi Speaking at the national prayer breakfast, which is happening now and can be watched live here, Trump has alluded to the support for his impeachment by both Mitt Romney and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who led the process. Pelosi has often said she prays for the president. Trump didn\u2019t mention either opponent by name, but after tilting at Utah Republican Romney he also said, implying Pelosi: \u201c Nor do I like people who say, \u2018I pray for you,\u2019 when they know that that\u2019s not so.\u201d He added: \u201cSo many people have been hurt, and that cannot go away. I will be discussing that a bit later at the White House.\u201d The president appeared to tilt at Mitt Romney in the opening of his address to the national prayer breakfast in Washington, which is underway. He began by thanking his loyal Republican ranks for their \u201cwisdom, fortitude and strength to do what everyone knows was right\u201d. Trump was acquitted yesterday in his impeachment trial, by the Republican majority in the Senate. But one person became the first Senator in history to vote in an impeachment trial to remove a president from their own party - Mitt Romney, Senator of Utah, voted to convict Trump yesterday, saying it was his obligation to adjudicate fairly having taken an oath to do so before God. Moments ago, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong.\u201d The president is going to address the topic of his impeachment trial more fully at the White House at midday - we\u2019ll be covering that live, of course. Donald Trump Jr has called for Romney to be expelled from the party. The Iowa bump appears to be helping only one Democratic presidential candidate in New Hampshire: Pete Buttigieg. As the Iowa results show Buttigieg locked in a close race for first with Bernie Sanders, a new poll found the former Indiana mayor on the rise in the second voting state of New Hampshire. According to the latest Boston Globe/WBZ-TV/Suffolk University poll, Buttigieg has jumped into second place in New Hampshire, attracting support from 19% of the state\u2019s likely voters. In comparison, Sanders hit 25%, a strong showing but one that is only one percentage point higher from the outlets\u2019 last poll. Meanwhile, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are languishing behind the front runners at 12% and 11%, respectively, while undecided voters register at 14%. There are still five days until the primary in New Hampshire, a state that is well known for often making a different decision than Iowa. But the numbers indicate Biden and Warren, who are hoping for a strong showing there after failing to come in the top two in Iowa, could be in some trouble. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House, also delivers a prayer, this one for various high-level politicians and other public figures. Nancy Pelosi delivers a prayer for the \u201cpoor and the persecuted\u201d. Trump holds up copies of USA Today and the Washington Post with the same headline: \u201cTrump acquitted.\u201d A relaxed-looking Donald Trump has arrived to speak at the prayer event at a hotel in Washington. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi \u2013 whose tensions with Trump were illustrated so vividly when she ripped up her copy of his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night \u2013 is in attendance, along with vice-president Mike Pence, a friendlier face. Donald Trump is due to speak shortly at the annual \u2018National Prayer Breakfast\u2019, a Christian gathering in Washington. You can watch it live here or here. This is ahead of the full speech he is planning to give on his impeachment acquittal at midday ET (5pm UK). The White House is threatening to veto a $4.7bn emergency aid package for Puerto Rico, in the latest example of hostility to helping the US territory recover from a 2017 hurricane and a recent series of earthquakes. \u201cNeither Puerto Ricans nor the American taxpayers benefit when emergency aid is misallocated, lost, or stolen through waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a statement. \u201cMultiple high-profile cases of corruption have marred distribution of aid already appropriated and have led to ongoing political instability on the island \u2026 If [the bill] were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.\u201d Trump has consistently seemed reluctant to help aid Puerto Rico, notoriously making the false claim in 2018 that 3,000 people did not die there as a result of Hurricane Maria, claiming the number was made up by the Democratic party \u201cto make me look as bad as possible\u201d. In fact it was the figure arrived it through independent analysis commissioned by the governor of Puerto Rico. Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was one of the key figures in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, his written for the Washington Post to accuse the Trump administration of having \u201cundermined our democratic institutions\u201d. Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled from her post in May last year after coming under attack from Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, as he attempted to persuade Ukrainian officials to carry out an investigation into Joe Biden. The memo summarising Trump\u2019s now-infamous 25 July 2019 conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy shows the US president predicting that Yovanvitch is \u201cgoing to go through some bad things\u201d \u2013 something she told the impeachment inquiry she thought \u201csounded like a threat\u201d. A recording from before she was removed, and released last month, reveals Trump ordering associates to \u201cGet rid of her!\u201d and \u201cTake her out.\u201d She writes in the Post: We must not allow the United States to become a country where standing up to our government is a dangerous act. It has been shocking to experience the storm of criticism, lies and malicious conspiracies that have preceded and followed my public testimony, but I have no regrets. I did \u2014 we did \u2014 what our conscience called us to do \u2026 This administration, through acts of omission and commission, has undermined our democratic institutions, making the public question the truth and leaving public servants without the support and example of ethical behavior that they need to do their jobs and advance U.S. interests. To add to the woes of the Iowa Democratic party, Trump supporters began phoning its caucus results hotline on Monday, slowing the reporting process down further, Bloomberg (the news site, not the presidential candidate) reports. According to two participants on the call, Ken Sagar, a state Democratic central committee member, was among those answering the hotline on caucus night and said people called in and expressed support for Trump. The phone number became public after people posted photos of caucus paperwork that included the hotline number, one of the people on the call said. Bernie Sanders may or may not eventually be crowned the winner in Iowa, but he has had a lucrative January, announcing today that his campaign raised $25m. It was his best fundraising month to date. \u201cThe Vermont senator spent $50 million during the final three months of 2019 and finished the year with $18.2 million in cash on hand, putting him in a stronger position than many of his rival candidates even before his latest bonanza last month,\u201d reports AP. Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, announced Thursday that his candidate will immediately increase staffing in states that vote during the Democratic primary\u2019s Super Tuesday, on March 3. The campaign also plans to spend $5.5 million on television and digital ads in eight new states voting then: Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. And Sanders will expand ad buys the campaign already made in California and Texas, the two largest states voting on Super Tuesday. By contrast, Elizabeth Warren, his main rival on the left, has cancelled $375,000 of ad spending in Nevada and South Carolina \u2013 the next two primary states after New Hampshire \u2013 after her disappointing showing in Iowa, the Washington Post reports. Warren\u2019s reliance on grass-roots donations \u2014 and her decision not to do a high-dollar program \u2014 has been one of her main talking points, and she has credited the decision with focusing her campaign on people rather than the powerful. But, it also means a perceived lack of momentum can cause money to dry up quickly as low-dollar donors look elsewhere. Good morning. On Wednesday Donald Trump was acquitted in his impeachment trial in the Senate. The president tweeted that \u201cthe Impeachment Hoax was just a continuation of the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats corrupt practices\u201d, and announced he would make a speech about the verdict at midday ET (5pm UK). Only one Republican \u2013 Mitt Romney \u2013 broke ranks to vote to convict him. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, made a powerful speech on the Senate floor explaining why he was voting to convict Trump of abuse of power: The verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty. The grave question the Constitution tasked senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did. The president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president\u2019s purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust. What he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one\u2019s oath of office that I can imagine. The abuse of power charge fell 52-48. Romney voted not guilty on the second charge, which fell 53-47. All Democratic senators voted to convict Trump on both charges. Trump seemed to be saving his response for his speech today. But he did tweet in response to Romney\u2019s vote: \u201cHad failed presidential candidate @MittRomney devoted the same energy and anger to defeating a faltering Barack Obama as he sanctimoniously does to me, he could have won the election. Read the Transcripts!\u201d (Here you go.) His son Donald Trump Jr posted a childish picture of Romney on Instagram and called for him to be thrown out of the Republican party. But there is thought to be no appetite for such a punishment among Romney\u2019s GOP colleagues. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any doghouses here,\u201d said Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cThe most important vote is the next vote.\u201d Trump was impeached for conditioning military aid and a White House meeting for Ukraine on the announcement of investigations into his potential rival for the White House in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, and son Hunter Biden, and into a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, instead of Russia, was behind foreign tampering in the 2016 US election. Here\u2019s some further reading on yesterday\u2019s proceedings: Primaries Meanwhile, the Democrats\u2019 Iowa caucus is still too close to call following Monday\u2019s botched election, the first stage in the party\u2019s process of choosing a candidate to face Trump in the November election. With 96.94% of local precincts reporting, Pete Buttigieg is very narrowly ahead of Bernie Sanders, with the centrist former mayor having won 26.2% of the state\u2019s 41 delegates, and the socialist senator 26.1%. Sanders, however, seems to be winning the popular vote in the state \u2013 26.5% to 25% \u2013 another reason critics of the Iowa caucus system may accuse it of being not fit for purpose. (Here\u2019s an explanation of how the controversial system works and what went wrong on Monday.) The Democratic candidates have moved on to New Hampshire, which votes on Tuesday... using a more conventional system. Sanders seems firmly ahead there, although polling shows a slight increase in Buttigieg\u2019s vote share this week. Joe Biden, the former vice-president whose frontrunner status has taken a serious knock this week, admitted \u201cwe took a gut punch in Iowa\u201d. If he falls into third place behind Buttigieg in New Hampshire supporters and donors in the centrist Democratic establishment may start to abandon him and switch to Buttigieg or former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg instead. Buttigieg and Sanders, as well as lower-tier candidates Amy Klobuchar and Deval Patrick, will take part in town hall events on CNN tonight.",

Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said the public is increasingly not bothering to report certain crime types, generally less serious offences such as car crime. Matt Parr, HM Inspector of Constabulary, warned victims faced varying chances of their reported crimes being investigated, depending on where they lived. The low level but more frequently occurring offences are known as \u201cvolume crimes\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Law enforcement agencies are being provided with the web browsing histories of people under investigation using mandatory data retention powers, despite the federal government specifically excluding that practice in the legislation, the commonwealth ombudsman has warned. When the Coalition government passed mandatory data retention laws in 2015, the legislation explicitly ruled out forcing telecommunications companies to hold web-browsing histories of its users as part of the regime. Under the scheme, telecommunications companies such as Telstra, Optus, or NBN Co are required to retain information such as time of call, location data, and other so-called metadata for two years for law enforcement to access without a warrant for investigating a range of criminal activity or for missing person cases. A disastrous 2014 interview in which the then attorney general George Brandis struggled to explain what was or was not considered to be content or metadata led the government to clarify that URLs, because they effectively give away the content of what someone was doing on the internet, would be excluded from the scheme. The commonwealth ombudsman Michael Manthorpe, however, has warned that while it might be explicitly excluded from the mandatory data retention regime, some telecommunications companies are providing web browsing histories to law enforcement when sent a request for metadata by the agencies. \u201cThe piece of ambiguity we observed through our inspections is sometimes the metadata in the way it is captured, particularly URL data \u2026 in its granularity starts to communicate something about the content of what is being communicated,\u201d he told the joint parliamentary committee on intelligence and security on Friday. \u201cSo just to be very clear you get the full URL, you get the full www dot, whatever it is, dotcom?\u201d committee chair Andrew Hastie asked. \u201cThat\u2019s right. It can be quite long or it can be quite short, and in some cases the descriptor is long enough we start to ask ourselves that it is almost starting to communicate the content, even though it is captured in the URL,\u201d Manthorpe replied. He said there was a \u201cgreyness\u201d in the definition of metadata that needed to be examined. It is unclear whether law enforcement have asked for this data, or have simply been provided it when an access request is sent to them. In the ombudsman\u2019s submission to the inquiry, it is noted that law enforcement obtaining such data could be in violation of the law, and have suggested to law enforcement that the data should be quarantined until legal advice is obtained. The ombudsman said in some cases a person\u2019s account number and their physical addresses have been provided. The committee is reviewing the operation of the scheme, now having been in effect for close to five years. The latest annual report on the scheme revealed law enforcement was provided data 295,691 times in the last financial year. Inspector general of intelligence and security, Margaret Stone, told the committee there needed to be a consideration for whether metadata, when considered in the full range of metadata available, could be considered more intrusive than obtaining the content of a communication. \u201cMetadata tells you a lot about a person,\u201d she said. Stone also said in a small number of instances, Asio was provided metadata for people by mistake due to an error either in the access request or on the part of the telecommunications company, but she said in those instances Asio was good at isolating and destroying the data held.",

Days of torrential rains washed away roads, forced the evacuation of 2,000 people and saw the country\u2019s MetService issue its first red weather warning this week, in response to the worst flooding the region in the South Island has seen in decades. Residents of Mataura, Gore, Wyndham and Balclutha returned home on Friday to assess the damage, with some houses now uninhabitable, and some farm properties and paddocks still under water. One dairy farmer described the damage as \u201ca bit of a kick in the gut really\u201d and said damage would run into the tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cIt\u2019s more the carnage we\u2019re seeing as it leaves ... we\u2019re just in planning mode now\u201d Jon Pemberton told local media. \u201cThe water travelled quicker than it has in the past. That\u2019s what caught a lot of people out and just the sheer volume of rain ... to have in between 100mm and 200mm over a couple of days across the region is pretty unheard of.\u201d Numerous roads in the district remained closed, the council said, but the Mataura Bridge was structurally sound. A boil water notice applied for most of the district, and a community support centre had been set up. \u201cThere is still flooding in some Mataura streets and a number of homes may be uninhabitable,\u201d Gore council chief executive Stephen Parry said. Emergency management authorities in Gore said the town had escaped the worst, and sandbagging and flood defence efforts by locals had proved pivotal in preventing the severe damage. Around 80-90% of the water had now been pumped out of townships, emergency management said, but a state of emergency remained in the district as many people needed support. MP for Clutha-Southland Hamish Walker said the extreme weather events in Southland were costing local businesses. \u201cThe rebuild is going to be tough,\u201d Walker said. \u201cBusinesses in these areas are facing immense costs as they get back up and running and the losses they\u2019ve incurred as a result of closing are also considerable.\u201d \u201cThe government has been missing in action with the exception of $100,000 for Rural Support Trusts, this isn\u2019t going to go far enough to make a real difference.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The lord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, has demanded the prime minister, Scott Morrison, explain to parliament how his energy minister, Angus Taylor, came to rely on a false document that was used to accuse her of hypocrisy on climate change, after the Australian federal police declined to investigate. The AFP announced on Thursday it would not investigate the doctored document scandal further, saying it was unlikely a commonwealth offence had been committed and there was no evidence that Taylor had been involved in falsifying the document. The decision has outraged Moore and the opposition, which had initially referred the matter to the NSW police. Moore said she still did not know how Taylor came by a page of the City of Sydney\u2019s annual report, which contained incorrect figures and which showed that the City of Sydney had spent $15m on travel. The real figures, available online, show it was a fraction of that. \u201cHe didn\u2019t give me any explanation about how that happened. I still don\u2019t know why the minister did that, why he signed that letter,\u201d she told ABC radio. The incorrect figures were included in a letter Taylor sent to Moore criticising her declaration of a climate emergency and suggesting she curtail her travel instead. The letter was then leaked to the Telegraph, which mocked her declaration publicly. Moore said that Taylor\u2019s apology, made in parliament a month ago, was not sufficient. \u201cDoes he not think that climate change is important? That my reputation is not important?\u201d Moore said the prime minister should now investigate the matter and report to parliament, as the matter still raised important questions of ministerial conduct. But she added that she would not be pursuing the matter further and would extend focus on the business of the city. The City of Sydney announced on Thursday that it would bring forward its goal of reaching zero net emissions from 2050 to 2040 \u2013 ten years earlier. In a clear criticism of the Morrison government\u2019s record and Taylor, the minister for emissions reduction, she said: \u201cIt is incumbent on us as a rich country to do all we can to reduce emissions so we can then put pressure on the large emitters to do their part.\u201d Taylor has welcomed the news that the AFP would not be investigating further and accused Labor of a \u201ctrack record of using police referrals as a political tool\u201d. \u201cThe leader of the opposition [Anthony Albanese] and shadow attorney general [Mark Dreyfus]\u2019s pursuit of this matter is a shameful abuse of their office and a waste of our policing agencies\u2019 time,\u201d he said in a statement. Dreyfus and the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said that \u201cserious questions remain unanswered\u201d about the scandal because \u201ctwo police investigations have now failed to clarify where Angus Taylor got his dodgy figures from\u201d. Guardian Australia is currently seeking a review of a freedom of information request that sought documents. Taylor\u2019s office refused to release several documents, including one which was described as an email from \u201can external third party\u201d. It was withheld on the grounds that it would adversely affect the business affairs of that person.",

The bespectacled 47-year-old former barrister is \u201canti-Australian\u201d, an \u201cEXTREME left-winger and anti-coal zealot\u201d, according to the Daily Mail Australia. \u201cAdam Bandt\u2019s election as Greens leader will change the country as we know it.\u201d Sky News political editor Andrew Clennell \u2013 the journalist who replaced Speers \u2013 told Sky host Peta Credlin he knew Bandt from his \u201cuni days\u201d and he was very unpopular. \u201cIn fact, the Labor-right people in campus used to hate Adam Bandt, they used to think he was just too leftwing,\u201d Clennell said. \u201cSo, he\u2019s your classic watermelon I guess, which is a Green who\u2019s really sort of a socialist.\u201d In the Australian the anonymous columnist The Mocker made fun of the Greens by using the fairy trope which was popular in the 1990s to describe the Democrats. \u201cI promise to rule wisely and fairly,\u201d declared the new King [Bandt]. \u201cAnd I avow and declare that the worship of trees \u2013 particularly the Faraway Tree which grows at the centre of these woods \u2013 shall remain at the core of pixie ideology. Having said that, I am not sure what I love more: this magical tree, which bears all fruits, or the watermelons it produces.\u201d But it was the Herald Sun whose attempts to discredit Bandt were so ludicrous they resulted in making him look good. Andrew Bolt\u2019s column carried art that depicted Bandt as the Incredible Hulk. Bolt said Bandt is the \u201cangriest, nastiest and maybe most stupid\u201d Greens leader yet. \u201cThat\u2019s a big problem for us all, because this former (?) Marxist now leads a party that shares the balance of power in our Senate. \u201cI said Bandt is angry. That\u2019s ugly enough, but he wants everyone else to be angry, too.\u201d Bolt said Bandt is a \u201chate preacher\u201d for blaming Morrison for the fires. \u201cFor a start, these fires, our sixth most deadly in 100 years, were not caused by global warming, despite Bandt\u2019s claims,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven warmist scientist Andy Pitman admits global warming does not cause drought directly. In fact, our rainfall over the past century has risen, and the area burnt by fire has fallen by a third over 20 years.\u201d Pitman told the Guardian in October that Bolt was misrepresenting his views. Last question for Neil McMahon For five years freelancer Neil McMahon has written an entertaining wrap of ABC TV\u2019s Q&amp;A for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. Every Tuesday it was one of the most popular stories on the websites of the now Nine Entertainment newspapers. On Friday McMahon was told he would write his last column on Monday, about the debut of new host Hamish Macdonald. Sources say the decision was a cost-cutting move by the entertainment editors. Correspondents in Canberra will now take turns writing the weekly Q&amp;A wrap. Blair\u2019s new low The Daily Telegraph columnist Tim Blair has a reputation for writing tasteless blog posts about his many targets, but his repeated mocking of the name of former race commissioner Tim Soutphommasane is a new low. In a recent post about the coronavirus, Blair referred to the professor as \u201crace hustler Tim Sudafednasalspray\u201d. This was just the latest slur from Blair, who has also called the academic Dr Superpuffin, Dr Sweetpeahummusstain, Dr Soupinacan and Dr Souscheffromparis. The Daily Telegraph editor, Ben English, who last week apologised for his headline \u201cChina kids stay home\u201d by saying it \u201cwas in no way intended to single out Chinese people\u201d, did not respond to a request for comment. Taking their cue from Blair, some of the readers\u2019 comments on the post are similarly offensive. Today flicks the switch to vaudeville With Karl Stefanovic back on the Today show couch after a year\u2019s break, Nine is trying to improve the breakfast show\u2019s ratings \u2013 which are trailing behind Sunrise on Seven \u2013 with some pretty desperate tactics. Stefanovic and co-host Allison Langdon have been fronting promos to give away a house: \u201cOne lucky viewer is going to travel to Melbourne and will walk away with the great Australian dream: a house and land package, and a new lifestyle. It\u2019s unbelievable. With one turn of a key, someone\u2019s life is going to change forever.\u201d But now they\u2019ve flicked the switch to vaudeville with a promo in the style of Silence of the Lambs with Stefanovic as Hannibal Lecter and Langdon as Clarice. \u201cI\u2019ve missed the smell of morning coffee,\u201d Stefanovic says. \u201cApparently I\u2019ve been a very naughty boy.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1) Everton seem transformed under Ancelotti</strong></h2> \n<p>Everton face Crystal Palace knowing victory will lift them into seventh and, for 24 hours at least, level on points with Sheffield United. It is a bewildering state of affairs given they have been largely terrible this season but also testament to the job Carlo Ancelotti has done since becoming manager, with the high point undoubtedly being last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/01/watford-everton-premier-league-match-report\">3-2 win at Watford</a>. Everton triumphed after going 2-0 down and having lost Fabian Delph to a 71st-minute red card, showing a level of resilience that has been lacking for some time. It is that quality, perhaps more than any other, that the Goodison faithful would like to see on Saturday. Can Everton secure back-to-back victories in difficult circumstances? Doing so would suggest this most flaky of sides really has been transformed by the new man in charge. <strong>SN</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Everton v Crystal Palace: Saturday, 12.30pm (all times GMT)</em></p> \n<h2>2) Bayern out to stop Leipzig winning first Bundesliga</h2> \n<p>This year\u2019s Bundesliga title race has been one of the most exciting for years, with the four sides battling it at the top separated by just three points. RB Leipzig\u2019s trip to Bayern Munich on Sunday will be the acid test for whether their young head coach, Julian Nagelsmann, can help secure a first championship in the club\u2019s history. Two defeats to Eintracht Frankfurt, first in the league and then in the cup in midweek, ended a 12-match unbeaten run just as Bayern have hit form, with the Borussias \u2013 Dortmund and M\u00f6nchengladbach \u2013 also in the mix as they enter the business end of the season. Timo Werner, who has 20 league goals this season and hinted this week that he may fancy a crack at the Premier League, will go toe-to-toe with Robert Lewandowski, with both aiming to become the league\u2019s top goalscorer, or the magnificently-named <em>Torj\u00e4gerkanone</em>. <strong>EA</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Bayern Munich v RB Leipzig: Sunday, 5pm</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/625/top\"> \n <table data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"table table--football table--striped\"> \n  <thead> \n   <tr> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\"><abbr title=\"Position\">Pos</abbr></th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Team</th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--played\"><abbr title=\"Played\">P</abbr></th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--difference\"><abbr title=\"Goal difference\">GD</abbr></th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--points\"><abbr title=\"Points\">Pts</abbr></th> \n   </tr> \n  </thead> \n  <tbody> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">1</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Bayern Munich</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">20</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">35</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">42</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">2</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">RB Leipzig</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">20</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">28</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">41</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">3</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Borussia Dortmund</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">20</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">28</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">39</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">4</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Borussia M'gladbach</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">20</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">15</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">39</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">5</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Bayer Leverkusen</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">20</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">7</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">34</td> \n   </tr> \n  </tbody> \n </table> \n</figure> \n<h2>3) Ibrahimovic makes timely return for the Milan derby</h2> \n<p>Sunday\u2019s Derby della Madonnina will be the first Zlatan Ibrahimovic has contested since he left Milan for PSG in 2012.

If true, then surely it makes sense to start preparing Foden for that responsibility now. He has played a total of 900 minutes this campaign and, one suspects, needs much more game time if he is to hit the ground running as a prominent first-team player in August. That process could start this weekend. City face West Ham knowing they have close to zero chance of stopping Liverpool winning the title, so why not use the remaining league fixtures as an opportunity for forward planning? Guardiola is rotating his squad anyway and playing Foden, alongside a few other youngsters, would also allow him to keep key senior players rested and ready for the Champions League, which should be City\u2019s priority now. <strong>SN</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Manchester City v West Ham: Sunday, 4.30pm</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61805357313523c85491900df43d2847cebcdc2e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61805357313523c85491900df43d2847cebcdc2e/157_336_2195_1317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Foden last made a league start for Manchester City against Everton on New Year\u2019s Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Foden last made a league start for Manchester City against Everton on New Year\u2019s Day.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images via Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>5) Forest can capitalise on Leeds\u2019 latest slump</strong></h2> \n<p>We go again. That will surely be the message Sabri Lamouchi delivers to his Nottingham Forest players ahead of their biggest game of the season so far. Last week\u2019s 2-1 defeat at Birmingham City was an unexpected setback for Forest given they travelled to St Andrew\u2019s on a run of seven league games without defeat, propelling them to third in the Championship and fuelling belief of securing an automatic promotion spot. Forest are now down to fourth, but remain only four points off second given Leeds also lost last week, at home to Wigan, and are in the type of slump that suggests they are again running out of gas when it matters most. If Forest are to return to the Premier League for the first time in more than 20 years, they simply have to take full advantage on Saturday in what promises to be some contest. <strong>SN</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Nottingham Forest v Leeds: Saturday, 5.30pm</em></p> \n<h2>6) Is O Cl\u00e1ssico Porto\u2019s last chance to catch Benfica?</h2> \n<p>This season\u2019s title race in Portugal has turned into something of a procession as Benfica have won 18 of their 19 fixtures so far, with the home defeat against Porto back in August the only blemish so far for Bruno Lage\u2019s side. Saturday\u2019s meeting between the two sides at the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o therefore could be the last chance for Porto to stop Benfica from retaining their title, given that the Lisbon team are already seven points clear at the top before O Cl\u00e1ssico. Having strengthened their squad with the \u00a318m purchase of Julian Weigl from Borussia Dortmund, Benfica also look well equipped for a decent run in the Europa League.

Their remaining 13 games include jousts with all of the current top nine, starting with Sheffield United on Sunday. The Blades are going to have a significant say in the relegation race over the coming weeks, but not in the way that most people expected pre-season.

      "bodyText": "1) Everton seem transformed under Ancelotti Everton face Crystal Palace knowing victory will lift them into seventh and, for 24 hours at least, level on points with Sheffield United. It is a bewildering state of affairs given they have been largely terrible this season but also testament to the job Carlo Ancelotti has done since becoming manager, with the high point undoubtedly being last week\u2019s 3-2 win at Watford. Everton triumphed after going 2-0 down and having lost Fabian Delph to a 71st-minute red card, showing a level of resilience that has been lacking for some time. It is that quality, perhaps more than any other, that the Goodison faithful would like to see on Saturday. Can Everton secure back-to-back victories in difficult circumstances? Doing so would suggest this most flaky of sides really has been transformed by the new man in charge. SN \u2022 Everton v Crystal Palace: Saturday, 12.30pm (all times GMT) 2) Bayern out to stop Leipzig winning first Bundesliga This year\u2019s Bundesliga title race has been one of the most exciting for years, with the four sides battling it at the top separated by just three points. RB Leipzig\u2019s trip to Bayern Munich on Sunday will be the acid test for whether their young head coach, Julian Nagelsmann, can help secure a first championship in the club\u2019s history. Two defeats to Eintracht Frankfurt, first in the league and then in the cup in midweek, ended a 12-match unbeaten run just as Bayern have hit form, with the Borussias \u2013 Dortmund and M\u00f6nchengladbach \u2013 also in the mix as they enter the business end of the season. Timo Werner, who has 20 league goals this season and hinted this week that he may fancy a crack at the Premier League, will go toe-to-toe with Robert Lewandowski, with both aiming to become the league\u2019s top goalscorer, or the magnificently-named Torj\u00e4gerkanone. EA \u2022 Bayern Munich v RB Leipzig: Sunday, 5pm 3) Ibrahimovic makes timely return for the Milan derby Sunday\u2019s Derby della Madonnina will be the first Zlatan Ibrahimovic has contested since he left Milan for PSG in 2012. It\u2019s fair to say that plenty has changed since then at both of the Milan clubs, with neither having come close to winning the Scudetto in this era that has been dominated by Juventus. Ibrahimovic is expected to return after missing Milan\u2019s draw with Verona last week due to a bout of flu, and Milan will need the 38-year-old to be at his vintage best if they are to win this league fixture for the first time since 2016. Romelu Lukaku is certainly looking forward to facing his former Manchester United teammate, who has scored six times in the derby, having also represented Inter between 2006 and 2009. \u201cIn Manchester I could train every day with him, that was the most beautiful thing for me,\u201d said Lukaku. \u201cIt will be nice to play against him. He is a great champion and professional.\u201d EA \u2022 Internazionale v Milan: Sunday, 7.45pm 4) Foden must play more this season to be ready for next It was reported this week that Pep Guardiola intends to use Phil Foden as David Silva\u2019s replacement next season, with the manager viewing the 19-year-old as the natural heir to arguably Manchester City\u2019s best-ever midfielder. If true, then surely it makes sense to start preparing Foden for that responsibility now. He has played a total of 900 minutes this campaign and, one suspects, needs much more game time if he is to hit the ground running as a prominent first-team player in August. That process could start this weekend. City face West Ham knowing they have close to zero chance of stopping Liverpool winning the title, so why not use the remaining league fixtures as an opportunity for forward planning? Guardiola is rotating his squad anyway and playing Foden, alongside a few other youngsters, would also allow him to keep key senior players rested and ready for the Champions League, which should be City\u2019s priority now. SN \u2022 Manchester City v West Ham: Sunday, 4.30pm 5) Forest can capitalise on Leeds\u2019 latest slump We go again. That will surely be the message Sabri Lamouchi delivers to his Nottingham Forest players ahead of their biggest game of the season so far. Last week\u2019s 2-1 defeat at Birmingham City was an unexpected setback for Forest given they travelled to St Andrew\u2019s on a run of seven league games without defeat, propelling them to third in the Championship and fuelling belief of securing an automatic promotion spot. Forest are now down to fourth, but remain only four points off second given Leeds also lost last week, at home to Wigan, and are in the type of slump that suggests they are again running out of gas when it matters most. If Forest are to return to the Premier League for the first time in more than 20 years, they simply have to take full advantage on Saturday in what promises to be some contest. SN \u2022 Nottingham Forest v Leeds: Saturday, 5.30pm 6) Is O Cl\u00e1ssico Porto\u2019s last chance to catch Benfica? This season\u2019s title race in Portugal has turned into something of a procession as Benfica have won 18 of their 19 fixtures so far, with the home defeat against Porto back in August the only blemish so far for Bruno Lage\u2019s side. Saturday\u2019s meeting between the two sides at the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o therefore could be the last chance for Porto to stop Benfica from retaining their title, given that the Lisbon team are already seven points clear at the top before O Cl\u00e1ssico. Having strengthened their squad with the \u00a318m purchase of Julian Weigl from Borussia Dortmund, Benfica also look well equipped for a decent run in the Europa League. Domestic concerns will take centre stage this weekend in a fixture that is never for the faint-hearted. EA \u2022 Porto v Benfica, Saturday, 8.3opm 7) Blades could yet play role in relegation battle Bournemouth have won their last two league matches but are still a good bet to go down. Their remaining 13 games include jousts with all of the current top nine, starting with Sheffield United on Sunday. The Blades are going to have a significant say in the relegation race over the coming weeks, but not in the way that most people expected pre-season. After Bournemouth, they play Brighton and Norwich and will also contest a re-arranged fixture with Aston Villa. With January signing Sander Berge likely to feature in midfield, where Bournemouth will be deprived of the suspended Jefferson Lerma, it is hard to see Eddie Howe\u2019s side springing a surprise and taking a point off United. That\u2019s not something anyone was saying before these teams met on the opening day of the season. PD \u2022 Sheffield United v Bournemouth: Sunday, 2pm 8) Potter and Pearson both desperate for the points The dramatic second half against West Ham that saw Brighton rescue a point despite twice trailing by two goals heaped the pressure on David Moyes\u2019s struggling side this week as they prepare for a devilish run of fixtures. Potter\u2019s side remain perilously close to the bottom three before Watford\u2019s visit to the south coast on Saturday.

Watford, whose momentum has stalled of late after their blistering start under Nigel Pearson, are also in desperate need of the points. They will offer a stern test of whether Potter and his players are up for the fight.

      "bodyText": "The proportion of people living in poverty who are in a working family has hit a record high, according to a report that shows rising levels of employment have failed to translate into higher living standards. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said that while paid employment reduces the risk of poverty, about 56% of people living in poverty in 2018 were in a household where at least one person had a job, compared with 39% 20 years ago. Seven in 10 children in poverty are now in a working family, the charity\u2019s annual UK poverty report found. Single-parent families have been the worst affected by the trend of wages falling behind living costs, it added. Working single parents accounted for three in 10 households in poverty in 2018, compared with two in 10 in 2011. The JRF\u2019s executive director, Claire Ainsley, said the charity\u2019s latest barometer of poverty in the UK revealed the scale of the task facing Boris Johnson\u2019s administration if it is to \u201clevel up\u201d incomes across the UK by narrowing the gap between the wealthiest cities and poorer regions. \u201cThe new government has a historic opportunity as we enter the 2020s,\u201d she said. \u201cPast successes in recent decades show that it is possible for the UK to loosen the grip of poverty among those most at risk, but this progress has begun to unravel, and it will take sustained effort across the country and throughout the governments of the UK to unlock poverty.\u201d Amid concerns that the poorest receive worse healthcare and have the most insecure jobs, Ainsley said it was an indictment of recent government policy that the number of people in poverty across the whole workforce jumped from 9.9% in 1998 to 12.7% in 2018. Labour accused the government of allowing too many people to remain trapped in low-paid insecure work and \u201call too often the social security system fails to give people the support they need\u201d. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cThe government must crack down on business models based on poverty pay and insecure jobs. Zero-hour contracts should be banned and the minimum wage must go up to at least \u00a310 an hour right away.\u201d Approximately 14 million people are in poverty in the UK \u2013 more than one in five of the population, including 4 million children and 2 million pensioners, up by 400,000 and 300,000 respectively over the past five years. A family is classified as being in poverty if it has an income of less than 60% of the median income for their family type, after housing costs. A family\u2019s income includes earnings from employment, self-employment, state benefits and inheritances. The report said people were more likely to be in poverty if they lived in certain parts of the UK, in a family where there is a disabled person or a carer, if they work in the hospitality or retail sector, or if they live in rented housing. The worst-hit regions were London, the north of England, the Midlands and Wales, while the lowest poverty rates were found in the south of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the JRF said. The charity was especially concerned about the rise in young people living with their parents, who in a previous era would have started to buy a house and start a family of their own, which it named \u201cconcealed households\u201d. Twenty years ago, 20% (2.4 million) of 20- to 34-year-olds lived with a parent or guardian. That proportion rose to 30% in 2018, affecting 3.9 million people, the JRF found. The report describes in-work poverty as a \u201ccritical issue for our economy\u201d and calls for action to reduce job insecurity, lower housing costs and increase earnings for low-paid workers. The JRF said the introduction of universal credit, which rolls six benefits into one, did not help many low-income families because it required upfront payments for childcare before households were able to access state support. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: \u201cTackling poverty will always be a priority for this government. We know that getting into work is the best route out of poverty \u2013 and there are more people in work than ever before. Wages are outstripping inflation and absolute poverty is lower than in 2010. \u201cWe know that some need more help, which is why we spend over \u00a395bn a year on working-age benefits. Millions will see their benefit payments rise further from April and we\u2019re also boosting the incomes of pensioners each year through the triple lock.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 February 2020. An earlier version said the proportion of people with a job who live in poverty went up for the third consecutive year in 2018 to a record high. This should have said the proportion of people in poverty who live in a working family went up in 2018 to a record high.",

      "body": "<p>Older people are withdrawing \u00a310m a day from their homes \u2013 adding up to \u00a33.4bn last year \u2013 and it\u2019s not just for new kitchens and dream holidays. New research reveals a surge in the number of people turning to equity release in order to pay off debts and mortgages.</p> <p>Equity release is becoming an increasingly mainstream proposition, and rates on these deals have fallen to record lows, making them look more tempting. The lowest interest rates are now below 3%, whereas five years ago you would have done very well to get 5%.</p> <p>Lower rates make a big difference to what you can end up owing. To give a very rough example, someone aged 71 who wants to release \u00a360,000 as a lump sum might, after 20 years, be looking at owing a total of \u00a3106,000 (the loan plus interest). That might sound like a lot, but it\u2019s much less than the \u00a3166,000 that someone who was 71 in 2015 would owe after 20 years.</p> <p>However, these are complex products, and there are downsides.</p> <p>So if you are an older homeowner who is short of cash, should you consider taking the plunge? Or are there better alternatives out there, such as the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/mar/23/retirement-interest-only-mortgages-offer-lifeline-to-older-borrowers\" title=\"\">retirement interest-only</a>\u201d (Rio) mortgages that some lenders have launched?</p> <p><strong>The basics</strong></p> <p>Equity release is a way for older people \u2013 the minimum age is usually 55, and sometimes 60 \u2013 to get cash out of their property without the need to move home. Typically there are no monthly repayments. Leading providers include Aviva, Legal &amp; General, more2life, LV= (Liverpool Victoria), Just and Canada Life. The average amount released last year was \u00a375,600, according to <a href=\"https://www.keyadvice.co.uk/about/market-monitor\" title=\"\">over-55s specialist adviser Key</a>.</p> <p>But equity release can be an expensive way to borrow. The way these schemes work means you end up paying interest on interest, so the total owed can balloon. For most, the most financially effective way of freeing up cash is to move to a smaller property or cheaper area.</p> <p><strong>Types of scheme</strong></p> <p>The most common are mortgage-based products secured against your home, repaid from the sale of the property when you die or go into long-term care. These are known as lifetime mortgages and allow you to take out a loan on your property in return for a one-off lump sum or regular smaller sums.</p> <p>These deals are becoming more flexible \u2013 a growing number include a feature called drawdown, where a pot of money is set aside for you to draw from when you need to. </p> <p>This is popular because not everyone needs a big lump sum at the outset, and because you only pay interest on the cash you release.</p> <p><strong>How much can </strong><strong>I borrow?</strong></p> <p>This will vary and depend on your age, the value of your property and sometimes your health. According to the firms\u2019 website calculators, someone aged 75 with a \u00a3300,000 house could typically borrow:</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3145,500 from Just</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3145,500 from Legal &amp; General</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3141,000 to \u00a3163,500 from more2life (depending on how healthy you are)</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3123,000 from Aviva</p> <p>At age 85 those figures rise to \u00a3168,000 for both Just and L&amp;G, \u00a3159,000-\u00a3163,500 for more2life, and \u00a3156,000 for Aviva.</p> <p><strong>What are the rates like? </strong></p> <p>\u201cOver the last few years rates have fallen significantly and it is not unusual to see clients taking out products with sub-3% interest rates,\u201d says Will Hale at Key. For example, rates at more2life start at 2.67%.</p> <p><strong>What is the money used for?</strong></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.lv.com/about-us/press/large-increase-in-number-of-people-using-equity-release-to-pay-off-debts-and-mortgages\" title=\"\">latest customer data</a> from LV= shows that 27% of customers in 2019 used equity release to clear their mortgage, loans or debts \u2013 up from 15% in 2016. Almost one in four customers (24%) used some or all the cash for home and garden improvements. Others splash out on holidays or help family and friends.</p> <p><strong>Give me an example</strong></p> <p>A couple, both 71, have a \u00a3350,000 house and want to release \u00a360,000. Key looked at two scenarios for Guardian Money: releasing the cash as a lump sum or releasing an initial \u00a320,000 and withdrawing four lots of \u00a310,000 at the end of years three, five, eight and 10. These are based on an interest rate of 2.89% from more2life, available through specialist advisers.</p> <p>Under the first scenario the amount owing \u2013 loan plus interest \u2013 would be \u00a369,000 after five years and \u00a380,000 after 10 years. After 20 years it would be \u00a3106,000.</p> <p>Under the second scenario the amounts owed would be lower: \u00a333,000 after five years, \u00a362,000 after 10 years, and \u00a390,000 after 20 years.</p> <p>Many equity release products offer borrowers the opportunity to make interest repayments if they wish. If the couple did this, the balance outstanding would simply reflect the total sum they had borrowed on equity release, provided all monthly interest repayments had been met. At the end of 20 years, in both scenarios \u00a360,000 would be owed.</p> <p><strong>What about </strong><strong>Rio mortgages?</strong></p> <p>These are a new type of interest-only mortgage for older people. They might appeal to those put off by the idea of equity release.</p> <p>Rio mortgages are effectively standard home loan deals with one big difference: the mortgage doesn\u2019t usually have a set end date and carries on until the borrower\u2019s death, or they move into a care home. Until then, the borrower continues to pay the interest each month, and the loan is ultimately repaid from the sale of their property.</p> <p>There are now more than 70 Rio mortgage products on the market, with rates starting at 2.74% courtesy of Nationwide, according to data provider Moneyfacts.</p> <p>The good news about Rio mortgages is that they will often work out cheaper than equity release over the longer term, according to number-crunching by financial information firm Defaqto.

      "bodyText": "Older people are withdrawing \u00a310m a day from their homes \u2013 adding up to \u00a33.4bn last year \u2013 and it\u2019s not just for new kitchens and dream holidays. New research reveals a surge in the number of people turning to equity release in order to pay off debts and mortgages. Equity release is becoming an increasingly mainstream proposition, and rates on these deals have fallen to record lows, making them look more tempting. The lowest interest rates are now below 3%, whereas five years ago you would have done very well to get 5%. Lower rates make a big difference to what you can end up owing. To give a very rough example, someone aged 71 who wants to release \u00a360,000 as a lump sum might, after 20 years, be looking at owing a total of \u00a3106,000 (the loan plus interest). That might sound like a lot, but it\u2019s much less than the \u00a3166,000 that someone who was 71 in 2015 would owe after 20 years. However, these are complex products, and there are downsides. So if you are an older homeowner who is short of cash, should you consider taking the plunge? Or are there better alternatives out there, such as the so-called \u201cretirement interest-only\u201d (Rio) mortgages that some lenders have launched? The basics Equity release is a way for older people \u2013 the minimum age is usually 55, and sometimes 60 \u2013 to get cash out of their property without the need to move home. Typically there are no monthly repayments. Leading providers include Aviva, Legal &amp; General, more2life, LV= (Liverpool Victoria), Just and Canada Life. The average amount released last year was \u00a375,600, according to over-55s specialist adviser Key. But equity release can be an expensive way to borrow. The way these schemes work means you end up paying interest on interest, so the total owed can balloon. For most, the most financially effective way of freeing up cash is to move to a smaller property or cheaper area. Types of scheme The most common are mortgage-based products secured against your home, repaid from the sale of the property when you die or go into long-term care. These are known as lifetime mortgages and allow you to take out a loan on your property in return for a one-off lump sum or regular smaller sums. These deals are becoming more flexible \u2013 a growing number include a feature called drawdown, where a pot of money is set aside for you to draw from when you need to. This is popular because not everyone needs a big lump sum at the outset, and because you only pay interest on the cash you release. How much can I borrow? This will vary and depend on your age, the value of your property and sometimes your health. According to the firms\u2019 website calculators, someone aged 75 with a \u00a3300,000 house could typically borrow: \u2022 \u00a3145,500 from Just \u2022 \u00a3145,500 from Legal &amp; General \u2022 \u00a3141,000 to \u00a3163,500 from more2life (depending on how healthy you are) \u2022 \u00a3123,000 from Aviva At age 85 those figures rise to \u00a3168,000 for both Just and L&amp;G, \u00a3159,000-\u00a3163,500 for more2life, and \u00a3156,000 for Aviva. What are the rates like? \u201cOver the last few years rates have fallen significantly and it is not unusual to see clients taking out products with sub-3% interest rates,\u201d says Will Hale at Key. For example, rates at more2life start at 2.67%. What is the money used for? The latest customer data from LV= shows that 27% of customers in 2019 used equity release to clear their mortgage, loans or debts \u2013 up from 15% in 2016. Almost one in four customers (24%) used some or all the cash for home and garden improvements. Others splash out on holidays or help family and friends. Give me an example A couple, both 71, have a \u00a3350,000 house and want to release \u00a360,000. Key looked at two scenarios for Guardian Money: releasing the cash as a lump sum or releasing an initial \u00a320,000 and withdrawing four lots of \u00a310,000 at the end of years three, five, eight and 10. These are based on an interest rate of 2.89% from more2life, available through specialist advisers. Under the first scenario the amount owing \u2013 loan plus interest \u2013 would be \u00a369,000 after five years and \u00a380,000 after 10 years. After 20 years it would be \u00a3106,000. Under the second scenario the amounts owed would be lower: \u00a333,000 after five years, \u00a362,000 after 10 years, and \u00a390,000 after 20 years. Many equity release products offer borrowers the opportunity to make interest repayments if they wish. If the couple did this, the balance outstanding would simply reflect the total sum they had borrowed on equity release, provided all monthly interest repayments had been met. At the end of 20 years, in both scenarios \u00a360,000 would be owed. What about Rio mortgages? These are a new type of interest-only mortgage for older people. They might appeal to those put off by the idea of equity release. Rio mortgages are effectively standard home loan deals with one big difference: the mortgage doesn\u2019t usually have a set end date and carries on until the borrower\u2019s death, or they move into a care home. Until then, the borrower continues to pay the interest each month, and the loan is ultimately repaid from the sale of their property. There are now more than 70 Rio mortgage products on the market, with rates starting at 2.74% courtesy of Nationwide, according to data provider Moneyfacts. The good news about Rio mortgages is that they will often work out cheaper than equity release over the longer term, according to number-crunching by financial information firm Defaqto. The bad news \u2013 apart from the fact that you must make monthly repayments \u2013 is that you have to undergo affordability tests similar to a standard mortgage, and anecdotal evidence suggests many people are failing because the tests are pretty strict. You will need to show that you can afford the mortgage payments as well as all your living costs, which probably means you will need to be getting a pretty chunky pension income. For many older people that will be a tall order. Also, most Rio rates aren\u2019t fixed for life, as is the case with equity release. Nevertheless, if you are an older borrower with a secure income, you may want to check out Rio mortgages first.

      "bodyText": "Former prime minister Julia Gillard\u2019s 2012 \u201cmisogyny speech\u201d has been voted the most unforgettable moment of Australian TV history, after leading Guardian Australia\u2019s poll since voting opened on 24 January. The parliamentary speech \u2013 in which Gillard accused then-opposition leader Tony Abbott and the Coalition of sexism, and proclaimed \u201cthe government will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man\u201d \u2013 was criticised as opportunistic by many Canberra journalists at the time, before going viral among the Australian public and making headlines around the world. The speech was voted number one by 3,391 Guardian readers, while Gough Whitlam\u2019s dismissal speech came in a distant #2, with 1,383 votes. It\u2019s perhaps telling of the demise of traditional television that the top spot was taken by a moment which most Australians would have watched online: on YouTube alone, the ABC\u2019s video of the speech has been watched more than 3.3m times. The Chaser\u2019s invasion of Apec \u2013 a revelatory oral history of which featured in Guardian Australia\u2019s story series, which ran alongside the poll \u2013 came in at #3. It was followed by Cathy Freeman\u2019s win at the 2000 Olympics, Scott and Charlene\u2019s wedding on Neighbours and, somewhat unexpectedly, A Current Affair\u2019s 2008 chastisement of infamous teen Corey Worthington, which hit the #6 spot \u2013 a reminder, perhaps, that people were voting for moments they\u2019d never forget, for better or for worse. Kevin Rudd\u2019s 2008 apology to Indigenous Australians was voted in at #7 (11 places ahead of actor John Howard\u2019s satirical version of same), Nakkiah Lui and Miranda Tapsell\u2019s trashing of Get Krack!n came at #8, and Gough Whitlam\u2019s dismissal made another showing at #9, thanks to comedian Norman Gunston\u2019s unlikely appearance at that seminal moment of Australian history. The #10 spot went to the \u201c100-metre-track\u201d skit on John Clarke and Bryan Dawes\u2019 The Games, followed by John Aloisi\u2019s World Cup-qualifying goal in 2005, and Molly\u2019s death on A Country Practice. Sporting moments featured highly: at #13, #14 and #15 respectively were Bob Hawke\u2019s cheeky advice for bosses after Australia won the 1983 America\u2019s Cup; Adam Goodes\u2019 celebratory spear throw in 2015; and Stephen Bradbury\u2019s unlikely win at the 2002 Winter Olympics. But there were some shock twists, too. The death of child character Lou on Australian drama series Love My Way, endorsed by Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor and remembered through tears by many of her staff, came in all the way down at #20. While prolific among the nominations, dramatic deaths in general did not feature as highly as expected in the final results \u2013 with Patrick\u2019s death on Offspring reaching #23, the death of Josh\u2019s mother Rose on Please Like Me at #25, Judy\u2019s death on Seven Little Australians at #36 and Charlie Cousins\u2019 death on Bellbird at #43. Each of these morbid scenes apparently fade into the deep recesses of memory when compared to \u201cBronson\u2019s pissing contest in Round the Twist\u201d, a scene from the 1990s after-school program which surprised almost everyone by climbing to #19. The bottom spot in the poll went to Ben Ross, who broke his arm on the Footy Show in 2015 and won only eight votes for the pleasure. Perhaps that horrifying moment of live TV was one everyone tried hard to forget. \u2022 View the full results of Guardian Australia\u2019s poll UPDATE, 3pm AEST: We are not the only ones surprised by where Bronson placed. Our happy winner has announced she is \u201cdelighted\u201d to have beat him.",
