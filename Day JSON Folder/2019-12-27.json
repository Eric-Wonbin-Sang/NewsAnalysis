We love them all dearly, will always remember them in our hearts and miss them greatly.\u201d Following the release of Diya\u2019s statement, the hotel\u2019s owner said: \u201cDiligent and exhaustive police investigations into this tragedy have confirmed that the pool was working normally and there was no malfunction of any kind. Our sympathies remain with the family at what we understand must be a stressful and desperately upsetting time for them.\u201d According to Spanish police, Comfort got into difficulty while playing in a swimming pool at the resort and her father and brother died trying to save her. Tributes have been paid to the three who died. Comfort\u2019s school, Windrush primary in Charlton, south-east London, described her as the \u201cmost wonderfully kind, thoughtful and caring pupil who was a role model for her peers\u201d. In a post on the school\u2019s website, the executive headteacher, Jo Marchant, said everyone was devastated by the news. She added: \u201cComfort will be greatly missed by the whole school community, adults and children alike.\u201d Marchant said support would be available for any pupil or parent who needs it when school resumes on 6 January. Gabriel Diya was minister in charge at Open Heavens in Charlton, which is part of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), a Nigeria-based network of religious groups. The RCCG said in a post on Facebook: \u201cWith heavy hearts, we extend our condolences to the family, parish, friends and associates of area pastor Gabriel Diya who sadly passed away, along with two of his children \u2026 in a tragic incident while on a family holiday in Spain.\u201d It added: \u201cAt this very difficult time, our prayers are for Pastor Gabriel Diya\u2019s family, the parishes that were under his supervision, friends, associates, members of RCCG and the general public.\u201d A neighbour said she was \u201creally devastated\u201d to learn of the deaths, describing the Diyas as \u201cvery religious, very friendly, very humble\u201d. Speaking outside her home in Charlton, Lara Akins, 59, added: \u201cI still can\u2019t comprehend it, it\u2019s still shocking. They are so nice, that is why everybody is shocked \u2026 we are very friendly with each other.\u201d Olubumni Diya and Favour have been given psychological treatment.",

Duncan Smith, an MP since 1992 and Tory leader from 2001 to 2003, was awarded a knighthood alongside Bob Neill, the MP for Bromley and Chislehurst and former Conservative party vice-chairman. The Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull North, Diana Johnson, has been made a dame, in part because of her campaigning for a full inquiry, which is currently taking place, into how contaminated blood transfusions infected thousands of people with hepatitis C and HIV. While it is not uncommon for long-serving MPs, particularly former party leaders, to receive honours, Duncan Smith\u2019s knighthood was met with criticism from opposition parties because of his record on benefits. Labour criticised the decision to honour \u201cthe primary architect of the cruel universal credit system, which has pushed thousands of people into poverty\u201d, while the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine said the award \u201cbeggars belief\u201d. As work and pensions secretary for six years from 2010, Duncan Smith was the central figure as significant cuts were made to benefit and disability entitlements during the peak of the Conservative-led austerity period. He faced particular criticism for a botched system of assessing people for disability payments and for helping preside over a rhetorical culture centred on \u201cshirkers\u201d and \u201cscroungers\u201d, which charities said led to an increase in abuse against disabled people. In the role \u2013 which he eventually quit in protest at further planned benefits cuts \u2013 Duncan Smith also oversaw the beginnings of universal credit, his personal brainchild for a system to replace a series of working-age benefits with one flexible payment. However, UC has proved deeply problematic and slow to roll out, with particular criticism about delays to initial payments, which charities said contributed to an increase in the number of people needing to use foodbanks. Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy said it was a \u201cdisgraceful decision by Boris Johnson to reward a legacy of cruelty and failure\u201d. She tweeted: \u201cThis regime deliberately removed the safety net. It stripped people of their dignity. There is no honour in that.\u201d New year honours predominantly reward public service rather than political work, so feature relatively few MPs. Many more political figures are likely to receive awards early next year, when the dissolution honours \u2013 drawn up by the outgoing government before a general election \u2013 are published. The new year list also includes honours for a series of public servants and senior civil servants, among them Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, who is knighted. David Prior, the chair of NHS England, said he wanted to congratulate Stevens and others in the health service given new honours. \u201cIt is the staff who make the NHS what it is, our most treasured national institution, so I am pleased to see their skill and dedication recognised,\u201d he said. Also given recognition was Alison Saunders, a former director of public prosecutions, whose five-year term ended in 2018 amid some controversy, notably over the collapse of several rape trials after the failure of the prosecution to disclose evidence.

A number of the squad who beat New Zealand in the final were awarded honours, with Ben Stokes\u2019 triumphant summer recognised with an OBE. Stokes, who was stripped of his vice-captaincy in 2017 after following a late-night brawl in Bristol, was honoured after a triumphant summer. Head coach Trevor Bayliss, the Australian who transformed the one-day team over his four years in the job, also received an OBE. Captain Eoin Morgan and the ECB chairman, Colin Graves, were given CBEs. Wicket keeper Jos Buttler, who sealed the historic victory and Joe Root, England\u2019s top run-scorer at the World Cup and Test cricket captain, received MBEs. Veteran cricket great Clive Lloyd, 75, a former West Indies team captain, was awarded a knighthood for services to the game. The success of the England women\u2019s football team \u2013 who came fourth in the FIFA World Cup \u2013 was recognised with an MBE for midfielder Jill Scott. Scott said it was fantastic to see the rise in women\u2019s football since the time when she fell in love with the sport as a young girl from Sunderland. Baroness Sue Campbell, director of women\u2019s football at the FA, who was responsible for hiring Phil Neville as manager, was made a dame. Campbell said the honour was an immense privilege. \u201cI feel very grateful and it\u2019s a reflection of all the hard work an awful lot of people have put in to women\u2019s football and my life in sport generally,\u201d she said. Broadcaster and former gymnast Gabby Logan received an MBE for services to sport, along with Olympic heptathlon bronze medallist Kelly Sotherton and former world squash champion Laura Massaro. England Netball team captain Serena Guthrie and goal shooter Jo Harten received MBEs, in the year the squad won the bronze in the Netball World Cup in Liverpool. British Gymnastics chief executive Jane Allen, who has overseen the emergence of a new generation of women\u2019s talent including world medal-winning sisters Ellie and Becky Downie, was also given an MBE. \u201cI accept this award on behalf of everybody at British Gymnastics who has been involved in the growth and development of gymnastics at the recreational level, as well as the fantastic achievements of our athletes on the world stage,\u201d she said. Double Olympic taekwondo champion Jade Jones and former golf major winner and golfer Catriona Matthew, who captained Europe in their Solheim Cup victory over the US, were given OBEs. Having retained her Olympic title in Rio in 2016, Jones claimed her first world title in Manchester in May and will target a third straight Olympic gold in Tokyo next year.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Elton John has received the highest acknowledgement in a new year honours list in which hundreds of ordinary people were recognised alongside household names from sport, the arts, entertainment and politics.</p> <p>The singer and songwriter was awarded the Companion of Honour for a remarkable career spanning more than five decades, in which he has sold more than 300m records worldwide, and used his fame to promote the work of 23 charities, including his own Aids foundation. He becomes one of only 64 people apart from the monarch who can hold the honour at any one time.</p> <p>The musician tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m humbled and honoured to be among such highly esteemed company in receiving the Companion of Honour. 2019 has turned out to be a truly wonderful year for me and I feel extraordinarily blessed.\u201d</p> <p>Another big entertainer on the list was Olivia Newton-John. The British-born singer, campaigner and actor, best known for starring in the film Grease, was made a dame for services to charity, cancer research and entertainment.</p> <p>The honours list, which was drawn up and approved during Theresa May\u2019s premiership, rewards a glittering lineup of well-known figures from arts and sport. But the vast majority (72%) of the 1,097 to be recognised were people who work in their communities.</p> <p>This year disabled people are better represented than for many years, with 120 individuals receiving awards, 11% of the total number.</p> <p>Among those to be knighted for their work in public service, were Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the NHS in England, for his 31 years in the health service, and his \u201cvigorous public case for improved funding\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, received the Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, and a number of academics working to combat climate change were also recognised. These included Sarah Whatmore, professor of environment and public policy at the University of Oxford, who became a dame for her work addressing the threat from flooding.</p> <p>In politics, some opposition MPs criticised a knighthood being given to Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader and the architect of universal credit while he was work and pensions secretary. In April the Institute for Fiscal Studies found universal credit disproportionately reduced incomes among poorer adults.</p> <p>A Labour spokesman said it was \u201cunfortunate to see that \u2026 the primary architect of the cruel universal credit system, which has pushed thousands of people into poverty\u201d had been rewarded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe7806ebaea4dae0f86d114d1a77ca77aee8012c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe7806ebaea4dae0f86d114d1a77ca77aee8012c/0_126_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Saunders, former Director of Public Prosecutions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alison Saunders, formerly the director of public prosecutions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also likely to be controversial is the decision to make Alison Saunders, the former director of public prosecutions, a dame. She ended her five-year term as DPP in October last year amid criticism over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/26/urgent-review-of-all-cases-as-digital-evidence-is-withheld\">the collapse of several rape trials</a> after the failure of the prosecution to disclose evidence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jul/20/mps-criticise-dpp-alison-saunders-collapse-rape-trials\">A report by MPs in July 2018</a> accused her of not sufficiently recognising \u201cthe extent and seriousness of the failures of disclosure by police\u201d and the Crown Prosecution Service.</p> <p>The honours did not recognise any of the heroic actions of individuals during the recent London Bridge terrorist attack but organisers said they were expected to be considered in future lists.

      "bodyText": "Sir Elton John has received the highest acknowledgement in a new year honours list in which hundreds of ordinary people were recognised alongside household names from sport, the arts, entertainment and politics. The singer and songwriter was awarded the Companion of Honour for a remarkable career spanning more than five decades, in which he has sold more than 300m records worldwide, and used his fame to promote the work of 23 charities, including his own Aids foundation. He becomes one of only 64 people apart from the monarch who can hold the honour at any one time. The musician tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m humbled and honoured to be among such highly esteemed company in receiving the Companion of Honour. 2019 has turned out to be a truly wonderful year for me and I feel extraordinarily blessed.\u201d Another big entertainer on the list was Olivia Newton-John. The British-born singer, campaigner and actor, best known for starring in the film Grease, was made a dame for services to charity, cancer research and entertainment. The honours list, which was drawn up and approved during Theresa May\u2019s premiership, rewards a glittering lineup of well-known figures from arts and sport. But the vast majority (72%) of the 1,097 to be recognised were people who work in their communities. This year disabled people are better represented than for many years, with 120 individuals receiving awards, 11% of the total number. Among those to be knighted for their work in public service, were Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the NHS in England, for his 31 years in the health service, and his \u201cvigorous public case for improved funding\u201d. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, received the Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, and a number of academics working to combat climate change were also recognised. These included Sarah Whatmore, professor of environment and public policy at the University of Oxford, who became a dame for her work addressing the threat from flooding. In politics, some opposition MPs criticised a knighthood being given to Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader and the architect of universal credit while he was work and pensions secretary. In April the Institute for Fiscal Studies found universal credit disproportionately reduced incomes among poorer adults. A Labour spokesman said it was \u201cunfortunate to see that \u2026 the primary architect of the cruel universal credit system, which has pushed thousands of people into poverty\u201d had been rewarded. Also likely to be controversial is the decision to make Alison Saunders, the former director of public prosecutions, a dame. She ended her five-year term as DPP in October last year amid criticism over the collapse of several rape trials after the failure of the prosecution to disclose evidence. A report by MPs in July 2018 accused her of not sufficiently recognising \u201cthe extent and seriousness of the failures of disclosure by police\u201d and the Crown Prosecution Service. The honours did not recognise any of the heroic actions of individuals during the recent London Bridge terrorist attack but organisers said they were expected to be considered in future lists. More awards will be handed out early next year when the dissolution honours \u2013 drawn up by the outgoing government before a general election \u2013 are published. Honours for those involved in the aftermath of the 2017 Grenfell Tower tragedy would not be considered until the conclusion of the public inquiry. The arts were well recognised, with British director Sam Mendes being knighted for his work in film and theatre. Mendes, who has directed two Bond films as well as multiple international theatre productions, said he was \u201camazed, delighted and extremely proud\u201d. The writer Rose Tremain was made a dame, as was the Liberal Democrat peer and former children\u2019s TV presenter Floella Benjamin. The artist and director Steve McQueen, who received worldwide recognition in 2014 for his Oscar-winning film 12 Years a Slave, was knighted. In the world of sport, members of the World Cup-winning England cricket team were acknowledged, including the captain, Eoin Morgan, and vice-captain, Ben Stokes, as were leading figures in women\u2019s sport. The playwright James Graham, also known for the film Brexit: The Uncivil War, which charted the EU referendum leave campaign run by Dominic Cummings, received an OBE for services to drama and to young people in British theatre following his work at the National Youth Theatre. From the world of cookery and entertainment, the chef Ainsley Harriott and Great British Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain were made MBEs, while the food writer Nigel Slater received an OBE for services to cookery and literature. The TV presenter Gok Wan said he was \u201cexcited and humbled\u201d to be recognised in the honours. The host of How to Look Good Naked was made an MBE for services to fashion and social awareness. The youngest recipient of an award was 13, while the oldest was Wilf Oldham, 99, from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, a veteran of the Battle of Arnhem, who was made an MBE. \u201cI was very surprised, of course, because it\u2019s the last thing I ever expected,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a very humble man and I feel very proud because obviously somebody recommended me or put my name forward.\u201d D-day veteran Harry Billinge, 94, from St Austell in Cornwall, whose fundraising efforts have made headlines around the world, was made an MBE for services to charity.

Wolves\u2019s pace on the counterattack led to a surprise 2-0 win at the Etihad in October as City\u2019s defence produced a showreel of errors and uncertainty whenever the visiting team attacked. Adama Traor\u00e9 scored both of Wolves\u2019 goals and since then he has had a target on his back, with teams using rotational filth to limit the winger\u2019s impact. Will City follow suit? They\u2019re not shy of a tactical foul or two are they? </p> <p>Manchester City can\u2019t afford to drop any more points if they are to have any hope of reeling in Liverpool but with Kevin De Bruyne starting to hit top gear City are likely to improve in the second half of the season. If he can bring his brand of outrageous footballing geometry to the table this evening, one expects Wolves will ship a goal or two. Despite City playing some exquisite football as they beat Leicester last time out, Pep Guardiola has been in a bit of a grump in the buildup to this game. \u201cI wrote a letter to the Premier League to say thank you [for the fixture congestion],\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cWe are going to the fridge after Wolves to get ready for Sheffield United.\u201d</p> <p>City play two games in less than 48 hours but Wolves have it even worse. They play Liverpool \u2013 at Anfield \u2013 only 44 hours and 45 minutes after the final whistle blows this evening. That may be one reason Pep is miffed. His side will face a fresher Wolves team and Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo might fancy picking up points in this match more than the next one \u2013 which could make for some wild entertainment.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 7.45pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-27T19:31:37.045Z\">at 7.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola has popped up. Here\u2019s what he had to say: The result is what it is. Playing with 10 is difficult but against this side especially. [My team] fought incredibly. The goals couldn\u2019t be avoided. Sometimes it\u2019s fatigue. They\u2019re tired \u2026 I have no regrets. [The gap at the top] is big. We cannot think about that [the title race]. I\u2019m not sure Pep Guardiola\u2019s going to pop up anytime soon. I\u2019m guessing his mood is darker than the skies above Molineux. Anyway, Paul Doyle\u2019s match report has arrived. Have a read. What a thrilling night\u2019s football. Thanks for your emails and tweets. Bye! Here\u2019s the beaming Wolves manager Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo: It\u2019s a good night to win and perform like this. It was a fantastic game of football. Everything changed with City down to 10 men. I told my players to keep doing the same things [after City\u2019s goal] but we conceded a second goal that made it very hard but it was a fantastic reaction. [Traore] had to come inside [to have an impact]. He was not getting the ball out wide. When he is playing inside everything is tight but it was a fantastic goal [to get us back into the game]. I\u2019m always positive. As well as Wolves played, City ultimately paid the price for Ederson\u2019s sending off in the first half. Wolves are a difficult team to face with 11 men but with 10 men for 79 minutes, there was always going to be a tired error in that City defence. Wolves got better as the game wore on. Traore was immense and Jimenez was so good in all aspects of his game. His hold up play and clever touches held Wolves\u2019 play together. Wolves face Liverpool at Anfield next. One imagines this game will have taken too much out of them to cause another shock but you never know. With the Champions League places only two points away they will find energy from somewhere. Adama Traore, who really is a thorn in City\u2019s side, speaks: This team is amazing. We fight till the end. Whatever the occasion, whatever the difficulty. Every one of us has been working so hard and believing. So Manchester City are 14 points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand. Leicester remain second by a point with City in third. Molineux is a madhouse. There are huge cheers in Molineux (and Merseyside) as the final whistle blows. What a match! 90+3 min: Jimenez is substituted as Wolves look to see out the clock. There are ol\u00e9s from the Wolves fans as their players keep possession. Steady now \u2026 90+2 min: Sterling curls a delicious effort over the wall but the ball clips the bar. 90 min: There\u2019ll be four minutes for City to try and salvage a point from this. Traore barges into Sterling and gives away a free-kick on the edge of the box. It\u2019s 20 yards out in a central position. Where\u2019s De Bruyne when you need him? It looks like Sterling will hit it \u2026 They\u2019ve only gone and done it! Doherty plays a one-two with Jimenez on the edge of the box. Otamendi lunges in and misses and Doherty passes the ball into teh far corner with great composure. Is that City\u2019s title challenge well and truly knacked? 88 min: Otamendi goes down after an innocuous challenge. I imagine he\u2019s trying to take the wind out of Wolves\u2019 sails. 86 min: \u201cTraore is captivating to watch. A dazzling array of step overs, shimmies and dummies before laying off a simple five-yard pass. Imagine being out for a meal and asking him to pass the salt - 15 minutes later you\u2019re still waiting as he somersaults round the restaurant with the cellar between his bum cheeks,\u201d writes Stephen Carr (probably before Traore played a simple cross in for Jimenez\u2019s goal). I get where you\u2019re coming from though Stephen. It\u2019s like he has to do a moonwalk before everything else he does. 85 min: At least Otamendi and Bravo can say it wasn\u2019t them. 84 min: The question now is will Wolves go for the winner? Traore certainly wants to. He\u2019s pleading for the ball whenever his teammates get it. Oh Mendy! The full-back tries to shield the ball as it is drifting out of play but Traore nudges into him and scoops the ball from beneath his legs before zipping a low cross into the six-yard box for Jimenez to tap home. Guardiola will be furious with Mendy. He should have cleared it. 80 min: Neto is on in place of Jota, who has worked himself into the ground. He\u2019s quickly into the action, beating Walker and driving a low cross in to the near post, where City clear. If City hang on here it will be some win. It\u2019s been a gritty performance of 80% grit and 20% sheen. 78 min: Traore slaloms his way past Bernardo Silva and bursts towards the City box but Doherty mis-controls as Traore finds him coming up in support to his right. It\u2019s like Traore is running on a different operating system to his teammates. He\u2019s too quick for them. 77 min: It\u2019s another wonderful cross into the six-yard box that Saiss gets to again, flicking the ball towards Doherty on the back post \u2026 but a touch from Rodri on to Doherty\u2019s head prevents the Wolves defender from nodding it into the gaping goal. That was fine defending by the City midfielder. 76 min: Sterling drags Jota to the floor over near the corner flag. Moutinho is set to deliver another dangerous cross. 75 min: City have had 39% possession, which is the lowest they have ever had under Guardiola in any match. I\u2019d argue that 39% with 10 men is pretty decent. Jota drills a low cross in at the near post. City clear but back Wolves come \u2026 73 min: Wolves go so close! Moutinho whips in a delicious ball that Saiss flicks across goal and past the far post by an inch. Bravo was rooted to his line. Wolves are building up the pressure. 71 min: City are defending admirably. Wolves\u2019 only real outlet is Traore. He\u2019s not a bad outlet, mind. He\u2019s just whipped in another cross but it\u2019s too deep for Jimenez. Walker gives a free-kick away on the left. It\u2019s a decent position five yards in from the corner flag. Jonny is taken off and Vinagre is on. 69 min: Saiss has a pop at goal from distance and then Traore dances inside his marker and makes room for a shot at goal with his left foot that he buries into Bravo\u2019s belly. 68 min: City have used all their substitutes. Kyle Walker\u2019s bum is probably getting twitchy. He\u2019ll be praying that Bravo behaves himself. 67 min: And that\u2019s De Bruyne\u2019s last action of the match. Gundogan replaces him. De Bruyne looks miffed and Guardiola looks to be explaining that they have another match in about seven minutes. 66 min: De Bruyne fakes to do a dragback and then knocks the ball out his feet to make the space to shoot. But, and you\u2019ll never believe this, he drags his shot wide like any ordinary Joe might. 64 min: Traore has got his dancing shoes on now. He shimmies past two City players and dinks a cross into the box \u2026 but City clear. 63 min: Dendocker fires a shot at goal from 25 yards. It bounces in front of Bravo but the goalkeeper gets two solid gloves on it and keeps hold. 62 min: Beep! Beep! Beep! That\u2019s the sound of City\u2019s defence reversing. Wolves are pop, pop, popping passes around the edge of City\u2019s area. They work the ball out to Traore, who delivers a fine cross to Jimenez at the back post but after the striker brings the ball down with a feather-toed touch, his shot is blocked 60 min: Otamendi swipes at Jota and sends him into the air near the touchline. It\u2019s a clear foul and a booking to boot. Moutinho whips in the free-kick but this time Fernandinho heads clear. 59 min: Moutinho whips it in and Otamendi heads into the air for Bravo to collect. De Bruyne wants an early throw from Bravo so City can break but the goalkeeper\u2019s having none of it. 58 min: Wolves win a free-kick wide on the left. It\u2019s a lovely angle to curl one in from. 56 min: A moment before that goal, Jimenez fired wide by a couple of inches. It\u2019s wide open now. We\u2019ll be seeing more goals. I\u2019m sure of that. Sterling is loose in possession. Traore picks the ball up just outside the box and drives at goal before hammering home across Bravo and into the far corner. That was an unerring finish. Game on! 52 min: Jota goes down after a coming together with Walker in the box. Jonny hits the deck a moment later after feeling a push from Rodri. There\u2019s a VAR check on both but \u201cNo Penalty\u201d is the decision. I think VAR is right but who knows these days. What a goal this is! Rodri drops deep to collect the ball in midfield. He turns and slides the ball towards De Bruyne, who slices the Wolves defence open with a first-time pass behind Dendoncker to Sterling. The forwards scurries into the box and lifts the ball over Rui Patricio with nonchalant ease. Fantastic! 49 min: City enjoy a spell of possession before Otamendi gifts the ball back to Wolves with an errant punt forwards. 47 min: Jota stabs over the bar after Jimenez scooped a delightful ball over the defence and into the little forward\u2019s path. He had to hit it on the half-volley so it wasn\u2019t easy but he was only 15 yards out and Bravo was beaten if he\u2019d controlled it. What a chance! 45 min: The 18-year-old defender Eric Garcia is on for Riyad Mahrez. This could be a slog of a second half for City, who will likely play 5-3-1 now. Justin Kavanagh is back for more! \u201cScrap the Christmas Carol narrative, Gregg. What with Pep\u2019s team now getting a taste of its own weekly medicine (having to defend for 90 minutes), this has turned into A Tale of Two Cities. And we\u2019ll see just how good the other one is now.\u201d To be fair to them, they have been very solid but I fancy there will be an Oh Claudio! or Oh Nicolas! moment before the game is done. Half-time hot takes \u201cEarlier this season Jefferson Lerma stepped on David Silva\u2019s foot in the penalty area and VAR looked at it and decided it wasn\u2019t a penalty. Great job all around!\u201d writes JR in Illinois. \u201cBut really, you\u2019ve got to laugh at the way VAR has been rolled out. I really shouldn\u2019t be surprised considering the own goal of Brexit that y\u2019all have inflicted on yourselves but yet somehow still am. (And I also understand that no one from the US should be laughing at anyone else considering what we\u2019ve got cooking over here).\u201d \u201cWhen Pep said earlier today that replacing Aguero would be a tough task, I think nobody would have put a penny on Claudio Bravo being the man,\u201d honks Admir Pajic. \u201cWhat a thankless task you have, in simply trying to describe a football game that many of your readers don\u2019t have the benefit of watching,\u201d writes Charles Robinson. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if Peter Adams had his tongue in his cheek earlier, but was Ederson\u2019s contact on Jota minimal? Yes, but he clipped his shoulder, and it was a sending off. Was the contact on Mahrez from Dendonker minimal? Yes, but he trod on his foot, so it was a penalty. Should the penalty have been retaken? Yes, because two Wolves players were in the box when Sterling took it. Was the decision, as you describe it, \u2018overly fussy\u2019? Perhaps, but it was still correct. All the key decisions from VAR have so far been spot on, and you\u2019ve called it right.\u201d I think Peter\u2019s tongue was firmly in cheek, earlier, Charles. \u201cSince encroachment is a technical offence and doesn\u2019t really put off the taker, it seems harsh to award another penalty. Maybe an indirect free kick from where the defender makes the clearance would be fairer,\u201d writes Tom in New Zealand. Well, that was eventful. City have defended with Ben\u00edtez-like efficiency since being reduced to 10 men. I\u2019ll be back with your half-time missives when I\u2019ve made a cuppa. 45+7 min: City play the free-kick deep. Wolves win the ball back but play a long ball into the corner that runs out of play \u2013 and that should be that for this half. 45+6 min: Moutinho slides in and brings Sterling down and City should get the chance to survive until half-time. 45+4 min: Traore scuffs a shot wide from the edge of the area and then Jota tries to dribble through the City defence but is stopped by Otamendi. City are clinging on for half-time. They\u2019re just hoofing it clear when they regain possession. Back come Wolves \u2026 45+2 min: Bernardo chests the ball and is penalised for handball out by the touchline on the right. That was never handball. What a ridiculous decision! Moutinho floats the free-kick in and City clear. The ball is knocked back in towards Coady on the back post but he can\u2019t stretch to reach it. 45 min: Neves bangs a shot at goal from somewhere near Birmingham and Bravo saves easily. That was a waste. It\u2019s like he hit that out of anger at everything that has gone before it in this evening\u2019s game. There\u2019ll be seven minutes of injury/VAR time. Yikes! 44 min: Moutinho curls a delicious ball forwards to Jimenez\u2019s feet. The striker takes a touch and creates space for a curler, but his shot doesn\u2019t have any venom in it and floats into Bravo\u2019s grateful gloves. 43 min: Jonny dinks a cross in towards Jimenez from the left, but Bravo collects comfortably. 42 min: \u201cOn Wolves, every time the commentator says \u2018Here\u2019s Jonny\u2019 I chuckle to myself, especially when you consider the dark mood at Molineux at the moment.\u201d Ciaran Boland lightens the mood. 40 min: Wolves are increasing the tempo and making it very difficult for City to keep possession. Even De Bruyne struggled to find his way out of a tight spot then. Doherty hooks a cross into the box, it\u2019s hoofed into the air by Otamendi and then is scrambled away. Jonny curls a cross in from the left that Traore volleys into a City defender and then City clear. Back come Wolves, though. They\u2019re building up a head of steam \u2026 37 min: Wolves have appeared a little shellshocked since the penalty incident. They haven\u2019t been able to get going. City\u2019s shape has been very good, mind. I think Wolves\u2019 best chance of getting back in this game will be committing to a high press. There\u2019s a mistake in Otamendi and Bravo. 35 min: \u201cSo just to be sure Gregg; it was minimal contact on Jota and a definite red. It was minimal contact on Mahrez and it\u2019s harsh penalty. Does that Wolves shirt you got for Christmas fit well?\u201d scolds Peter Adams. It\u2019s a bit small Peter. I might have to take it back. I think the difference is that Dendoncker appeared to be running in step with Mahrez and not deliberately challenging him. But I do understand why it was given. Had his heel not been clipped he wouldn\u2019t have fallen over. 32 min: Bravo has just had a wobble. Jimenez put the press on the substitute goalkeeper, who walloped the ball out of play. There\u2019s also been confirmation that a drinks container was thrown at Sterling after the City forward scored. 30 min: Boos are cascading down from the Molineux stands. It\u2019s a moody atmosphere now. One thing I can say is that City\u2019s approach after going a man down was laudable. They continued to probe patiently and were rewarded for sticking to their gameplan. It\u2019s up to Wolves to play with greater intensity now. They will have to wear City down. 28 min: Well, what an odd 10 minutes that was. There were so many delays but ultimately if you look back at each incident VAR probably got them right, even if the awarding of the penalty and the demand for it to be retaken appeared overly fussy. Well this is incredible. Rui Patricio goes the same way again and saves \u2026 but this time the ball lands back at Sterling\u2019s feet and the City forward taps home. The Wolves fans are hopping mad and a supporter appears to have thrown something on to the pitch. 23 min: Rui Patricio dives low to his right and saves it from Sterling. But hang on. It\u2019s going to retaken. There was some encroachment it seems. 22 min: After a number of checks it is given! I can understand why but it seems harsh. Sterling will take it. 20 min: City appeal for a penalty as Mahrez goes down in the box. Atkinson waves it away. It looked like Mahrez threw himself down after a Dendoncker\u2019s arm leant on his shoulder but from another angle it appears that Mahrez\u2019s heel was clipped accidentally. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a penalty but VAR are checking it. 19 min: Jimenez flicks the corner on at the near post, Doherty flicks the ball at goal from a tight angle but Bravo collects comfortably. 17 min: It looks like Sterling has gone up front on his own in a 4-1-3-1 formation. Although that formation could change 99 times before the game is done. Wolves win a corner after Traore wallops a cross against Mendy. 15 min: Moutinho knocks a tame free-kick straight into Bravo\u2019s midriff. We\u2019ll see how good City are in possession now they are down to 10 men. 13 min: Ederson trudges off while we\u2019re waiting for Bravo to get changed. It\u2019s Aguero who is sacrificed after only 13 minutes. Bravo will face a free-kick from 25 yards out on the left side of the box when he comes on. Kyle Walker would definitely save it. 11 min: My oh my! Coady pings a long ball to Jota, catching City napping after the restart. Ederson comes rushing out of his box and after Jota knocks the ball over the City keeper, Ederson collides with him. It was a definite red. 8 min: Mendy and Dendoncker have clashed heads. I think both should be OK but they\u2019re getting checked over as you can\u2019t be too careful. It came after Traore was tracked by Sterling, who nudged the Wolves winger over deep in the City half. Nuno wanted a foul and after looking at a replay it looked like Wolves deserved one. 6 min: Traore stretches his legs for the first time. It came after Coady pinged a long ball forwards that City only half cleared. Jimenez found Traore to the right of him. The winger found the byline but just overran the ball by a few inches. Goal-kick. It\u2019s all very tame. 4 min: The game has very quickly settled into a Manchester City exhibition in sterile possession. But after a couple of minutes Otamendi wallops the ball out of play under pressure to huge cheers from the home fans. 3 min: Justin Kavanagh is not a fan of 2019-20 Pep: \u201cWhat with the sarcastically exaggerated handshakes to officials, and now the faux letters to the League in thanks for Yuletide fixture congestion, Pep Guardiola is becoming a bit of a footballing Ebenezer Scrooge. He needs a visit from Don Revie (the ghost of fixture pile-ups past) or even J\u00fcrgen Klopp (pile-ups present\u2026and yet they\u2019re still winning) to get over himself. Otherwise I foresee his ghost of Christmas future as being the next Mourhino (and one of them is enough for any narrative).\u201d 1 min: Manchester City get the game under way. They\u2019re shooting from left to right on my TV, so make a picture of that in your heads. Sterling immediately tries to dribble his way into a shooting position on the left corner of the 18-yard box, but Doherty gets an important foot in the way and halts his progress. That\u2019s a sharp start by City. Here come the teams. Wolves, in black tracksuit tops covering their glorious gold shirts, are led out by the underrated Conor Coady. Manchester City, in 1980s-style light blue/dark blue tops over their famous sky blue shirts, are marched out on to the turf by captain Fernandinho. There\u2019s a cracking atmosphere. The home fans are up for this. So am I! It\u2019s almost time for kick-off and it\u2019s like middle earth at Molineux, where the air is dripping with mist. It\u2019s a proper football night. David Wall preferred the good old days of, um, 2016: \u201cI know it sounds a bit curmudgeonly but am I the only person who feels something is missing from the past two and a half seasons where you effectively have to win every game in order to win the title? True, City and Liverpool hitting such prolonged periods of excellence is admirable, but are either side one that supporters will really love in future? It used to be the case that you could lose a number of games in a season but, if you put together a run of 10-12 wins from around March you\u2019d be in with a good chance of the title. It meant that in the first half of the season you could relax a bit when watching matches, just enjoy them, because you knew that the odd dropped points could be caught up later on. But now it\u2019s tension from the very first game, with any draw becoming a major set-back, and any defeat almost a crisis. I suppose Liverpool supporters won\u2019t complain when they get the title at the end of the season, but they were more fun to watch when they had a little inconsistency, and a poor performance might not just end in a win nonetheless.\u201d Nuno speaks: \u201cManchester City are an outstanding team with outstanding players. Let\u2019s not forget that we have to play. We have to play. They are a very good team and they will test us.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound like Wolves are going to sit back does it? This could be very entertaining. I\u2019m watching highlights of Kevin De Bruyne. The incredible thing about him is that whenever he shoots, if he misses, it is only by inches. You never see him sky a shot or wildly overhit a pass. Everything is measured. If he\u2019s off target the likelihood is that one of his shots or passes will still cause the opposition an awful lot of trouble. Pep Guardiola speaks: \u201cWolves\u2019 consistency for two seasons is incredible,\u201d he says. Of trying to stop Adama Traore he has this to say: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. You need a motorcycle. He has a pace that no other player in the world has.\u201d On the subject of fast-tracking Aguero back into the starting lineup after injury, he says he didn\u2019t have a choice as to whether he should play him or not. \u201cJesus was sick.\u201d Adama Traore\u2019s great fun isn\u2019t he? He plays football at a million miles an hour. Every dribble is like a thrash-metal solo. There\u2019s a nice interview with Nuno playing on Amazon at the moment. He credits his managerial nous to being a reserve goalkeeper for such a long time. He says he learned \u201cbench experience\u201d sat on the sidelines watching managers make mistakes. Carlo Nash should be a modern-day Shankly if this is true. In case you\u2019re wondering why Gabriel Jesus is missing from City\u2019s squad, he\u2019s ill. That\u2019s why you should get your winter flu jab, folks! Harry Redknapp believes Liverpool ended City\u2019s title hopes last night. Is that true? It\u2019s staggering to even be talking about the title race being over before we\u2019ve entered the new year. If there\u2019s one team that can put a run of wins together long enough to close the gap and make it interesting it\u2019s City. But Liverpool have taken 79 points from a possible 81 going back to last season. That\u2019s ludicrous really. Is Guardiola taking a risk starting Ag\u00fcero tonight? As good as he is, he\u2019s been out for the best part of five weeks. He does tend to pick up recurring injuries. Mind you, if he\u2019s only 90% fit he will still be lethal given half a chance. Here\u2019s a reminder of what happened at the Etihad in October. City fans, you might want to watch highlights of your club\u2019s greatest moment instead. Wolves: Rui Patricio, Dendoncker, Coady, Saiss, Doherty, Neves, Joao Moutinho, Jonny, Traore, Jimenez, Jota. Subs: Vallejo, Bennett, Pedro Neto, Cutrone, Ruddy, Ruben Vinagre, Kilman. Man City: Ederson, Walker, Fernandinho, Otamendi, Mendy, De Bruyne, Rodri, Bernardo Silva, Mahrez, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Gundogan, Zinchenko, Jose Angelino, Joao Cancelo, Foden, Garcia. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire) Predicting lineups at this stage of the season can be tricky but at least the two players I mentioned in my preamble are starting. I\u2019ll take that. They are two very strong starting XIs. Hello! The feast of festive football continues, readers \u2013 and this evening\u2019s game could be a Christmas cracker. Wolves\u2019s pace on the counterattack led to a surprise 2-0 win at the Etihad in October as City\u2019s defence produced a showreel of errors and uncertainty whenever the visiting team attacked. Adama Traor\u00e9 scored both of Wolves\u2019 goals and since then he has had a target on his back, with teams using rotational filth to limit the winger\u2019s impact. Will City follow suit? They\u2019re not shy of a tactical foul or two are they? Manchester City can\u2019t afford to drop any more points if they are to have any hope of reeling in Liverpool but with Kevin De Bruyne starting to hit top gear City are likely to improve in the second half of the season. If he can bring his brand of outrageous footballing geometry to the table this evening, one expects Wolves will ship a goal or two. Despite City playing some exquisite football as they beat Leicester last time out, Pep Guardiola has been in a bit of a grump in the buildup to this game. \u201cI wrote a letter to the Premier League to say thank you [for the fixture congestion],\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cWe are going to the fridge after Wolves to get ready for Sheffield United.\u201d City play two games in less than 48 hours but Wolves have it even worse. They play Liverpool \u2013 at Anfield \u2013 only 44 hours and 45 minutes after the final whistle blows this evening. That may be one reason Pep is miffed. His side will face a fresher Wolves team and Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo might fancy picking up points in this match more than the next one \u2013 which could make for some wild entertainment. Kick-off: 7.45pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>If this is where Manchester City practically lost their title, at least they can say they did not relinquish it without a fight. But, not for the first time this season, they lacked sangfroid in the heat of this extraordinary battle and that cost them dearly. It is, in fairness, very hard to stay cool when being attacked by this excellent Wolves team \u2013 and when trying to chase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/26/liverpool-leicester-premier-league-brendan-rodgers-jurgen-klopp\" title=\"\">down Liverpool</a>, who are now 14 points clear of City with a match in hand.</p> <p>Given the size of that lead, Pep Guardiola says his team\u2019s most realistic ambition is to reclaim second place from Leicester. He said if they relent in their pursuit, they risk missing out on the top four. \u201cWe cannot prioritise cup competitions because if so, next season we will not be in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to think about Leicester. We have a chance to recover second position.\u201d</p> <p>For a while it looked like City would triumph here with the aid of VAR and over remarkable adversity, including self-inflicted wounds. Ederson was sent off in the 12th minute for clattering into Diogo Jota outside his area, then Raheem Sterling had the same contentiously awarded penalty saved twice by Rui Patr\u00edcio. Yet still 10-man City established a two-goal lead. First Sterling rolled in the rebound from his retaken penalty, then he scored in the second half to move tantalisingly close to victory.</p> <p>But not close enough. Wolves, again inspired by the phenomenal Adama Traor\u00e9, came storming back with three exquisite goals in the last 35 minutes. Traor\u00e9 scored the first of them before creating an equaliser for Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, who later played a beautiful pass to tee up Matt Doherty for a winning goal that ignited wild celebrations at Molineux. And, no doubt, on Merseyside.</p> <p>Guardiola\u2019s plans ran into a complication even before kick-off here, as illness afflicted Gabriel Jesus and forced City to draft in Sergio Ag\u00fcero. An aristocrat\u2019s problem if ever there was one, but City had wanted to ease their record goalscorer back into action after a thigh injury and would have preferred not to make this the match in which he made his first start for over two months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/dec/27/wolves-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live\">Wolves v Manchester City: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As it turned out, Ag\u00fcero was invited to rest up again after only 12 minutes, as Guardiola had to sacrifice him to introduce a replacement goalkeeper following the dismissal of Ederson. The referee, Martin Atkinson, ordered the keeper off after he charged out of his box and brought down Jota, who beat him to a pass over the top by Conor Coady. In came Claudio Bravo for his first Premier League appearance since November\u2019s defeat at Liverpool. Jo\u00e3o Moutinho\u2019s free-kick made for a comfortable reintroduction. Neither manager grumbled about the red card, nor would they offer their views on what happened in the 22nd minute \u2013 but the home crowd were not coy about expressing their anger at the decision to award City a penalty when Riyad Mahrez fell spectacularly in the box following contact with Leander Dendoncker. The infringement was not apparent to most people in the stadium but this is the age of mass surveillance: VAR spotted Dendoncker treading on the Algerian\u2019s foot.</p> <p>Patr\u00edcio saved Sterling\u2019s penalty but then, again on the recommendation of VAR, the referee ordered it to be retaken due to encroachment. Patr\u00edcio made another save but was helpless to stop the relieved Sterling from stroking in the rebound. A few bozos in the stands vented their anger by flinging objects on to the pitch. The Football Association has opened an investigation.</p> <p>City did well to protect their lead until half-time. Guardiola replaced Mahrez during the break with 18-year-old Eric Garcia as City buttressed their defence.

      "bodyText": "If this is where Manchester City practically lost their title, at least they can say they did not relinquish it without a fight. But, not for the first time this season, they lacked sangfroid in the heat of this extraordinary battle and that cost them dearly. It is, in fairness, very hard to stay cool when being attacked by this excellent Wolves team \u2013 and when trying to chase down Liverpool, who are now 14 points clear of City with a match in hand. Given the size of that lead, Pep Guardiola says his team\u2019s most realistic ambition is to reclaim second place from Leicester. He said if they relent in their pursuit, they risk missing out on the top four. \u201cWe cannot prioritise cup competitions because if so, next season we will not be in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to think about Leicester. We have a chance to recover second position.\u201d For a while it looked like City would triumph here with the aid of VAR and over remarkable adversity, including self-inflicted wounds. Ederson was sent off in the 12th minute for clattering into Diogo Jota outside his area, then Raheem Sterling had the same contentiously awarded penalty saved twice by Rui Patr\u00edcio. Yet still 10-man City established a two-goal lead. First Sterling rolled in the rebound from his retaken penalty, then he scored in the second half to move tantalisingly close to victory. But not close enough. Wolves, again inspired by the phenomenal Adama Traor\u00e9, came storming back with three exquisite goals in the last 35 minutes. Traor\u00e9 scored the first of them before creating an equaliser for Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, who later played a beautiful pass to tee up Matt Doherty for a winning goal that ignited wild celebrations at Molineux. And, no doubt, on Merseyside. Guardiola\u2019s plans ran into a complication even before kick-off here, as illness afflicted Gabriel Jesus and forced City to draft in Sergio Ag\u00fcero. An aristocrat\u2019s problem if ever there was one, but City had wanted to ease their record goalscorer back into action after a thigh injury and would have preferred not to make this the match in which he made his first start for over two months. As it turned out, Ag\u00fcero was invited to rest up again after only 12 minutes, as Guardiola had to sacrifice him to introduce a replacement goalkeeper following the dismissal of Ederson. The referee, Martin Atkinson, ordered the keeper off after he charged out of his box and brought down Jota, who beat him to a pass over the top by Conor Coady. In came Claudio Bravo for his first Premier League appearance since November\u2019s defeat at Liverpool. Jo\u00e3o Moutinho\u2019s free-kick made for a comfortable reintroduction. Neither manager grumbled about the red card, nor would they offer their views on what happened in the 22nd minute \u2013 but the home crowd were not coy about expressing their anger at the decision to award City a penalty when Riyad Mahrez fell spectacularly in the box following contact with Leander Dendoncker. The infringement was not apparent to most people in the stadium but this is the age of mass surveillance: VAR spotted Dendoncker treading on the Algerian\u2019s foot. Patr\u00edcio saved Sterling\u2019s penalty but then, again on the recommendation of VAR, the referee ordered it to be retaken due to encroachment. Patr\u00edcio made another save but was helpless to stop the relieved Sterling from stroking in the rebound. A few bozos in the stands vented their anger by flinging objects on to the pitch. The Football Association has opened an investigation. City did well to protect their lead until half-time. Guardiola replaced Mahrez during the break with 18-year-old Eric Garcia as City buttressed their defence. Wolves soon showed the tempo that the youngster would have to get used to, as Jim\u00e9nez and Jota cut through City\u2019s backline with wicked finesse. Jota flicked the ball over the bar after running on to the Mexican\u2019s lovely looped pass. Soon Sterling produced an even finer chip. After being released by Kevin De Bruyne, Sterling ran into the box and did what he had been unable to do from the penalty spot, beating Patr\u00edcio with a deadly dink. That gave City an extra cushion but they could not sit comfortably for long. Five minutes later Sterling lost possession in midfield to R\u00faben Neves, who helped the ball on to Traor\u00e9, whose devastating directness City have learned to dread. After scoring twice at the Etihad, he slashed City\u2019s lead here by ramming a long-range shot into the bottom corner. Wolves attacked in waves after that. Traor\u00e9 almost found a way through them again but was foiled by Bravo. City enjoyed a let-off as Romain Sa\u00efss nodded wide from six yards. Then Rodri made a critical intervention at the back post to deny Doherty. As City clung on, Benjamin Mendy tried to shepherd the ball out of play near the byline, a decision that Traor\u00e9 soon made him regret.

      "bodyText": "A plane carrying almost 100 people has crashed near Almaty airport in Kazakhstan, killing at least 12 and injuring more than 60. Almaty airport said on Friday morning that survivors and emergency workers were on the scene in Almerek village, just beyond the end of the runway. Footage from the site, which was cordoned off, appeared to show the Fokker 100 plane had hit a building. The plane, Bek Air flight number Z92100, was carrying 93 passengers and five crew. Emergency services searched through the rubble in the immediate aftermath of the crash. Some survivors managed to stumble from the wreckage. Kazakhstan has declared a national day of mourning on Saturday for the victims of the crash. The government has promised a full investigation and declared safety inspections at all the country\u2019s airlines. An official said the crash had been caused either by equipment failure or pilot error. Among those killed was Dana Kruglova, a 35-year-old editor of the Informburo.kz website. In a post, the site said Kruglova had been travelling from Almaty to the capital, Nur-Sultan, to celebrate the New Year holiday with her parents. \u201cDana Kruglova was a real journalist,\u201d the site\u2019s editor, Mikhail Dorofeyev, wrote. \u201cDana was honest, brave and objective at the same time. This is a terrible loss for all of us.\u201d A survivor told the news website Tengrinews she had heard a \u201cterrifying sound\u201d before the plane started losing altitude. \u201cThe plane was flying with a tilt. Everything was like in a movie: screaming, shouting, people crying,\u201d she said. Another survivor, Aslan Nazaraliyev, a businessman, told the Vremya newspaper the plane had started shaking while gaining altitude about two minutes after takeoff. \u201cAt some point we started falling, not vertically, but at an angle. It seemed like control over the plane was lost,\u201d he said. The president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, pledged to provide families of the victims with compensation and tweeted that those responsible \u201cwill be severely punished in accordance with the law\u201d. Tokayev also said a government commission had been set up to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy. The families of the victims were promised compensation of 4m tenge (\u00a38,000). While airline safety has been a concern in Kazakhstan, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) gave the country an award in October for \u201cprogress in resolving aviation security and oversight deficiencies\u201d. The country\u2019s aviation service had done \u201ccomprehensive work in aviation security development\u201d, the ICAO said. Friday\u2019s crash is Kazakhstan\u2019s deadliest since 2013, when a Bombardier CRJ200 operated by SCAT Airlines crashed on approach to Almaty airport, killing all 21 people on board. The country\u2019s previous worst crash since independence came on Christmas Day 2012, when an Antonov An-72-100 run by the country\u2019s military crashed near the city of Shymkent, killing 27 on board, including top members of the border guard service. The Bek Air flight took off from Almaty, Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city, at 7.22am local time on Friday. Kazakhstan\u2019s civil aviation committee said the aircraft had \u201clost altitude during takeoff and broke through a concrete fence\u201d before hitting a small building. Almaty health authorities initially put the death toll at 15 or more but revised the figure down to 12. The committee said 66 people had been taken to hospital. The Almaty mayor\u2019s office said at least 22 of the injured were in critical condition. Officials called for blood donations to help the survivors. A Reuters reporter travelling to the airport said there was thick fog in the area. Flightradar24 said that at the time of takeoff there was fog and the air temperature was -9C (15.8F), with very little wind. Bek Air operates a fleet of Fokker 100 jets. The aviation committee said it was suspending all flights of that type of aircraft pending an investigation. The government said the crashed plane was built in 1996 and its most recent flight certificate was issued in May 2019. Kazakhstan\u2019s interior ministry said it was investigating a possible breach of flight operations and safety rules.",

Bishop, who often used the hashtag \u201cfashion diplomacy\u201d in her social media posts, formalised the relationship between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the industry body in a memorandum of understanding in 2015. Regardless of what you think of her policies, her signature tailored corporate chic provided an inspiration to women workers across Australia, with a wardrobe featuring everything from power shoulders and pant suits to sequins and evening gowns.</p> <h2>Gentrified surfers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"20e917857c8ec0d35c91cf6bd3ccec43a9de1683\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20e917857c8ec0d35c91cf6bd3ccec43a9de1683/0_228_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Models pose in creations by Double Rainbouu during Fashion Week Australia in Sydney on May 15, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hawaiian shirts have had a makeover courtesy of Double Rainbouu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Who knew the Hawaiian shirt would have a reboot via Bondi?

This decade Byron Bay emerged as the epicentre for the boho chic look that has dominated our beaches and bars, championed by local labels such as Arnhem, The Goddess of Babylon, Amalita and The Freedom State. The queens of the hippy look that brought Byron\u2019s relaxed dressing and free-spirited existence to the masses were sisters Isabella Pennefather and Elizabeth Abegg of Spell &amp; The Gypsy Collective. The duo began at Byron\u2019s local markets in 2009 with crochet dresses, fringing and festival-ready fashion and, over the past 10 years, their garments have made their way into some of the world\u2019s top stores (Shopbop, Urban Outfitters, Free People) and into the closets of women across Australia who wanted to live the nomadic Kombi, yoga and kombucha dream \u2013 even while residing in the big smoke.</p> <h2><br>Club Med</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Lindy Rama-Ellis wearing her own line of resortwear.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

They are all shown off on Instagram, inspiring a boom in resort and destination dressing. <br><br>\u201cTen years ago if you went on holiday to a tropical island it was always cut-off denim shorts and a tank, but now thanks to Instagram people are meticulously planning fashion outfits for social media,\u201d says Lindy Rama-Ellis, who has the resort brand Rama Voyage.<br></p> <h2>Licensed and deadly</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A dress by fashion label Lore.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Although the works were reproduced under license, <a href=\"https://genprogress.org/fashion-line-refuses-to-reveal-aboriginal-artist-behind-newest-collection/\">Rodarte never credited the Pintupi artist</a>. Since that misstep, plenty of labels subsequently have given credit <em>and</em> cash where it is due.</p> <p>The rise of digital printing has made it easier to bring complex artwork to life on clothing, at a more affordable price. A number of brands, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous owned, have employed this technology to showcase First Nations Australian art on garments. Rebooted in 2013, 80s favourite Desert Designs features the artwork of Jimmy Pike, while BRACKS celebrates Torres Strait, South Sea Islander and Aboriginal cultures through their best-selling polo shirts for men.<br><br>Shannon Brett, a descendant of the Wakka Wakka, Budjula and Gurang Gurang clans, founded her label Lore with a vision to work with art centres across the country. She showed at London Pacific Fashion Week in 2018. The same year, Lyn-Al Young partnered with David Jones on a NAIDOC week fashion collection, and in 2019 Melbourne brand Gorman partnered with the WA-based Mangkaja Arts Resource Agency to produce a capsule collection featuring the prints of five artists \u2013 Ngarralja Tommy May, Sonia Kurarra, Daisy Japulija, Nada Tigila Rawlins and Lisa Uhl \u2013 which the Australian Copyright Agency described as \u201ca benchmark for future fashion licensing agreements\u201d.</p> <h2>Hype marsupials</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A look from Melbourne label Perks and Mini\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

The unisex label Cocurata launched in 2015, founded by Ksubi alumni George Gorrow and New York-based gallerist George Benias, to exist somewhere between an art project and a fashion house.</p> <p>Feit made \u201cneo luxury\u201d hand-crafted leather trainers for men and women and now has stores in Sydney and New York. The brand was founded by brothers Josh and Tull Price, who created cult London-based sneaker brand Royal Elastics in 1996, then sold it in 2012.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/23/worst-trends-decade-ranked-2010s\">What were we thinking?

Perth-based Butter Goods specialises in skatewear, while Penny Skateboards create the actual boards, a new take on the classic longboard in plastic rather than plywood.<br></p> <h2>Carbon neutrals</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5L49oEBc6J/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "In the 2010s, Australian fashion had its own subcultures, each with favoured designers and brands. There was some overlap \u2013 those that go to the races are known to vacation in Positano \u2013 but for many Australians, getting dressed is as much about personal identity as specific trends. While some were influenced by fashion globally, other looks were purely homegrown. Ladies who Lycra The active wear market boomed this decade as yoga and fitness studios popped up faster than you could say \u201cnamaste\u201d. It was no wonder Australians embraced the Lycra-led movement with particular zeal, given our love of sport, beaches and the great outdoors. With PE Nation by Pip Edwards, Stylerunner, The Upside and First Base among the local fashionable fitness brands that entered the (sporting) arena, working out became as much about dressing in designer duds as it did about deadlifts or downward dogs. \u201cI was so uninspired by what was out there because I wanted something new and trend-setting to wear when I was doing Bikram yoga,\u201d says Stylerunner founder Julie Stevanja. \u201cI knew the opportunity was huge because if I wanted this activewear there must be other women out there who felt the same way.\u201d She was right. Show ponies Some may have started saying #nuptothecup, but bright colours, short skirts and sharp tailoring \u2013 like Aeroguard and Golden Gaytimes \u2013 are a perennial at the Melbourne Cup Carnival. Championed by Melbourne racing style royalty including Rebecca Judd, Jesinta Franklin and Jennifer Hawkins, the peplums, bold prints and fascinators that make up Australian race wear proved they have more staying power than Black Caviar, dominating the front pages of tabloid newspapers across the country as well as the racks of Myer and David Jones year after year. Diplomatic dressers When Julie Bishop was named by Tony Abbott as foreign affairs minister in 2013, she appointed herself an unofficial ambassador for Australian designers, wearing their creations frequently while overseas at glittering events. She earned herself the nickname \u201cMinister for Fashion\u201d and soon enough she sort of became one, after helping Vogue Australia editor in chief Edwina McCann found the Australian Fashion Council. Bishop, who often used the hashtag \u201cfashion diplomacy\u201d in her social media posts, formalised the relationship between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the industry body in a memorandum of understanding in 2015. Regardless of what you think of her policies, her signature tailored corporate chic provided an inspiration to women workers across Australia, with a wardrobe featuring everything from power shoulders and pant suits to sequins and evening gowns. Gentrified surfers Who knew the Hawaiian shirt would have a reboot via Bondi? Double Rainbouu\u2019s colourful, print-driven designs became the go-to for Aussie festival dudes and surfer gents after Mikey Nolan and Toby Jones came up with the idea of reinventing the holiday staple while taking a break in Thailand. \u201cWe saw a gap in the market for doing Hawaiian shirts in a fresh, contemporary way,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cBeachwear makes sense coming from Australia and people in the international market look to us for print and colour.\u201d The vacay vibe continued with brands such as Holiday the Label, which produced pastel puff paint T-shirts, caps and swimmers featuring slogans like \u201cBeach Bum\u201d, \u201cHoliday\u201d and \u201cLifestyles of the Bored and Aimless\u201d. High end menswear brand Commas also dished up some seriously luxe Hawaiian shirts and boardies, and even surf wear stalwart Rip Curl got in on the wave of Splices, sunscreen and sandy toes with its $350m sale to Kathmandu in October. Byron babes Forget the big cities \u2013 by 2019 Australia\u2019s new fashion capital had firmly cemented itself. This decade Byron Bay emerged as the epicentre for the boho chic look that has dominated our beaches and bars, championed by local labels such as Arnhem, The Goddess of Babylon, Amalita and The Freedom State. The queens of the hippy look that brought Byron\u2019s relaxed dressing and free-spirited existence to the masses were sisters Isabella Pennefather and Elizabeth Abegg of Spell &amp; The Gypsy Collective. The duo began at Byron\u2019s local markets in 2009 with crochet dresses, fringing and festival-ready fashion and, over the past 10 years, their garments have made their way into some of the world\u2019s top stores (Shopbop, Urban Outfitters, Free People) and into the closets of women across Australia who wanted to live the nomadic Kombi, yoga and kombucha dream \u2013 even while residing in the big smoke. Club Med From June to August you\u2019re either the person enduring the Australian winter, scrolling through the Instagram feeds of friends and influencers sipping spritzes in Positano, or you are that smug person, documenting your Euro odyssey with carefully curated snaps. The European holiday season became synonymous with the outfit choices of Australian socialites such as Nicky Oatley and Deborah Symond, and back at home over summer you couldn\u2019t get far in Bondi or St Kilda without seeing Lucy Folk\u2019s sunglasses strung on a cord, shortie linen dresses by Alex and Trahanas or Matteau\u2019s liberty-print tiered sundresses. They are all shown off on Instagram, inspiring a boom in resort and destination dressing. \u201cTen years ago if you went on holiday to a tropical island it was always cut-off denim shorts and a tank, but now thanks to Instagram people are meticulously planning fashion outfits for social media,\u201d says Lindy Rama-Ellis, who has the resort brand Rama Voyage. Licensed and deadly In 2012, US fashion darlings Rodarte found themselves in hot water over the use of prints from the estate of Benny Tjangala. Although the works were reproduced under license, Rodarte never credited the Pintupi artist. Since that misstep, plenty of labels subsequently have given credit and cash where it is due. The rise of digital printing has made it easier to bring complex artwork to life on clothing, at a more affordable price. A number of brands, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous owned, have employed this technology to showcase First Nations Australian art on garments. Rebooted in 2013, 80s favourite Desert Designs features the artwork of Jimmy Pike, while BRACKS celebrates Torres Strait, South Sea Islander and Aboriginal cultures through their best-selling polo shirts for men. Shannon Brett, a descendant of the Wakka Wakka, Budjula and Gurang Gurang clans, founded her label Lore with a vision to work with art centres across the country. She showed at London Pacific Fashion Week in 2018. The same year, Lyn-Al Young partnered with David Jones on a NAIDOC week fashion collection, and in 2019 Melbourne brand Gorman partnered with the WA-based Mangkaja Arts Resource Agency to produce a capsule collection featuring the prints of five artists \u2013 Ngarralja Tommy May, Sonia Kurarra, Daisy Japulija, Nada Tigila Rawlins and Lisa Uhl \u2013 which the Australian Copyright Agency described as \u201ca benchmark for future fashion licensing agreements\u201d. Hype marsupials As Off-White, Vetements and Supreme led the global rise of streetwear, Australia entered the hypebeast fray, with local brands creating cult caps, hoodies, kicks and even skateboards. At the pointy end of the market Song for the Mute and Chronicles of Never emerged for Style Zeitgeist-types, manufacturing their moody garments almost entirely in black. The unisex label Cocurata launched in 2015, founded by Ksubi alumni George Gorrow and New York-based gallerist George Benias, to exist somewhere between an art project and a fashion house. Feit made \u201cneo luxury\u201d hand-crafted leather trainers for men and women and now has stores in Sydney and New York. The brand was founded by brothers Josh and Tull Price, who created cult London-based sneaker brand Royal Elastics in 1996, then sold it in 2012. \u201cI\u2019d become disenfranchised with the idea of design and marketing being driven purely by the requirement for increased volume, so the name Feit was about fighting that system of doing business and trying to find a way to go back to focusing purely on product and quality,\u201d says Tull Price. At a more affordable price point you could shop the trippy graphics of Melbourne brand Perks and Mini or the technical garb of Kloke, which hails from the same city. Perth-based Butter Goods specialises in skatewear, while Penny Skateboards create the actual boards, a new take on the classic longboard in plastic rather than plywood. Carbon neutrals Organic, vegan, slow-fashion and ethical.

Australiana endures When Romance Was Born re-released its May Gibbs print shorts, caps and shirts in late 2019, they sold out almost immediately.

A veritable B&amp;S ball of the label\u2019s back catalogue was also worn by guests at the opening of Jenny Kee and Linda Jackson: Step Into Paradise at the Powerhouse Museum in November.

      "bodyText": "A Chinese-owned company has been granted approval to run a 96m litre a year commercial water mining operation in severely drought-hit southern Queensland, where locals are on water rations and communities at imminent risk of running dry. Last week the Southern Downs regional council approved a development application for the company, Joyful View Garden Real Estate Development Resort Pty Ltd, to operate a water extraction and distribution facility at Cherrabah, a large property at Elbow Valley near the Queensland-New South Wales border. The following day the council implemented extreme water restrictions for residents at the nearby towns of Warwick and Stanthorpe, limiting residents to 80L a day. Stanthorpe is expected to run out of drinking water within weeks. Neighbours of Cherrabah have told Guardian Australia they have not had a reliable water supply at their properties for more than a year, and have been trucking water in on a regular basis. Some cattle properties have removed all their cattle. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how it is allowed to happen,\u201d one resident says. \u201cIf that water drains away from the shallow aquifers, it affects our long-term viability.\u201d Joyful View is ultimately owned by Chinese investors Wenxing and Wenwei Ma. The company had attempted to build a large-scale luxury resort at the remote property but pulled the proposal in 2016 after planning and environmental difficulties, including concern for a local population of spotted-tailed quolls. The water extraction licence for the property was first issued by the Queensland government in 2008 and extended in 2016 to allow Joyful View to pump 96m litres from the aquifer until 2111 \u2013 another 92 years. Council documents show the company plans to send the water to a bottling plant on the Gold Coast. A local newspaper, the Southern Free Times, reported that councillors who voted in favour of the development application at a 18 December meeting said they had no power to regulate groundwater extraction, which was a state responsibility. The deputy mayor, Jo McNally, reportedly told the meeting the council was aware of many property owners extracting water and selling it outside the region, but that the council could do nothing to stop it. Neighbours who objected told Guardian Australia they had been taken by surprise by the revival of the water-mining proposal. An earlier version of the plan was withdrawn in 2018 after council management recommended it should be rejected. The council conducted no consultation on the new application, instead relying on submissions made by concerned residents in 2018. \u201cObviously the drought has become 1o times worse in the past year,\u201d one resident said. Even a year ago, locals said in submissions they had observed the impacts of drought and drawdown in groundwater. \u201cI am a close neighbour and I depend on creeks, springs and shallow wells \u2026 I have never been surveyed on any long-term effects,\u201d Eagle View property owner Ben Usher said. \u201cI know from information passed down through generations of my family, and from years of my own experience that \u2026 springs on the property could be relied on to provide water for the grazing of cattle throughout its history. \u201cThis situation has changed. Over time supply has become sporadic with increasing water shortage. I can no longer rely on [the property\u2019s] well and need to cart water to my property.\u201d Another resident, Paul Keogh, said: \u201cThe water supply has become unreliable. I cannot say whether this has been caused by the Cherrabah bore or climate change. Whichever way, we no longer had the water supply we had over generations, and so any water allocations \u2026 now need to be limited to reflect current water availability.\u201d A 2009 study, which was relied upon by the Queensland government when extending the water extraction licences, raised significant uncertainty about whether the continued pumping of water from the aquifer at Cherrabah was sustainable in the long term. The study concluded there was \u201cinsufficient recharge data\u201d to model the sustainability of the aquifer beyond a year, and that there was a \u201crisk\u201d the aquifer would deplete in times of low rainfall. Joyful View has this year commissioned a second study, which was summarised in a council report but has not been released publicly. According to the council summary of the study, it claimed there would be minimal impact on the water resource of surrounding properties. However, the report also acknowledged that test pumping was \u201cextremely challenging to analyse\u201d and that the authors did not attempt to model the long-term drawdown of the water resource because doing so would not be reliable. At the 18 December council meeting, the preceding item was a \u201cwater contingency plan\u201d that discussed the dire situation for Stanthorpe and Warwick, and attempts to find alternate \u201cemergency\u201d supply of water. Anyone outside of town water supply has already likely run out of water. Many are reliant on local charity operations. The plan noted that Stanthorpe could run dry within weeks, and additional water was already being trucked to Storm King dam. Water supply in Warwick, which is also being used to support Stanthorpe, will be exhausted without significant rain by mid to late 2020. Attempts were made to contact the council and Joyful View for comment.",

      "bodyText": "When a politician can lambast your entire industry for its shockingly poor behaviour and earn applause rather than laughter, you\u2019ve got a problem. But that was the situation National Australia Bank\u2019s new chairman, Phil Chronican, found himself in at his company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on 18 December as the Australian banking industry\u2019s year from hell tottered towards its end. \u201cYou are the unacceptable face of capitalism because you have failed to obey the law,\u201d former Labor senator Chris Schacht told Chronican and the NAB board. \u201cYou are the face of unconscionable greed.\u201d For the banking industry, it has been a bad end to a year that started with some promise. In February, the sector seized on the release of the final report of the banking royal commission as an opportunity to draw a line under years of scandals \u2013 including charging dead people fees, signing up vulnerable people to useless insurance and systematically undermining the retirement nest eggs of workers through high charges and poor investment returns. While commissioner Kenneth Hayne was damning of banking\u2019s culture of greed, the report did not contain harsher measures some in the industry feared, and company share prices jumped in relief. But in the past few months plans by some in the industry for a quick return to business as usual, which included lobbying against responsible lending rules set down by the corporate regulator, have fallen to pieces. Westpac, which had been leading the push, looked to be gaining ground after a court victory in August against the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, over responsible lending standards. Asic has appealed against the ruling, and in late December signalled it would not be backing down on responsible lending standards by launching legal action against Volkswagen\u2019s finance arm over almost 50,000 car loans it says weren\u2019t properly assessed. But any hope the back to business project might succeed was smashed to smithereens in November when Austrac, the agency responsible for monitoring the flow of money through the economy, hit Westpac with a mammoth lawsuit alleging millions of breaches of anti-money laundering laws, including failing to detect or stop several thousand transactions consistent with child exploitation in the Philippines. Money for paedophiles. A new low for an industry already neck deep in muck. Unsurprisingly, Westpac\u2019s chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, and chief executive Brian Hartzer handed in their resignations. In the week before Christmas, the corporate cop shovelled more of the smelly stuff into the faces of executives at NAB in a federal court lawsuit alleging it broke the law more than 10,000 times by charging customers fees for services they never received and failing to keep proper records of financial advice. NAB is also facing the prospect of action against it by Austrac, which in the past few years has emerged as the banking sector\u2019s most feared regulator due to the seriousness of the laws it administers and the huge fines it can levy, which can climb well into the billions of dollars. All this was no doubt weighing on the minds of Chronican and NAB\u2019s chief executive, Ross McEwan, during the recent AGM. Reflecting the turmoil in the sector this year, neither has been in the job for long. Chronican has been acting as CEO since February, when chairman Ken Henry and chief executive Andrew Thorburn resigned after being beaten up by Hayne in his report. McEwan became CEO just three weeks ago but his scant time in the top job wasn\u2019t enough to save him from Schacht. It was a repeat performance for Schacht \u2013 six days earlier, he had delivered an even angrier speech to Westpac\u2019s top brass at its annual meeting at the same venue, Sydney\u2019s International Convention Centre. Schacht said he had been a NAB shareholder since 2003 and attended most of the bank\u2019s AGMs since then. But he hadn\u2019t detected an improvement in the bank\u2019s management. \u201cEvery time there was a scandal, the same words that you said today and the same words of Mr McEwan \u2013 we\u2019ll be better,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will get on top of it. \u201cBut next year another bloody scandal turned up, something else went wrong. It has not changed, and that is the worrying thing about the bank.\u201d Standards in banking were even lower than in politics, he said. \u201cI gotta tell you, if I had done 1% of what this board had allowed to happen, I would have been thrown out of Parliament House, drowned in Lake Burley Griffin and everyone would have cheered.\u201d Schacht is right that Australia\u2019s banks are no strangers to scandal. It\u2019s arguable a cowboy culture in the industry stretches as far back as the Victorian land boom of the 1880s and 1890s, when soaring property prices and easy credit provided by a string of fledgling banks and building societies helped create a speculative financial bubble \u2013 the pricking of which saw fortunes destroyed and corrupt premier James Munro bankrupted and beaten in the street. Westpac, then known as the Bank of New South Wales, did not escape unscathed \u2013 it lost out after lending money to some of the speculators. The big banks \u2013 ANZ, Commonwealth, NAB and Westpac \u2013 may be nicknamed the \u201cfour pillars\u201d of the Australian economy, but they have also behaved in a less than solid fashion. Over the decades, they have more or less taken it in turns to be the bad bank. In 1992, Westpac, Australia\u2019s oldest bank, turned in the country\u2019s biggest corporate loss at the time, of $1.56bn, after writing off $2.6bn in disastrous loans on commercial property. The AGM went for two days and the managing director, Frank Conroy, resigned. NAB hit trouble in the \u201crogue trader\u201d affair of the early 2000s in which four foreign exchange traders trousered hefty bonuses by hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses. The scandal eventually cost the head of chief executive Frank Cicutto. Australia\u2019s banks survived the global financial crisis in good financial shape, thanks in part to the Rudd government guaranteeing their debts, but nonetheless ANZ managed to get itself into trouble by backing stockbroker Opes Prime. Opes Prime collapsed in 2008 owing $1bn, including $650m to ANZ, after efforts by executives to cover up a $300m hole in its accounts failed. The affair was a wild ride involving fast cars, members of Melbourne\u2019s underworld and colourful Sydney lawyer Chris Murphy, whose account was at the centre of the collapse. ANZ also loaned about $1bn to Indian business couple Pankaj and Radhika Oswal to build a fertiliser plant on the Burrup Peninsula. The loan went bad amid allegations of fraud and the bank had to pay the couple more than $200m to settle a highly embarrassing lawsuit. But more recently the banks have stopped taking it in turns to misbehave, with scandals coming so thick and fast it\u2019s almost impossible to keep up. They have all been tarred by the financial planning debacle that was one of the main drivers behind the royal commission last year, although initially misconduct at CBA was most prominent. CBA also led the way at getting in trouble with Austrac, paying $700m in June last year to settle a case in which the regulator accused it of more than 53,000 breaches of the law. All big four banks tried to rig a key interest rate benchmark, the BBSW, to their benefit and against the interests of their customers \u2013 although Westpac copped the brunt of bad publicity because it made the quixotic decision to fight a lawsuit brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission rather than settle, as the others did. And there is more to come. Company accounts are normally pretty dry reading but buried deep in NAB\u2019s annual report is a list of looming problems that provides a good summary of what\u2019s ahead for the entire sector in the coming 12 months. Note 29, \u201ccontingent liabilities\u201d, lays out the problems that NAB knows it has but on which it has so far been unable to put a price tag. These include a class action in the US over the BBSW, lawsuits in the UK over business loans its former subsidiary Clydesdale Bank wrote there and, of course, an Austrac investigation. In addition to Asic\u2019s fee-for-no-service lawsuit it is sweating on the outcome of another industry-wide investigation by the corporate regulator into junk credit card insurance, an issue over which it faces another class action. It is also waiting on the outcome of Asic lawsuits over service fees wrongly charged by its superannuation trustee company, Nulis, and an introducer scheme that saw gym owners and hairdressers get kickbacks for bringing homeloan customers to the bank. On top of that, it is also being audited by the Taxation Office over its claims for deductions due to research and development spending. The other banks also face more pain at the hands of an Asic whose spine has been stiffened by the royal commission. Costs across the industry of compensating customers it has ripped off and fixing up long-neglected systems designed to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again are projected at $10bn. And they could well go higher. On Thursday, federal court judge Michael Wigney hit Westpac with a fine of $9.15m over the behaviour of just one financial adviser who earned fat commissions by tipping his clients into inappropriate superannuation and insurance products created by the bank. But those kinds of stings are dwarfed by a monster fine, likely to be in excess of a billion dollars, that Westpac is expected to pay to settle the Austrac case. The bank seems to have lost some of the anti-regulator attitude that saw it fight lawsuits tooth and nail and prompted Hartzer to complain at a meeting last year with the prudential regulator that it was \u201cunfair\u201d that all the banks had to do a comprehensive review of their cultural failings because \u201cnothing has gone wrong to CBA\u2019s scale\u201d. Well, it has now.",

Philander gave the impression that both Archer deliveries should have been called for no\u2011ball, which would have meant he was unable to bowl again in the match. This also seemed to be the impression of the South Africa management at the close of play.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a little bit of a conversation going on after the game,\u201d Philander said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s plain and simple, we\u2019re playing a game and we\u2019re setting an example for the rest of the people coming into this game.

The first one fair enough. The second one ... well, it just missed the stumps. I saw him [the square leg umpire, Paul Reiffel] put his arm out and I think he tucked it in quite quickly. They [the umpires] withdrew that second no-ball.\u201d</p> <p>This version of events was confirmed afterwards though Archer must now be careful for the rest of the innings. Another transgression and he will be removed from the attack.</p> <p>\u201cMore prosaically \u2013 except for those residing in the West Country \u2013 Philander confirmed that he would be joining Somerset next summer \u201con a year-by-year basis\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two leading figures of a frantic contest, Joe Denly and Vernon Philander, agreed about most things but not everything. Both acknowledge they are not playing on a batsman\u2019s paradise but we may have guessed that after 15 wickets fell on the second day. \u201cIt was tough to begin with,\u201d Denly said. \u201cPhilander and [Kagiso] Rabada are world\u2011class bowlers who complement each other very well. It\u2019s disappointing to be 175 behind but they are four wickets down and we are still in the Test match. It\u2019s a new-ball wicket for the bowlers and if we can get through that new ball relatively unscathed hopefully we might be able to chase something under 300.\u201d Philander has also spent a fair amount of time batting at Centurion. \u201cOnce the bowler hits a good area it\u2019s very tough to score out there.\u201d Then he mentioned the same number as Denly. \u201cA lead of 300 plus out there and you are in the safe zone.\u201d Where these two seemed to differ was in their interpretation of Jofra Archer\u2019s final two deliveries of the day: two attempted knuckleballs to the nightwatchman Anrich Nortje, both of which ended up as beamers with the batsman falling to the ground to avoid being hit. Philander gave the impression that both Archer deliveries should have been called for no\u2011ball, which would have meant he was unable to bowl again in the match. This also seemed to be the impression of the South Africa management at the close of play. \u201cThere was a little bit of a conversation going on after the game,\u201d Philander said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s plain and simple, we\u2019re playing a game and we\u2019re setting an example for the rest of the people coming into this game. You\u2019ve got to make the right call. Are we going to tolerate it at another game or are we going to put a stop to it right here \u2013 it\u2019s in the hands of the umpires.\u201d Denly\u2019s interpretation was different. \u201cI was at leg slip and I wasn\u2019t expecting two beamers. The first one fair enough. The second one ... well, it just missed the stumps. I saw him [the square leg umpire, Paul Reiffel] put his arm out and I think he tucked it in quite quickly. They [the umpires] withdrew that second no-ball.\u201d This version of events was confirmed afterwards though Archer must now be careful for the rest of the innings. Another transgression and he will be removed from the attack. \u201cMore prosaically \u2013 except for those residing in the West Country \u2013 Philander confirmed that he would be joining Somerset next summer \u201con a year-by-year basis\u201d.",

Location: courtesy of the trustees of St George\u2019s Hall, Bewdley.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even though he was renowned in the party as a savvy organiser and occasionally brutal scrapper, Watson said he left in part because of the aggression he had faced within Labour. He said at one point police told him that a Labour supporter had been arrested for making a death threat via the party that Labour officials did not inform him about.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview, Watson praised Corbyn personally but said conditions within Labour had contributed to making his political career unsustainable. \u201cThe point is that the brutality and hostility is real and it\u2019s day to day,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I just thought: now\u2019s the time to take a leap, do something different. You\u2019ve had a good innings. You\u2019ve done good stuff. Go now.\u201d</p> <p>Watson cited the pressures of social media, factionalism and criticism from unions: \u201cOn their own, you deal with them and they\u2019re a normal part of life. Combine them, and you\u2019re carrying a very heavy load. And sometimes you\u2019ve got to realise when that balance of life shifts and there are other things that are more rewarding.\u201d</p> <p>At what turned out to be Watson\u2019s final Labour conference as deputy leader in September he faced a motion from the left of the party seeking to abolish his job. It was eventually withdrawn.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s former deputy leader Tom Watson has said he left parliament because of the \u201cbrutality and hostility\u201d he experienced within Labour and blamed poor organisation and messaging for the party\u2019s disastrous general election result. Watson, who stood down as an MP and deputy leader last month, condemned Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s advisers and told the Guardian that Labour\u2019s next generation of leaders must address whether they \u201cactually want power\u201d as they begin to rebuild the party. In an admission that will draw criticism from Corbyn\u2019s supporters, he also said he had voted for the leadership challenger Owen Smith despite his position as deputy leader. Watson\u2019s stinging criticisms, in an interview with Weekend magazine, are his first intervention in the debate over the party\u2019s disastrous showing at the election earlier this month, in which Boris Johnson won a majority of 80. Watson\u2019s former West Bromwich East seat was lost to the Conservatives for the first time. Corbyn\u2019s critics have identified his unpopularity as a key factor in the election result, but figures on the left of the party say the defeat was primarily because of the difficulties over Labour\u2019s Brexit position and not strategic errors or the leader. In a succession race interrupted by Christmas, only two Labour MPs have formally declared their intention to run for leader: Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, and Clive Lewis, a shadow Treasury minister. Other expected candidates include the two favourites, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey. Lisa Nandy, David Lammy and Yvette Cooper could also stand. Watson said: \u201cDoes the Labour party in its current form actually want power? The ultimate betrayal of working-class people is not to take power when you can, and if you are a party that believes in power through elections, then that requires pragmatism, prioritisation, compromise and collaboration.\u201d Even though he was renowned in the party as a savvy organiser and occasionally brutal scrapper, Watson said he left in part because of the aggression he had faced within Labour. He said at one point police told him that a Labour supporter had been arrested for making a death threat via the party that Labour officials did not inform him about. In a wide-ranging interview, Watson praised Corbyn personally but said conditions within Labour had contributed to making his political career unsustainable. \u201cThe point is that the brutality and hostility is real and it\u2019s day to day,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I just thought: now\u2019s the time to take a leap, do something different. You\u2019ve had a good innings. You\u2019ve done good stuff. Go now.\u201d Watson cited the pressures of social media, factionalism and criticism from unions: \u201cOn their own, you deal with them and they\u2019re a normal part of life. Combine them, and you\u2019re carrying a very heavy load. And sometimes you\u2019ve got to realise when that balance of life shifts and there are other things that are more rewarding.\u201d At what turned out to be Watson\u2019s final Labour conference as deputy leader in September he faced a motion from the left of the party seeking to abolish his job. It was eventually withdrawn. Watson said that even amid the wranglings, the move surprised him: \u201cI don\u2019t think you could pre-empt such political idiocy and collective self-harm.\u201d Speaking immediately after the election defeat, Watson cited Brexit, Corbyn\u2019s leadership, issues over antisemitism and a lack of party unity as reasons for the poor showing, as well as a convoluted election offering. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the message of our campaign was,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were announcements everywhere, but none of them got through because there were so many. You knew what Boris Johnson\u2019s was: Get Brexit done. What was the Labour strapline?\u201d Corbyn and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have said they will step down following the crushing defeat on 12 December. Watson also revealed that when Owen Smith challenged for the Labour leadership in 2016 following a vote of no confidence in Corbyn by Labour MPs, he voted for Smith. \u201cI did vote for Owen, but I\u2019ve never said it publicly before,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI thought, as soon as the leader loses the confidence of the parliamentary party it\u2019s almost impossible to see how you can form a government. I thought Jeremy should have resigned, and he nearly did.\u201d Watson\u2019s departure from politics was also part of a wider shake-up of his life in which he has lost eight stone in weight and begun to retrain as a gym instructor.",

If you did get it right, well done, because the understated Mr Drakeford would be the first to admit that he does not have quite the same profile as the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, or even the former Northern Irish first minister, Arlene Foster. The latter has not been in post for three years, but has been omnipresent throughout the Brexit debate. Of Mr Drakeford, if we live outside Wales, we hear next to nothing. Wales, with its population of just over 3 million and its 40 seats at Westminster, is largely ignored in the wider UK. The general election gave the Conservatives their best night in Wales since 1983. They won Wrexham (a seat where before the second world war they rarely bothered to stand) for the first time and captured Bridgend in Labour\u2019s south Wales heartland. Overall, Labour got 41% of the vote, compared with the Tories\u2019 36%, and has 22 seats against the Tories\u2019 14 and Plaid Cymru\u2019s four.

      "bodyText": "From Parkland to Las Vegas, and Columbine to Sandy Hook, Greg Zanis\u2019 work has been a comfort to those suffering in the aftermath of whichever mass shooting was the latest to lead the news cycle. Zanis spent years creating almost 27,000 handcrafted memorials for every mass shooting victim, and traveled hundreds of thousands of miles at his own expense to lovingly place each one. But now the carpenter has announced his retirement \u2013 emotionally exhausted by the heartbreak of his work amid the ongoing epidemic of mass shootings in America. Zanis, 69, was always among the first on the scene at any mass shooting across the United States, driving from his home in Aurora, Illinois, in his pickup truck and trailer to deliver and erect white crosses, Stars of David or Islamic crescent moons to memorialize each victim by name. In the last few years alone there were 49 carvings pitched at Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub in June 2016, 58 in Las Vegas in October 2017 and 17 more at Parkland, Florida\u2019s Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in February 2018. But it was a workplace shooting and the deaths of five people in his hometown of Aurora in February that forced Zanis to reflect and come to a decision to hand over his Crosses for Losses operation to Lutheran Church Charities (LCC). \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how devastated I was, my own town,\u201d Zanis told NBC Chicago. \u201cI felt like I was carrying the weight of the country on my shoulders. I love what I\u2019m doing but I\u2019m getting called every day to go to 10 shootings. I just feel that 27,000 crosses later, it\u2019s more demanding today than it was last year, and it was more demanding last year than the year before. \u201cThese are people, not numbers. It\u2019s not gay people in Orlando, it\u2019s not Sikhs in Milwaukee, it\u2019s not Jewish people in Pennsylvania, it\u2019s not black people in Chicago. This is our country. We\u2019re a family. We\u2019re American first,\u201d he said. Zanis said it was this month\u2019s shooting at a naval air station in Pensacola, Florida, in which three were killed, that finally made up his mind. \u201cI got as far as Indianapolis and turned back,\u201d he told the Chicago Tribune. \u201cI decided I wasn\u2019t going to do this any more.\u201d Zanis said he plans to visit to 135 Lutheran churches around the country to help teach volunteers how to construct the memorials, then spend time at home working on his 1927 Cadillac. He says he has amassed debt of $14,000 through constructing the crosses, each of which he says takes an hour to make, and has traveled an estimated 850,000 miles since 1996 to deliver them. Zanis spoke to the Guardian in July 2012, after a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, claimed 12 lives, most in their teens or 20s. \u201cA cross is a prayer,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s so important.

Newey was arrested and taken to a police station for questioning, along with his 18-year-old son Sam, who was also threatened with arrest.

The YPG is not banned under UK terrorism legislation. However, several UK nationals who have joined the group have been arrested or charged in connection to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), a movement based in Turkey and Iraq closely allied to the YPG. The PKK is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK and several other countries. Aidan James from Merseyside, 29, who trained with the PKK in Iraq to fight alongside Kurdish units, was jailed for four years in a landmark case last month. He was cleared of attending a place of terrorism training with the YPG across the border in Syria due to the YPG working with British support to defend the Kurdish people against the threat of Isis forces. Similar charges against former soldier James Matthews, 43, from Dalston, London, were dropped last year. Another former soldier, Daniel Burke, 32, was remanded in custody on 20 December on two counts of preparing acts of terrorism, one of which relates to an allegation he organised transport for Newey to travel to Iraq from Barcelona. \u201cMaterial support\u201d for terrorism, a charge Newey\u2019s father could face, has been commonly used to prosecute family members and friends of Britons who joined Isis. Funding terrorism carries a maximum sentence of 14 years but shorter sentences have been handed down for small sums of money transferred from family members to relatives in Syria. In the most high-profile case, in June this year John Letts and Sally Lane of Oxford were found guilty of sending their son \u00a3223 in September 2015 when he was in Syria, despite concerns he had joined Isis. The couple were sentenced to 15 months in prison suspended for 12 months. Earlier this month a woman in Liverpool was found guilty of sending \u00a335 to her husband in Syria, a self-styled \u201cindependent fighter\u201d. Another woman, a friend, had already pleaded guilty over \u00a346. Both are due to be sentenced soon. The status of international YPG volunteers has become more complicated since Kurdish-led forces dismantled the last slivers of Isis\u2019s so-called caliphate in March. Since then, Donald Trump has announced the withdrawal of US troops in the area who acted as a buffer between the YPG and Turkey, and Turkey subsequently launched a large attack over its border on the YPG. As a result, British volunteers with the YPG are now for the most part fighting against a Nato ally and its proxy Syrian rebel forces. In May 2019, Sajid Javid, then UK home secretary, warned all British citizens in Kurdish-held north-east Syria to leave within 28 days or face a 10-year prison sentence if they attempted to return to the UK, adding that security officials were \u201curgently\u201d reviewing whether to tighten rules about travel to the region. If introduced, the policy would be the first use of new powers given to the home secretary in the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act, which became law in February. A rise in arrests and charges brought against Britons with links to the YPG has led to speculation the Home Office is considering the group for inclusion on the proscribed terrorist organisation list. The department said it did not comment on the decision-making process. Hundreds of international volunteers have travelled to Syria since 2014 to fight alongside Kurdish forces.

      "bodyText": "RSPCA investigators have taken photographs in the garden of the lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC as part of an animal cruelty investigation after he clubbed a fox to death with a baseball bat while wearing a kimono, the Guardian understands. The investigators visited Maugham\u2019s London home on Thursday night as the debate continued over the remain supporter\u2019s justification for his actions, which he revealed in a Boxing Day tweet that received 10,500 replies and widespread media coverage. Animal welfare workers expressed sadness at Maugham\u2019s killing of the fox, which they said was needless. \u201cIt is absolutely shocking that this wild animal was condemned to such a brutal death,\u201d said Isobel Hutchinson, the director of Animal Aid. \u201cIt is deeply saddening that anyone should react in this way when coming face to face with a wild animal.\u201d According to tweets and interviews, Maugham woke up on Thursday morning to the sound of a commotion in his back garden. Still nursing a hangover, he pulled on the first garment he could find \u2013 his wife\u2019s green satin kimono \u2013 armed himself with a baseball bat and walked out of the back door. The fox was trapped in the netting surrounding Maugham\u2019s hen house. He has said his violent response was at least in part triggered by the grief of losing chickens to foxes in the past. Maugham tweeted: \u201cNo one should relish killing animals \u2013 and I certainly didn\u2019t \u2026 Many or most councils in London treat foxes as an urban pest. And at least one recommends clubbing them. To those concerned I have broken the law, I called and spoke to the RSPCA and left my contact details.\u201d Terry Woods, a wildlife consultant with Fox-A-Gon, which helps individuals and businesses with humane fox deterrence, suggested Maugham may have committed an offence under the 1996 Wild Mammals (Protection) Act. The law makes it an offence for anyone to mutilate, kick, beat, nail or otherwise impale, stab, burn, stone, crush, drown, drag or asphyxiate any wild mammal with intent to inflict unnecessary suffering. \u201cHe should have done what any reasonable person would\u2019ve done, which is call the RSPCA,\u201d Woods said. \u201cHad I turned up, I would have covered its head so it couldn\u2019t see, which quietens them down considerably, and cut the mesh. \u201cI would then, as someone who deals with this all the time, [have] taken it to the vet to see what injuries it had suffered.\u201d Woods said it was not uncommon for foxes to become trapped in netting of the kind used in children\u2019s football goals or to keep birds away from growing fruit, but it should not usually be possible for one to become trapped in a chicken coop. Any coop that poses a risk to foxes also poses a risk to the hens it is supposed to protect, said Tara Kenward, who kept chickens for a decade in south-east London. While fox numbers in London are believed to be stable, according to data collected by the British Trust for Ornithology, the population of the red fox has fallen by 42% across the UK in the past two decades. While a number of scare stories have circulated in recent years about urban foxes, including that they spread diseases such as mange and have attacked pets and even small children, some experts say they are beneficial.

      "body": "<p>\u201cWhen the time came to say goodbye, I told Pat I loved him and I appreciated him,\u201d Patrick Aristhene says as he remembers the moment before the machines were switched off and his best friend, the boxer Patrick Day, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcoP0d3YcuM\" title=\"\">slipped away into death</a>. Four days earlier, on 12 October 2019, Day had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/16/patrick-day-charles-conwell-open-letter\" title=\"\">knocked out in the last round of his 22nd professional fight, against Charles Conwell,</a> in Chicago. He fell into a coma and the doctors soon knew they could not save him.</p> <p>On a beautiful late December afternoon in Rockville Centre, near New York, with a low winter sun as gentle as the subject of our interview is hard, Aristhene recalls his final words in hospital. \u201cI told Pat, \u2018Hold it down that side and watch over everybody. I\u2019ll hold it down this side till I see you again.\u2019 I believe I\u2019ll see Pat again. I believe the human spirit is powerful and, when we die, it goes on a journey. The Egyptians said it: \u2018Death is only the beginning.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Many fighters have died in the ring, and there have been five boxing fatalities this year, but the death of 27-year-old Patrick Day resonates. He was not impoverished or desperate. Boxing, far from being his only hope, was his choice out of many options. His father was a doctor and his mother an editorial assistant at the UN. Day was college educated and his intelligence was matched by his eloquence, charm and dedication to boxing as a super\u2011welterweight (154lb) who had been ranked in the world\u2019s top 10 by the IBF and WBC.</p> <p>\u201cPat didn\u2019t waste a moment of his life,\u201d says Aristhene, a former Golden Gloves champion, \u201cand he did everything with good intentions. We lived on the same block in Freeport [Long Island, New York] our whole lives and, as a kid, I could run to his house in seven seconds. Our parents are from Haiti and they put us together as babies. He was born in August 1992 and I was born that October. We both majored in food and nutrition and bounced most decisions off each other.</p> <p>\u201cPatrick was pure-hearted. He would ask me to take a second look at people I didn\u2019t trust. Patrick would say: \u2018Look at their heart.\u2019 He encouraged me to give them another chance. There were times I\u2019d say: \u2018Pat, this guy is taking advantage of you,\u2019 and he\u2019d agree. I was the realist, he was the optimist. We balanced each other. Our last messages are right here.\u201d</p> <p>Aristhene opens his phone. \u201cHere we go. Saturday October 12.\u201d</p> <p>We read the stream of messages that fateful day as they texted each other from Freeport and Chicago. After Aristhene wished him good luck against Conwell, Day wrote these words to his oldest friend: \u201cAppreciate you and love you, my brother. Tonight I\u2019m going to do my thang out there.\u201d</p> <p>Aristhene responded: \u201cLove you man. I\u2019m excited for the world to see what you got.\u201d</p> <p>He still felt a secret foreboding. \u201cI was anxious because I had a dream the night before that somebody was going to get hurt bad. In the dream I was in Chicago at the fight. I\u2019m trying to get through the crowd, saying: \u2018Who won?\u2019 A voice tells me: \u2018Someone got knocked out bad.\u2019 In the dream I couldn\u2019t tell who it was. So on the night of the fight I had such pain in my stomach. I didn\u2019t care who won. I just wanted Pat to be safe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a67868e1ffce8a0598900aa261501ef20ede9f5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a67868e1ffce8a0598900aa261501ef20ede9f5c/236_146_7499_4500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Aristhene in The Freeport Police Athletic League gym on Long Island.

He was the best friend of Patrick Day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two Patricks fell for boxing as teenagers. The Days lived across the street from Joe Higgins, a former marine and firefighter who ran the local boxing gym. Higgins kept his garage doors open so the boys could see a heavy bag dangling from the rafters. He knew they would be curious and sure enough, when he was a skinny 14-year-old, Day crossed Buchanan Street and began hitting the bag. Higgins chided him \u2013 but only because he was slapping rather than punching. It was not long before Day and Aristhene joined Higgins at his Freeport PAL gym. The trainer promised Day\u2019s mother, Lyssa, her son would learn many good habits through boxing.</p> <p>Lyssa disliked boxing, but she knew Higgins was a good man. He was respected throughout Freeport. Apart from the hope he spread through boxing, he and his brother Tim had been among the first firemen who went into the burning Twin Towers on 9/11. Tim died, after saving many lives. Joe survived \u2013 but he carries the darkness of that terrible day in hidden corners of his mind.</p> <p>Aristhene smiles when I ask if he and Day were intimidated by Higgins. \u201cCoach Joe is only intimidating in the sense of discipline. When he was around, you didn\u2019t say a curse word. You minded your p\u2019s and q\u2019s. To have him in the neighbourhood was good.\u201d</p> <p>Did he and Day realise Higgins was haunted by 9/11? \u201cPat and me would get a lift to the gym with Coach Joe. During those car rides, we began to understand the demons he\u2019s still battling with. But it was only when Pat and I became men that we understood the trauma.\u201d</p> <p>Aristhene and Day revered <a href=\"http://www.liherald.com/stories/retiring-pro-boxer-seanie-monaghan-was-symbol-of-long-beach-resilience,114390\" title=\"\">Seanie Monaghan</a> \u2013 a professional fighter from Long Island who was 11 years older than them. Monaghan was Higgins\u2019s star boxer. He came to boxing late but reeled off 28 successive wins in front of a vociferous following. The light-heavyweight retired last April with a 29\u20113 record and his reputation as New York\u2019s most popular fighter intact. \u201cSeanie\u2019s our big brother,\u201d Aristhene says. \u201cPat loved going to the Long Beach boardwalk where you felt Seanie\u2019s clout. If we told anyone there we boxed with Sean Monaghan they\u2019d say: \u2018Whatever you want is free.\u2019 At clubs you just had to say Seanie\u2019s name and you were in. Sean was a hero \u2013 and our friend.\u201d</p> <p>Monaghan, who is now 38, picks me up from Freeport station on a cold afternoon. His warmth fills the car and, despite his grief for Day, Monaghan makes our meeting feel natural. He only pauses when holding the keys to Higgins\u2019s gym \u2013 a small blue brick building in the middle of a Freeport park. \u201cI\u2019ve not been inside since we lost Pat,\u201d he says. \u201cCoach Joe closed it for a few weeks and I\u2019ve not been able to face coming back.\u201d</p> <p>Old posters, featuring some of Monaghan\u2019s greatest nights in the ring and Day\u2019s past fights, line the walls. The blue ring is empty. But, rather than being an ominous symbol of the place where Day lost his life, it feels like home. We sit on the ring apron as Monaghan remembers his friend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9df93689b6731415a79a3369829681f942b7f585\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9df93689b6731415a79a3369829681f942b7f585/35_148_3481_2088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Day (left) and Charles Conwell slug it out in the fourth round of their super-welterweight bout at Wintrust Arena in Chicago.

He always had a smile, very humble, a really pleasant kid. When Patrick first came to the track where Coach Joe made us run, I lapped him. Then, when he got older, I couldn\u2019t keep up with him. He was smoking that track. Patrick fought at 154 to 160 [lb] and I was 175, but we sparred a lot. He was tough. I sparred beasts like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyfLppct9NI\" title=\"\">Artur Beterbiev</a> [the world\u2019s most ferocious light-heavyweight] but Patrick was so competitive. He always tried to get me and he was fast.</p> <p>\u201cIn the summer we opened the steel doors and people watched me and Patrick put on some shows. I sparred more with Patrick than anyone else. We ran the track together, did our gym work together, did everything together. He was a wonderful person who had such heart.\u201d</p> <p>Aristhene says something similar. \u201cPat had more determination than anyone I\u2019ve met. He wasn\u2019t good at sports like basketball. But his determination made him good at defence. He was so tenacious he always found a way to do well. At school his nickname was \u2018Straight A Day\u2019. He got straight A\u2019s in everything. He wrote that nickname on his headgear and shoes.</p> <p>\u201cPat was the golden child but I\u2019d get into fights at school. I\u2019d get suspended. Pat said: \u2018You should think about boxing.\u2019 But he lost his first three amateur fights. I\u2019ll never forget we were in his kitchen making pancakes. He said: \u2018Man, if I lose the next fight, I\u2019m done.\u2019 But he won, and won again. When Pat won the Golden Gloves I was like: \u2018I got to get mine.\u2019 How many Golden Gloves champions live on the same block like Pat and me? That\u2019s testament to Coach Joe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13ca23589000f8981bc1c2a817af37c4b4de4124\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13ca23589000f8981bc1c2a817af37c4b4de4124/261_302_7580_4548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coach Joe Higgins (left) and the former light-heavyweight Seanie Monaghan, both close acquaintances of Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coach Joe Higgins (left) and the former light-heavyweight Seanie Monaghan, both close acquaintances of Day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our reflections are interrupted by the arrival of Higgins. A strapping man, with a cap covering his bald head, he sounds exactly like a tough New York firefighter. But, as the man who introduced Patrick to boxing and worked the corner in every one of his amateur and professional fights, Higgins is grieving. He explains how, after he reopened the gym last month, he could not bear the thought of it being associated with boxing. Higgins resolved to turn it into a fitness centre. But, as the weeks pass and young men ask him to help them box, and even fight in next year\u2019s Golden Gloves, Higgins has felt torn. He knows Patrick would want him to continue, and he reiterates how dark the park seemed when the gym was closed, but he still lives across the street from the Day family. It breaks his heart every time he sees Pat\u2019s mother, knowing how much she hated boxing. How can he go on?</p> <p>Did boxing help him to deal with the torment of 9/11? \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt,\u201d Higgins says. \u201cI was diagnosed with everything. But I was a high-profile fire guy, a marine. You don\u2019t admit that stuff. I know it\u2019s stupid and today I counsel people \u2013 \u2018Go get help.\u2019 But going for help made me feel worse. Coming here every day is what helped me. The gym is a family but I\u2019m closest to Sean and Patrick. Sean came here a few months after 9/11 when I was still dazed. Remember, Seanie?\u201d</p> <p>Monaghan nods. \u201cYou were in and out for a while \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t always here,\u201d Higgins agrees, \u201cbut Seanie kept showing up. I could tell he was serious about boxing and that helped me.\u201d</p> <p>Higgins smiles. \u201cThen Patrick showed up. Seanie had such a positive impact on Pat because he is really kind. They sparred a thousand rounds together over the years. Patrick changed me too because I felt he would look at me differently if I got too angry and cursed. So I don\u2019t curse no more. Seanie and Patrick were raised right, and they gave me a healing force with boxing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"15ef68b1afcc74bb758d6dc7971d1363ab116bd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15ef68b1afcc74bb758d6dc7971d1363ab116bd3/0_0_7975_5317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photos of Seanie Monaghan and Day at the Freeport Police Athletic League gym.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photos of Seanie Monaghan and Day at the Freeport Police Athletic League gym.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Patrick did not need to be healed. He was happy and full of light and hope. \u201cPat had no intention of going pro,\u201d Aristhene remembers. \u201cBut the longer he stayed in the game, and kept winning, the competitor in him said: \u2018I need to face the best in the world.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Did Patrick love boxing because it\u2019s the ultimate test physically, emotionally and psychologically? \u201cExactly. That fact drew him in. In other sports you can shove the responsibility on to a team mate. But, with boxing, it\u2019s all on you. You need discipline. You can\u2019t be with your lady friends the way you want. You can\u2019t eat the food you want. Early to bed. Wake up at dawn to run. That discipline is addictive.\u201d</p> <p>I travel across Long Island to interview Lou DiBella, <a href=\"https://myemail.constantcontact.com/STATEMENT-ON-THE-PASSING-OF-PATRICK-DAY.html?soid=1107007864509&amp;aid=PzrflrhgLB8\" title=\"\">Day\u2019s promoter</a>, at home in Sea Cliff. DiBella, a Harvard Law School graduate, has been in boxing for over 30 years \u2013 but Day\u2019s death shook him. Ten weeks since the tragic fight between two boxers he promoted, he still looks stricken. \u201cI met Pat at the Golden Gloves,\u201d DiBella recalls. \u201cIt was impossible not to notice him. He was a good-looking, eloquent kid with a big smile. Patrick was not your usual prize fighter. He didn\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p> <p>From his pro debut in New York on 23 January 2013, Day won nine and drew one of his first 10 fights. Then, in January 2015, he faced Alantez Fox who was unbeaten in 14. Fox won a majority decision. \u201cIn my contracts, if a fighter loses, I can release him,\u201d DiBella reveals. \u201cIt sounds cold, but it\u2019s for the fighter\u2019s good. Boxing is unforgiving and you can go from being a prospect to an opponent very quickly. People are hitting you in the head so it\u2019s not healthy.</p> <p>\u201cFox was world-class but that fight could have gone either way. So I told him: \u2018Pat, I\u2019m keeping you on.\u2019 He won the next two but then he fought a guy meant to be an ego\u2011boost in Brooklyn.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos Garcia Hernandez, Day\u2019s opponent in November 2015, had a mediocre record \u2013 nine wins, 14 losses and one draw. \u201cThe guy was a journeyman but he knocked Pat out. I thought Pat should get out of boxing. He had the charisma to be a very successful working person. Some fighters I would have kept on because if you take them out of boxing they get into drugs, criminal behaviour. Pat would never do that. I figured Pat could get a job so I released him.\u201d</p> <p>That decision hurt Day and Higgins. \u201cI was a little angry,\u201d Higgins admits, \u201cbecause Pat went for a quick knockout. In his previous fight he dropped the kid and I don\u2019t know how he didn\u2019t get counted out. The referee blew it. Pat still won every round. But afterwards DiBella criticised Pat, his own boxer. They made a comment like Patrick needs to hit harder. That offended Pat. Against the journeyman, he tried to knock the guy out right away. That\u2019s never the gameplan. He learned a valuable lesson and in his remaining fights he stuck to our gameplan. He beat real competitive guys.\u201d</p> <p>As the designated B-list opponent, meant to fall at the feet of the A-list prospect, Day shocked fighters with impressive records. From April 2016 to February 2019 he won six consecutive fights against supposedly superior rivals. DiBella had re-signed him after he beat the unbeaten Eric Walker in July 2017. \u201cLou had just signed Walker,\u201d Higgins remembers, \u201cbut we knew we\u2019d beat him.\u201d</p> <p>DiBella acknowledges: \u201cPat and Joe didn\u2019t quit. They won some big fights against top opposition. I had a new contract with Pat and I put him in fights that were tough but not like King Kong fights. He went on a long winning run. That made me realise: \u2018I can get him another opportunity.\u2019</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Education is everything to his family and we want to continue Pat\u2019s legacy</p> <footer> <cite>Lou DiBella, Patrick Day's promoter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe came to see me before the Carlos Adames fight [in late June 2019]. His mother didn\u2019t want him to fight. His parents are highly educated. This is not a family of under-achievers struggling against poverty. Pat was a kid any father would want his daughter to come home with. He said to me: \u2018I\u2019m making $10,000 a fight. I can\u2019t justify this to my family. You\u2019ve got to get me bigger fights.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t making much money with him but I believed in him as a person. His character was impeccable. When you have that combination of character, heart and you\u2019re good, you can go a long way. So we got him Adames.\u201d</p> <p>Adames, a punishing fighter from the Dominican Republic, had a flawless 17-0 record \u2013 but Day would make $50,000 and believed he could win. \u201cPat boxed well against Adames,\u201d Higgins says. \u201cBut the kid hurt him in the final round. I saw a picture of Pat after the fight. Their arms are around each other and they\u2019re smiling. But Patrick\u2019s face is busted up.\u201d</p> <p>DiBella recalls: \u201cPat fought brilliantly. Two-thirds of the way through, it was anybody\u2019s fight. Adames wore Pat down but it was highly competitive. It was on ESPN and afterwards Pat was very positive. Sometimes you lose and it\u2019s solitary. But everyone was taking pictures and telling him how well he fought. I told him I wasn\u2019t going to release him. Pat\u2019s message was the same: \u2018I don\u2019t want a meaningless fight. I want another opportunity.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Higgins believed \u201cIt could have been a draw\u201d, adding: \u201cBrad Goodman, the Top Rank matchmaker, felt that. Pat wasn\u2019t his guy but they all loved Patrick. Brad thought Pat could beat Charles Conwell. He felt Conwell wasn\u2019t as good as Adames.\u201d</p> <p>Aristhene was less certain. \u201cI saw Conwell at the 2015 Golden Gloves. He fought Cordell Booker, who\u2019s now an undefeated professional from New York. He beat Booker convincingly. I remember telling Pat that \u2018Conwell is really tough\u2019. But Pat and myself still thought it was winnable.\u201d</p> <p>Seanie\u2019s wife, was more worried. \u201cI was walking around town with Beverly that Saturday,\u201d Seanie remembers, \u201cand we saw the wife of Joe Quiambao who used to be DiBella\u2019s matchmaker. She and my wife have a bond, and they loved Patrick. They were like: \u2018Oh, no, Pat\u2019s fighting another fricken beast.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In Chicago, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-2028420/Video-Patrick-Day-speaks-Conwell-knockout-left-comatose.html\" title=\"\">Day had charmed the final press conference</a>. He praised Chicago and the other fighters. He hoped everyone would stay \u201chealthy and in one piece\u201d. Day then said: \u201cPeople look at me and say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re such a nice guy, well-spoken, why do you choose to box?\u2019 But I have a fighter\u2019s soul and I love this sport. Boxing makes me happy. That\u2019s why I choose to do it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to go out there on Saturday and have fun.\u201d</p> <p>Higgins smiles. \u201cIf anyone was thinking of talking smack they decided right after Patrick spoke that \u2018I\u2019m not doing it\u2019. He humbled the entire room. He made everybody love each other.\u201d</p> <p>Few people loved him as much as his best friend. Aristhene, still reeling from his ominous dream the night before, felt sick. \u201cIn my dream the bad knockout happened in the third round. So once the fight passed round three, I felt calmer, like maybe this dream won\u2019t come true. And then, in the 10th, it happened. I hated that.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen guys knocked out, and put on a stretcher, but they wake up. Look at Curtis Stevens against David Lemieux. He was on a stretcher, but he put his hand up and was OK. Manny Pacquiao got put to sleep pretty hard, but I\u2019m thinking: \u2018He woke up. He was OK.\u2019 It\u2019s not usually the guys knocked out cold who suffer damage. It\u2019s usually the guys beaten up round after round. Pat got dropped twice earlier but the first one he was off-balance. The second was a rough one, but he was OK. The last one was so abrupt and his head hit the canvas so hard. But it wasn\u2019t until they said he didn\u2019t wake up that I knew it was bad. I flew to Chicago.\u201d</p> <p>Monaghan still can\u2019t quite believe his friend is gone. \u201cCoach called me from hospital. He says: \u2018It\u2019s not good, man. He won\u2019t wake up.\u2019 It was horrible. I thought, \u2018Pat\u2019s career is over but he\u2019s a good kid and will do something else now.\u2019 I was sad for Pat because he loved boxing. I never thought \u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43b59d685c3ac3b77cb5519cf880d0223bd7459a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43b59d685c3ac3b77cb5519cf880d0223bd7459a/0_0_7302_4868/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gym locker of Patrick Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gym locker of Patrick Day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Monaghan looks up. \u201cDiBella called me at midnight. He was freaking out: \u2018Sean, the doctors say he might not make it.\u2019 I told my wife and she gasped. Every time I spoke to Joe, there was no good news. The third Day brother was flying in from Texas. They were waiting for him and then they would switch off the machines. It makes me sick thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeatherHardyBox\" title=\"\">Heather Hardy</a> , a fellow New York fighter, was also hit hard by Day\u2019s death. On 18 October <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeatherHardyBox/status/1185352114215751680\" title=\"\">Hardy tweeted</a>: \u201cFor 12 hours our timelines were flooded with love and prayers for Patrick Day. Now most of that is gone. I refuse to forget, or allow anyone to forget his death. I\u2019m losing sleep \u2026 not because Pat was so close to me \u2026 but because he was me. I am him. Don\u2019t forget him.\u201d</p> <p>I interview Hardy in Gleason\u2019s, the famous old gym that lies in the shadow of Brooklyn bridge, and her face is lined with sweat after sparring. Hardy believes that the business of boxing, rather than the actual sport, cost Day his life. What does she mean? \u201cAn A-sided fighter is the favourite. You\u2019re the promoter\u2019s fighter. The B-side fighter is the guy who\u2019s not supposed to win. The only time a B-side fighter ever really wins a fight, is when they knock the A-side fighter out. I felt like I am Pat because I also went into my last fight [<a href=\"https://www.badlefthook.com/2019/9/13/20865351/hardy-vs-serrano-results-amanda-dominates-heather-win-wbo-title-scores-decision-dazn-boxing-news\" title=\"\">against Amanda Serrano</a>] as the B-side fighter. I felt the only way I was going to win was if I knocked her out.</p> <p>\u201cIt made me lose respect for how boxing treats its combatants. Patrick was just treated as somebody to make money for everybody. A stepping stone. But he was a great person. I met him in the amateurs. I believe we were on the national team together. But I was also a matchmaker at Gleason\u2019s so I matched fights for him. I was about 29 and Pat would have been 18. But I can\u2019t claim we were close friends. We were just fighters together. It\u2019s different with Seanie Monaghan and Pat. They were like brothers.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Monaghan when he last saw his friend. His crumpled face brightens as he remembers Patrick dancing in a Long Beach bar. \u201cHe was dressed so nice, dancing with this white girl. He turns round and gives me the biggest smile and sweatiest hug. He was a sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>The last time the two Patricks went out they also ended up dancing in Rockville. \u201cWe were sitting around and I said: \u2018I feel like dancing,\u2019\u201d Aristhene recalls. \u201cWe went to this place we liked and met two beautiful girls. We danced with them and had a great night. There was no drinking. Just dancing and good conversation. After that we went home. We live on the same block so Pat dropped me off at the corner.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aristhene drives me back to the gym in Freeport. I tell him how Higgins had said he would miss Patrick more than ever on Christmas morning. \u201cWe live across the street from the Days and Pat and I had this Christmas tradition,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cWe would meet in the middle of the street and I\u2019d get my Christmas morning hug from Pat. It\u2019s going to be hard on Christmas Day. I won\u2019t hug Pat Day.\u201d</p> <p>New Year will be harder for Aristhene. He and Pat always spent New Year\u2019s Eve together. \u201cI\u2019m going to be with his brothers this time,\u201d Aristhene says. \u201cWe\u2019ll remember Pat.\u201d</p> <p>Walking through the park to the gym, we feel better. The Day family and Aristhene are setting up a Patrick Day scholarship which will be supported by DiBella \u2013 with further contributions from Dazn, the sports streaming service, and <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/videos/6095609512001/Patrick-Day-Eddie-Hearn-cries-as-he-talks-about-the-late-boxe\" title=\"\">Eddie Hearn, who promoted his last fight</a>, and other boxing insiders.</p> <p>\u201cEducation is everything to his family and we want to continue Pat\u2019s legacy,\u201d DiBella said. \u201cWhat happened is heartbreaking but we can feel Pat\u2019s impact. More has been written about health and safety in boxing the last few months than in a long time. There\u2019ll be a kid going to college every year because of Pat. His name will live on.\u201d</p> <p>Those closest to him are badly wounded. Aristhene stresses that Pat\u2019s mother, \u201cwho is like a second mom to me\u201d, is \u201csuch a good person. But it\u2019s so hard for her. There have also been days when I could hardly get up. If I was not a schoolteacher I would have quit my job. But knowing I had kids to help got me up. Pat came to the school last year and spoke to the kids. They loved him. Everything we\u2019re doing in his name gives me positivity because, all our 27 years, he was my best friend, my brother. I had him the whole ride. So, when he passed, I had no regrets. That\u2019s freeing.\u201d</p> <p>Inside the gym we see old photographs of Patrick boxing and smiling. We see his fight robe and his locker with his name scrawled above it. We see the ring where he and Seanie Monaghan sparred their thousand rounds. We see the corner where Joe Higgins used to wipe sweat from Patrick\u2019s face while teaching him to become an even better fighter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1cd19c9b51d98d0771b1d56251cf4b1e846a25b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cd19c9b51d98d0771b1d56251cf4b1e846a25b1/122_199_7763_4658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Higgins\u2019s cornerman jacket hangs at the Freeport Police Athletic League gym.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Higgins\u2019s cornerman jacket hangs at the Freeport Police Athletic League gym.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How does Aristhene feel about boxing now? \u201cVery mixed. Boxing changed me for the better. Winning the Golden Gloves is one of my highest honours. It gave me discipline and clarity. But it\u2019s hard for me to tell people to box now because of what happened. Boxing did a lot for Pat but it took his life. He died doing something he loved. When I\u2019m shadow-boxing in the ring I feel good. I feel close to Pat. But then I have waves of frustration, anger, sadness at the gravity of it. Sometimes I throw punches and watch myself in the mirror. These are the movements that took his life but I know he submitted his soul to boxing.</p> <p>\u201cI had another dream about Pat the other night. I shave my head now. So when people touch my head it feels different. I felt Pat touch my head. In the dream I said: \u2018What is it like?\u2019 He said: \u2018It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s chill with an all-knowing feeling.\u2019 I found peace in that.\u201d</p> <p>We drive through Freeport one last time and, after all the tumult and grief, I sense that peace. I remember how, as we left the gym, Aristhene reached out and touched Pat\u2019s locker. It was his way of saying goodbye \u2013 and a reminder that he will be back.</p> <p>At Freepoint station we embrace like Coach Joe and Pat Day. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure his name and his legacy live on,\u201d Aristhene says with certainty. \u201cPatrick Day will never be forgotten.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhen the time came to say goodbye, I told Pat I loved him and I appreciated him,\u201d Patrick Aristhene says as he remembers the moment before the machines were switched off and his best friend, the boxer Patrick Day, slipped away into death. Four days earlier, on 12 October 2019, Day had been knocked out in the last round of his 22nd professional fight, against Charles Conwell, in Chicago. He fell into a coma and the doctors soon knew they could not save him. On a beautiful late December afternoon in Rockville Centre, near New York, with a low winter sun as gentle as the subject of our interview is hard, Aristhene recalls his final words in hospital. \u201cI told Pat, \u2018Hold it down that side and watch over everybody. I\u2019ll hold it down this side till I see you again.\u2019 I believe I\u2019ll see Pat again. I believe the human spirit is powerful and, when we die, it goes on a journey. The Egyptians said it: \u2018Death is only the beginning.\u2019\u201d Many fighters have died in the ring, and there have been five boxing fatalities this year, but the death of 27-year-old Patrick Day resonates. He was not impoverished or desperate. Boxing, far from being his only hope, was his choice out of many options. His father was a doctor and his mother an editorial assistant at the UN. Day was college educated and his intelligence was matched by his eloquence, charm and dedication to boxing as a super\u2011welterweight (154lb) who had been ranked in the world\u2019s top 10 by the IBF and WBC. \u201cPat didn\u2019t waste a moment of his life,\u201d says Aristhene, a former Golden Gloves champion, \u201cand he did everything with good intentions. We lived on the same block in Freeport [Long Island, New York] our whole lives and, as a kid, I could run to his house in seven seconds. Our parents are from Haiti and they put us together as babies. He was born in August 1992 and I was born that October. We both majored in food and nutrition and bounced most decisions off each other. \u201cPatrick was pure-hearted. He would ask me to take a second look at people I didn\u2019t trust. Patrick would say: \u2018Look at their heart.\u2019 He encouraged me to give them another chance. There were times I\u2019d say: \u2018Pat, this guy is taking advantage of you,\u2019 and he\u2019d agree. I was the realist, he was the optimist. We balanced each other. Our last messages are right here.\u201d Aristhene opens his phone. \u201cHere we go. Saturday October 12.\u201d We read the stream of messages that fateful day as they texted each other from Freeport and Chicago. After Aristhene wished him good luck against Conwell, Day wrote these words to his oldest friend: \u201cAppreciate you and love you, my brother. Tonight I\u2019m going to do my thang out there.\u201d Aristhene responded: \u201cLove you man. I\u2019m excited for the world to see what you got.\u201d He still felt a secret foreboding. \u201cI was anxious because I had a dream the night before that somebody was going to get hurt bad. In the dream I was in Chicago at the fight. I\u2019m trying to get through the crowd, saying: \u2018Who won?\u2019 A voice tells me: \u2018Someone got knocked out bad.\u2019 In the dream I couldn\u2019t tell who it was. So on the night of the fight I had such pain in my stomach. I didn\u2019t care who won. I just wanted Pat to be safe.\u201d The two Patricks fell for boxing as teenagers. The Days lived across the street from Joe Higgins, a former marine and firefighter who ran the local boxing gym. Higgins kept his garage doors open so the boys could see a heavy bag dangling from the rafters. He knew they would be curious and sure enough, when he was a skinny 14-year-old, Day crossed Buchanan Street and began hitting the bag. Higgins chided him \u2013 but only because he was slapping rather than punching. It was not long before Day and Aristhene joined Higgins at his Freeport PAL gym. The trainer promised Day\u2019s mother, Lyssa, her son would learn many good habits through boxing. Lyssa disliked boxing, but she knew Higgins was a good man. He was respected throughout Freeport. Apart from the hope he spread through boxing, he and his brother Tim had been among the first firemen who went into the burning Twin Towers on 9/11. Tim died, after saving many lives. Joe survived \u2013 but he carries the darkness of that terrible day in hidden corners of his mind. Aristhene smiles when I ask if he and Day were intimidated by Higgins. \u201cCoach Joe is only intimidating in the sense of discipline. When he was around, you didn\u2019t say a curse word. You minded your p\u2019s and q\u2019s. To have him in the neighbourhood was good.\u201d Did he and Day realise Higgins was haunted by 9/11? \u201cPat and me would get a lift to the gym with Coach Joe. During those car rides, we began to understand the demons he\u2019s still battling with. But it was only when Pat and I became men that we understood the trauma.\u201d Aristhene and Day revered Seanie Monaghan \u2013 a professional fighter from Long Island who was 11 years older than them. Monaghan was Higgins\u2019s star boxer. He came to boxing late but reeled off 28 successive wins in front of a vociferous following. The light-heavyweight retired last April with a 29\u20113 record and his reputation as New York\u2019s most popular fighter intact. \u201cSeanie\u2019s our big brother,\u201d Aristhene says. \u201cPat loved going to the Long Beach boardwalk where you felt Seanie\u2019s clout. If we told anyone there we boxed with Sean Monaghan they\u2019d say: \u2018Whatever you want is free.\u2019 At clubs you just had to say Seanie\u2019s name and you were in. Sean was a hero \u2013 and our friend.\u201d Monaghan, who is now 38, picks me up from Freeport station on a cold afternoon. His warmth fills the car and, despite his grief for Day, Monaghan makes our meeting feel natural. He only pauses when holding the keys to Higgins\u2019s gym \u2013 a small blue brick building in the middle of a Freeport park. \u201cI\u2019ve not been inside since we lost Pat,\u201d he says. \u201cCoach Joe closed it for a few weeks and I\u2019ve not been able to face coming back.\u201d Old posters, featuring some of Monaghan\u2019s greatest nights in the ring and Day\u2019s past fights, line the walls. The blue ring is empty. But, rather than being an ominous symbol of the place where Day lost his life, it feels like home. We sit on the ring apron as Monaghan remembers his friend. \u201cPatrick walked in here around 2005,\u201d he says. \u201cI was 25 and he was this skinny kid. He always had a smile, very humble, a really pleasant kid. When Patrick first came to the track where Coach Joe made us run, I lapped him. Then, when he got older, I couldn\u2019t keep up with him. He was smoking that track. Patrick fought at 154 to 160 [lb] and I was 175, but we sparred a lot. He was tough. I sparred beasts like Artur Beterbiev [the world\u2019s most ferocious light-heavyweight] but Patrick was so competitive. He always tried to get me and he was fast. \u201cIn the summer we opened the steel doors and people watched me and Patrick put on some shows. I sparred more with Patrick than anyone else. We ran the track together, did our gym work together, did everything together. He was a wonderful person who had such heart.\u201d Aristhene says something similar. \u201cPat had more determination than anyone I\u2019ve met. He wasn\u2019t good at sports like basketball. But his determination made him good at defence. He was so tenacious he always found a way to do well. At school his nickname was \u2018Straight A Day\u2019. He got straight A\u2019s in everything. He wrote that nickname on his headgear and shoes. \u201cPat was the golden child but I\u2019d get into fights at school. I\u2019d get suspended. Pat said: \u2018You should think about boxing.\u2019 But he lost his first three amateur fights. I\u2019ll never forget we were in his kitchen making pancakes. He said: \u2018Man, if I lose the next fight, I\u2019m done.\u2019 But he won, and won again. When Pat won the Golden Gloves I was like: \u2018I got to get mine.\u2019 How many Golden Gloves champions live on the same block like Pat and me? That\u2019s testament to Coach Joe.\u201d Our reflections are interrupted by the arrival of Higgins. A strapping man, with a cap covering his bald head, he sounds exactly like a tough New York firefighter. But, as the man who introduced Patrick to boxing and worked the corner in every one of his amateur and professional fights, Higgins is grieving. He explains how, after he reopened the gym last month, he could not bear the thought of it being associated with boxing. Higgins resolved to turn it into a fitness centre. But, as the weeks pass and young men ask him to help them box, and even fight in next year\u2019s Golden Gloves, Higgins has felt torn. He knows Patrick would want him to continue, and he reiterates how dark the park seemed when the gym was closed, but he still lives across the street from the Day family. It breaks his heart every time he sees Pat\u2019s mother, knowing how much she hated boxing. How can he go on? Did boxing help him to deal with the torment of 9/11? \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt,\u201d Higgins says. \u201cI was diagnosed with everything. But I was a high-profile fire guy, a marine. You don\u2019t admit that stuff. I know it\u2019s stupid and today I counsel people \u2013 \u2018Go get help.\u2019 But going for help made me feel worse. Coming here every day is what helped me. The gym is a family but I\u2019m closest to Sean and Patrick. Sean came here a few months after 9/11 when I was still dazed. Remember, Seanie?\u201d Monaghan nods. \u201cYou were in and out for a while \u2026\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t always here,\u201d Higgins agrees, \u201cbut Seanie kept showing up. I could tell he was serious about boxing and that helped me.\u201d Higgins smiles. \u201cThen Patrick showed up. Seanie had such a positive impact on Pat because he is really kind. They sparred a thousand rounds together over the years. Patrick changed me too because I felt he would look at me differently if I got too angry and cursed. So I don\u2019t curse no more. Seanie and Patrick were raised right, and they gave me a healing force with boxing.\u201d Patrick did not need to be healed. He was happy and full of light and hope. \u201cPat had no intention of going pro,\u201d Aristhene remembers. \u201cBut the longer he stayed in the game, and kept winning, the competitor in him said: \u2018I need to face the best in the world.\u2019\u201d Did Patrick love boxing because it\u2019s the ultimate test physically, emotionally and psychologically? \u201cExactly. That fact drew him in. In other sports you can shove the responsibility on to a team mate. But, with boxing, it\u2019s all on you. You need discipline. You can\u2019t be with your lady friends the way you want. You can\u2019t eat the food you want. Early to bed. Wake up at dawn to run. That discipline is addictive.\u201d I travel across Long Island to interview Lou DiBella, Day\u2019s promoter, at home in Sea Cliff. DiBella, a Harvard Law School graduate, has been in boxing for over 30 years \u2013 but Day\u2019s death shook him. Ten weeks since the tragic fight between two boxers he promoted, he still looks stricken. \u201cI met Pat at the Golden Gloves,\u201d DiBella recalls. \u201cIt was impossible not to notice him. He was a good-looking, eloquent kid with a big smile. Patrick was not your usual prize fighter. He didn\u2019t have to do this.\u201d From his pro debut in New York on 23 January 2013, Day won nine and drew one of his first 10 fights. Then, in January 2015, he faced Alantez Fox who was unbeaten in 14. Fox won a majority decision. \u201cIn my contracts, if a fighter loses, I can release him,\u201d DiBella reveals. \u201cIt sounds cold, but it\u2019s for the fighter\u2019s good. Boxing is unforgiving and you can go from being a prospect to an opponent very quickly. People are hitting you in the head so it\u2019s not healthy. \u201cFox was world-class but that fight could have gone either way. So I told him: \u2018Pat, I\u2019m keeping you on.\u2019 He won the next two but then he fought a guy meant to be an ego\u2011boost in Brooklyn.\u201d Carlos Garcia Hernandez, Day\u2019s opponent in November 2015, had a mediocre record \u2013 nine wins, 14 losses and one draw. \u201cThe guy was a journeyman but he knocked Pat out. I thought Pat should get out of boxing. He had the charisma to be a very successful working person. Some fighters I would have kept on because if you take them out of boxing they get into drugs, criminal behaviour. Pat would never do that. I figured Pat could get a job so I released him.\u201d That decision hurt Day and Higgins. \u201cI was a little angry,\u201d Higgins admits, \u201cbecause Pat went for a quick knockout. In his previous fight he dropped the kid and I don\u2019t know how he didn\u2019t get counted out. The referee blew it. Pat still won every round. But afterwards DiBella criticised Pat, his own boxer. They made a comment like Patrick needs to hit harder. That offended Pat. Against the journeyman, he tried to knock the guy out right away. That\u2019s never the gameplan. He learned a valuable lesson and in his remaining fights he stuck to our gameplan. He beat real competitive guys.\u201d As the designated B-list opponent, meant to fall at the feet of the A-list prospect, Day shocked fighters with impressive records. From April 2016 to February 2019 he won six consecutive fights against supposedly superior rivals. DiBella had re-signed him after he beat the unbeaten Eric Walker in July 2017. \u201cLou had just signed Walker,\u201d Higgins remembers, \u201cbut we knew we\u2019d beat him.\u201d DiBella acknowledges: \u201cPat and Joe didn\u2019t quit. They won some big fights against top opposition. I had a new contract with Pat and I put him in fights that were tough but not like King Kong fights. He went on a long winning run. That made me realise: \u2018I can get him another opportunity.\u2019 \u201cHe came to see me before the Carlos Adames fight [in late June 2019]. His mother didn\u2019t want him to fight. His parents are highly educated. This is not a family of under-achievers struggling against poverty. Pat was a kid any father would want his daughter to come home with. He said to me: \u2018I\u2019m making $10,000 a fight. I can\u2019t justify this to my family. You\u2019ve got to get me bigger fights.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t making much money with him but I believed in him as a person. His character was impeccable. When you have that combination of character, heart and you\u2019re good, you can go a long way. So we got him Adames.\u201d Adames, a punishing fighter from the Dominican Republic, had a flawless 17-0 record \u2013 but Day would make $50,000 and believed he could win. \u201cPat boxed well against Adames,\u201d Higgins says. \u201cBut the kid hurt him in the final round. I saw a picture of Pat after the fight. Their arms are around each other and they\u2019re smiling. But Patrick\u2019s face is busted up.\u201d DiBella recalls: \u201cPat fought brilliantly. Two-thirds of the way through, it was anybody\u2019s fight. Adames wore Pat down but it was highly competitive. It was on ESPN and afterwards Pat was very positive. Sometimes you lose and it\u2019s solitary. But everyone was taking pictures and telling him how well he fought. I told him I wasn\u2019t going to release him. Pat\u2019s message was the same: \u2018I don\u2019t want a meaningless fight. I want another opportunity.\u2019\u201d Higgins believed \u201cIt could have been a draw\u201d, adding: \u201cBrad Goodman, the Top Rank matchmaker, felt that. Pat wasn\u2019t his guy but they all loved Patrick. Brad thought Pat could beat Charles Conwell. He felt Conwell wasn\u2019t as good as Adames.\u201d Aristhene was less certain. \u201cI saw Conwell at the 2015 Golden Gloves. He fought Cordell Booker, who\u2019s now an undefeated professional from New York. He beat Booker convincingly. I remember telling Pat that \u2018Conwell is really tough\u2019. But Pat and myself still thought it was winnable.\u201d Seanie\u2019s wife, was more worried. \u201cI was walking around town with Beverly that Saturday,\u201d Seanie remembers, \u201cand we saw the wife of Joe Quiambao who used to be DiBella\u2019s matchmaker. She and my wife have a bond, and they loved Patrick. They were like: \u2018Oh, no, Pat\u2019s fighting another fricken beast.\u2019\u201d In Chicago, Day had charmed the final press conference. He praised Chicago and the other fighters. He hoped everyone would stay \u201chealthy and in one piece\u201d. Day then said: \u201cPeople look at me and say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re such a nice guy, well-spoken, why do you choose to box?\u2019 But I have a fighter\u2019s soul and I love this sport. Boxing makes me happy. That\u2019s why I choose to do it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to go out there on Saturday and have fun.\u201d Higgins smiles. \u201cIf anyone was thinking of talking smack they decided right after Patrick spoke that \u2018I\u2019m not doing it\u2019. He humbled the entire room. He made everybody love each other.\u201d Few people loved him as much as his best friend. Aristhene, still reeling from his ominous dream the night before, felt sick. \u201cIn my dream the bad knockout happened in the third round. So once the fight passed round three, I felt calmer, like maybe this dream won\u2019t come true. And then, in the 10th, it happened. I hated that. \u201cI\u2019ve seen guys knocked out, and put on a stretcher, but they wake up. Look at Curtis Stevens against David Lemieux. He was on a stretcher, but he put his hand up and was OK. Manny Pacquiao got put to sleep pretty hard, but I\u2019m thinking: \u2018He woke up. He was OK.\u2019 It\u2019s not usually the guys knocked out cold who suffer damage. It\u2019s usually the guys beaten up round after round. Pat got dropped twice earlier but the first one he was off-balance. The second was a rough one, but he was OK. The last one was so abrupt and his head hit the canvas so hard. But it wasn\u2019t until they said he didn\u2019t wake up that I knew it was bad. I flew to Chicago.\u201d Monaghan still can\u2019t quite believe his friend is gone. \u201cCoach called me from hospital. He says: \u2018It\u2019s not good, man. He won\u2019t wake up.\u2019 It was horrible. I thought, \u2018Pat\u2019s career is over but he\u2019s a good kid and will do something else now.\u2019 I was sad for Pat because he loved boxing. I never thought \u2026\u201d Monaghan looks up. \u201cDiBella called me at midnight. He was freaking out: \u2018Sean, the doctors say he might not make it.\u2019 I told my wife and she gasped. Every time I spoke to Joe, there was no good news. The third Day brother was flying in from Texas. They were waiting for him and then they would switch off the machines. It makes me sick thinking about it.\u201d Heather Hardy , a fellow New York fighter, was also hit hard by Day\u2019s death. On 18 October Hardy tweeted: \u201cFor 12 hours our timelines were flooded with love and prayers for Patrick Day. Now most of that is gone. I refuse to forget, or allow anyone to forget his death. I\u2019m losing sleep \u2026 not because Pat was so close to me \u2026 but because he was me. I am him. Don\u2019t forget him.\u201d I interview Hardy in Gleason\u2019s, the famous old gym that lies in the shadow of Brooklyn bridge, and her face is lined with sweat after sparring. Hardy believes that the business of boxing, rather than the actual sport, cost Day his life. What does she mean? \u201cAn A-sided fighter is the favourite. You\u2019re the promoter\u2019s fighter. The B-side fighter is the guy who\u2019s not supposed to win. The only time a B-side fighter ever really wins a fight, is when they knock the A-side fighter out. I felt like I am Pat because I also went into my last fight [against Amanda Serrano] as the B-side fighter. I felt the only way I was going to win was if I knocked her out. \u201cIt made me lose respect for how boxing treats its combatants. Patrick was just treated as somebody to make money for everybody. A stepping stone. But he was a great person. I met him in the amateurs. I believe we were on the national team together. But I was also a matchmaker at Gleason\u2019s so I matched fights for him. I was about 29 and Pat would have been 18. But I can\u2019t claim we were close friends. We were just fighters together. It\u2019s different with Seanie Monaghan and Pat. They were like brothers.\u201d I ask Monaghan when he last saw his friend. His crumpled face brightens as he remembers Patrick dancing in a Long Beach bar. \u201cHe was dressed so nice, dancing with this white girl. He turns round and gives me the biggest smile and sweatiest hug. He was a sweetheart.\u201d The last time the two Patricks went out they also ended up dancing in Rockville. \u201cWe were sitting around and I said: \u2018I feel like dancing,\u2019\u201d Aristhene recalls. \u201cWe went to this place we liked and met two beautiful girls. We danced with them and had a great night. There was no drinking. Just dancing and good conversation. After that we went home. We live on the same block so Pat dropped me off at the corner.\u201d Aristhene drives me back to the gym in Freeport. I tell him how Higgins had said he would miss Patrick more than ever on Christmas morning. \u201cWe live across the street from the Days and Pat and I had this Christmas tradition,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cWe would meet in the middle of the street and I\u2019d get my Christmas morning hug from Pat. It\u2019s going to be hard on Christmas Day. I won\u2019t hug Pat Day.\u201d New Year will be harder for Aristhene. He and Pat always spent New Year\u2019s Eve together. \u201cI\u2019m going to be with his brothers this time,\u201d Aristhene says. \u201cWe\u2019ll remember Pat.\u201d Walking through the park to the gym, we feel better. The Day family and Aristhene are setting up a Patrick Day scholarship which will be supported by DiBella \u2013 with further contributions from Dazn, the sports streaming service, and Eddie Hearn, who promoted his last fight, and other boxing insiders. \u201cEducation is everything to his family and we want to continue Pat\u2019s legacy,\u201d DiBella said. \u201cWhat happened is heartbreaking but we can feel Pat\u2019s impact. More has been written about health and safety in boxing the last few months than in a long time. There\u2019ll be a kid going to college every year because of Pat. His name will live on.\u201d Those closest to him are badly wounded. Aristhene stresses that Pat\u2019s mother, \u201cwho is like a second mom to me\u201d, is \u201csuch a good person. But it\u2019s so hard for her. There have also been days when I could hardly get up. If I was not a schoolteacher I would have quit my job. But knowing I had kids to help got me up. Pat came to the school last year and spoke to the kids. They loved him. Everything we\u2019re doing in his name gives me positivity because, all our 27 years, he was my best friend, my brother. I had him the whole ride. So, when he passed, I had no regrets. That\u2019s freeing.\u201d Inside the gym we see old photographs of Patrick boxing and smiling. We see his fight robe and his locker with his name scrawled above it. We see the ring where he and Seanie Monaghan sparred their thousand rounds. We see the corner where Joe Higgins used to wipe sweat from Patrick\u2019s face while teaching him to become an even better fighter. How does Aristhene feel about boxing now? \u201cVery mixed. Boxing changed me for the better. Winning the Golden Gloves is one of my highest honours. It gave me discipline and clarity. But it\u2019s hard for me to tell people to box now because of what happened. Boxing did a lot for Pat but it took his life. He died doing something he loved. When I\u2019m shadow-boxing in the ring I feel good. I feel close to Pat. But then I have waves of frustration, anger, sadness at the gravity of it. Sometimes I throw punches and watch myself in the mirror. These are the movements that took his life but I know he submitted his soul to boxing. \u201cI had another dream about Pat the other night. I shave my head now. So when people touch my head it feels different. I felt Pat touch my head. In the dream I said: \u2018What is it like?\u2019 He said: \u2018It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s chill with an all-knowing feeling.\u2019 I found peace in that.\u201d We drive through Freeport one last time and, after all the tumult and grief, I sense that peace. I remember how, as we left the gym, Aristhene reached out and touched Pat\u2019s locker. It was his way of saying goodbye \u2013 and a reminder that he will be back. At Freepoint station we embrace like Coach Joe and Pat Day. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure his name and his legacy live on,\u201d Aristhene says with certainty. \u201cPatrick Day will never be forgotten.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Michael Peacock, who has died aged 90 of cancer, joined the BBC in 1952, it was an institution notoriously resistant to change. Six years later he made his most lasting contribution to the corporation\u2019s culture. He and his colleague <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituarydonald-baverstock-1611694.html\" title=\"\">Donald Baverstock</a> were commissioned by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/20/bbc-sir-hugh-greene-death-archive-1987\" title=\"\">Sir Hugh Greene</a>, the director general, to write a report on BBC News \u2013 widely viewed as stuffy and conventional when compared with the viewer-friendlier output of Independent Television News, launched three years earlier on the rival channel.</p> <p>Their report did not pull its punches. \u201cWe were disturbed by the \u2018BBC-ish\u2019 flavour,\u201d the two men wrote. \u201cWe noted the emphasis placed on the arrival and departure of cabinet ministers \u2026 the way in which the platitudes and cliches uttered by an accepted public figure are so often presented to the viewers as a significant statement; the tendency to concentrate on \u2018official\u2019 pronouncements and attitudes.\u201d</p> <p>In 1961 Peacock was given the chance to correct these failings when he was appointed editor of the news operation, establishing the style of inquisitive reporting that today\u2019s politicians find so irritating. For him, it was a further step on a fast-track path that would soon lead to him running BBC Two and BBC One in turn, before leaving to pursue what was, at least initially, a less successful career in the commercial sector.</p> <p>Michael was born in Christchurch, Hampshire, to Norman, an advertising executive, and his wife, Sara. At the outbreak of the second world war he was evacuated to the US, where he was a boarder at the Kimball Union academy in Meriden, New Hampshire. On his return he attended Welwyn Garden City grammar school before graduating in sociology from the London School of Economics.</p> <p>Almost as soon as he had completed his degree he was hired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/12/grace-wyndham-goldie-bbc-producer-1940s-1950s-invented-tv-formats\" title=\"\">Grace Wyndham Goldie</a>, the power behind what was then known as the talks department of BBC TV. In 1952 he joined the team of young men she had identified as being of outstanding promise, capable of making waves in this so far under-exploited medium.</p> <p>Peacock produced a variety of factual TV programmes before being assigned specifically to Panorama, the weekly current affairs flagship, in 1955; as producer there he <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/magazine-26723188/is-this-the-best-april-fool-s-ever\" title=\"\">commissioned the spaghetti harvest hoax report broadcast</a> on 1 April 1957. It created headlines largely because it was so out of character with the programme\u2019s staid \u201cAuntie Beeb\u201d image. He was editor of Panorama from 1959 to 1961. After running BBC News for two years he was made chief of programmes for the new BBC Two channel, due to launch in 1964.</p> <p>His initial plan was for each evening\u2019s output to be grouped around a single theme, what he called the \u201cseven faces of the week\u201d. After a disastrous opening night, when a power failure caused the cancellation of most of the programmes, it soon became clear that this restrictive formula did not work. Viewing figures were discouragingly low, in part because most TV sets had to be adapted to receive the new channel, although he did initiate several successful programme strands, including Match of the Day, The Likely Lads and The Forsyte Saga.</p> <p>After little more than a year he was moved to head the main channel, BBC One, after Baverstock resigned in a huff at being asked to change places with him. Here Peacock was more successful; so much so that he was headhunted in 1967 to be managing director of London Weekend Television, a consortium put together by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/01/sir-david-frost\" title=\"\">David Frost</a> and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-aidan-crawley-1502189.html\" title=\"\">Aidan Crawley</a> to bid for the ITV franchise then held by ATV.</p> <p>Peacock\u2019s reputation, combined with the other high-profile names that Frost had persuaded to come on board, ensured that the consortium won the franchise, based on a promise to inject more quality programming into the weekend schedule: sophisticated satire (starring Frost), serious dramas and documentaries, rather than shows such as Sunday Night at the London Palladium that until then had been the characteristic weekend fare.</p> <p>The launch night, 2 August 1968, had disturbing parallels with that of BBC Two four years earlier. Many programmes were blacked out, this time because of a trade union dispute. When normal service resumed, it quickly became clear that viewers were no more ready to accept the more cerebral schedule on offer than they had Peacock\u2019s themed nights on BBC Two. In the first six months of operation, weekend ITV audiences fell by 16.5%, with a consequent reduction in advertising revenue.</p> <p>One problem was that Peacock, who had never previously worked for a commercial organisation, was reluctant to take instructions from the business executives on the LWT board. As Sir Robert Fraser, the director general of the Independent Television Authority, put it in a letter to his chairman: \u201cThe main criticism of Michael [is] that, with all his talent, he is a poor administrator and a worse leader of men.\u201d Fraser worried that the debacle at London Weekend would raise questions about ITA\u2019s procedures in awarding contracts. \u201cFor there is little doubt in my mind that LWT owes its appointment far more to the inclusion of Michael in the group than to any other single factor. I can remember how he dominated the interview with his consistent and brilliant talk.\u201d</p> <p>For all that brilliance, the LWT board fired Peacock in September 1969, overriding the objections of many of his senior colleagues, six of whom resigned in solidarity. His subsequent career was in the independent production sector. In 1972 he teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/john-cleese\" title=\"\">John Cleese</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/23/sir-antony-jay-obituary\" title=\"\">Antony Jay</a> to form <a href=\"https://www.videoarts.com/\" title=\"\">Video Arts</a>, a company making training films. That same year he was appointed managing director of Warner Brothers TV, the British arm of the US company, and two years later moved to California as executive vice-president of Warner Brothers Television.</p> <p>After two years he was back in Britain as the managing director of Dumbarton Films, a spin-off from the increasingly profitable Video Arts. He also helped launch Piccadilly Radio in Manchester in 1974. Such was his standing in broadcasting that in 1981 he was chosen as the first chairman of the Independent Programme Producers\u2019 Association, set up to protect the interests of producers in light of the rapid expansion of the market generated by the impending arrival of Channel 4.</p> <p>In 1989 Video Arts was sold for \u00a350m, of which his share was \u00a310m. He used the windfall to establish the Michael Peacock Charitable Foundation, providing postgraduate scholarships at the LSE for students from the former Soviet Union. He also funded the LSE\u2019s purchase of the Royalty theatre, close to its campus, which was renamed the Peacock theatre in his honour, and was active in other fundraising activities for the LSE and was a longstanding member of its council. He was made OBE in 2005.</p> <p>His main leisure pursuit was yachting. During the 1980s he was a member of the British team competing in the Admiral\u2019s Cup and in 1994 he formed a company, Truly Classic Yachts, marketing a yacht that he had helped design.</p> <p>In 1956 he married Daphne Lee, a music teacher. She survives him along with their three children, Adam, Emma and Caspar.</p> <p>\u2022 Ian Michael Peacock, broadcasting executive, born 14 September 1929; died 6 December 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Michael Peacock, who has died aged 90 of cancer, joined the BBC in 1952, it was an institution notoriously resistant to change. Six years later he made his most lasting contribution to the corporation\u2019s culture. He and his colleague Donald Baverstock were commissioned by Sir Hugh Greene, the director general, to write a report on BBC News \u2013 widely viewed as stuffy and conventional when compared with the viewer-friendlier output of Independent Television News, launched three years earlier on the rival channel. Their report did not pull its punches. \u201cWe were disturbed by the \u2018BBC-ish\u2019 flavour,\u201d the two men wrote. \u201cWe noted the emphasis placed on the arrival and departure of cabinet ministers \u2026 the way in which the platitudes and cliches uttered by an accepted public figure are so often presented to the viewers as a significant statement; the tendency to concentrate on \u2018official\u2019 pronouncements and attitudes.\u201d In 1961 Peacock was given the chance to correct these failings when he was appointed editor of the news operation, establishing the style of inquisitive reporting that today\u2019s politicians find so irritating. For him, it was a further step on a fast-track path that would soon lead to him running BBC Two and BBC One in turn, before leaving to pursue what was, at least initially, a less successful career in the commercial sector. Michael was born in Christchurch, Hampshire, to Norman, an advertising executive, and his wife, Sara. At the outbreak of the second world war he was evacuated to the US, where he was a boarder at the Kimball Union academy in Meriden, New Hampshire. On his return he attended Welwyn Garden City grammar school before graduating in sociology from the London School of Economics. Almost as soon as he had completed his degree he was hired by Grace Wyndham Goldie, the power behind what was then known as the talks department of BBC TV. In 1952 he joined the team of young men she had identified as being of outstanding promise, capable of making waves in this so far under-exploited medium. Peacock produced a variety of factual TV programmes before being assigned specifically to Panorama, the weekly current affairs flagship, in 1955; as producer there he commissioned the spaghetti harvest hoax report broadcast on 1 April 1957. It created headlines largely because it was so out of character with the programme\u2019s staid \u201cAuntie Beeb\u201d image. He was editor of Panorama from 1959 to 1961. After running BBC News for two years he was made chief of programmes for the new BBC Two channel, due to launch in 1964. His initial plan was for each evening\u2019s output to be grouped around a single theme, what he called the \u201cseven faces of the week\u201d. After a disastrous opening night, when a power failure caused the cancellation of most of the programmes, it soon became clear that this restrictive formula did not work. Viewing figures were discouragingly low, in part because most TV sets had to be adapted to receive the new channel, although he did initiate several successful programme strands, including Match of the Day, The Likely Lads and The Forsyte Saga. After little more than a year he was moved to head the main channel, BBC One, after Baverstock resigned in a huff at being asked to change places with him. Here Peacock was more successful; so much so that he was headhunted in 1967 to be managing director of London Weekend Television, a consortium put together by David Frost and Aidan Crawley to bid for the ITV franchise then held by ATV. Peacock\u2019s reputation, combined with the other high-profile names that Frost had persuaded to come on board, ensured that the consortium won the franchise, based on a promise to inject more quality programming into the weekend schedule: sophisticated satire (starring Frost), serious dramas and documentaries, rather than shows such as Sunday Night at the London Palladium that until then had been the characteristic weekend fare. The launch night, 2 August 1968, had disturbing parallels with that of BBC Two four years earlier. Many programmes were blacked out, this time because of a trade union dispute. When normal service resumed, it quickly became clear that viewers were no more ready to accept the more cerebral schedule on offer than they had Peacock\u2019s themed nights on BBC Two. In the first six months of operation, weekend ITV audiences fell by 16.5%, with a consequent reduction in advertising revenue. One problem was that Peacock, who had never previously worked for a commercial organisation, was reluctant to take instructions from the business executives on the LWT board. As Sir Robert Fraser, the director general of the Independent Television Authority, put it in a letter to his chairman: \u201cThe main criticism of Michael [is] that, with all his talent, he is a poor administrator and a worse leader of men.\u201d Fraser worried that the debacle at London Weekend would raise questions about ITA\u2019s procedures in awarding contracts. \u201cFor there is little doubt in my mind that LWT owes its appointment far more to the inclusion of Michael in the group than to any other single factor. I can remember how he dominated the interview with his consistent and brilliant talk.\u201d For all that brilliance, the LWT board fired Peacock in September 1969, overriding the objections of many of his senior colleagues, six of whom resigned in solidarity. His subsequent career was in the independent production sector. In 1972 he teamed up with John Cleese and Antony Jay to form Video Arts, a company making training films. That same year he was appointed managing director of Warner Brothers TV, the British arm of the US company, and two years later moved to California as executive vice-president of Warner Brothers Television. After two years he was back in Britain as the managing director of Dumbarton Films, a spin-off from the increasingly profitable Video Arts. He also helped launch Piccadilly Radio in Manchester in 1974. Such was his standing in broadcasting that in 1981 he was chosen as the first chairman of the Independent Programme Producers\u2019 Association, set up to protect the interests of producers in light of the rapid expansion of the market generated by the impending arrival of Channel 4. In 1989 Video Arts was sold for \u00a350m, of which his share was \u00a310m. He used the windfall to establish the Michael Peacock Charitable Foundation, providing postgraduate scholarships at the LSE for students from the former Soviet Union. He also funded the LSE\u2019s purchase of the Royalty theatre, close to its campus, which was renamed the Peacock theatre in his honour, and was active in other fundraising activities for the LSE and was a longstanding member of its council. He was made OBE in 2005. His main leisure pursuit was yachting. During the 1980s he was a member of the British team competing in the Admiral\u2019s Cup and in 1994 he formed a company, Truly Classic Yachts, marketing a yacht that he had helped design. In 1956 he married Daphne Lee, a music teacher. She survives him along with their three children, Adam, Emma and Caspar. \u2022 Ian Michael Peacock, broadcasting executive, born 14 September 1929; died 6 December 2019",

If it promoted the separation of church and state, it also encouraged the assumption that religion has nothing to do with politics and so created a vacuum that Christian populists like Trump and Orb\u00e1n have been quick to exploit.</p> <p>In the last century two great Christian thinkers in Oxford, AD Lindsey and Nathaniel Micklem, found it hard to decide whether to become ordained ministers or members of parliament. Both seemed to them equally important Christian vocations. Lindsey opted for politics but based his resistance to Hitler\u2019s tyranny on his Christian faith, as in his I Believe in Democracy. Micklem, as a theologian and principal of a theological college, argued in his Theology of Politics that \u201call political problems are at bottom theological\u201d because they raise questions about our relation to God, other human beings and all creation.</p> <p>As you urge, such convictions need to be more powerfully shared.<br><strong>Rev</strong><strong> Dr Donald W Norwood</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 Thank you for your Boxing Day editorial. According to George Lakoff in his book The Political Mind (pages 117-118), cognitive science has shown that there is a biological basis for empathy, cooperation and community. We are born to empathise and cooperate. I suggest it is not merely a coincidence that the tenet to love our neighbours as ourselves is written into the formative holy books of all the major faiths.</p> <p>Lakoff contrasts the strict father with the nurturing parent as metaphors of government. We are all susceptible to messages from both metaphors. Rightwing narratives are about the strict father. In the UK they implement policies preventing adults looking to the government for assistance lest they become dependent. Alternatively we could promote the the empathetic metaphor of government as a nurturing parent responsible for the health and wellbeing of every UK citizen. We need a moral narrative that could end the indignity and humiliation of homelessness for families and individuals.<br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br><em>Taxpayers Against Poverty</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is absolutely correct that all liberals \u2013 whether religious or nonreligious \u2013 should come together to oppose populism (whether Christian populism or not), but your leader falls into the same Christian exceptionalism as the populist in asserting that human equality and dignity begin with Christianity. To fight fire with fire is never productive, especially when it involves such historical revisionism. Accepting the reality that modern human rights are built on a blending of human traditions and rooted in our common humanity is the best path to the outcome of progress and solidarity that we should seek.<br><strong>Andrew Copson</strong><br><em>Chief executive, Humanists UK</em></p> <p>\u2022 Having outlined the disastrous consequences of the rise of religious identity politics, it is bizarre that you then suggest that US Democrats \u201cwearing their faith on their sleeve\u201d is a happy circumstance. The fact that they too \u201chave begun to play this game\u201d is beyond depressing. All the evidence points to the fact that religion only exacerbates division and discord in society. Keeping all religion and associated sectarian ideology out of the political sphere is the only way of uniting \u201cliberals of goodwill \u2026 across the religious/secular divide in 2020\u201d.<br><strong>John Dillon</strong><br><em>Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 Re your excellent editorial and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/25/footballer-v-nurse-who-is-valued-more\" title=\"\">Mark Redhead\u2019s letter</a> (26 December), on Christmas Day, following our morning service, two young Muslim men arrived to wish us a happy Christmas, to offer chocolates to everyone and to offer a free Christmas Day taxi service to older people.

If it promoted the separation of church and state, it also encouraged the assumption that religion has nothing to do with politics and so created a vacuum that Christian populists like Trump and Orb\u00e1n have been quick to exploit. In the last century two great Christian thinkers in Oxford, AD Lindsey and Nathaniel Micklem, found it hard to decide whether to become ordained ministers or members of parliament. Both seemed to them equally important Christian vocations. Lindsey opted for politics but based his resistance to Hitler\u2019s tyranny on his Christian faith, as in his I Believe in Democracy. Micklem, as a theologian and principal of a theological college, argued in his Theology of Politics that \u201call political problems are at bottom theological\u201d because they raise questions about our relation to God, other human beings and all creation. As you urge, such convictions need to be more powerfully shared. Rev Dr Donald W Norwood Oxford \u2022 Thank you for your Boxing Day editorial. According to George Lakoff in his book The Political Mind (pages 117-118), cognitive science has shown that there is a biological basis for empathy, cooperation and community. We are born to empathise and cooperate. I suggest it is not merely a coincidence that the tenet to love our neighbours as ourselves is written into the formative holy books of all the major faiths. Lakoff contrasts the strict father with the nurturing parent as metaphors of government. We are all susceptible to messages from both metaphors. Rightwing narratives are about the strict father. In the UK they implement policies preventing adults looking to the government for assistance lest they become dependent. Alternatively we could promote the the empathetic metaphor of government as a nurturing parent responsible for the health and wellbeing of every UK citizen. We need a moral narrative that could end the indignity and humiliation of homelessness for families and individuals. Rev Paul Nicolson Taxpayers Against Poverty \u2022 It is absolutely correct that all liberals \u2013 whether religious or nonreligious \u2013 should come together to oppose populism (whether Christian populism or not), but your leader falls into the same Christian exceptionalism as the populist in asserting that human equality and dignity begin with Christianity. To fight fire with fire is never productive, especially when it involves such historical revisionism. Accepting the reality that modern human rights are built on a blending of human traditions and rooted in our common humanity is the best path to the outcome of progress and solidarity that we should seek. Andrew Copson Chief executive, Humanists UK \u2022 Having outlined the disastrous consequences of the rise of religious identity politics, it is bizarre that you then suggest that US Democrats \u201cwearing their faith on their sleeve\u201d is a happy circumstance. The fact that they too \u201chave begun to play this game\u201d is beyond depressing. All the evidence points to the fact that religion only exacerbates division and discord in society. Keeping all religion and associated sectarian ideology out of the political sphere is the only way of uniting \u201cliberals of goodwill \u2026 across the religious/secular divide in 2020\u201d. John Dillon Birmingham \u2022 Re your excellent editorial and Mark Redhead\u2019s letter (26 December), on Christmas Day, following our morning service, two young Muslim men arrived to wish us a happy Christmas, to offer chocolates to everyone and to offer a free Christmas Day taxi service to older people. Religion can be a uniting force for good when followed as it should be.

      "bodyText": "The protests erupting all over India about the changes to citizenship embodied in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are heartwarming because they tell us that Indian democracy is alive and well at its grassroots, despite its current parliamentarians having ridden roughshod over the constitution (Jails fill amid rage on the streets, 21 December). This constitution was carefully debated and crafted in the constituent assembly over a three-year period as its makers, trained in the art of nationalist resistance, wrested control from the colonial state in an extraordinary exercise of moral and political legitimacy that laid bare the nature of British colonialism. In Henry Maine\u2019s words, British India was a \u201cmost extraordinary experiment\u201d involving \u201cthe virtually despotic government of a dependency by a free people\u201d. The postcolonial state of India that emerged in 1947, despite the bloody internecine conflict at its birth, did fulfil its promise at some level, to its citizens of \u201ca sovereign, socialist and democratic republic\u201d with justice, liberty and equality to all for the next 70 years. The constitutional imbroglio that India is in today is a result of a hasty and communally motivated act that goes against the vision of the architects of this great and diverse nation and its remarkable constitution. Vinita Damodaran Professor of south Asian history, University of Sussex \u2022 Re your report (Canada police prepared to shoot Indigenous activists, documents show, 20 December), yes this is awful, and I appreciate you sharing it. However, I would love it if you would start including the responsibility of England for the colonialism here in Canada, starting with Rupert\u2019s Land, which was appropriated with the stroke of a pen in 1670 \u2013 which led to the extraction of this region through the Hudson Bay Company. Absolutely everything about the way Canada is now started in England. England has benefited enormously from colonialism in Canada. I am not excusing the contemporary state for the continuance, but your article is not properly set in the context that actually admits responsibility.

      "body": "<p>Amazon\u2019s UK ambitions have been checked by the competition watchdog after it launched an in-depth investigation into the online retailer\u2019s purchase of a stake in food delivery company Deliveroo.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority announced the probe on Friday after Amazon and Deliveroo declined to offer concessions in response to the CMA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/11/amazon-investment-in-deliveroo-could-lead-to-higher-prices-says-cma\">initial raising of concerns earlier this month</a>.</p> <p>Amazon was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/17/amazon-invests-in-food-courier-service-deliveroo\">lead investor in a $575m (\u00a3442m) funding round</a>, announced in May, which reportedly gave it a 16% stake in Deliveroo.</p> <p>Deliveroo has been seeking investment to boost its performance against other deep-pocketed rivals such as Uber Eats, owned by the taxi app company Uber, and Just Eat, the FTSE 100 delivery platform that is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/19/just-eat-takeover-battle-rivals-make-new-bids-takeaway-com-prosus\">subject of a bidding war</a>.</p> <p>However, the CMA\u2019s decision to refer the transaction to a full investigation on Friday will cast doubt on whether the investment can go ahead. The regulator has the power to block the investment completely or demand specific remedies from the companies.</p> <p>The CMA said the deal could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower-quality services. Amazon and Deliveroo had been given five days from 11 December to come up with changes but did not offer alterations to the deal. The CMA says it will conclude its investigation by 11 June 2020.</p> <p>One of the main concerns was the impact on the incipient ultra-fast grocery delivery market. In the UK Deliveroo has been working on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/12/morrisons-expands-super-fast-amazon-delivery-deal\">grocery deliveries within </a>half an hour with convenience stores such as the Co-op, going up against Amazon\u2019s venture with Morrisons, which is available to some subscribers to its Prime service. While the sector is still relatively small \u2013 other ultra-fast services include Sainsbury\u2019s Chop Chop, Ocado Zoom and Waitrose\u2019s Rapid delivery service \u2013 the CMA was concerned that an effective merger between the two firms could erode competition.</p> <p>Amazon has previously tried to enter the food delivery market. In 2016 it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/amazon-moves-into-takeaway-food-delivery\">launched Amazon Restaurants</a>, which was initially available to some Londoners as part of its Prime subscription service. However, the operation was closed in December 2018, a testament to the difficult economics of delivering hot food at low cost.</p> <p>Food \u2013 a market worth nearly $1tn a year in the US alone \u2013 remains a key part of Amazon\u2019s plans. In June 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/16/amazon-buy-whole-foods-market-organic-food-fresh\">Amazon bought</a> the organic food chain Whole Foods, giving it a foothold in bricks-and-mortar retail.</p> <p>The CMA\u2019s investigation represents a rare regulatory rebuke to Amazon. The $926bn company, founded by Jeff Bezos, has built up commanding positions globally in online retail and cloud computing with relatively few regulatory hurdles.</p> <p>However, its size and use of offshore jurisdictions to minimise tax payments have increasingly attracted the attention of politicians across the world. The US Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/08/elizabeth-warren-amazon-facebook-google-big-tech-break-up-blogpost\">Amazon, and other online platforms such as Google and Facebook</a>, to be broken up.</p> <p>In the UK Boris Johnson last month said internet companies needed to make a \u201cfairer contribution\u201d on tax, although trade experts have questioned whether his government will push ahead with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/04/uk-could-drop-plans-to-tax-tech-firms-in-rush-to-secure-us-trade-deal-google\">a levy that could anger the US</a> ahead of crucial post-Brexit trade talks.</p> <p>The CMA decision will be a blow to the growth plans of Deliveroo. The company, which was founded in London by the former investment banker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/22/deliveroos-highest-paid-director-gets-57-pay-rise-despite-losses\">Will Shu</a>, has raised a total of $1.5bn since 2013 from backers including fund manager Fidelity and California-based tech investor Greenoaks Capital.</p> <p>Much of that investment has been used to fund expansion in new markets as well as development of its online takeaway technology. Revenues of Deliveroo\u2019s parent company, Roofoods, rose by 72% to \u00a3476m in 2018, but the company made a loss of \u00a3232m.</p> <p>It is understood the CMA will publish an issues statement, setting out in detail what it expects to investigate, in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The companies are expected to focus on persuading the CMA the minority investment by Amazon will not prevent the US company from re-entering the British food delivery market, as well as highlighting the differences in their business models.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Deliveroo said: \u201cDeliveroo has been working closely with the CMA and will continue to do so. We are confident that we will persuade the CMA of the facts that this minority investment will add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers.</p> <p>\u201cDeliveroo is a British company operating right across the country and this investment will be particularly beneficial to the UK economy.\u201d</p> <p>An Amazon spokesperson said: \u201cA homegrown UK business like Deliveroo should have broad access to investors and supporters. Amazon believes that this investment funding will lead to more pro-consumer innovation by helping Deliveroo continue to build its world-class service and remain competitive in the restaurant food delivery space by creating more highly skilled jobs, innovating in the restaurant food delivery sector, and developing new products for customers.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a> or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>.</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Amazon\u2019s UK ambitions have been checked by the competition watchdog after it launched an in-depth investigation into the online retailer\u2019s purchase of a stake in food delivery company Deliveroo. The Competition and Markets Authority announced the probe on Friday after Amazon and Deliveroo declined to offer concessions in response to the CMA\u2019s initial raising of concerns earlier this month. Amazon was the lead investor in a $575m (\u00a3442m) funding round, announced in May, which reportedly gave it a 16% stake in Deliveroo. Deliveroo has been seeking investment to boost its performance against other deep-pocketed rivals such as Uber Eats, owned by the taxi app company Uber, and Just Eat, the FTSE 100 delivery platform that is the subject of a bidding war. However, the CMA\u2019s decision to refer the transaction to a full investigation on Friday will cast doubt on whether the investment can go ahead. The regulator has the power to block the investment completely or demand specific remedies from the companies. The CMA said the deal could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower-quality services. Amazon and Deliveroo had been given five days from 11 December to come up with changes but did not offer alterations to the deal. The CMA says it will conclude its investigation by 11 June 2020. One of the main concerns was the impact on the incipient ultra-fast grocery delivery market. In the UK Deliveroo has been working on grocery deliveries within half an hour with convenience stores such as the Co-op, going up against Amazon\u2019s venture with Morrisons, which is available to some subscribers to its Prime service. While the sector is still relatively small \u2013 other ultra-fast services include Sainsbury\u2019s Chop Chop, Ocado Zoom and Waitrose\u2019s Rapid delivery service \u2013 the CMA was concerned that an effective merger between the two firms could erode competition. Amazon has previously tried to enter the food delivery market. In 2016 it launched Amazon Restaurants, which was initially available to some Londoners as part of its Prime subscription service. However, the operation was closed in December 2018, a testament to the difficult economics of delivering hot food at low cost. Food \u2013 a market worth nearly $1tn a year in the US alone \u2013 remains a key part of Amazon\u2019s plans. In June 2017 Amazon bought the organic food chain Whole Foods, giving it a foothold in bricks-and-mortar retail. The CMA\u2019s investigation represents a rare regulatory rebuke to Amazon. The $926bn company, founded by Jeff Bezos, has built up commanding positions globally in online retail and cloud computing with relatively few regulatory hurdles. However, its size and use of offshore jurisdictions to minimise tax payments have increasingly attracted the attention of politicians across the world. The US Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for Amazon, and other online platforms such as Google and Facebook, to be broken up. In the UK Boris Johnson last month said internet companies needed to make a \u201cfairer contribution\u201d on tax, although trade experts have questioned whether his government will push ahead with a levy that could anger the US ahead of crucial post-Brexit trade talks. The CMA decision will be a blow to the growth plans of Deliveroo. The company, which was founded in London by the former investment banker Will Shu, has raised a total of $1.5bn since 2013 from backers including fund manager Fidelity and California-based tech investor Greenoaks Capital. Much of that investment has been used to fund expansion in new markets as well as development of its online takeaway technology. Revenues of Deliveroo\u2019s parent company, Roofoods, rose by 72% to \u00a3476m in 2018, but the company made a loss of \u00a3232m. It is understood the CMA will publish an issues statement, setting out in detail what it expects to investigate, in the coming weeks. The companies are expected to focus on persuading the CMA the minority investment by Amazon will not prevent the US company from re-entering the British food delivery market, as well as highlighting the differences in their business models. A spokesperson for Deliveroo said: \u201cDeliveroo has been working closely with the CMA and will continue to do so. We are confident that we will persuade the CMA of the facts that this minority investment will add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers. \u201cDeliveroo is a British company operating right across the country and this investment will be particularly beneficial to the UK economy.\u201d An Amazon spokesperson said: \u201cA homegrown UK business like Deliveroo should have broad access to investors and supporters. Amazon believes that this investment funding will lead to more pro-consumer innovation by helping Deliveroo continue to build its world-class service and remain competitive in the restaurant food delivery space by creating more highly skilled jobs, innovating in the restaurant food delivery sector, and developing new products for customers.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

Around the park in summer, cricket matches play out on a brownish field, tennis balls pound back and forth, and the sea breeze carries noise from one of the most enviably placed bowling clubs on the east coast.</p> <p>Olsen is dressed in a black T-shirt and long black pants, which her mum Thomas points out are \u201ccovered in dog hair\u201d. She clips her helmet over her short blonde hair and drops into the bowl. The rolls and scrapes of her wheels grow louder as her riding expands, and when she falls to her knees she slides and gets up.

A boy screeches into the bowl on a flimsy scooter and is howled out of the way.</p> <p>When she performs a handplant, pulling her board and feet above her head, Olsen mirrors a photo of herself doing the same thing on a council recycling bin a few metres away. It is the same skate park where Olsen used to be the only girl.</p> <p>Women\u2019s skating was barely visible a decade ago, and both Olsen and Farrar say they have encountered sexism. Much of it is the sexism of low expectation: assumptions about which tricks they can land, which falls they can endure. But sometimes, says Farrar, it\u2019s hard to tell where sexism ends and the moody dynamics of skating begin.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people who go to the park super early, because they don\u2019t want anyone watching them,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s this thing you see, \u2018skateboarder face\u2019.

He presses forward on the handlebars of his tiny scooter. A chant of \u201cMushroom, Mushroom\u201d begins, and a middle-aged guy \u2013 skateboarder clothes, dark sunglasses \u2013 sits and watches silently.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been talking yourself up Mushroom, gotta do it now,\u201d a boy says.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Olsen says, walking over. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to do it.\u201d</p> <p>She speaks with the boy in private, away from the others. He returns to the shallow end of the bowl and rides around to a cheery \u201csick!\u201d from Farrar.

A fall on a ramp by Asta Zhang Xin left Olsen shaken. \u201cShe was knocked out. You learn to fall the right way, it\u2019s just something that comes with doing it constantly and hurting yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cThese girls come in and don\u2019t know how to fall.\u201d Farrar tries a few tricks , South Newcastle skatepark The importance of falling becomes clear, firstly in the rust of South Newcastle skatepark \u2013 the city\u2019s answer to Venice Beach, where Farrar takes several goes at riding a blistered concrete wall, finishing bloodied and satisfied she didn\u2019t \u201cbitch out\u201d \u2013 and then in the skate park at Bar Beach. The bowl is 25 steps from the sand, flanked by Norfolk Island pines and languid dudes in bucket hats poured out over the steps. Around the park in summer, cricket matches play out on a brownish field, tennis balls pound back and forth, and the sea breeze carries noise from one of the most enviably placed bowling clubs on the east coast. Olsen is dressed in a black T-shirt and long black pants, which her mum Thomas points out are \u201ccovered in dog hair\u201d. She clips her helmet over her short blonde hair and drops into the bowl. The rolls and scrapes of her wheels grow louder as her riding expands, and when she falls to her knees she slides and gets up. A fall causes Olsen to admonish herself slightly, shake her head, while a success brings the ubiquitous \u201csick!\u201d from Farrar, who films everything. She\u2019s got incredible smoothness and speed through the board,\u201d Farrar says. \u201cIt\u2019s that speed and that smoothness, so that one trick flows into the next.\u201d Farrar filming Olsen A small, male crowd has gathered in the smoky air to skate and carp at each other with a fond profanity. Some lookd young enough to be in primary school. A boy screeches into the bowl on a flimsy scooter and is howled out of the way. When she performs a handplant, pulling her board and feet above her head, Olsen mirrors a photo of herself doing the same thing on a council recycling bin a few metres away. It is the same skate park where Olsen used to be the only girl. Women\u2019s skating was barely visible a decade ago, and both Olsen and Farrar say they have encountered sexism. Much of it is the sexism of low expectation: assumptions about which tricks they can land, which falls they can endure. But sometimes, says Farrar, it\u2019s hard to tell where sexism ends and the moody dynamics of skating begin. \u201cThere are people who go to the park super early, because they don\u2019t want anyone watching them,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s this thing you see, \u2018skateboarder face\u2019. But it\u2019s kind of up to you to get through that, to make that pressure a good thing.\u201d At the highest, steepest part of the bowl, a small boy nicknamed \u201cMushroom\u201d is looking over the edge. He presses forward on the handlebars of his tiny scooter. A chant of \u201cMushroom, Mushroom\u201d begins, and a middle-aged guy \u2013 skateboarder clothes, dark sunglasses \u2013 sits and watches silently. \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking yourself up Mushroom, gotta do it now,\u201d a boy says. \u201cNo,\u201d Olsen says, walking over. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to do it.\u201d She speaks with the boy in private, away from the others. He returns to the shallow end of the bowl and rides around to a cheery \u201csick!\u201d from Farrar. And everyone gets back to skating. The girl from Newcastle with her eyes on Tokyo 2020",

Most have made a long-term habit of only making minimum payments each month, which often masks underlying financial troubles.</p> <p>About 60% of the UK\u2019s adult population \u2013 about 30 million people \u2013 have credit cards. The <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps18-04.pdf\">FCA has estimated</a> that about 5.6m credit card accounts may be held by customers who are struggling financially, and that nearly 2 million may fail to raise their payments before the 36-month period is up.</p> <p>It is difficult to predict how many customers may end up having their credit cards suspended as a result, but it is understood that banks are still contacting thousands of customers as the first 36-month period comes to an end. An account suspension could affect a user\u2019s credit scores.</p> <p>Credit card companies have been ordered to send at least three letters to customers, warning them to raise their payments or risk having their credit card suspended. Firms have been offering alternative ways of repaying their debts more quickly, usually over a period of three to four years. That could include transferring a credit card balance to a personal loan with lower interest.</p> <p>The rules are expected to cut into revenues for credit card companies, but the FCA said it will save customers up to \u00a31.3bn per year. \u201cFurthermore, consumer stress and related financial difficulties would be reduced by resolving debt problems sooner. The total cost savings were expected to have reached between \u00a33bn and \u00a313bn by 2030,\u201d the watchdog said in its original policy paper.</p> <p>Barclaycard said it had sent monthly letters since September 2018, offering customers personalised four-year pay-down plans. It said it would reach out to the remaining customers for a final time in February 2020 before taking action later that month.</p> <p>\u201cBarclaycard is a responsible lender, committed to helping customers manage their borrowing effectively,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cAs a result, we have been writing to customers in persistent debt to let them know what actions they need to take to get themselves out of persistent debt over the coming months.\u201d</p> <p>But if customers are unlikely to keep up with payments for those alternative plans, firms will have to show \u201cforbearance,\u201d which could include reducing, waiving or cancelling any interest or charges. \u201cWe would expect firms to suspend the cards of customers that have been shown forbearance, and those who do not respond,\u201d the FCA policy document explained.</p> <p>RBS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/02/credit-card-spending-terms-conditions-rbs-natwest\">sent its first batch of letters</a> to customers in May 2018, but is understood to have started the 18-month clock in September that year. It means Natwest and RBS customers could also have credit cards suspended by February next year.</p> <p>TSB said it could increase customers\u2019 minimum payments if it reasonably believed customers were in a position to keep up with the added costs. However, it still has the power to stop customers from using their cards altogether.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the industry lobby group UK Finance said: \u201cIn some circumstances, where a suitable repayment option is not agreed, and in accordance with the new rules, cards might be suspended, so it is really important that customers do not ignore letters received \u2013 they should read them carefully to understand their options and contact their credit card provider at the earliest opportunity.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of credit card customers are at risk of having their accounts suspended in the new year due to the City regulator\u2019s new affordability rules. Credit card providers \u2013 including UK banks such as Barclays, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 were last year forced to identify customers who had been in persistent debt for at least 18 months, and have had a further 18 months to convince customers to increase their payments. Customers who fail to respond or cannot afford hiked payments risk having their credit cards suspended as early as February 2020 \u2013 as the first 36-month period draws to a close. The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s regulations are targeted at customers in persistent debt for at least 36 months, who end up paying more in interest fees and charges than the original amount they borrowed. Most have made a long-term habit of only making minimum payments each month, which often masks underlying financial troubles. About 60% of the UK\u2019s adult population \u2013 about 30 million people \u2013 have credit cards. The FCA has estimated that about 5.6m credit card accounts may be held by customers who are struggling financially, and that nearly 2 million may fail to raise their payments before the 36-month period is up. It is difficult to predict how many customers may end up having their credit cards suspended as a result, but it is understood that banks are still contacting thousands of customers as the first 36-month period comes to an end. An account suspension could affect a user\u2019s credit scores. Credit card companies have been ordered to send at least three letters to customers, warning them to raise their payments or risk having their credit card suspended. Firms have been offering alternative ways of repaying their debts more quickly, usually over a period of three to four years. That could include transferring a credit card balance to a personal loan with lower interest. The rules are expected to cut into revenues for credit card companies, but the FCA said it will save customers up to \u00a31.3bn per year. \u201cFurthermore, consumer stress and related financial difficulties would be reduced by resolving debt problems sooner. The total cost savings were expected to have reached between \u00a33bn and \u00a313bn by 2030,\u201d the watchdog said in its original policy paper. Barclaycard said it had sent monthly letters since September 2018, offering customers personalised four-year pay-down plans. It said it would reach out to the remaining customers for a final time in February 2020 before taking action later that month. \u201cBarclaycard is a responsible lender, committed to helping customers manage their borrowing effectively,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cAs a result, we have been writing to customers in persistent debt to let them know what actions they need to take to get themselves out of persistent debt over the coming months.\u201d But if customers are unlikely to keep up with payments for those alternative plans, firms will have to show \u201cforbearance,\u201d which could include reducing, waiving or cancelling any interest or charges. \u201cWe would expect firms to suspend the cards of customers that have been shown forbearance, and those who do not respond,\u201d the FCA policy document explained. RBS sent its first batch of letters to customers in May 2018, but is understood to have started the 18-month clock in September that year. It means Natwest and RBS customers could also have credit cards suspended by February next year. TSB said it could increase customers\u2019 minimum payments if it reasonably believed customers were in a position to keep up with the added costs. However, it still has the power to stop customers from using their cards altogether. A spokeswoman for the industry lobby group UK Finance said: \u201cIn some circumstances, where a suitable repayment option is not agreed, and in accordance with the new rules, cards might be suspended, so it is really important that customers do not ignore letters received \u2013 they should read them carefully to understand their options and contact their credit card provider at the earliest opportunity.\u201d",

There is also a cinema, library and panelled grand hallway.\u201d The house does not appear to be advertised for sale on Simon Blyth\u2019s website, nor on property search websites such as Rightmove. As his businesses imploded in the summer, the high court froze Woodhouse\u2019s personal assets as administrators for much of his group attempted to recoup funds owed to creditors. In an update to the freezing order issued in September, the court stated: \u201cUntil further order from the court, [Woodhouse] must not: (1) remove from England and Wales any of his assets which are in England and Wales up to the value of \u00a32,186,963.17; or (2) in any way dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of any of his assets\u201d. The order goes on to say: \u201cThis prohibition includes the following assets in particular ...\u201d and refers to Woodhouse\u2019s \u201cinterest in land and property\u201d at the Halifax house. Offering the property for sale is not a breach of the court order in itself. But it is understood a sale would require a variation in the September order. The proposed sale being marketed by the brochure also refers to an adjoining parcel of meadow land that is owned by a company called Woodhouse Family Ltd. However, the businessman lost control of the land when Woodhouse Family Ltd was placed into administration in August. Duff &amp; Phelps, the insolvency firm that applied for the freezing order on behalf of Woodhouse\u2019s creditors and is the administrator of Woodhouse Family Ltd, said it had been unaware of the moves to advertise the property and the land until it was asked for comment by the Guardian. As administrators, the accounting firm is offering the meadow land plot for sale itself and said it had now contacted Simon Blyth estate agents and Woodhouse\u2019s lawyers, JMW Solicitors, about the marketing. Neither Simon Blyth nor Woodhouse responded to requests for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Police are investigating after a man appeared to use a dead fox to attack a vehicle containing anti-hunting activists. As dozens of hunts took place across the UK on Boxing Day, a man alleged to be a supporter of a hunt in North Yorkshire was filmed hitting the window of a van with the animal\u2019s body. Blood and hair were left smeared across the glass and a group from the Hunt Saboteurs Association (HSA), activists who monitor and disrupt purported illegal hunting, claimed the vehicle was damaged. The apparent attack occurred at midday on Thursday when a group of people approached the activists before a man was seen sprinting towards the van attempting to hide his face and brandishing the dead fox, which he then used as a weapon. Several others who appeared to be his associates also recorded the incident on their mobile phones. It is believed the fox was not killed by hounds. The Sheffield Hunt Saboteurs said on Facebook that hunt supporters \u201cwere clearly unhappy not to see some actual hunting, so decide to be aggressive and block vehicles in and smash our window with a roadkill fox whilst also smashing bits off our vehicle\u201d. Nearby, the Badsworth hunt \u2013 which amalgamated with another group in 2002 but is said to hold its own Boxing Day meet \u2013 continued its activities. Neither the man nor his apparent associates were connected to the hunt, according to the pro-hunting campaign group the Countryside Alliance. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe condemn this utterly despicable behaviour by this group of individuals whom we are told are not connected to the hunt in any way. \u201cWe understand these were local people whose appalling actions have brought hunting into disrepute and we sincerely hope they will be held to account.\u201d A spokesperson for North Yorkshire police said: \u201cPolice are investigating an incident in the Kirk Smeaton area that occurred at about 12pm on 26 December 2019. Inquiries are at an early stage.\u201d Meanwhile, in Chiddingstone, Kent, protesters confronted the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, as he supported a hunt. \u201cAll these packs are trail hunting,\u201d Farage said, referring to the pursuit by hounds of an artificial pre-laid scent, according to the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s a day out with the horses and the dogs.

The explosive testimony was published Friday by the New York Times, which obtained previously unseen video interviews and text messages from several former members of an elite commando unit once led by special operations chief Eddie Gallagher. Gallagher was convicted in July of posing with the dead body of a teenage Islamic State captive he had just killed with a hunting knife. He was granted clemency by the president in November in a decision that angered military chiefs. In the interviews, conducted by navy investigators looking into Gallagher\u2019s conduct during a tour of duty in Iraq in 2017, fellow platoon members told of a ruthless leader who stabbed the captive to death for no reason then forced his troops to pose for a photograph with the corpse. At his court martial, Gallagher was acquitted of murder but demoted in rank for the lesser charge of posing with the body \u2013 a decision Trump reversed. In a lengthy criminal investigation report, the navy detectives laid out other allegations against Gallagher, including shooting a schoolgirl and elderly man from a sniper\u2019s roost. Members of Alpha Platoon\u2019s Seal Team 7 alarmed by their leader\u2019s conduct said they were initially shut down by military chiefs when they first spoke up, and told their own careers would suffer if they continued to talk about it.

      "bodyText": "Russia has deployed its first hypersonic nuclear-capable missiles, with Vladimir Putin boasting that it puts his country in a class of its own. The president described the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, which can fly at 27 times the speed of sound, as a technological breakthrough comparable to the 1957 Soviet launch of the first satellite. Putin has said Russia\u2019s new generation of nuclear weapons can hit almost any point in the world and evade a US-built missile shield, though some western experts have questioned how advanced some of the weapons programmes are. The Avangard is launched on top of an intercontinental ballistic missile, but, unlike a regular missile warhead, which follows a predictable path after separation, it can make sharp manoeuvres en route to its target, making it harder to intercept. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, told Putin the first missile unit equipped with the Avangard had entered combat duty. \u201cI congratulate you on this landmark event for the military and the entire nation,\u201d Shoigu said later during a conference call with top military leaders. The strategic missile forces chief, Gen Sergei Karakaev, said during the call that the Avangard had been put on duty with a unit in the Orenburg region in the southern Ural mountains. Putin unveiled the Avangard and other prospective weapons systems in his state-of-the-nation address in March 2018, saying its ability to make sharp manoeuvres on its way to a target would render missile defense useless. \u201cIt heads to target like a meteorite, like a fireball,\u201d he said at the time. The Russian leader said the Avangard had been designed using new composite materials to withstand temperatures of up to 2,000C (3,632F) which can be reached while travelling at hypersonic speeds. The missile can carry a nuclear weapon of up to 2 megatons. Putin has said Russia had to develop the Avangard and other weapons systems because of US efforts to develop a missile defence system that he claimed could erode Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent. Moscow has scoffed at US claims that its missile shield isn\u2019t intended to counter Russia\u2019s missile arsenals. This week, Putin noted that for the first time Russia was leading the world in developing a new class of weapons, unlike in the past when it was catching up with the US. In December 2018, the Avangard was launched from the Dombarovskiy missile base in the southern Urals and hit a practice target on the Kura shooting range on the Kamchatka peninsula, 3,700 miles (6,000km) away. The defence ministry said last month it had demonstrated the Avangard to a team of US inspectors as part of transparency measures under the New Start nuclear arms treaty between the two countries. China has tested its own hypersonic glide vehicle, believed to be capable of travelling at least five times the speed of sound. It displayed the weapon called Dong Feng 17, or DF-17, at a military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese state.

      "body": "<p>Speaking as someone who writes about television for a living, the 2010s have absolutely broken me. It all used to be so simple. There were five channels, three of them good, and you watched whatever they decided to show you. It didn\u2019t matter if it was rubbish, either. Soap operas. Game shows. So many documentaries about the British Transport Police you\u2019d call me a liar if I tried to list them all. We watched it all, because that\u2019s what was on.</p> <p>In retrospect, it was a golden age. Because now when you sit down to watch television, you basically have to choose between every single thing that has ever been made. The channels are still going, just, but they\u2019re outgunned by streaming platforms with libraries that swell by the day. Netflix throws a new original series out every few days, plus a bank of buzzy imports. NowTV keeps you up to date with all the shows that get recapped by the sites you like. Amazon isn\u2019t easing off either, especially now that competition comes in the form of Apple and Disney and Facebook and Snapchat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd34232599af63d766fd6796a1a442f08dcea486\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd34232599af63d766fd6796a1a442f08dcea486/0_79_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Good Fight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I know it\u2019s amazing because people won\u2019t shut up about it ...

I do. I do it all the time. Not in print, of course, but socially. \u201cIsn\u2019t The Good Fight amazing?\u201d a friend will ask me. What choice do I have? Of course The Good Fight is amazing. I know it\u2019s amazing because people won\u2019t shut up about how amazing it is. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve watched it.

      "bodyText": "Speaking as someone who writes about television for a living, the 2010s have absolutely broken me. It all used to be so simple. There were five channels, three of them good, and you watched whatever they decided to show you. It didn\u2019t matter if it was rubbish, either. Soap operas. Game shows. So many documentaries about the British Transport Police you\u2019d call me a liar if I tried to list them all. We watched it all, because that\u2019s what was on. In retrospect, it was a golden age. Because now when you sit down to watch television, you basically have to choose between every single thing that has ever been made. The channels are still going, just, but they\u2019re outgunned by streaming platforms with libraries that swell by the day. Netflix throws a new original series out every few days, plus a bank of buzzy imports. NowTV keeps you up to date with all the shows that get recapped by the sites you like. Amazon isn\u2019t easing off either, especially now that competition comes in the form of Apple and Disney and Facebook and Snapchat. It\u2019s too much. No wonder people are lying about what they watch. I do. I do it all the time. Not in print, of course, but socially. \u201cIsn\u2019t The Good Fight amazing?\u201d a friend will ask me. What choice do I have? Of course The Good Fight is amazing. I know it\u2019s amazing because people won\u2019t shut up about how amazing it is. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve watched it. I keep promising myself I\u2019ll get around to it, but I know I never will. Whenever an opportunity to watch The Good Fight arises, I\u2019ll immediately find myself wedged in a bottleneck of newer drama. I\u2019ll never watch The Good Wife.

It was a very impressive opening spell from Philander and Rabada, and they challenged us in good areas. There were a couple of very good balls in there. Batting outside of the crease against Philander, trying to take LBW out of the equation, was my plan. If he nips one away and catches my edge, then fair play. </p> <p>\u201cI wanted to be patient. I knew it would be tough and they would make me work really hard for every run. Once that new ball wore off, I managed to find a little bit of fluency. It\u2019s frustrating. I felt pretty comfortable out there with Ben, then I managed to nick one and we lost a few wickets after that. We spoke at tea about trying to bat long, trying to keep them out there as long as we could, but it wasn\u2019t to be in the end. </p> <p>\u201cWe have spoken about trying to get first-innings runs. We need to try to assess the conditions, understand game situations, get through tricky periods and wear the opposition down. I think that as a batsman you need to be clear in your plan. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a great fightback tonight though, and we\u2019re in a stronger position than we were an hour ago. The bounce is a bit variable but I don\u2019t think there are too many demons in the wicket. That new ball is very tricky. If we can get through that in the second innings, there are runs to be had.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-27T15:46:22.524Z\">at 3.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e06248b8f08c39722641163\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-27T15:38:22.245Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Those four late wickets </strong>have given England an outside chance of another famous comeback, but you don\u2019t need to be an automated win predictor to know that South Africa are strong favourites to win the match.

      "bodyText": "Vic Marks\u2019 report has arrived, so it\u2019s time to wrap up today\u2019s blog. Please join John Ashdown for day three of this quickfire Test. Thanks for your company, bye! Here\u2019s Joe Denly \u201cIt was tough out there. It was a very impressive opening spell from Philander and Rabada, and they challenged us in good areas. There were a couple of very good balls in there. Batting outside of the crease against Philander, trying to take LBW out of the equation, was my plan. If he nips one away and catches my edge, then fair play. \u201cI wanted to be patient. I knew it would be tough and they would make me work really hard for every run. Once that new ball wore off, I managed to find a little bit of fluency. It\u2019s frustrating. I felt pretty comfortable out there with Ben, then I managed to nick one and we lost a few wickets after that. We spoke at tea about trying to bat long, trying to keep them out there as long as we could, but it wasn\u2019t to be in the end. \u201cWe have spoken about trying to get first-innings runs. We need to try to assess the conditions, understand game situations, get through tricky periods and wear the opposition down. I think that as a batsman you need to be clear in your plan. \u201cIt was a great fightback tonight though, and we\u2019re in a stronger position than we were an hour ago. The bounce is a bit variable but I don\u2019t think there are too many demons in the wicket. That new ball is very tricky. If we can get through that in the second innings, there are runs to be had.\u201d Those four late wickets have given England an outside chance of another famous comeback, but you don\u2019t need to be an automated win predictor to know that South Africa are strong favourites to win the match. They lead by 175, which might already be enough on this pitch and against these batsmen, and they have six wickets remaining. England did some good things, some bad things and some really really really really really bad things. They collapsed from 142 for three to 181 all out, and there\u2019s nothing much we can do except take the positives. 20th over: South Africa 72-4 (van der Dussen 17, Nortje 4) That second Archer beamer was originally given as a no-ball by the square-leg umpire Paul Reiffel, who then changed his mind. In fairness to Archer, the second one was just a low full-toss; it looked more dramatic because Noftje dived for cover. Anyway, Ben Stokes comes on to bowl the last over of the day, a maiden to van der Dussen. It has been South Africa\u2019s day, and then some. 19th over: South Africa 72-4 (van der Dussen 17, Nortje 4) Archer bowls consecutive beamers to the nightwatchman Nortje. They were both attempted knuckle balls gone wrong, but even so that doesn\u2019t look great. The first was given as a no-ball, the second wasn\u2019t. 18th over: South Africa 66-4 (van der Dussen 12, Nortje 4) Nortje isn\u2019t a complete rabbit - he has four first-class fifties - and he gets off the mark by squirting Curran behind square for four. South Africa lead by 169. 17th over: South Africa 62-4 (van der Dussen 12, Nortje 0) van der Dussen is almost hit by a diabolical bouncer from Archer, who is bowling ferociously. In fact van der Dussen did really well to snap his head out of the way, Robin Smith-style. A malevolent over from Archer finishes with van der Dussen playing and missing outside off. 16th over: South Africa 62-4 (van der Dussen 12, Nortje 0) Replays show there was nothing on UltraEdge for that van der Dussen appeal, so England were right not to review. Curran, meanwhile, bowls a relatively harmless over that is survived by the nightwatchman Nortje. Fifteen minutes remaining. 15th over: South Africa 62-4 (van der Dussen 12, Nortje 0) Anrich Nortje comes in as nightwatchman. Archer looks fired up all of a sudden, and has a few words with van der Dussen after ripping a bouncer past his noggin. The next ball snaps past the outside edge - or did it shave it? Some of the England fielders were convinced there was an edge, though Archer didn\u2019t appeal. After canvassing opinion, Root decides not to review. Faf du Plessis dies by the sword. He took Archer on effectively for a while but tried one shot too many. It was a very unusual stroke, a top-edged hook played on one knee, and Curran ran round the square leg boundary to take a good catch. 14th over: South Africa 55-3 (du Plessis 20, van der Dussen 5) A quiet over from Sam Curran to du Plessis, a maiden in fact. 13th over: South Africa 55-3 (du Plessis 20, van der Dussen 5) du Plessis continues his calculated assault on Jofra Archer, hooking him sweetly for six. That was a brilliant stroke, and he has raced to 20 from 21 balls. He is doing precisely what England don\u2019t want. \u201cStokes has a huge role to play when this early push for wickets flattens out,\u201d says Richard Holmes. \u201cCometh the hour, cometh the Stokes to keep England in the Test.\u201d I suspect this situation is beyond even SuperBen. 12th over: South Africa 48-3 (du Plessis 13, van der Dussen 5) van der Dussen edges the new bowler Sam Curran low to second slip, where Stokes seems to take an outstanding catch to his left. The umpires go upstairs, with a soft signal of out, but there is enough doubt for Kumar Dharmasena to give it not out. That\u2019s the right decision I think. 11th over: South Africa 44-3 (du Plessis 12, van der Dussen 2) du Plessis gets off the mark with a nice stroke, opening the face to drive a straight ball from Archer to the extra-cover boundary. He repeats the stroke later in the over, this time off the back foot. Every little helps, especially on a pitch like this, and du Plessis has clearly decided to go on the attack. He makes room to cut the last ball of the over for another boundary. South Africa lead by 147. 10th over: South Africa 31-3 (du Plessis 0, van der Dussen 1) A bit too wide from Broad, allowing du Plessis to leave a few deliveries outside off stump. 9th over: South Africa 30-3 (du Plessis 0, van der Dussen 0) I wouldn\u2019t say England are back in the game just yet, but they have given themselves an outside chance with this new-ball burst. South Africa lead by 133. Jofra Archer replaces his initialsake James Anderson - and he strikes second ball! Elgar inside-edges a big nipbacker down the leg side, where Buttler flies to his right to take another fine two-handed catch. 8th over: South Africa 25-2 (Elgar 18, du Plessis 0) The new batsman, Faf du Plessis, is beaten by a jaffa from Broad. There\u2019s an hour\u2019s play remaining; realistically, England need another three or four wickets in that time. Hamza is caught down the leg side. He tried to roll the wrists on a nothing delivery from Broad but got it too fine and Buttler took a good catch diving to his left. South Africa lead by 128. 7th over: South Africa 25-1 (Elgar 18, Hamza 4) Elgar hits Anderson for consecutive boundaries, a slightly loose steer over backward point followed by a crisp drive through mid-off. He makes it three in four balls with a flick off the pads. Nice one. 6th over: South Africa 13-1 (Elgar 6, Hamza 4) Broad has an absurd enquiry for LBW against Elgar turned down. It was missing leg stump by a long way. England are bowling pretty well, though they have not managed to repeat Philander and Rabada\u2019s forensic near-ball examination. 5th over: South Africa 11-1 (Elgar 6, Hamza 3) I bet James Anderson\u2019s internal monologue is a thing of comic beauty right now. He has an enquiry for LBW against Elgar turned down by Chris Gaffaney. It was a good delivery but it didn\u2019t straighten enough. Root looks vaguely interested in a review but can\u2019t persuade anyone else that he should go upstairs. 4th over: South Africa 10-1 (Elgar 6, Hamza 2) Broad beats Elgar again with a gorgeous delivery that straightens from around the wicket. He\u2019s bowled extremely well in this game, albeit in helpful conditions, and should help himself to a few more wickets in the second innings. \u201cThe thing about Lampard-Gerrard of course is that between underwhelming outings for England they went back and performed brilliantly at club level,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cNot so Bairstow and Buttler.\u201d White-ball form is the new club level. 3rd over: South Africa 10-1 (Elgar 6, Hamza 2) Games like this can be won - get your precedents here - but realistically England will struggle to chase anything over 150 batting last. That gives them another 36 runs to play with. If it wasn\u2019t so funny, it would be mildly dispiriting. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Nick Parish. \u201cI\u2019ve just woken up. Well, it is Christmas. A Tory government with a huge majority, Liverpool top of the league, and an England batting collapse. It\u2019s like the 1980s all over again.\u201d Yes, but at least Donald Trump isn\u2019t oh I can\u2019t be bothered. 2nd over: South Africa 6-1 (Elgar 4, Hamza 0) Dean Elgar avoids a king pair by ignoring his first delivery from Stuart Broad. He is beaten by the second, a Warner special, and then edges between second slip and gully for four. It wasn\u2019t at catchable height but it do go into a gap. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond understanding,\u201d says Nasser Hussain of England\u2019s decision to have only two slips. \u201cIt really is.\u201d 1st over: South Africa 2-1 (Elgar 0, Hamza 0) Anderson celebrated that wicket with a scowl, one which said: I\u2019m 37 years old, coming back from a long-term injury, and you foppwits have asked me to bowl again after only 53.2 overs\u2019 rest, so take your jaunty high fives and stick \u2018em in your redacted. Jimmy Anderson strikes with his fourth ball. Markram whips around his pad and is given out LBW. He takes a review with him, having used one up in the hope the ball was missing leg stump. It wasn\u2019t. That was a desperate review. What does he know? \u201cNow now, I think there is some doom and gloom here,\u201d says Tone White. \u201cThere is not that much difference between the teams, only one big score. If de Kock had gone for 35, say, England would be easily within striking distance of the SA total. Following the OBO yesterday, I had the impression the English bowlers were better than ok.\u201d Never trust that rag. I do agree about de Kock \u2013 he was very lucky at the start of his innings \u2013 but you could say the same about England\u2019s top scorer, Denly, who was dropped on 0. Ultimately England are being outplayed, again. They just aren\u2019t very good. In fact, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re that good. Credit where it\u2019s due. While England didn\u2019t exactly bat with life-affirming excellence, South Africa bowled quite brilliantly. Not just the big two, either. Dwaine Pretorius and especially Anrich Nortje sparked a dramatic collapse - the last seven wickets fell for 39 - with a blistering spell of old-ball bowling. That might just be out. Philander pegs back Archer\u2019s off stump with a gorgeous legcutter to finish with pornographic figures of 14.2-8-16-4. South Africa lead by 103 and will win this game at a canter. 53rd over: England 181-9 (Archer 3, Anderson 0) \u201cRe: the 50th over,\u201d begins Adam Pervoe. \u201cEngland anticipated a tie?\u201d That or a seven-wicket win. It all depends on whether you speak scorecard. Meh. Broad fences a short one from Rabada straight to gully. 52nd over: England 178-8 (Archer 0, Broad 2) \u201cHi Ron,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed a couple of Lampard-Gerrard years comparisons you\u2019ve made in recent months. As all football followers outside England and quite a few within it always knew, those should have been the Scholes years had he not been shunted onto the left wing because neither of the other two had his versatility. (If you doubt my word, ask Xavi.) Who, if anyone, do you reckon would be his current cricketing equivalent?\u201d The obvious answer is Ben Foakes. But I think he\u2019s more like Michael Carrick or Owen Hargreaves, understated and underappreciated. I suppose the closest comparison is Moeen, in that he has often been played out of position to accommodate more ostentatious talents. And now he has semi-retired. And another one goes by. Buttler edges a beautiful seaming lifter from Philander towards first slip, where de Kock dives in front of van der Dussen to take a spectacular catch. That\u2019s his sixth catch of the innings, equalling the South African record. 51st over: England 176-7 (Buttler 12, Archer 0) Archer\u2019s batting for England has been a letdown so far, in all forms. He is beaten by a cracking lifter from Rabada but then does extremely well to get on top of a venomous throat ball. 50th over: England 176-7 (Buttler 12, Archer 0) Buttler is beaten twice by Philander. The first kept low; the second lifted and seamed away. These are not easy batting conditions. \u201cEasy to say from here, but bearing in mind the fragile form of the batting unit as well as the disruption to the training camp due to illness, I am surprised by the decision to bowl first/bat last,\u201d says Patrick Treacy. \u201cWere the conditions really that compelling to make it worth the risk? Background circumstances seemed to favour using the bowling attack on a fourth innings wicket while giving batting partnerships more chance to bed in before fielding in blazing heat all day.\u201d I\u2019d say it was emphatically the wrong decision \u2013 as most people observed at the time - but not a complete stinker. I suspect England misread the conditions and envisaged a 250/370/220/100-3 type of game. 49th over: England 176-7 (Buttler 12, Archer 0) \u201cIt all feels so predictable, Rob,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cAnd not just Bairstow\u2019s middle stump, but I agree he really did need the winter off. He still looks pretty blinkered, and there\u2019s a risk he\u2019ll really get into a big rut here. Pope will have a say in this series but we can\u2019t expect a (hugely talented) young batsman to get us out of trouble. It starts, as they say, at the top. Once again, we let a side off the hook, something that\u2019s even more common than our collapses. We aren\u2019t a poor side, but we\u2019re a potentially decent one making continually poor decisions. Something has to change, surely.\u201d I\u2019m not sure I agree with all of that. It\u2019s this assumption of potential, based on increasingly thin evidence, that has created a lot of the problems England have had in the last 2-3 years. The culture of picking on status and potential rather than performance is pretty miserable. Sam Curran\u2019s counter-attack is ended by a fine reaction catch. He turned a shortish ball from Rabada off the face of the bat towards short leg, where Zubayr Hamza reached down by his left ankle to take it superbly. 48th over: England 173-6 (Buttler 12, Curran 16) \u201cI like the idea of a Gerrard-Lampardification of the team but at least you knew they were the best midfielders in the country and that they were likely in decent form for their clubs,\u201d says David Horn. \u201cWith Bairstow, I believe he was asked to get some red ball cricket under his belt - which he hasn\u2019t done - and come back as a specialist batsman. Now, someone who got their runs in red ball cricket and plugged away in county cricket has been dropped after one Test to make way for someone who still can\u2019t work out if he should be backwards or forwards and whether or not he should hit a straight one. It\u2019s approaching 90s levels of selection comedy.\u201d Crawley isn\u2019t a middle-order batsman so I can understand the selection in that respect. But they should have had somebody other than Bairstow as the back-up middle-order batsman. England are still selecting him because of his form in 2016. And as we all know, the world was a very different place back then. 47th over: England 171-6 (Buttler 12, Curran 15) A double bowling change, with Rabada coming on as well. He beats Buttler with a nasty seaming grubber. England are paying, in truth, for an indifferent (and occasionally unfortunate) bowling performance yesterday. This pair are probably their last realistic hope, and both are playing with the requisite counter-attacking intent. Buttler gets his second boundary by thumping Rabada through the covers. 46th over: England 165-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 15) Vernon Philander returns after tea. His bowling figures (10-7-5-2) are already pretty erotic. In an hour\u2019s time we could be looking at pure scorecard porn. Not if Curran has anything to do with it, mind you: he hits Philander for consecutive boundaries with a fine square drive and a thick edge along the ground. \u201cI gather from the good folk on Guerrilla Cricket that Ed Smith is on the record as saying Foakes needs to win a Big Bash contract before he can be considered again for the Test team,\u201d says Reverend Jim. \u201cIs this the most disgraceful cricket-related utterance in history or only in the last fifty years?\u201d No, but it might be the most satirical. Teatime reading, from an old friend 45th over: England 157-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 7) Curran is beaten for pace as he attempts to hook Nortje. Playing for tea, 2019-style. The next ball is a snorter: full, seaming away and keeping a bit low as it zips past the edge. That was unplayable. England haven\u2019t a prayer in the fourth innings on this pitch. A superb over from Nortje continues with a short ball that Curran fences short of the slips and through for four. It\u2019s been a sizzling spell of bowling from Nortje, and it has put South Africa in complete control of the match. See you in 20 minutes for more Test-match batting, England-style. 44th over: England 152-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 2) Buttler ignores a series of tempters outside off stump from Pretorius. England are playing for tea, which is five minutes away. I\u2019d expect a ferocious counter-attack from Buttler and Curran after that, as it\u2019s the only way England can get a first-innings lead. And by flip they need one. 43rd over: England 151-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 1) Curran works Nortje off the hip to get off the mark. I think a few teams fancy that Curran can be bounced out, and South Africa are among them. 42nd over: England 150-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 0) \u201cI know there are illnesses etc but what is Bairstow doing within ten miles of the Test team?\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cIt\u2019s amusing how every attack in the world only needs to target Bairstow\u2019s stumps for between 5 and 10 balls and he\u2019ll get out. Do you think he\u2019s in the team as he threw a tantrum to Root?!\u201d Ha, no, I think he\u2019s there on perceived potential. I would have given him the winter off, at the very least, as two Tests isn\u2019t nearly enough time to reset. It\u2019s hard to justify - never mind warm to - the Gerrard/Lampardification of the England Test team in recent years. 41st over: England 150-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 0) Nortje produces another Flintoff-to-Gilchrist beauty to beat the new batsman Sam Curran. South Africa have always produced raw, exciting, occasionally shambolic fast bowlers \u2013 Nantie Hayward, Andre Nel, the rest - and Nortje looks a worthy addition to the list. That\u2019s his second consecutive wicket maiden. Spoiler alert: England have lost this game. Anrich Nortje has taken the big wicket! Ben Stokes chases a wide delivery from around the wicket that straightens to take the edge, and de Kock pouches a simple catch. It was a fine delivery but a fairly poor stroke from Stokes, who until then had played immaculately. 40th over: England 150-5 (Stokes 35, Buttler 6) Buttler gets off the mark second ball with a delicious boundary, driven between short extra cover and mid-off when Pretorius overpitches. He almost falls later in the over, checking a stroke that lands just short of the bowler. 39th over: England 143-5 (Stokes 34, Buttler 0) That dismissal takes Bairstow\u2019s average this year to 19. England are in big trouble now. Bairstow drags a couple of thick inside-edges into the leg side off Nortje. He is, unsurprisingly, are bowling very straight in an attempt to consolidate Bairstow\u2019s famous bowled/LBW statistics. And he\u2019s done it! Bairstow is cleaned up by a ball that keeps a fraction low and thuds into the off stump. He was back when he should have been forward, and was probably beaten for pace as well. His comeback lasted just six deliveries. 38th over: England 143-4 (Stokes 34, Bairstow 1) That fifty was Denly\u2019s fifth in the last nine innings, and was the usual mixture of pluck, luck, intelligence and elegance. Those runs have come against some serious pace attacks. All hail the Pretty Boy Who Went To War. The new batsman is Jonny Bairstow, who has a point to prove, in his head at least. Joe Denly falls three deliveries after reaching his fifty. He got the thinnest inside-edge on a nipbacker from the new bowler Dwaine Pretorious and was caught behind by Quinton de Kock. It was given not out on the field but South Africa reviewed straight away, and there was a small spike on Ultra-Edge. Pretorius gets his first Test wicket with a fine delivery. 36th over: England 138-3 (Denly 45, Stokes 34) A beautiful shot from Stokes, who times Nortje through mid-on for four. Two balls later he bends his back to uppercut a short ball over the slips for a one-bounce four. That\u2019s another majestic stroke from Stokes, who is now averaging over 50 in Tests this year. No other England player has an average in the forties, never mind the fifties. Right here, right now, he is unquestionably England\u2019s best Test batsman. 35th over: England 128-3 (Denly 45, Stokes 25) A quiet over from Maharaj this time, with Stokes resisting the urge to go over midwicket a third time. 34th over: England 126-3 (Denly 44, Stokes 24) An abysmal short ball from Nortje boings down the leg side for four wides. Despite their promising recovery, England have a lot of work to do. They will need plenty of fourth-innings insurance, ideally a lead of at least 100. Thanks Tanya, hello everyone. South African conditions are often conducive to compelling, lowish-scoring Tests, and we have another on our hands here. England have recovered well from a torrid start to the innings, with Joe Denly again justifying comparisons with David Steele and Ben Stokes launching a calculated assault on Keshav Maharaj. As the players take a slurp and Stokes and Denly admire their fifty partnership after that tactical savaging of Maharaj, I\u2019ll hand over to Rob Smyth who\u2019ll be your guide for the rest of the day. Thanks for all your emails! 33rd over: England 120-3 (Denly 43, Stokes 24) Stokes eyes up Maharaj for three balls, then kneels down and sweeps him twice in succession for six into the remnants of the barmy army. And that\u2019s drinks! 32nd over: England 108-3 (Denly 43, Stokes 12) Well played England! du Plessis decides Philander has done enough in this humidity. He scrambles for Nortje, who would fit twice over into Philander\u2019s shirt. He fires a couple in, one leaps off a length, screaming past the top of de Kock\u2019s desperate leap to stop it. Four byes. 31st over: England 102-3 ( Denly 42, Stokes 11) Rabada goes too full, and Stokes twists the bat and drives him through mid-on for four. Rabada\u2019s post-lunch spell hasn\u2019t had the threat of his morning session, too many blobs not on a length. Kim Thonger has a suggestion for Buttler: 30th over: England 97-3 ( Denly 41, Stokes 7) Cricket is a cruel game. Sibley sits alone with his thoughts, just along from Buttler who is still reading that frustratingly-just-out-of-reach novel. Denly nudges just a single from the over Ah! Martin Wright has identified the book. It\u2019s not a novel. Thanks Martin. I reckon Jos Buttler\u2019s reading material is probably \u201cStillness Is The Key\u201d, which apparently \u201cdraws on timeless Stoic and Buddhist philosophy to show why slowing down is the secret weapon for those charging ahead.\u201d A fount of good advice for any batsman inclined to lose his head while coming down the wicket. 29th over: England 96-3 ( Denly 40, Stokes 7) The main men have swapped ends, Rabada now rocking in from the Pavilion End. A better over, until the fifth ball, too short, which Stokes pulls, with gumption stuffing and sauce, to the midwicket boundary. Tromso hey? You lucky thing. Is this Northern Lights season? 29th over: England 90-3 ( Denly 40, Stokes 1) A-ha! England aren\u2019t out of the woods yet. Philander has replaced Rabada at the other end. Stokes gets off the mark to his 13th ball (Denly\u2019s progress will show him this is nothing to worry about), and Denly clips Philander off his heels for a couple. What is this plenty? In the shade Jos Buttler is reading a novel, with a title something like Stillness is the net - but NOT that as google can\u2019t find it. 28th over: England 87-3 ( Denly 38, Stokes 0) Maharaj replaces Philander, Denly employs watchful waiting for the first couple of balls before dancing forward to miscue-drive him to mid-on. Unperturbed, he twinkles and drives him beautifully for four to the long-off boundary. 27th over: England 83-3 ( Denly 34, Stokes 0) Denly dabs at Rabada and, to the brass trumpets of the Centurion band, the ball rushes down between gully and point. Rabada won\u2019t be too disheartened, it wasn\u2019t done with any great conviction. 26th over: England 78-3 ( Denly 29, Stokes 0) Philander on the charge, the slight hint of Christmas day visible in his torso. Stokes plays out a maiden, driving slightly awkwardly at the sixth. Abhijato Sensarma writes in high praise. Philander is the antithesis to the incumbent English opening bowling pair. He pitches it up all the time with the new ball. He might go for the occasional boundary, but his control of length and mastery over the seam is so proficient that it\u2019s second nature for him to claim top order batsmen in his opening spells. A role model for all aspiring bowlers. Oh I don\u2019t know. 8-7-1-2 not that much to shout about... 25th over: England 78-3 ( Denly 29, Stokes 0) Joe Denly has one over Rabada right now, a midwicket shovel is followed by a swivel over mid-on, both for four. Rabada\u2019s compass has gone somewhat haywire since lunch. Those grassy banks look lovely for cricket watching. 24th over: England 70-3 ( Denly 21, Stokes 0) The hypnotic powers of Philander. Root knew what he had to do, knew what he mustn\u2019t do, but he did it anyway. Stokes watches and sees out five dot balls. A furious Root flings his arms in disgust after a feeble nibble at Philander trying to nudge behind square. 23rd over: England 70-2 ( Denly 21, Root 29) Root goes up on his toes and square cuts Rabada with his back foot off the ground to the boundary. And that\u2019s the fifty partnership from 104 balls. A quick single, with an element of risk, is safely negociated. And that, my friends, is a cover drive to lie back and drink cocktails to. Denly leans into the stroke and it whizzes to the rope. 22nd over: England 61-2 ( Denly 17, Root 24) Philander takes the ball. He nips a couple away and Root watches, then nibbles. At last he gets bat to ball behind square and the first run off Philander comes off his 34th ball. Right, here we go - a huge session this. Will Philander go for a run? Will Root and Denly survive Rabada and Philander mark two? Was it a good idea to give my 13 year old a boxing ball for Christmas? ( I know the answer to that one). England trail by 224 - but can just start to breathe a little. The ever-present danger from Rabada and Philander was completely absorbing, pace and skill, but Root and Denly somehow survived and their replacements Nortje and Pretorius didn\u2019t have quite the threat. How they survive Rabada and Philander after their rub-down is the next test. Time for a coffee, see you shortly. 21st over: England 60-2 ( Denly 17, Root 23) Nortje fires in a bouncer, Denly ducks. A couple of easy singles, and that\u2019s lunch. An unbroken partnership of 45 between Root and Denly, who was, remember, dropped on 0. Phil Sawyer has news for the schedulers , \u201cMorning, Tanya. Hope you got all the Double Deckers your heart desired for Christmas. Having just spent Christmas back home in glorious Lancashire, could I suggest Blackpool\u2019s delightful Stanley Park cricket ground for the Boxing Day test? A brisk walk down the prom before play, fish and chips for lunch and a quick pedalo around the lake for those wanting to work off those Christmas excesses (or for ex-England all-rounders wanting to recreate old times). And definitely untroubled by anything approaching warm temperatures. You know it makes sense.\u201d I love it. 20th over: England 57-2 ( Denly 16, Root 21) Smith turns to the long-fingers of Maharaj, one of very few to have pulled on both the cap of the red rose and the white rose. He must, at the very least, be the only South African to have played both sides of the Pennines. A maiden. One over before lunch. 19th over: England 57-2 ( Denly 16, Root 21) Nortje\u2019s not given up hopes of a wicket before lunch. He fires in a couple of fiery bouncers over Root\u2019s head. Lots of interesting talk around this (see below) - Graeme Smith persuading Dwaine Pretorius away from a Kolpak deal with Notts. A good point made by Nasser Hussain on Sky - what happens if he decides to stick with South Africa, has a couple of bad matches and is dropped? He\u2019d be heartily cheesed off. 18th over: England 59-2 ( Denly 16, Root 19) A Denly clip through mid-wicket off Pretorius makes that three boundaries in two overs. And suddenly it is all looking a bit easier. Avitaj Mitra has been mulling over Sibley\u2019s go-don\u2019t go moment: In defence of Sibley\u2019s decision (or indecision).. considering that the umpires barely call out no balls these days, I\u2019d think it was worth it to hang around just to check if you\u2019d get a reprieve due to the bowler overstepping the line. 17th over: England 51-2 ( Denly 12, Root 19) And suddenly, just as nut follows after eight, the runs start to flow. Denly knocks Nortje through square leg and then through long-on for two charming boundaries. 16th over: England 42-2 ( Denly 3, Root 19) England would take Pretorius over Philander any day of the week. He\u2019s accurate but without quite the threat. Root shoots him through third man for a boundary. \u201cPoor crowd for second day of test,\u201d sniffs David Malcolm. \u201cLots of empty seats yesterday .Reflects the lack of interest in test cricket in South Africa. I imagine there will be more England fans watching this series than locals. The only cricket now viewed in any numbers outside England and Australia is rubbish twenty/20.\u201d There are reams of blue bucket seats on show, but it was much fuller yesterday. South African cricket has been a bit of a shower recently, maybe this new regime can turn it around. 15th over: England 38-2 ( Denly 3, Root 15) Nortje bounds in, a big guy, almost as horizontal as he is vertical. Root steals a four through the slips, Denly is hit on the pads, but the shout is optimistic. 14th over: England 33-2 ( Denly 3, Root 10) Five dots relieved only by a couple squeezed from the Denly bat. If he and Root can survive until lunch, they\u2019ll deserve every strip of biltong coming their way. Kim Thonger drops us a line. Tanya, In the present dire circumstances might we consider giving Jolyon Maugham a run in the England top order? He\u2019s clearly a man who knows how to get more than an outside edge on the object he\u2019s trying to hit. Ahem. 13th over: England 27-2 ( Denly 1, Root 10) A double-change, as Anrich Nortje is thrown the ball and Rabada retreats for a rest. Nortje has a look of a young Hansie Cronje, just less swarthy. It turns out he\u2019s not in the habit of handing out freebies either, and the speedometer is up there at Rabada pace. Root squeezes a four off his final ball, but not with a great deal of confidence. 12th over: England 27-2 ( Denly 1, Root 6) England\u2019s agony is briefly lifted as Pretorius replaces Philander. But Denly\u2019s luck stretches on after he pushes forward at Pretorius and the ball narrowly misses popping back onto the stumps. 11th over: England 25-2 ( Denly 1, Root 6) Oooh, Denly survives as an outside edge is dropped by van der Dussen at first slip. He\u2019s standing well back and the ball somehow popped out of his hands, low to the ground. Rabada puts his head in his hands. And three balls later, with an awkward prod, Denly is off the mark at last, after 28 balls. 10th over: England 25-2 ( Denly 0, Root 6) I\u2019m quite impressed by Denly\u2019s sang froid. He\u2019s now gone 22 balls without scoring, without looking either too jumpy or too desperate . Here he manages a calm(ish) leg-bye, and potters up to the other end. And that\u2019s Philander\u2019s fifth maiden. Good morning Tanya, writes Simon McMahon. I hope you are well, and had a merry Christmas. Thanks to you and all the OBO team for your sterling work in bringing us cricket from around the world. \u2018If the Boxing Day Tests are to be put on hold while we work out how to save the planet, maybe Scotland could host one, at the end of January? A day / nighter perhaps, with whisky for drinks? Balaclavas on top of helmets. And an extra jumper of course. All traditions have to start somewhere...\u201d In all seriousness, I think high up in the northern hemisphere is the place to be. And cricket in the highlands in winter would mean, of course, no midges as well as the bonus whisky chaser. (is that a thing?) 9th over: England 25-2 ( Denly 0, Root 6) Root survives the final two balls of the over. An email pings in from Tom Dunn. Good morning Tanya. Good morning Tom! England\u2019s trepidation-inspiring top order might be getting a painful working over but there\u2019s no need to take it out on Burglar Bill: While he may have stolen Burglar Betty\u2019s baby (in the big brown box with little holes in it), it was Betty who subsequently broke into Bill\u2019s house. I think an apology might be in order. Oh dear. Sorry Tom, sorry Bill, sorry Betty. 8.4 overs: England 25-2 ( Denly 0, Root 6) A sigh of relief, as Root kisses a four through the covers, but respite is brief. He\u2019s then has to perform some kind of pike leap, cut in half by a bouncer that rises off the pitch. Ye gods, then Rabada sends one short, and Root heads the ball off the top of his helmet to the boundary for four. And as Root is checked for concussion, they take DRINKS. 8th over: England 17-2 ( Denly 0, Root 2) Denly, 16 balls without scoring, is batting well out of his crease to Philander. Philander dangles the ball at various lengths, but Denly holds his nerve. Four overs, four maidens for Philander. 7th over: England 17-2 ( Denly 0, Root 2) Root runs through his multiple batting skills, ducking, diving, prodding, surviving. More Rabada magic. 6th over: England 15-2 ( Denly 0, Root 0) Denly somehow survives a Philander special, just escaping an lbw squeeze, then just nibbling, but not enough, at one on a perfect line. Philander and Rabada are quite the bowling double-act - one blows you away, the other dissects the remains. 5th over: England 15-2 ( Denly 0, Root 0) Rabada gave Sibley a thorough working over there, probing outside his off stump, though he did stray briefly onto his pads where Sibley nudged him through the onside for four. Then bang. A suggestion for OBO over readers who like wallowing in England discord. Oh dear. Sibley gets a sniff at a rocket slightly wide of the stump and pushes slightly desperately at it. He\u2019s given not out but South Africa review straight away. Sibley then starts walking, but Denly calls him back, but Reiffel tells him to keep walking. Confusion a-go-go. Anyway, he\u2019s out. 4th over: England 11-1 ( Denly 0, Sibley 0) Replays show the ball nicked Burns\u2019s thumb as it went past. Such a peach from Philander, whose skills with the ball are pseudo-magical, especially against left-handers. Denly successfully plays out the rest of the over. Burns falls to his very first ball from Philander, a beauty, that rockets up from nowhere and Burns dutifully nibbles away. 3rd over: England 11-0 ( Burns 9, Sibley 0) Rabada is going for it here. Burns somehow, with a kind of twisted bat, directs a 90mph ball through gully for four. He looks awkward, but was ever thus, and how he\u2019s compiled those runs. 2nd over: England 6-0 ( Burns 4, Sibley 0) Jelly babies and ginger nuts , Sibley plods forward heavily and gets within a lego brick of an edge to Philander. And so it continues. 1st over: England 6-0 ( Burns 4, Sibley 0) And just as it was in the South African innings, so it nearly was in the England innings. Rabada sent down a very full ball, that shaped in and Burns looked as if he\u2019d got a tickle, he turned immediately to see the ball fall into de Koch\u2019s gloves. He was given out on the field but, hesitatingly reviews, and it seems the noise was a foot or a glove. Not out. His working over continues for the rest of the over as Rabada sends down two no balls at top speed and hits him on the hip as he awkwardly twists. Advantage Rabada. Four wickets each for Broad and Sam Curran. Let\u2019s see what Philander and Rabada have up their sleeve. Rob Key has just suggested that Philander is similar to Darren Stevens... Just a sniff short of the 300 they were hoping for, we are about to see how good a score this is. Sibley, Denly, Burns - a top three to inspire what? Confidence? Trepidation? Lying down in a dark room? Another mince pie? Philander reviews the most obvious caught behind since Burglar Bill broke into Burglar Betty\u2019s house, for reasons currently inexplicable. And that\u2019s that. 84th over: South Africa 278-9 (Philander 29, Nortje 0) Sam Curran is on the prowl for his fifth wicket, it would be his first Test five-fer. Nortje, not completely convincingly, survives the last four balls of the over. 83rd over: South Africa 277-9 (Philander 28, Nortje 0) Broad, long limbed, slightly rounded back, reels in and finishes off yesterday evening\u2019s over. Morning Tanya, writes Guy Hornsby, another great day of cricket in store. But with more players going down with this gastro bug it\u2019ll be a miracle that it won\u2019t affect the result, but it\u2019s Friday so I\u2019m being optimistic and saying we\u2019ll have them out quickly and runs from Burns and Root today. The problem is that we said this in NZ and we folded, so we\u2019re fragile. So it\u2019s as likely 175 all out as 290-5, I\u2019m afraid. The players are out, Stuart Broad has the ball... Did you know? writes Finbar Anslow, \u201cthat until yesterday three of the top ten run scorers in Australian test cricket played for Somerset?\u201d Ah, no. But I do now. Time for an emergency piece of toast and marmite. Hope that dog is behaving Graeme - you\u2019ve got six minutes. .. Graeme Smith, South African\u2019s new interim director of cricket, is chatting to Ian \u2018n\u2019 Mike. His shoulders could have their own chat show. \u201cI was looking forward to being in the comm box, but South African cricket has got into a lot of challenges into the last while and I wanted to get in and see if I could make a difference and help. The biggest challenges? I\u2019m still working to try and add a bit more intensity, a bit more experience, a bit more leadership. [re Kolpaks] I think it is always difficult to stop guys going to earn a good living that comes their way - in many ways its a good thing for them but for us it is a big challenge. We\u2019ve got to be able to give our guys a good living, the strength of our cricket willthen improve, and then work out transformation, how we brings really talented black Africans through.\u201d Graeme Arthur drops a note. When does play begin? Have I got time to take the dog out? And, out of interest, what would have happened if England had failed to field 11 fit players from their squad? Or, indeed, should a number of the current team have to leave the field? Is there a point beyond which play is abandoned / suspended? You\u2019ve got time for a quick stroll round the block - play starts at 8am GMT. As for the illness question, I think they could keep calling people up ad infinitum. Back in 1986, you could whistle for an old pro in a suit pressing the flesh in a hospitality box... We\u2019re on, Rob Key has ironed his shirt and is calling it \u201ca crucial day.\u201d Ebony Rainford-Brent praises Sam Curran. Nasser Hussain and Ian Ward are out on the pitch in matching white shirts, no ties. The clouds are out, it is humid. Nasser says day 2 is the best day for batting. Shaun says said the pitch is as good as he\u2019s seen it for a few years . The cracks in the pitch are not yet in play - too far outside off stump. It is especially poignant to read the report on the future of the Melbourne Test while England play in South Africa. It was only a couple of years ago that all grade cricket had to be cancelled in the Cape Town area because of drought, and the touring Indians were donating money to water charities. Drilling deep into the report, particularly prescient in Australia right now, with burning bush fires and controversy over the future of coal, it suggests that the Boxing Day Test will soon no longer be able to exist in its present form because of rising temperatures, and will have to be moved to the evening or a different time of year. Cricket Australia\u2019s response: \u201cCricket is played in different climates and countries around the world and it is committed to both addressing the impact of climate change and ensuring cricket continued to be played in Australia on December 26 for many years to come.\u201d Here is coverage from Day 2 of Australia v New Zealand and Travis Head\u2019s century - as it happened. Good morning everyone! An intriguing day ahead at Centurion. While we wait for the coverage to start, a couple of things. Firstly, there is more sickness in the England camp to report - now Mark Wood joins Jack Leach, Ollie Pope, Chris Woakes and two members of support staff in the sick bay. Also, do read this important report into the future of the Boxing Day Test in this era of climate crisis. Tanya will be here soon. Here\u2019s Sam Curran\u2019s thoughts on the first day of play: \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough week as a squad and we\u2019re pleased how we\u2019ve stuck together as a group. It was tough out there, warm with not much breeze. Of course we would like to have bowled them out by the close. But I would say it\u2019s been an even day. [Quinton] de Kock played beautifully, yet all in all we\u2019re pretty pleased. \u201cThere was a special atmosphere out there with the band and the Barmy Army. It was pretty cool ... There is some nice carry here so you can nick the batters off and there is a bit of variation in the bounce. Maybe we will need some different plans for Quinton in the second innings.\u201d Read more from Vic Marks here.",

      "bodyText": "Potters Corner winning the Welsh National for Wales is quite some yarn again for the Chesptow marathon ... And there\u2019s also the involvement of Welsh rugby international Jonathan Davies ... Meanwhile, at Leopardstown commentator Jerry Hannon goes for the top note after Roaring Bull gets up on the line to win the Paddy Power Chase. 1 Potters Corner (Jack Tudor) 8-1 2 Truckers Lodge (Lorcan Williams) 10-1 3 Yala Enki (Bryony Frost) 8-1 4 Prime Venture (Adam Wedge) 11-1 17 ran Also: 9-4 Fav Elegant Escape And they\u2019re off ... Space Cadet has made a mistake at the first already ... Yala Enki leads in the early stages ... The Two Amigos joins the leader but it\u2019s very early days ... Elegant Escape is in midfield ... Potters Corner travels well in third ... Captain Chaos and Looks Like Power are towards the rear ... Arthur\u2019s Gift blunders but no fallers so far ... up front nothing has changed and they now still have a circuit to go ... Captain Chaos has made a move and The Two Amigos goes into the lead ... all 17 are still standing ... The Two Amigos and Yala Enki still at the front with Looks Like Power at the back ... Space Cadet is tailing off ... Elegant Escape is getting close to the leading trio ... in line for home now ... Potters Corner moves up to second ... Potters Corner has the lead but it\u2019s close ... Truckers Lodge is challenging ... Potters Corner wins the Welsh Grand National for Wales! It is 30 years since Bonanza Boy lugged 11st 11lb to victory in the Welsh National, becoming the first and so far only horse to win the race in successive years since it moved to Chepstow in 1949. Rarely has his sole ownership of that record faced as stern a threat as it does on Friday, however, as Elegant Escape, a one-and-a-quarter-length winner off a 9lb lower mark last year, could not be returning in better form. He was only two lengths behind De Rasher Counter, who was getting 11lb, in the Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury last time and should improve again for Friday\u2019s marathon trip. The ground is more testing this year, however, and 11st 12lb could leave him vulnerable to a progressive rival. Now McGinty and Potters Corner both have strong claims and marginal preference is for the latter at around 7-1. Christian Williams has kept him to hurdles since his win in the Midlands National in March, and his handicap win this month suggests he remains on a very fair mark. On to Kempton (2.30) now for the Desert Orchid Chase. This is Christmas without the feast as Altior, who was due to run here, is absent with an abscess. Bun Doran has lead all the way, kicks clear after the last and holds off the late challenges of Duc des Genievres and Sceau Royal. Underwhelmed by that and another blanket finish. I think the best thing to say is Get Well Soon, Altior! Result: 1 Bun Doran (J J Burke) 4-1 2 Duc Des Genievres (James Bowen) 3-1 3 Sceau Royal (Thomas Bellamy) 7-2 5 ran It\u2019s just over half an hour to the Welsh National and Elegant Escape is all the rage for the race. A Bookmakers.tv spokesman said: \u201cThe market has sprung to life at Chepstow and the only horse the public want to be with at the front end is the hot favourite and last year\u2019s winner Elegant Escape. \u201cColin Tizzard and Robbie Power were out of luck in yesterday\u2019s feature but punters are convinced they\u2019ll go one better today and last night\u2019s 7-2 looks long gone as the top weight has fallen to 11-4 in places, while it would be no surprise to see him go off shorter still. The remainder of the field have largely been ignored but one at longer odds attracting support is Irish raider Space Cadet who has halved from 40-1 to 20-1 despite racing from out of the handicap.\u201d Back to Leopardstown (1.45) for the Paddy Power Future Champions Novice Hurdle ... All eyes here are on favourite Abacadabras ... and he\u2019s going well just behind the leaders on the home turn ... he\u2019s coming to challenge Heaven Help Us at the last and runs out the winner. Abacadabras is a clumsy jumper and will need to improve in that sphere but he\u2019s certainly got ability. Betfair were impressed and go 7-2 favourite for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival from 6-1. Given his hurdling technique I would be looking elsewhere presently at those odds. Result: 1 Abacadabras (J W Kennedy) 10-11 Fav 2 Heaven Help Us 25-1 4 ran See what you think here: Now off to Chepstow (1.35) for Coral Finale Juvenile Hurdle, a race that has been won by useful types in the past. Allmankind has gone off like Rudolph at the front of the reindeer posse ... far too free ... let\u2019s see if he can keep up this pace up ... he\u2019s gone further clear ... Cerberus is staying on ... commentator Mark Johnson has gone too soon again but the winner hadn\u2019t and that was pretty impressive from Allmankind. That was a very good Cheltenham Festival Triumph Hurdle pointer. The winner is 8-1 for the Triumph from 16-1 with Betfair \u2013 that seems fair. Dan Skelton was impressed. \u201cI was really relaxed watching him, especially when he went up the hill when Harry got hold of him,\u201d the winning trainer told Sky Sports Racing. \u201cI knew if Harry asked him to extend he would do so, and I thought he gave him a magic ride. The horse has got a great attitude. He loves to run.\u201d The winning rider, Harry Skelton, said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe how he picked up from three out - not many horses give you a feel like that. When we went up the hill he dropped the bridle a bit. When we went down the hill he took over and I thought, \u2018they aren\u2019t going to catch him now\u2019. From three out, for a three-year-old to pick up like that it\u2019s pretty good.\u201d Result: 1 Allmankind (Harry Skelton) 6-5 Fav 2 Cerberus (R M Power) 5-2 3 Nordano (Bryony Frost) 20-1 8 ran Over to Kempton (1.20) for the Wayward Lad Novice Chase. Global Citizen leads into the straight but it\u2019s wide open. Al Dancer is trying to get there as is Rouge Vif ... but Global Citizen holds on. Now you could have thrown Santa\u2019s blanket over the first five home and they can\u2019t all be good ... Betfair go 16-1 Global Citizen (from 33-1) for the Arkle Trophy at the Cheltenham Festival. Winning trainer Ben Pauling said: \u201cIf he didn\u2019t win today he would probably have gone back for the Champion Hurdle, that\u2019s why we threw him in at the deep end on ground that he would not necessarily love. He is good fresh, so you might not see him out until the spring. He has got to be one of the best of the British [for the Arkle].\u201d Result: 1 Global Citizen (David Bass) 8-1 2 Rouge Vif (G Sheehan) 11-2 3 Grand Sancy (H Cobden) 11-2 6 ran Make your mind up on the strength of the form. Here\u2019s the finish: At Leopardstown (1.10) now it\u2019s Chacun Pour Soi\u2019s chance to strut his stuff in the Grade One Paddy\u2019s Rewards Chase. He\u2019s only run twice in four years but is an exciting prospect. Going well with four to go and leaps in the lead at the next ... he\u2019s got a fight on his hooves now on the run-in ... A Plus Tard and the favourite battle it out and Rachael Blackmore\u2019s mount gets up to pull off a surprise success. A Plus Tard now 6-1 from 33\u2019s for the Champion Chase with Betfair. Result: 1 A Plus Tard (Rachael Blackmore) 4-1 2 Chacun Pour Soi 8-15 Fav 3 Ordinary World 33-1 8 ran Here\u2019s all the late action. Terrific ride by Blackmore: The top-class action is about to start with the exciting City Island set to make his chasing debut at Leopardstown in the Paddy Power Beginners Chase at 12.35 ... where he faces the former Champion Hurdle runner-up Melon. Hold on to your trilby, we\u2019ll be busy ... Melon is 11-8 fav ... and City Island 2-1. That may look generous soon ... Cappucimix is down at the first ... Valdieu has now gone and Melon currently winning the jumping stakes against City Island, who has been slower over his obstacles ... City Island makes a shocking mistake and is virtually out of the race ... Melon also makes a very bad error at the last but gets up to beat Gallant John Joe in a fighting finish. City Island needs to go back to the schooling grounds ... and Melon is tough and clearly potentially useful over fences. He is unchanged with Betfair at 14-1 for the Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham. Willie Mullins said of the winner: \u201cI was very happy with the way he jumped early on, obviously he made a mistake at the last, but what particularly pleased me was the way he fought back when it looked like the game was up. He makes life difficult for himself, but he fought back well today.\u201d He added on plans: \u201cI\u2019d imagine the Arkle is the likely target. He could come back here for the Dublin Racing Festival and will need more experience.\u201d Result: 1 Melon (P Townend) 5-4 Fav 2 Gallant John Joe 16-1 3 Chosen Mate 11-1 8 ran You can see all the action here Chris Cook is having a short Christmas break but he found time to meet Hollie Doyle for a quick chat on her stellar year, and talked with the female jockey of the year about weight-training, festive eating and getting her own back in the saddle. It\u2019s a nice read before the action starts: The BBC is in for a tough time but they\u2019re not helping by ditching (sorry again) their racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght. When news of his exit surfaced, some opined that it may be because he was out of touch with the new-fangled social meeja. In fact he was one of the first to embrace Twitter \u2013 even if with semi-colons. He\u2019s at Chepstow today for the Welsh National and just posted this: Cyrname is likely to return to Ascot for his next appearance after finding stablemate Clan Des Obeaux too strong in the Ladbrokes King George VI Chase.

The pair\u2019s long, drawn out duel was genuinely gripping and many won\u2019t have seen it. Here\u2019s the race in full ... ... and here are the happy connections of the King George winner celebrating ... in McDonald\u2019s! ... and King Clan is well ... Yesterday, Paul Nicholls said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the dual King George winner Clan Des Obeaux\u2019s next appearance would be in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Well, the trainer\u2019s had a change of mind: Three of the last seven runnings of the Welsh National have been postponed until January after their original Christmas slot succumbed to waterlogging, but this year\u2019s renewal has somehow survived one of the wettest spells that any of us can remember and will take its traditional place as the focus of the British action this afternoon. The going at the Welsh track is not even heavy all round, with some patches of soft ground apparently clinging on at a few points on the circuit, but it will, as ever, be a thorough test for all concerned. Selections for the televised races at both Chepstow and Kempton Park, where the two-day Winter Festival meeting concludes, can be found here, and there are no non-runners anywhere on the ITV Racing schedule as yet. But there is also plenty to consider in Ireland too, where the most interesting runner on day two of Leopardstown\u2019s Christmas meeting is surely Chacun Pour Soi in the two-mile Grade One chase at 1.10, the first of two Grade One events on the card. Willie Mullins\u2019s seven-year-old is already the favourite for the Champion Chase at Cheltenham in March after just two runs for the stable last season, both of which saw him record impressive victories. It was his defeat of Defi Du Seuil at Punchestown, however, which shot him to the forefront of the Festival betting, as he cleared away from the JLT Novice Chase (and subsequent Tingle Creek) winner in the style of an exceptional chaser. The second Grade One at Leopardstown is a two-mile novice hurdle with an odds-on favourite in Gordon Elliott\u2019s Abacadabras, who was beaten fairly readily by his stable companion Envoi Allen in the Royal Bond at Fairyhouse earlier this month, while the big betting race of the day in Ireland is the Paddy Power Chase at 2.55, in which a huge field will chase an equally impressive \u20ac200,000 prize.",

Pellegrini must decide whether to risk a recall for the Poland goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to face Leicester after three months out with a hip injury having selected Roberto against Palace. \u201cWe will see which players are able to play without resting less than 48 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how Lukas Fabianski is but we will also must study and be very clear which can be the best starting 11.\u201d",

Both the EU and the UK committed to agreeing a future partnership by the end of 2020 in the political declaration and have agreed to work with great energy to achieve this.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/24/london-expected-co-host-next-stage-post-brexit-negotiations\">the Guardian revealed</a> that London is expected to co-host the next phase of the Brexit negotiations in a highly symbolic shift in focus from Brussels.</p> <p>A leaked EU document seen by the Guardian lays out the key areas of cooperation which will be the subject of negotiation once the withdrawal agreement is ratified and the UK has withdrawn from the bloc at the end of January.</p> <p>According to the paper, EU diplomats representing the member states will on 10 January look at the issues involved in maintaining a free flow of data after Brexit and allowing the UK\u2019s financial services sector to continue to operate within the EU through a decision on the \u201cadequacy\u201d of UK regulation in those two areas.</p> <p>Later in that week, the internal discussions will move on to trade in goods and services and the arrangements for intellectual property and public procurement.</p> <p>On 14 January, diplomats will scope out their position on fisheries and the need for a level playing field under which the UK will need to sign up to EU fiscal, environmental and social standards.</p> <p>Further seminars are planned on the governance of any agreement to allow dispute resolution, the arrangements in haulage and aviation, security, foreign policy, space, energy, mobility of citizens travelling between the UK and the EU, and future British involvement in the EU\u2019s programmes, including in higher education.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson should reconsider his refusal to extend the 11-month timeframe available for agreeing a deal on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU after Brexit, Ursula von der Leyen has suggested. The European commission president said she had \u201cserious concern\u201d about the limited time available for the negotiations and emphasised the need to keep all options open. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about negotiating a free trade deal but many other subjects,\u201d Von der Leyen said in an interview with the French newspaper les Echos. \u201cIt seems to me that on both sides we must ask ourselves seriously if all these negotiations are feasible in such a short time.\u201d Once the UK leaves the EU on 31 January it will remain in the bloc\u2019s customs union and single market until the end of 2020, with an option to stay within those arrangements for a further two years. But the prime minister has said he will not agree to such an extension, claiming there is ample time to negotiate a comprehensive deal covering all aspects of the current EU-UK relationship, from trade to internal security, transport and data-sharing. The withdrawal agreement provides for a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d on 1 July, by which time both sides will need to have agreed on prolonging the transition period or face running out of time. Should there not be a deal in place on trade, for example, the UK would face major disruption to its economy, with tariffs and quantity restrictions being immediately applied to goods being sold into the EU market. Von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, said the risks for both sides meant an extension of the transition period could not be ruled out. \u201cI believe that it would be reasonable to review things in the middle of the year, if necessary to see if an extension is needed,\u201d she said. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister has been clear that we will not be extending the implementation period. Both the EU and the UK committed to agreeing a future partnership by the end of 2020 in the political declaration and have agreed to work with great energy to achieve this.\u201d Earlier this week, the Guardian revealed that London is expected to co-host the next phase of the Brexit negotiations in a highly symbolic shift in focus from Brussels. A leaked EU document seen by the Guardian lays out the key areas of cooperation which will be the subject of negotiation once the withdrawal agreement is ratified and the UK has withdrawn from the bloc at the end of January. According to the paper, EU diplomats representing the member states will on 10 January look at the issues involved in maintaining a free flow of data after Brexit and allowing the UK\u2019s financial services sector to continue to operate within the EU through a decision on the \u201cadequacy\u201d of UK regulation in those two areas. Later in that week, the internal discussions will move on to trade in goods and services and the arrangements for intellectual property and public procurement. On 14 January, diplomats will scope out their position on fisheries and the need for a level playing field under which the UK will need to sign up to EU fiscal, environmental and social standards. Further seminars are planned on the governance of any agreement to allow dispute resolution, the arrangements in haulage and aviation, security, foreign policy, space, energy, mobility of citizens travelling between the UK and the EU, and future British involvement in the EU\u2019s programmes, including in higher education.",

This from a woman who can\u2019t watch television without declaring it pornography. (\u201cEastEnders? A dirty show with dirty ideas! David Attenborough\u2019s new project? You cannot deny it is suggestive.\u201d) It seemed like a miracle. But it was the work of the nieces. They\u2019re teens, and the embodiment of today\u2019s internet culture: fragile, brimming with potential, while also terrifying and dictatorial. If I thought I moved the dial in challenging family norms on, say, clothing, they ate the dial for breakfast. They\u2019ve been great to have on side \u2013 this side being us homogenous \u201cyounger ones\u201d; the British-born or unmarried ones; and we cousins who back each other up. Until the conversation turns to makeup. My nieces wear a lot of makeup. \u201cYou sound just like Mum!\u201d they\u2019ll say when I mention clogged pores, which is my main concern, not modesty. OK, fine, I care about the pressures of beauty standards, too. Also, constant sexualisation \u2013 at which point they roll their eyes and say it\u2019s funny the way I think I\u2019m so different from Auntie B yet somehow so much the same. They are sharp. So when they asked if I liked the negligee, I spoke honestly. I adhere to the slobwear school of PJs, I said, and found it too cold, too itchy \u2013 and isn\u2019t it a bit grownup for them?

      "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp has revealed Roberto Firmino\u2019s recent burst of goals came after the player had to be reassured of his value to Liverpool following a long stretch without scoring. The manager described the Brazilian as Liverpool\u2019s \u201cconnector\u201d, who gives invaluable service even when not getting on the scoresheet. Firmino\u2019s finishing has been impeccable over the festive period, as he scored the winning goals against Monterrey and Flamengo in the Club World Cup before two goals in the demolition of Leicester on Thursday. But he had scored only once in the previous 16 Premier League and Champions League games and began to worry about his form until Klopp reminded him of his precious contribution beyond goals. \u201cBobby has four goals in three games and before that he didn\u2019t score that often,\u201d Klopp said following Liverpool\u2019s 4-0 win at Leicester. \u201cWhen people tell me previously Bobby didn\u2019t score for a while I didn\u2019t realise. When I think about Bobby I don\u2019t think about scoring. I think about how important he is. \u201cWe had a bit of a talk because for the first time since I knew him he looked a little bit concerned about that fact,\u201d said Klopp of the player who joined Liverpool from Hoffenheim in June 2015. \u201cI told him I am not interested in that number because he is the connector for our team. He is so important for us. He is not the only one who can play that position but he can play that position in a very special way.\u201d Firmino acknowledged the impact of Klopp\u2019s reassurance by running to embrace his manager on the sideline after his second goal against Leicester. \u201cObviously he doesn\u2019t have to come [to hug me] every goal but this time he thought I was calm enough to leave him on the pitch in these games and he thought he has to say thank you.\u201d Meanwhile Brendan Rodgers, who brought Firmino to Anfield, stressed his young Leicester team must not lose confidence after being given a painful lesson by Liverpool. He said he will strive to ensure they get back to winning ways at West Ham on Saturday. \u201cYou are not going to have it all your own way all of the time but this is where the manager comes in to install that belief,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cYou have to go back to your basics again when you lose games like that. You have to work hard, get your aggression back in your game and play your football. That is what I will look to do \u2013 give them that confidence back. Mental strength comes from learning experiences and these last two games we will learn from that and be better for it.\u201d Rodgers said he will make several alterations to freshen up his team for their latest assignment in a hectic schedule. \u201cWe will make a number of changes. Players will want to play in every game but it is physically hard to do that to play to the level they want to. \u201cWe just played the Champions League winners and it\u2019s probably positive that we\u2019ve got a game so quickly after because we can focus on that and try to put this game to bed. We\u2019re at the start of our journey and I think it\u2019s important to reiterate that because it showed we were against a top side and they were better than us.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>If you walk into the centre of Carlisle, you will almost certainly notice Dixon\u2019s Chimney. The 90-metre (290ft) structure has dominated the city\u2019s skyline for nearly 200 years, its rust-coloured tower a reminder of Cumbria\u2019s industrial past. More recently, though, the chimney has taken on a new status as a fixed reminder of one of the city\u2019s most shocking deaths.</p> <p>In the early hours of Monday 28 October, residents woke to the sight of a man suspended in mid-air from the top of the Grade II-listed chimney. He had climbed the hundreds of steps overnight but slipped at the summit, leaving him hanging by his ankle in sub-zero temperatures.</p> <p>Crowds of onlookers gathered to watch the fraught 14-hour operation to rescue 53-year-old Phil Longcake, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/30/tributes-paid-to-man-who-died-in-carlisle-chimney-tragedy\">\u201cstrong, brave\u201d and popular family man</a> from a nearby village. But by the time emergency workers reached him, using a 90-metre cherrypicker rushed down from Glasgow, he was already dead. An inquest recorded his cause of death as hypothermia and cerebral swelling.</p> <p>The traumatic and very public nature of Phil\u2019s death has deeply affected the people of Carlisle, a city with a bigger sense of community than most small towns. Bouquets of flowers still surround Dixon\u2019s Chimney, a structure as tall as Big Ben, and more than 1,000 people have donated to a local mental health charity for which Phil\u2019s family has <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/rob-laura-longcake\">raised more than \u00a314,000</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3a6639dafbe45029af8d8372297a62ec20387ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3a6639dafbe45029af8d8372297a62ec20387ad/0_281_2644_1586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dixon\u2019s Chimney in Carlisle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dixon\u2019s Chimney in Carlisle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Walker/NNP/North News &amp; Pictures Ltd   northnews.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a statement after his death, Phil\u2019s loved ones paid tribute to a devoted granddad, father and husband. They said he had struggled with his mental health after recently disclosing an earlier trauma, but gave no further details, leading to a frenzy of speculation in the tight-knit towns and villages that surround Carlisle.</p> <p>Speaking publicly for the first time, Phil\u2019s family have decided to talk to the Guardian to explain the circumstances surrounding his death in an effort to prevent similar tragedies.</p> <p>In July, Phil told his family he had been sexually abused on a regular basis from the age of eight to 15. The perpetrator, he said, was still alive.</p> <p>He had kept this secret all his adult life \u2013 even from his wife, Andrea, whom he married when they were both 17 \u2013 but he eventually opened up after his family noticed a sudden change in his character. \u201cIt was instantaneous,\u201d said his son Rob Longcake, 31. \u201cOne minute he\u2019s Dad as we know him and then he completely changed.\u201d</p> <p>Phil reported his allegations to Cumbria police on 3 August. Barely nine weeks later, the investigation came to an end. The suspect, who denied any wrongdoing, was arrested and interviewed but later released without charge. In a statement, Cumbria police said they decided there would be no further action on evidential grounds as they could not corroborate Phil\u2019s account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"755b3683fad0e868303c2b96ed962ced18d8b874\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/755b3683fad0e868303c2b96ed962ced18d8b874/13_88_669_872/384.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Longcake and family.\" width=\"384\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Longcake and family.

Unfortunately, in this instance, there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a prosecution.</p> <p>\u201cA senior officer from the constabulary \u2013 a detective chief inspector and the force lead for rape and serious sexual offences \u2013 has visited the family and shared some of the specific details and challenges of the case. It would be inappropriate to disclose further detail wider.\u201d</p> <p>Andrea said her husband became \u201cmore depressed, more withdrawn\u201d after the investigation was dropped. She said she felt police did not do enough to investigate his allegations. \u201cI questioned the police. I said they\u2019ve done nothing because all they\u2019ve done is look into records and spoken to a few people. I think that\u2019s pretty poor actually,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThey said there was nothing to go off \u2013 it was just one word against another. But the way I see it, they didn\u2019t look.\u201d</p> <p>Rob Longcake, a fire service engineer, said he believed his father planned to end his life on the chimney, Carlisle\u2019s most prominent building, to send a message to his alleged abuser. \u201cIt was planned to the detail. He was definitely going up there for one reason,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really go anywhere in Carlisle without seeing it. He wanted the exposure.\u201d</p> <p>The family feel Phil received insufficient support in the weeks before he died, despite telling specialist mental health workers he planned to kill himself.

      "bodyText": "If you walk into the centre of Carlisle, you will almost certainly notice Dixon\u2019s Chimney. The 90-metre (290ft) structure has dominated the city\u2019s skyline for nearly 200 years, its rust-coloured tower a reminder of Cumbria\u2019s industrial past. More recently, though, the chimney has taken on a new status as a fixed reminder of one of the city\u2019s most shocking deaths. In the early hours of Monday 28 October, residents woke to the sight of a man suspended in mid-air from the top of the Grade II-listed chimney. He had climbed the hundreds of steps overnight but slipped at the summit, leaving him hanging by his ankle in sub-zero temperatures. Crowds of onlookers gathered to watch the fraught 14-hour operation to rescue 53-year-old Phil Longcake, a \u201cstrong, brave\u201d and popular family man from a nearby village. But by the time emergency workers reached him, using a 90-metre cherrypicker rushed down from Glasgow, he was already dead. An inquest recorded his cause of death as hypothermia and cerebral swelling. The traumatic and very public nature of Phil\u2019s death has deeply affected the people of Carlisle, a city with a bigger sense of community than most small towns. Bouquets of flowers still surround Dixon\u2019s Chimney, a structure as tall as Big Ben, and more than 1,000 people have donated to a local mental health charity for which Phil\u2019s family has raised more than \u00a314,000. In a statement after his death, Phil\u2019s loved ones paid tribute to a devoted granddad, father and husband. They said he had struggled with his mental health after recently disclosing an earlier trauma, but gave no further details, leading to a frenzy of speculation in the tight-knit towns and villages that surround Carlisle. Speaking publicly for the first time, Phil\u2019s family have decided to talk to the Guardian to explain the circumstances surrounding his death in an effort to prevent similar tragedies. In July, Phil told his family he had been sexually abused on a regular basis from the age of eight to 15. The perpetrator, he said, was still alive. He had kept this secret all his adult life \u2013 even from his wife, Andrea, whom he married when they were both 17 \u2013 but he eventually opened up after his family noticed a sudden change in his character. \u201cIt was instantaneous,\u201d said his son Rob Longcake, 31. \u201cOne minute he\u2019s Dad as we know him and then he completely changed.\u201d Phil reported his allegations to Cumbria police on 3 August. Barely nine weeks later, the investigation came to an end. The suspect, who denied any wrongdoing, was arrested and interviewed but later released without charge. In a statement, Cumbria police said they decided there would be no further action on evidential grounds as they could not corroborate Phil\u2019s account. DCS Dean Holden said: \u201cAll cases of this nature are taken extremely seriously by Cumbria constabulary, but any prosecution has to be based on a strong evidential case. Unfortunately, in this instance, there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a prosecution. \u201cA senior officer from the constabulary \u2013 a detective chief inspector and the force lead for rape and serious sexual offences \u2013 has visited the family and shared some of the specific details and challenges of the case. It would be inappropriate to disclose further detail wider.\u201d Andrea said her husband became \u201cmore depressed, more withdrawn\u201d after the investigation was dropped. She said she felt police did not do enough to investigate his allegations. \u201cI questioned the police. I said they\u2019ve done nothing because all they\u2019ve done is look into records and spoken to a few people. I think that\u2019s pretty poor actually,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said there was nothing to go off \u2013 it was just one word against another. But the way I see it, they didn\u2019t look.\u201d Rob Longcake, a fire service engineer, said he believed his father planned to end his life on the chimney, Carlisle\u2019s most prominent building, to send a message to his alleged abuser. \u201cIt was planned to the detail. He was definitely going up there for one reason,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really go anywhere in Carlisle without seeing it. He wanted the exposure.\u201d The family feel Phil received insufficient support in the weeks before he died, despite telling specialist mental health workers he planned to kill himself. Andrea said her husband saw \u201cfour or five\u201d different people from the Carleton Clinic, an NHS-run mental health facility, and that there was no consistency in who was monitoring him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they could truly monitor him if it wasn\u2019t the same person coming,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it\u2019s all down to funding but still \u2013 that doesn\u2019t work and people are slipping through the net because of it.\u201d Gary O\u2019Hare, the executive director of Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS foundation trust, said it was undertaking a \u201cthorough investigation into this serious incident\u201d and would listen to the family\u2019s concerns.

We would hold democratic values up high.\u201d</p> <p>Habeck has consistently argued for the Green movement to reinvent itself for the position it now finds itself in. In his 2016 book <em>Wer wagt, beginnt </em>(\u201cWho dares begins\u201d) he proposed that a left-right axis in politics was making way for a new scale of open and closed political systems, and that Greens were best placed to emerge on top as the old laws of political gravity are suspended.</p> <p>\u201cThe Greens can no longer just be the second line in the defence, to fill in the gaps that have opened in the ranks of the CDU or SPD,\u201d Habeck says. \u201cWe now try to become the new playmakers.</p> <p>\u201cThe Green party was founded to address issues that other parties had forgotten. But now these issues have a powerful effect on all of us. Voters realise their world is changing: we have sleepless nights in the summer, burning forests, dried out rivers, dwindling food resources for animals.</p> <p>\u201cGreen parties can also address central questions that don\u2019t fit into the traditional left-right spectrum. Many of these are cultural: how do you organise an open society? How do we establish a consensus in a diverse society?\u201d</p> <p>Both Habeck and Baerbock hail from the <em>realo </em>or pragmatic wing of the German Greens \u2013 a first in the 30-year history of a party that grew out of the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s and first entered parliament in 1983.</p> <p>Habeck shies away from the term \u201ccentrist\u201d; his expression of choice is that the Greens should be \u201cat the heart of society\u201d. If that is the direction of travel, should Green parties still describe themselves as leftwing?</p> <p>\u201cIf leftwing means progressive, in favour of an open society, against a closed, nationalist, or in the case of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/01/far-right-afd-makes-big-gains-but-fails-to-topple-mainstream-parties\">AfD</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/01/far-right-afd-makes-big-gains-but-fails-to-topple-mainstream-parties\"> [Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party]</a>, fascistic worldview, then yes\u201d, Habeck says.</p> <p>\u201cIf left means dismissing Europe, migration and environmental concerns as modern fads, and simply dream, Corbyn-like, that the old white working-class will close ranks again, then it\u2019s an empty category.\u201d</p> <p>A number of stumbling blocks on the path to power remain. One of the reasons the Greens underperformed at previous elections is that they failed to shake off their reputation as the <em>Verbotspartei</em>, the party that wants to ban everything. </p> <p>\u201cThere can be no politics that doesn\u2019t ban things,\u201d Habeck says. \u201cWe have a highway code, a code of civil law: the world is full of bans that exist <em> </em>in order<em> </em>to guarantee our freedom. What\u2019s different with the Greens is that we dare to apply that thinking to environmental questions too.\u201d</p> <p>What the Greens under Habeck\u2019s leadership tried to avoid, he says, was attempting to regulate people\u2019s private lives. \u201cIf you set standards at a broader political level, then that\u2019s a good thing. If you tell people they have a personal calorie budget for animal proteins, then that\u2019s a bad idea.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if you tell them there\u2019s not going to be any meat at public canteens on a Thursday afternoon then that\u2019s not cool either, because you are prescribing what they can eat when and where. But if you set standards for how the animals they eat are treated, then you can go to a kebab shop and eat doner any day you want.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53c9af9401742f7522c37404d27701377b564b4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53c9af9401742f7522c37404d27701377b564b4e/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-fossil fuel protesters at the J\u00e4nschwalde power plant in Brandenburg, eastern Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-fossil fuel protesters at the J\u00e4nschwalde power plant in Brandenburg, eastern Germany, where the Greens have struggled to win support.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another area where the Greens struggle is that their message resonates most strongly in urban areas, and in the old west: at state elections in Brandenburg in the formerly socialist east, where Germany\u2019s planned phase-out of coal power is likely to kill off the remaining mining industry, the Greens only came fourth this year.</p> <p>\u201cWe tried to explain to people there were plans after the coal mines had closed down: infrastructure projects, new hospitals, fast broadband,\u201d says Habeck, who lives with his family of five in the rural northernmost part of Germany, on the border with Denmark. \u201cBut after experiencing all these rough changes in the past people found it understandably difficult to trust.</p> <p>\u201cBut they did start listening to me when I said: before we are going to talk about what comes next, I am going to say thank you for you and your parents dedicating your life and health to building the industrial heart of the country.\u201d</p> <p>Admittedly, he adds, they did not start voting for the Greens then either. \u201cBut they realised there\u2019s a form of respect here.

In one of the verses the duo translated, McGough muses how dreamy literary types often struggle with the demands of practical reality: \u201cThough some are closet fascists / In the main they\u2019re democrats / But all things considered / poets make terrible acrobats.\u201d And yet, on the eve of 2020 the spotlight is on Habeck as he prepares to launch himself on to the geopolitical trapeze. Since he and his co-leader, Annalena Baerbock, took charge of the German Greens in January 2018, the environmentalist party has surged in the polls, leapfrogging the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) to challenge Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives for the top spot.

But the way in which he relishes giving straight answers to big questions has all the self-confidence and determination of a man whom Foreign Policy magazine has already described as Germany\u2019s answer to Emmanuel Macron.

In his 2016 book Wer wagt, beginnt (\u201cWho dares begins\u201d) he proposed that a left-right axis in politics was making way for a new scale of open and closed political systems, and that Greens were best placed to emerge on top as the old laws of political gravity are suspended. \u201cThe Greens can no longer just be the second line in the defence, to fill in the gaps that have opened in the ranks of the CDU or SPD,\u201d Habeck says. \u201cWe now try to become the new playmakers. \u201cThe Green party was founded to address issues that other parties had forgotten. But now these issues have a powerful effect on all of us. Voters realise their world is changing: we have sleepless nights in the summer, burning forests, dried out rivers, dwindling food resources for animals. \u201cGreen parties can also address central questions that don\u2019t fit into the traditional left-right spectrum. Many of these are cultural: how do you organise an open society? How do we establish a consensus in a diverse society?\u201d Both Habeck and Baerbock hail from the realo or pragmatic wing of the German Greens \u2013 a first in the 30-year history of a party that grew out of the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s and first entered parliament in 1983. Habeck shies away from the term \u201ccentrist\u201d; his expression of choice is that the Greens should be \u201cat the heart of society\u201d. If that is the direction of travel, should Green parties still describe themselves as leftwing? \u201cIf leftwing means progressive, in favour of an open society, against a closed, nationalist, or in the case of the AfD [Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party], fascistic worldview, then yes\u201d, Habeck says. \u201cIf left means dismissing Europe, migration and environmental concerns as modern fads, and simply dream, Corbyn-like, that the old white working-class will close ranks again, then it\u2019s an empty category.\u201d A number of stumbling blocks on the path to power remain. One of the reasons the Greens underperformed at previous elections is that they failed to shake off their reputation as the Verbotspartei, the party that wants to ban everything. \u201cThere can be no politics that doesn\u2019t ban things,\u201d Habeck says. \u201cWe have a highway code, a code of civil law: the world is full of bans that exist in order to guarantee our freedom. What\u2019s different with the Greens is that we dare to apply that thinking to environmental questions too.\u201d What the Greens under Habeck\u2019s leadership tried to avoid, he says, was attempting to regulate people\u2019s private lives. \u201cIf you set standards at a broader political level, then that\u2019s a good thing. If you tell people they have a personal calorie budget for animal proteins, then that\u2019s a bad idea. \u201cAnd if you tell them there\u2019s not going to be any meat at public canteens on a Thursday afternoon then that\u2019s not cool either, because you are prescribing what they can eat when and where. But if you set standards for how the animals they eat are treated, then you can go to a kebab shop and eat doner any day you want.\u201d Another area where the Greens struggle is that their message resonates most strongly in urban areas, and in the old west: at state elections in Brandenburg in the formerly socialist east, where Germany\u2019s planned phase-out of coal power is likely to kill off the remaining mining industry, the Greens only came fourth this year. \u201cWe tried to explain to people there were plans after the coal mines had closed down: infrastructure projects, new hospitals, fast broadband,\u201d says Habeck, who lives with his family of five in the rural northernmost part of Germany, on the border with Denmark. \u201cBut after experiencing all these rough changes in the past people found it understandably difficult to trust. \u201cBut they did start listening to me when I said: before we are going to talk about what comes next, I am going to say thank you for you and your parents dedicating your life and health to building the industrial heart of the country.\u201d Admittedly, he adds, they did not start voting for the Greens then either. \u201cBut they realised there\u2019s a form of respect here. People know the world is changing, but they want the credit they deserve for what they have achieved historically. Politics has to see the other side.\u201d",

Having spent the last few years botching album rollouts, cancelling projects and indulging in post-release alterations, West delivered on the planned Christmas Day release of Jesus Is Born, his second strongly Christian record of recent months and first to be credited to his Sunday Service Choir project. Jesus Is Born fully realises the ambitious Sunday Service shows the collective has been performing in churches and other venues for months now. Whatever fans make of West\u2019s transformation into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/03/gaining-my-religion-kanye-dylan-and-the-pop-stars-who-find-god\">paragon of religious </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/03/gaining-my-religion-kanye-dylan-and-the-pop-stars-who-find-god\">devotion</a>, they can\u2019t accuse him of failing to put in the time.</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/26/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-review\">Jesus Is King</a> saw West absorb a heavy Christian influence into his singular hip-hop style, its follow-up trades solely in traditional gospel. Fans uninterested in his religious rebirth will find little to love here (most of the Sunday Service Choir\u2019s vocals are a variant on this bar from More Than Anything: \u201cI love you, Jesus / I worship and adore you / Just want to tell you / Lord, I love you more than anything.\u201d) but the album certainly fulfils its prayerful remit. Though West\u2019s fingerprints are harder to detect than ever before, Jesus Is Born is more full-bodied than its predecessor, which often felt like a collection of unfinished sketches. Sometimes it can sound less like a studio album than audio snatched from a publicly funded evangelical TV station, but the power of the choir is captured in these recordings and the live feel of the compositions place the listener in Kanye\u2019s own house of prayer.</p> <p>Most interesting to West fans will be the new versions of older songs. Ultralight Beam is whittled down to the choir section that helped power <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oHdAA3AqnE\">the original</a>. The new version of Father Stretch My Hands (simply titled Father Stretch) develops the rap song\u2019s gospel overtures, while Follow Me \u2013 Faith reinterprets Fade. Most songs follow a similar pattern \u2013 the choir, led by a solo male voice, is backed up by a small number of live instruments \u2013 but still there are obvious highlights. A cover of SWV\u2019s Rain is one of the album\u2019s quieter moments, led by a languid guitar line that would catch the ear of Frank Ocean. That\u2019s How the Good Lord Works, a take on the Joubert Singers\u2019 Stand On the Word, leans on a jazzy piano riff, and Souls Anchored, a remake of Ginuwine\u2019s So Anxious, is one of a few 90s chart R&amp;B covers to retain the warmth of the original\u2019s lead vocals.</p> <p>Gospel isn\u2019t for everyone but the excellent recent compilations World Spirituality Classics 2 and No Other Love revealed the power of Christian music when it\u2019s driven by sober truths: that life can be a struggle, the will of man is frequently weak, sin is inescapable.

Delivering the same message in the same style for 84 minutes, it sometimes feels like mass does to a six-year-old. Yet the Sunday Service Choir have helped West deliver a pretty well-executed genre album. Just don\u2019t compare it to the rest of his mighty oeuvre. Should Kanye\u2019s interest in gospel music prove temporary, this is likely to be remembered as an oddity rather than a baptism.</p>",

Elberse met Ferguson for breakfast in Boston. \u201cI only realised later that it was a sort of audition,\u201d she says. \u201cHe wanted to see if I could be the person to help him tell his story about the leadership that he\u2019s brought to soccer.\u201d</p> <p>Ferguson would retire at the end of the 2012-13 season so Elberse might have been privy to a bombshell exclusive. \u201cLooking back it was pretty naive not to have realised: \u2018Oh, this might be his last year,\u2019\u201d she says, with a smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that was going to happen. I was able to follow him along for that last year. I visited the United training ground at Carrington, I went to his house and met his family, I saw him at the stadium. I even saw him in the famous room where he meets with the coach of the opposing team after matches.\u201d</p> <p>Elberse made a case study about Ferguson which asked what it took to run United, and they also wrote an article together for the Harvard Business Review, published in October 2013. It was entitled <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/10/fergusons-formula\" title=\"\">Ferguson\u2019s Formula</a>, and it distilled the eight leadership lessons that had formed the basis of his approach. Elberse commented at the time that \u201cmany of them can certainly be applied more broadly, to business and to life\u201d.</p> <p>By that time something else had changed in Elberse\u2019s career. She had developed a course for HBS\u2019s MBA students on entertainment, media and sport and, as the way she wrote and taught her case studies gathered repute, she was receiving more and more requests from people in various industries to sit in on her classes. She made a decision \u2013 to launch an executive education version of the course.</p> <p>The first edition of the four-day <a href=\"https://www.exed.hbs.edu/business-entertainment-media-sports/\" title=\"\">Business of Entertainment, Media and Sport</a> programme took place in June 2013 and Ferguson was one of the guest speakers \u2013 \u201ca very special moment,\u201d she says. Ferguson has since been to Harvard several times to watch Elberse teach his case study and to answer questions from students.</p> <p>In previous generations a retired footballer might open a pub or a sports retail store but, as Elberse says, it is rather different now. Top players can be brands in their own right and, in some instances, they have started to push high-end business ventures before they retire. Elberse\u2019s executive course aims to highlight via open-ended case studies the patterns that exist in the worlds of film, television, music and sport; to show how to market and manage creative products and talent; and how to build businesses around content.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb95fe28f93156c0cd7026e3fe98f5f7bcf50649\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb95fe28f93156c0cd7026e3fe98f5f7bcf50649/236_1581_2596_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elberse with \u2013 clockwise from left \u2013 Dani Alves, Edwin van der Sar, Kak\u00e1, Mario Melchiot and Nuri Sahin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"947\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elberse with \u2013 clockwise from left \u2013 Dani Alves, Edwin van der Sar, Kak\u00e1, Mario Melchiot and Nuri Sahin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Anita Elberse</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It runs every year for 80 people \u2013 each of whom pays $10,000 (\u00a37,700) \u2013 with the admissions committee looking to offer a well-balanced room, containing athletes, actors, musicians, agents and senior executives. They live a student life on the Harvard campus, which is a great leveller, a facilitator of equality and what Elberse calls \u201cone big community\u201d. There is a cross-pollination of ideas in an environment that attendees have described as \u201cinspiring\u201d. It is a perfect space for networking.</p> <p>Piqu\u00e9 was the first footballer to attend and he has been followed by Kak\u00e1, Alves, Mario Melchiot, Nuri Sahin, Edwin van der Sar, Tim Cahill and Oliver Kahn. There have been plenty of American sports stars, including Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, Pau Gasol and Chris Bosh (all from the NBA), plus Michael Strahan and Brandon Marshall (from the NFL), while from the entertainment sector there has been the actor Channing Tatum, the rapper LL Cool J and the singer Ciara.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at Gerard Piqu\u00e9 \u2013 he is an active player at Barcelona but he has an investment company called Kosmos and he has already established a significant business,\u201d Elberse says. \u201cHe\u2019s had a stake in the Players\u2019 Tribune from the get-go; he had a video game company as part of Kosmos and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/gerard-pique-revamped-davis-cup-project\" title=\"\">he has bought the Davis Cup</a> in tennis for $3bn. It\u2019s pretty simple what the footballers want from the course. They come to learn about the world of entertainment more generally, to discover patterns that are there in those industries that they can benefit from.</p> <p>\u201cI think the outside world looks at these people and says: \u2018You are a footballer, this is what you do and that is probably all that you\u2019ll do.\u2019 Well, no. What I\u2019ve learned is that they can do a lot more than what we\u2019ve seen them do on the field. There are some lessons that are very transferable \u2013 performing under high-pressure situations, working as part of a team, which all businesses are. They have worked under great leaders and probably bad ones, too.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things we do, and it\u2019s almost implicitly, is to show them that they actually know a lot more about business than they think they might. You might not know the jargon or the ins and outs of financial management or what it means to have the operations side of a business but there are a bunch of things that you do know and might be very good at.\u201d</p> <p>Kak\u00e1 and Alves, former Brazil teammates, did the course together and Elberse remembers how the latter, now playing for S\u00e3o Paulo, turned up in full Harvard garb. \u201cHe had the Harvard tie, the Harvard cardigan, the Harvard pants \u2013 he was completely Harvard, which was very, very funny,\u201d Elberse says. \u201cHe was by far the goofiest of the players that I\u2019ve had in the programme. He is completely crazy and he is proud of being as crazy as he is. But he was great to have for the group.</p> <p>\u201cHe has an audience of millions through social media and he can do whatever he wants to do. The same goes for Kak\u00e1, who is a really smart business guy. I can imagine him being the president of a soccer club.\u201d</p> <p>Van der Sar was appointed the chief executive of Ajax in 2016, having hung up his footballing boots in 2011, which represented a relatively quick transition from player to businessman. \u201cHe was the Ajax CEO when he was in the class,\u201d Elberse recalls. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to hear what he\u2019s learned from his playing career and how he\u2019s trying to apply that now that he\u2019s on the other side.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elberse\u2019s case studies present a story and invite questions and discussion. \u201cDwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson is a famous film star \u2013 why would he bother with a digital channel?\u201d she says. \u201cWhat is LeBron trying to build in Hollywood?

As has Gerwig, reviving Little Women in a year where a great deal of culture has considered the question of what it means to be good when the answer is less clear than ever.</p> <p>A decade of consciousness-raising via Twitter and Tumblr has complicated the issue, often by using culture and its makers to arbitrate issues of morality, from cultural appropriation to micro- and macro-aggressions. Even the concept of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/25/cancel-bret-easton-ellis-millennials-culture\">cancel culture</a> ended up getting \u2026 cancelled: debunked by critics, often of colour, who pointed out that nobody who had been cast aside for their infractions had gone away or lost much as a result. If so-called cancel culture was actually effective, then Donald Trump\u2019s history of sexually degrading comments (and alleged sexually degrading behaviour) and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/21/donald-trump-racist-wall-street-republicans\"> racist business practices</a> would have impeded his path to the White House \u2013 an idea that seems increasingly like a fairytale as the far right mount a successful pushback that has resulted in a moral void in world leadership. Politicians and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/28/fyre-festival-hustlers-holmes-obsessed-with-scammers\">lower-level scammers</a> have proven that deceit seldom gets in the way of success or power. It\u2019s fallen to children to hold adults to account for the decades of irresponsible, selfish consumption that has accelerated the climate crisis.</p> <p>Art became a space where these matters could be litigated, and tangible change could be reassuringly felt. It was inevitable that the question would resurface in culture, a longstanding concern pressed into new shapes as artists reach for the certainties of family, religion, self-respect and nature. The problem is that there appear to be diametrically opposed views on what constitutes goodness, who sets those standards and who benefits from them. At the start of 2018, New Statesman critic Anna Leszkiewicz wrote about <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2018/01/morality-tv-good-place-search-party-crazy-ex-girlfriend-bojack-horseman-bad-person-guilt-anxiety\">what she called \u201cmorality TV\u201d</a>, exploring why \u201ccharacters on screen are more anxious, guilty and self-hating than ever\u201d. The protagonists of shows including Search Party, Bojack Horseman and The Good Place were obsessed with whether they were good or bad people, she wrote. Almost two years later, that binary has become infinitely granular: not about being good or bad per se, but more the existential consideration of those qualities. At the start of series two of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/fleabag\">Fleabag</a>, Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character offers a supercut of the virtuous things she\u2019s done to get her life back on track: exercise, smoothies, sobriety. She is a better person than the mascara-smeared mess who sort of killed her best friend in series one. But \u2013 surprise! \u2013 all the \u201cnew year, new you\u201d tropes can\u2019t fill her cavernous existential holes. Fleabag\u2019s second coming asked that great Russian novel question: how can you live a good life at a time of great suffering when there may or may not be a God?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1e6ce1e548f88606a103e6683e71e33c0ed5d9d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e6ce1e548f88606a103e6683e71e33c0ed5d9d8/0_0_2627_1577/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kanye West performs Sunday Service during the 2019 Coachella festival, 21 April 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Should we be cynical about Kanye West\u2019s turn to gospel?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty Images for Coachella</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The essays in New Yorker staff writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/11/jia-tolentino-i-like-to-write-about-instincts-that-are-in-some-way-good-and-in-some-way-dangerous-\">Jia Tolentino</a>\u2019s debut collection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/02/trick-mirror-jia-tolentino-review\">Trick Mirror</a> turned over the complicated motivations behind contemporary performances of virtue \u2013 a question that found perhaps its definitive manifestation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">Kanye West</a>\u2019s turn towards gospel this year. Critics asked whether his religious awakening was merely a cynical attempt at redemption after a distinctly troubled period that saw him endorse Trump and describe slavery as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/01/kanye-west-on-slavery-for-400-years-that-sounds-like-a-choice\">a choice</a>\u201d. Admittedly it was difficult to accept West slut-shaming his wife in the name of the Lord on his album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/26/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-review\">Jesus Is King</a>, and to take his invite-only Sunday Service worship sessions \u2013 complete with merch including a $50 pair of socks and a $225 sweater \u2013 as a sign of a true believer, rather than an untrammelled god complex. But in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/arts/music/popcast-kanye-west-jesus-is-king.html\">an episode of the New York Times\u2019s Popcast</a>, gospel critics said the community was welcoming of his forays into the genre. If the Christian response to West is one of forgiveness and acceptance, then cynicism itself becomes suspect.</p> <p>That dynamic, where unexpected circumstances challenged a character\u2019s long-held ideas about what it meant to be good, played out on screen. The two proud nerds of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/25/olivia-wilde-booksmart-review-fast-funny-feminist\">Booksmart</a> are contemptuous of their hard-partying classmates until they learn that the bad kids are, in fact, matching their grades <em>and</em> having fun. Being good has only held their lives hostage. A more X-rated version of that revelation drove in HBO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/11/mrs-fletcher-review-kathryn-hahn-tom-perrotta\">Mrs Fletcher</a>. Kathryn Hahn\u2019s titular character, a feminist mother and divorcee, is appalled by her teenage son\u2019s degraded sexual politics.

At the end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/big-little-lies\">Big Little Lies</a>\u2019 first series, it was Bonnie\u2019s decency that drove her to run at Perry as he was strangling his wife, Celeste, pushing him down a flight of stairs and to his death. That sense of virtue returns in series two: no matter that she killed Perry to save Celeste, Bonnie still killed a man, and she falls apart under the pressure of lying. Meanwhile, her wealthy, white peers conceal the deed beneath the veneer that covers their lives, and carry on as before. The outward appearance of being a good father leads readers to sympathise with the newly divorced protagonist of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/15/taffy-brodesser-akner-interview-novel-fleishman-is-in-trouble\">Taffy Brodesser-Akner</a>\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/29/fleishman-is-in-trouble-taffy-brodesser-akner-review\">Fleishman Is in Trouble</a> \u2013 until his estranged wife finally enters the frame and offers a sucker-punch perspective flip.</p> <p>Even straightforward matters of justice acquired new wrinkles. In Marielle Heller\u2019s film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/30/can-you-ever-forgive-me-review-melissa-mccarthy-richard-e-grant\">Can You Ever Forgive Me?</a>, Melissa McCarthy portrays Lee Israel, a biographer on her uppers who resorts to becoming a successful literary forger. It\u2019s a Robin Hood tale: as the breadline recedes into the distance, deception comes to look like a legitimate survival tactic. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/19/best-tv-shows-2019-no-1-succession\">Succession</a>, meanwhile, a whistleblower threatens to overthrow Waystar Royco, and we watch Cousin Greg toy with whether to play his ace in service of financial reward or moral fortitude. His privilege \u2013 a young white man who has swiftly become accustomed to newfound wealth \u2013 means this hapless antihero slyly finds an option that combines both.</p> <p>It\u2019s a rare circumstance.

Marta, the daughter of an undocumented immigrant, appears to have killed him by accidentally and becomes embroiled in the whodunnit. But as his family members are revealed to be conniving and varyingly complicit, Marta exonerates herself \u2013 and reveals the true culprit \u2013 by always doing the decent thing.

      "bodyText": "In Greta Gerwig\u2019s new adaptation of Little Women, a haughty publisher dismisses Jo March\u2019s stories as unfashionable. \u201cMorals don\u2019t sell nowadays,\u201d he tells the aspiring author. \u201cPeople want to be amused, not preached at.\u201d Hopefully the statute of limitations has expired on spoiling a 151-year-old story: March \u2013 an avatar for her creator, Louisa May Alcott \u2013 proves him wrong. As has Gerwig, reviving Little Women in a year where a great deal of culture has considered the question of what it means to be good when the answer is less clear than ever. A decade of consciousness-raising via Twitter and Tumblr has complicated the issue, often by using culture and its makers to arbitrate issues of morality, from cultural appropriation to micro- and macro-aggressions. Even the concept of cancel culture ended up getting \u2026 cancelled: debunked by critics, often of colour, who pointed out that nobody who had been cast aside for their infractions had gone away or lost much as a result. If so-called cancel culture was actually effective, then Donald Trump\u2019s history of sexually degrading comments (and alleged sexually degrading behaviour) and racist business practices would have impeded his path to the White House \u2013 an idea that seems increasingly like a fairytale as the far right mount a successful pushback that has resulted in a moral void in world leadership. Politicians and lower-level scammers have proven that deceit seldom gets in the way of success or power. It\u2019s fallen to children to hold adults to account for the decades of irresponsible, selfish consumption that has accelerated the climate crisis. Art became a space where these matters could be litigated, and tangible change could be reassuringly felt. It was inevitable that the question would resurface in culture, a longstanding concern pressed into new shapes as artists reach for the certainties of family, religion, self-respect and nature. The problem is that there appear to be diametrically opposed views on what constitutes goodness, who sets those standards and who benefits from them. At the start of 2018, New Statesman critic Anna Leszkiewicz wrote about what she called \u201cmorality TV\u201d, exploring why \u201ccharacters on screen are more anxious, guilty and self-hating than ever\u201d. The protagonists of shows including Search Party, Bojack Horseman and The Good Place were obsessed with whether they were good or bad people, she wrote. Almost two years later, that binary has become infinitely granular: not about being good or bad per se, but more the existential consideration of those qualities. At the start of series two of Fleabag, Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character offers a supercut of the virtuous things she\u2019s done to get her life back on track: exercise, smoothies, sobriety. She is a better person than the mascara-smeared mess who sort of killed her best friend in series one. But \u2013 surprise! \u2013 all the \u201cnew year, new you\u201d tropes can\u2019t fill her cavernous existential holes. Fleabag\u2019s second coming asked that great Russian novel question: how can you live a good life at a time of great suffering when there may or may not be a God? The essays in New Yorker staff writer Jia Tolentino\u2019s debut collection Trick Mirror turned over the complicated motivations behind contemporary performances of virtue \u2013 a question that found perhaps its definitive manifestation in Kanye West\u2019s turn towards gospel this year. Critics asked whether his religious awakening was merely a cynical attempt at redemption after a distinctly troubled period that saw him endorse Trump and describe slavery as \u201ca choice\u201d. Admittedly it was difficult to accept West slut-shaming his wife in the name of the Lord on his album Jesus Is King, and to take his invite-only Sunday Service worship sessions \u2013 complete with merch including a $50 pair of socks and a $225 sweater \u2013 as a sign of a true believer, rather than an untrammelled god complex. But in an episode of the New York Times\u2019s Popcast, gospel critics said the community was welcoming of his forays into the genre. If the Christian response to West is one of forgiveness and acceptance, then cynicism itself becomes suspect. That dynamic, where unexpected circumstances challenged a character\u2019s long-held ideas about what it meant to be good, played out on screen. The two proud nerds of Booksmart are contemptuous of their hard-partying classmates until they learn that the bad kids are, in fact, matching their grades and having fun. Being good has only held their lives hostage. A more X-rated version of that revelation drove in HBO\u2019s Mrs Fletcher. Kathryn Hahn\u2019s titular character, a feminist mother and divorcee, is appalled by her teenage son\u2019s degraded sexual politics. But when he leaves for college, she develops a heavy porn habit that offers her unprecedented liberation. Artists further questioned who set the rules around morality and who actually benefits from adhering to them. At the end of Big Little Lies\u2019 first series, it was Bonnie\u2019s decency that drove her to run at Perry as he was strangling his wife, Celeste, pushing him down a flight of stairs and to his death. That sense of virtue returns in series two: no matter that she killed Perry to save Celeste, Bonnie still killed a man, and she falls apart under the pressure of lying. Meanwhile, her wealthy, white peers conceal the deed beneath the veneer that covers their lives, and carry on as before. The outward appearance of being a good father leads readers to sympathise with the newly divorced protagonist of Taffy Brodesser-Akner\u2019s novel Fleishman Is in Trouble \u2013 until his estranged wife finally enters the frame and offers a sucker-punch perspective flip. Even straightforward matters of justice acquired new wrinkles. In Marielle Heller\u2019s film Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Melissa McCarthy portrays Lee Israel, a biographer on her uppers who resorts to becoming a successful literary forger. It\u2019s a Robin Hood tale: as the breadline recedes into the distance, deception comes to look like a legitimate survival tactic. In Succession, meanwhile, a whistleblower threatens to overthrow Waystar Royco, and we watch Cousin Greg toy with whether to play his ace in service of financial reward or moral fortitude. His privilege \u2013 a young white man who has swiftly become accustomed to newfound wealth \u2013 means this hapless antihero slyly finds an option that combines both. It\u2019s a rare circumstance. In Rian Johnson\u2019s Knives Out, a wealthy family that telegraphs its liberal credentials through New Yorker subscriptions and conspicuous wokeness becomes outraged when it transpires that the late patriarch, a celebrated author, has left his entire estate to his Latina carer. Marta, the daughter of an undocumented immigrant, appears to have killed him by accidentally and becomes embroiled in the whodunnit. But as his family members are revealed to be conniving and varyingly complicit, Marta exonerates herself \u2013 and reveals the true culprit \u2013 by always doing the decent thing. She inherits the estate. But the film acts as a sort of reverse Get Out, the rub being that the \u201cgood\u201d immigrant can never win: not even model citizens are safe from racist attitudes and immigration policies. Even redemptive narratives are tinged with bitterness. In Little Women, Gerwig adds contemporary nuances to highlight how progressive Alcott\u2019s 1868 text already was and to restore some of Alcott\u2019s politics and ambitions that were stifled by her publisher\u2019s ideas of the right path for girls. \u201cWhat if you felt, when [Jo March] gets her book, the way you generally feel about a girl getting kissed?\u201d Gerwig has said. \u201cSo that it\u2019s not girl-gets-boy; it\u2019s girl-gets-book.\u201d Delving into the March sisters\u2019 later lives, she touches on Amy March setting up a foundation to support ambitious women. Gerwig\u2019s film is a comparable yardstick: it\u2019s a testament to her own ambition \u2013 to the depth of her research, her renowned care and respect as a director and collaborator \u2013 and a film whose politics, success and critical acclaim should create more opportunities for women film-makers in Hollywood.

It\u2019s your property.\u2019 We are working every day for that.\u201d</p> <p>Two of the men on V\u00eatu\u2019s team \u2013 Yudai Nitta and Yuta Wakimoto \u2013 will compete in the grand prix, along with Yuka Kobayashi, who is among the favourites for the women\u2019s title. \u201cThe riders I have on the Olympic team are really pure,\u201d says V\u00eatu. \u201cThey are not doing this for money. In other countries like China an Olympic gold is a route to money, but that doesn\u2019t matter here, because they already have money from professional keirin. Nitta has been dreaming about the Olympics since he was a kid.\u201d</p> <p>International keirin, in which riders follow a pacer bike around a 250m track before sprinting to the finish line, made its Olympic debut at the 2000 Sydney Games. The women\u2019s event appeared 12 years later in London, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/03/victoria-pendleton-london-olympics\">Britain\u2019s Victoria Pendleton </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/03/victoria-pendleton-london-olympics\">won gold</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"47c4c0725caf57daece688f77fb1fc723f4153a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47c4c0725caf57daece688f77fb1fc723f4153a0/0_215_3226_1936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riders compete during one of the girls\u2019 races at the Kawasaki Velodrome in 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riders compete during one of the girls\u2019 races at the Kawasaki Velodrome in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some keirin watchers attribute Japan\u2019s lack of success to differences in the rules between the domestic version and its UCI counterpart. Head-butting and shoulder barging are a feature of the sport in Japan, where riders from the same region collaborate on tracks of up to 500m. But it is the promise of making huge sums of money in Japan that keeps many promising young riders away from the international circuit.</p> <p>Kohei Gunji, who earned 68.5m yen (\u00a3480,000) during the first 11 months of the year, will be in the grand prix lineup for the first time but, like several other elite riders, has no Olympic ambitions. \u201cThere are riders I know who are taking time away from professional keirin to prepare for the Olympics,\u201d Gunji said in an interview last year. \u201cI\u2019ll be cheering them on, but it\u2019s not for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"474791d29335262f1de3e9a5930732d9ffa2e2cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/474791d29335262f1de3e9a5930732d9ffa2e2cd/834_0_3797_2281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kohei Gunji has no plans to take a break from professional keirin to compete at the Tokyo Olympics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kohei Gunji has no plans to take a break from professional keirin to compete at the Tokyo Olympics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin McCurry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However under the guidance of V\u00eatu and his assistant, the former Australian track cyclist Jason Niblett, Japan\u2019s athletes are making their presence felt on the international track. At last year\u2019s Track Cycling World Championships, Tomoyuki Kawabata became the first Japanese man to win a keirin medal for a quarter of a century. Yuta Wakimoto won keirin gold at a World Cup meet last year \u2013 Japan\u2019s first in the men\u2019s event since 2003. Nitta, Tomohiro Fukaya and Yoshitaku Nagasako won the men\u2019s team sprint title at the Brisbane leg of the World Cup this month, with Yumi Kajiwara taking gold in the women\u2019s omnium in Hong Kong.</p> <p>The world\u2019s first keirin race was held in the south-western city of Kokura \u2013 present-day Kitakyushu \u2013 three years after the end of the second world war. The city\u2019s mayor had cobbled together the funds to build a dirt-covered track he hoped would offer a distraction for the city\u2019s war-weary residents \u2013 particularly local men who had only recently swapped their military uniforms for overalls \u2013 and raise cash for Kokura\u2019s reconstruction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c14cb3647983ff1f54d61fef5996d682bcd89dd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c14cb3647983ff1f54d61fef5996d682bcd89dd6/0_0_5424_3527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japan\u2019s Tomoyuki Kawabata (third right) in action at the 2018 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Apeldoorn, where he won a silver medal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japan\u2019s Tomoyuki Kawabata (third right) in action at the 2018 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Apeldoorn, where he won a silver medal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 50,000 people flocked to the Kokura Velodrome over four days of racing, placing a total of 19.73m yen in bets \u2013 a massive sum at the time. Keirin \u2013 whose two kanji characters can be read as \u201ccompete\u201d and \u201cwheel\u201d \u2013 quickly spread to other towns and cities. But keirin\u2019s early history was blighted by violence, allegations of race fixing, illegal betting arranged by yakuza crime syndicates and growing calls from women\u2019s groups and teachers\u2019 unions to close velodromes and protect children from the curse of gambling addiction.</p> <p>More than 70 years later, keirin continues to occupy an uneasy place in the Japanese sporting firmament because of its association with gambling. The grand prix is one of the few occasions when the sport attracts the attention of terrestrial TV channels, but it has made attempts to modernise in recent years. The women\u2019s event, banned in 1964, was resurrected in 2012 to broaden keirin\u2019s appeal, while a small number of foreign cyclists are invited to compete in Japan every year, including Chris Hoy in the mid 2000s and, this year, Joe Truman, a member of the British track cycling team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b94d93427f02d8229d5a8092ba7ea834d024d5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b94d93427f02d8229d5a8092ba7ea834d024d5c/0_289_4330_2598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Punters watch a race on the betting screens at the Kawasaki Velodrome in 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Punters watch a race on the betting screens at the Kawasaki Velodrome in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>V\u00eatu said he understood the lure of professional keirin, and will be among the spectators at Tachikawa. \u201cI knew about the grand prix before I came to Japan three years ago, but you never get a real feeling for that race \u2013 the electric atmosphere, the craziness \u2013 until you see it for yourself,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019m happy that some members of the team are taking part this year, not for the money, but because they will be putting themselves under a lot of pressure, with spectators yelling at them from the stands.

Japanese professional riders can earn huge sums on the domestic circuit but have failed to turn this into medal-winning performances against their international rivals. The country has won only one keirin Olympic medal \u2013 a bronze for Kiyofumi Nagai in Beijing in 2008. Beno\u00eet V\u00eatu, the head coach of Japan\u2019s track team, is aiming to remedy that in Tokyo next year. \u201cThe main goal for me, and for the riders too, is to be good at the keirin at the Olympics,\u201d V\u00eatu, a former French national team track cyclist, told the Guardian after a training session at Izu Velodrome, the venue for the Olympic cycling events. \u201cI\u2019m always telling the riders: \u2018This is a Japanese event, so you have to bring it back home to to Japan. It\u2019s your property.\u2019 We are working every day for that.\u201d Two of the men on V\u00eatu\u2019s team \u2013 Yudai Nitta and Yuta Wakimoto \u2013 will compete in the grand prix, along with Yuka Kobayashi, who is among the favourites for the women\u2019s title. \u201cThe riders I have on the Olympic team are really pure,\u201d says V\u00eatu. \u201cThey are not doing this for money. In other countries like China an Olympic gold is a route to money, but that doesn\u2019t matter here, because they already have money from professional keirin. Nitta has been dreaming about the Olympics since he was a kid.\u201d International keirin, in which riders follow a pacer bike around a 250m track before sprinting to the finish line, made its Olympic debut at the 2000 Sydney Games. The women\u2019s event appeared 12 years later in London, where Britain\u2019s Victoria Pendleton won gold. Some keirin watchers attribute Japan\u2019s lack of success to differences in the rules between the domestic version and its UCI counterpart. Head-butting and shoulder barging are a feature of the sport in Japan, where riders from the same region collaborate on tracks of up to 500m. But it is the promise of making huge sums of money in Japan that keeps many promising young riders away from the international circuit. Kohei Gunji, who earned 68.5m yen (\u00a3480,000) during the first 11 months of the year, will be in the grand prix lineup for the first time but, like several other elite riders, has no Olympic ambitions. \u201cThere are riders I know who are taking time away from professional keirin to prepare for the Olympics,\u201d Gunji said in an interview last year. \u201cI\u2019ll be cheering them on, but it\u2019s not for me.\u201d However under the guidance of V\u00eatu and his assistant, the former Australian track cyclist Jason Niblett, Japan\u2019s athletes are making their presence felt on the international track. At last year\u2019s Track Cycling World Championships, Tomoyuki Kawabata became the first Japanese man to win a keirin medal for a quarter of a century. Yuta Wakimoto won keirin gold at a World Cup meet last year \u2013 Japan\u2019s first in the men\u2019s event since 2003. Nitta, Tomohiro Fukaya and Yoshitaku Nagasako won the men\u2019s team sprint title at the Brisbane leg of the World Cup this month, with Yumi Kajiwara taking gold in the women\u2019s omnium in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s first keirin race was held in the south-western city of Kokura \u2013 present-day Kitakyushu \u2013 three years after the end of the second world war. The city\u2019s mayor had cobbled together the funds to build a dirt-covered track he hoped would offer a distraction for the city\u2019s war-weary residents \u2013 particularly local men who had only recently swapped their military uniforms for overalls \u2013 and raise cash for Kokura\u2019s reconstruction. More than 50,000 people flocked to the Kokura Velodrome over four days of racing, placing a total of 19.73m yen in bets \u2013 a massive sum at the time. Keirin \u2013 whose two kanji characters can be read as \u201ccompete\u201d and \u201cwheel\u201d \u2013 quickly spread to other towns and cities. But keirin\u2019s early history was blighted by violence, allegations of race fixing, illegal betting arranged by yakuza crime syndicates and growing calls from women\u2019s groups and teachers\u2019 unions to close velodromes and protect children from the curse of gambling addiction. More than 70 years later, keirin continues to occupy an uneasy place in the Japanese sporting firmament because of its association with gambling. The grand prix is one of the few occasions when the sport attracts the attention of terrestrial TV channels, but it has made attempts to modernise in recent years. The women\u2019s event, banned in 1964, was resurrected in 2012 to broaden keirin\u2019s appeal, while a small number of foreign cyclists are invited to compete in Japan every year, including Chris Hoy in the mid 2000s and, this year, Joe Truman, a member of the British track cycling team. V\u00eatu said he understood the lure of professional keirin, and will be among the spectators at Tachikawa. \u201cI knew about the grand prix before I came to Japan three years ago, but you never get a real feeling for that race \u2013 the electric atmosphere, the craziness \u2013 until you see it for yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m happy that some members of the team are taking part this year, not for the money, but because they will be putting themselves under a lot of pressure, with spectators yelling at them from the stands. You can\u2019t get better preparation for the Olympics than that.\u201d Justin McCurry\u2019s book, War on Wheels: Inside Keirin and Japan\u2019s Cycling Subculture, will be published in June 2020 by Pursuit Books.",

Earlier this year, the victims commissioner for England and Wales, Helen Newlove, highlighted the need for greater action on the \u201cliving nightmare\u201d of antisocial behaviour for some people, with street drinking and gathering in groups the most frequent causes of problems. The Guardian gathered information from nearly 100 of the largest English councils, which showed their use of the orders has spread from the most common concerns of preventing public drunkenness and ensuring dog walkers clean up after their pets. Parks in Richmond in London operate under a web of 26 banning orders relating to feeding animals, riding bicycles, tricycles, scooters and skateboards in a way that causes annoyance, putting golf balls and being \u201clewd\u201d. In Hackney, uprooting trees is banned, while both planting and removing them are prohibited in Richmond\u2019s parks.

Fireworks and Chinese lanterns are also banned. The Manifesto Club said free expression and association were being \u201csignificantly restricted\u201d. It added as part of a report calling on councils to drop such bans: \u201cNearly 20% of councils have introduced a legal restriction upon free expression or association.\u201d Tower Hamlets bans groups of two or more people from gathering in one area, unless they are couples, keep-fit groups, dog walkers, sports teams or community groups.

Powerful corporations are fighting to protect the use of these profitable chemical compounds, Bilott says, and US regulators are doing next to nothing to stop them.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth listening to what Bilott has to say. He has spent the last two decades <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html\">advocating</a> for people in West Virginia and Ohio whose water was contaminated with one of these toxins, a chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA.</p> <p>Bilott achieved a class-action settlement with DuPont in 2004, part of which paid for a six-year health study. That study found links between PFOA and high cholesterol, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, high blood pressure, pregnancy-induced hypertension and thyroid disease. In a follow-up case in 2017, Bilott achieved a multimillion-dollar settlement of thousands of personal injury claims against DuPont. His two decades of work negotiated water filtration and treatment for affected communities, the establishment of a novel scientific panel for human health studies, and the introduction of a medical monitoring program for thousands of people exposed. His work led to DuPont and other manufacturers phasing out the use of PFOA in the US, though similar replacement chemicals have prompted fresh concerns.</p> <p>Bilott\u2019s battle against DuPont, documented in a <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Exposure/Robert-Bilott/9781501172816\">memoir</a>, has been made into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/20/dark-waters-review-mark-ruffalo-v-big-business-in-enraging-drama\">feature film</a> Dark Waters, released to theaters across the country this month. Starring Mark Ruffalo, Dark Waters tells of Bilott\u2019s journey from a chemical industry defense attorney to a plaintiffs\u2019 champion who <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-01-18-0501180271-story.html\">uncovered evidence</a> that DuPont knowingly hid the dangers of PFOA, even as its manufacturing facility near Parkersburg, West Virginia, was spilling the toxin across the landscape.</p> <p>DuPont\u2019s own lawyers and scientists raised concerns about the local community\u2019s exposure to PFOA, Bilott told me. \u201cUnfortunately what we saw was decisions made for business purposes to continue using the chemical, releasing it, and exposing people to it,\u201d Bilott says.</p> <p>(\u201cSafety, health and protecting the planet are core values at DuPont,\u201d the company told me in an email. \u201cWe are \u2013 and have always been \u2013 committed to upholding the highest standards for the wellbeing of our employees, our customers and the communities in which we operate.\u201d)</p> <p>Despite his legal victories and newfound fame, Bilott believes there is much more to be done. He is currently pursuing <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4956490-Hardwick-Complaint.html\">a new lawsuit</a> against chemical manufacturers 3M, DuPont and <a href=\"https://www.chemours.com/en/About%20Chemours\">DuPont spinoff Chemours</a>. The action is seeking class-action status on behalf of everyone living in the United States who has been exposed to not only PFOA but related compounds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/pfas-everyday-products-toxics-guide\">known as PFAS</a>, short for \u201cper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.\u201d</p> <p>Bilott says scientific research shows that PFAS chemicals <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pfas/basic-information-pfas\">accumulate in the human body</a> and in the environment, creating a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d in anyone exposed. He asserts that the companies \u201cmaliciously conspired\u201d to conceal the dangers of PFAS while contaminating the bodies of people around the country.</p> <p>As is the case with PFOA, studies link PFAS exposure to a range of human health problems, including <a href=\"https://pfasproject.com/2019/06/28/impacts-of-pfas-chemicals-on-immune-system-highlighted/\">a suppression of the human immune system</a>, liver dysfunction, and adverse birth outcomes. The chemicals have been used since the 1940s in a range of products such as non-stick cookware, stain-repellents, food packaging, firefighting foam and other products.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a unique health threat in the sense of its scope and magnitude,\u201d Bilott says. \u201cAs for PFOA, we\u2019re talking about a chemical that has managed to find its way into the blood of almost everything on the planet <a href=\"https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/pfc/index.cfm\">and almost every person</a> in the United States and is linked with <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects.html\">multiple potential adverse health</a> effects. \u201cIt is extremely unlikely to ever break down without us going out there and physically finding a way to get rid of it.\u201d</p> <p>Bilott is taking an unusual approach in the new litigation, which is pending in a federal court in Ohio. He is not asking for money damages for individuals, but rather for the establishment of an independent scientific panel to study and confirm the health effects of PFAS exposures so that people can be informed about the risks they face.</p> <p>Notably, he is insisting that the companies making the chemicals pay for the independent scientific work, not US taxpayers. The companies have denied liability and sought unsuccessfully to have the complaint dismissed.</p> <p>Separately, Bilott has also pushed the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) into action. After Bilott threated to sue ATSDR for failing to look at PFAS exposures, the agency said it would start collecting data from at least eight sites around the United States.</p> <p>Bilott fears limited funding will not allow for the necessary scope, however. And the companies \u201cought to be paying\u201d, not taxpayers, he argues.</p> <p>Thanks in part to his work, and to journalists, scientists and activists who have brought attention to the PFAS problem, action to protect public health is spreading. Last year United Nations experts called for <a href=\"https://pfasproject.com/2018/10/14/un-expert-committee-recommends-global-action-on-three-pfass/\">the phasing out</a> of certain PFAS. And this week environmental officials in Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/12/19/pfas-chemicals-europe-phase-out/\">announced a plan</a> to restrict all PFAS compounds and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6586418-EU-Strategy-for-PFASs-FINAL-VERSION-December-19.html\">phase out</a> most uses by 2030.</p> <p>Bilott is heartened at the progress but frustrated it has taken so long. He finds the lack of regulatory action by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) particularly infuriating.</p> <p>\u201cWe notified the EPA 18 years ago that PFOA in drinking water presented a public health threat, and in 2019 there are <em>still</em> no federal regulatory limits,\u201d Bilott told me. \u201cIf [affected] communities had been forced to sit back and wait for action they\u2019d still be exposed every day. They would have no relief whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>DuPont and manufacturing industry voices have sought to discredit Bilott and the Dark Waters film. The Ohio Manufacturers\u2019 Association, which has included DuPont executives among its leadership team in recent years, <a href=\"https://truthaboutdarkwaters.com/about/\">claims</a>, in a website created specifically to discredit Dark Waters, that \u201cactivists\u201d are \u201ccherry-picking\u201d information in an effort to \u201cdeceive the public, threaten our jobs, and destroy our way of life\u201d.</p> <p>This smear is only one small part of an ongoing effort to limit class-action environmental lawsuits, which are often the last line of defense for consumers.

Now they\u2019re home, the brothers are recovering well. Ayyub likes cricket and Mahmud has gone back to playing football: he also likes art and has just been made a class prefect. Ayyub is adapting to his new English-language school: his form teacher loves him and says his grasp of the language is improving. The boys adore their half-sister, Baiyyeenah, five, who had only just been born when they were taken to Syria, as well as their 12-year-old stepbrother, Siddiq and all four regularly crowd around their mother while she reads a story or they look at a tablet screen to obsess over Roblox online video games. Perkins-Ferreira herself has recently completed a college diploma and is about to open her own physical therapy business. She is aware of how lucky her family is to be reunited. \u201cBringing the boys back was overwhelming ,\u201d she said in a recent phone call from the family home in Petit Valley, a suburb of Port of Spain. \u201cI thank God for them every day and pray for the families who are still stuck there.\u201d The Ferreiras\u2019 happiness after years spent apart and filled with danger and uncertainty throws into sharp relief the fate of the 7,000 foreign children of Isis fighters still languishing in Kurdish-run camps in Syria. Since Mahmud and Ayyub were rescued earlier this year, the so-called caliphate has fallen, leading to an exodus of around 60,000 women and children who were unwilling or unable to leave the last slivers of the jihadists\u2019 territory. Almost all of them are now being held at the infamous al-Hawl camp, where a lack of adequate shelter, healthcare and educational facilities as well as the persistence of Isis\u2019s toxic ideology has created what Kurdish officials and foreign diplomats describe as a \u201ctimebomb waiting to go off\u201d. At least 409 children have died since arriving at the camp, mostly as a result of malnutrition and disease. Now winter has set in again there are fears of hypothermia for infants, and residents are forced to dig up the mud or frozen ground to keep food and any important belongings from rats. The camp\u2019s radical core cannot be controlled by the outnumbered guards, making murders and beatings increasingly commonplace. Among the residents are 25 Trinidadian women and 71 children whom the government has so far refused to help: Mahmud and Ayyub are the only documented Trinidadian children to escape Syria to date. While Trinidad is guilty of dragging its feet on repatriation, the tiny country is following the example of states with far more resources and international muscle that have also refused to address the issue, such as the UK. Only three British orphans have been returned home from Syria so far out of an estimated 60 UK national children trapped there. Those not as lucky as Mahmud and Ayyub are living on borrowed time. In October, Turkey made good on a long-standing threat to attack Kurdish-led forces in Syria that Ankara views as terrorists, plummeting the area into fresh chaos and jeopardising the fragile status quo at al Hawl. On the border, intermittent fighting continues despite a nominal Russian-brokered ceasefire. Her children have come home but Perkins-Ferreira is helping other affected families lobby the Trinidadian government and offering support and advice for families across the world. She talks frankly about the difficulties she has faced since the boys returned, including fighting off attempts by the state to take them into care. Watching her sons cry for their father, her ex-husband Abebe Oboi Ferreira, has been particularly painful. He has been missing since the Isis-held city of Raqqa fell in 2017, which is when the boys ended up in Kurdish custody after being found on the side of a road. All the same, she says, they have a real future now. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of love in this house and room for them to grow up. When he built this house my current husband made sure there were two extra bedrooms for Mahmud and Ayyub. He always said they\u2019d come back. We are so lucky.\u201d",

He said the London study showed that microplastic deposition did not depend on the strength or direction of the wind, suggesting the city itself was the most likely source. Melanie Bergmann, at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany, said more research on the potential health effects of microplastic pollution was very important. \u201cWe do not currently know what proportion of inhaled microplastics actually penetrates the deep lung,\u201d she said. The European commission\u2019s chief scientific advisers said in a report in April: \u201cThe evidence [on the environmental and health risks of microplastics] provides grounds for genuine concern and for precaution to be exercised.\u201d Microplastics are also found in drinking water and in August an assessment by the World Health Organization found no evidence to date of harm but said more research was needed. Cutting microplastic pollution requires changing how plastic is used and disposed of, said Wright: \u201cYou can\u2019t clean it up, so it is about stopping it at source.\u201d Allen said: \u201cThis is not a problem that is going to go away anytime soon.\u201d",

The change to the method of evaluating the economic benefits of spending, which the Treasury is expected to make before the spring budget, was welcomed by the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, the government\u2019s economic cheerleader and coordinator for the north. Government investment decisions are currently based on gross value added, a metric that assesses the net financial contribution of spending to the economy. Critics have long argued it is a blunt measurement system that overrewards concentrations of businesses and people, as it deems them to be more efficient, and thus penalises regions away from London and the south-east. According to the Times, which initially reported the policy change, the new rules would introduce metrics to determine spending, such as improving the wellbeing of people in certain areas, or reducing regional productivity gaps. Jim O\u2019Neill, the economist and crossbench peer who is the Northern Powerhouse Partnership\u2019s vice-chair, said \u201cthe static, accounting-based approach of value for money in assessing investment projects does not make any sense\u201d. He added: \u201cBy definition, it adds to the attraction of projects in heavily populated, economically vibrant areas \u2013 usually London \u2013 and doesn\u2019t allow for potential major productivity-enhancing projects elsewhere, including many in the north, and especially Northern Powerhouse Rail. \u201cI truly welcome a change to this approach, and hope it is for real. It would be a huge boost for many investments across the country, as well as throughout the \u2018northern powerhouse\u2019.\u201d A Treasury spokeswoman said: \u201cWe work across government to ensure investment is focused on where it is needed across the UK and delivers value for money for the taxpayer.\u201d Changing the investment rules would be part of a wider attempt by Boris Johnson\u2019s government to shore up its support in the Midlands and the north, where the Conservatives won a series of key seats in the general election. During the campaign, Johnson promised increased investment in transport infrastructure, as well as areas such as the NHS, education and policing, after almost 10 years of cuts. During the election campaign, Labour argued strongly for a change in approach, with investment to alleviate regional economic discrepancies and part of the Treasury moved to the north to oversee more devolved spending decisions.",

I burnt out, got better and tried to chill out. But craving distraction remains a problem. These days, I am unable to confront even natural breaks in the working day without preplanned diversions. A walk from one meeting to the next has to be filled with a playlist or podcast. I have had to start keeping my phone in the boot of my car to stop me checking my emails at the lights.</p> <p>I have always found the late December void we are currently enduring to be discombobulating and stressful. I\u2019m neither at work nor am I on holiday. I am supposed to just relax and do nothing. It sounds nice in theory, but by midday on 28 December, usually while watching Mrs Doubtfire on Channel 5, I tend to slip into an existential crisis. When my wife and kids are out of the house, and I have no pressing work deadlines, I become anxious: the nagging thought that I really should be doing something productive but can\u2019t think what, the pressure to absorb myself in something genuinely relaxing. I start half-watching a documentary about veganism on Netflix, while idly scrolling Twitter on my phone and, with my other hand, inexplicably researching the 1980s band DeBarge on Wikipedia on my laptop. Eventually, I go upstairs to lie silently on my bed, having a small panic attack.</p> <p>This is a real thing, a condition recognised by psychiatrists as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/dec/21/oliver-burkeman-the-perfect-christmas\" title=\"\">relaxation-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/dec/21/oliver-burkeman-the-perfect-christmas\" title=\"\">induced </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/dec/21/oliver-burkeman-the-perfect-christmas\" title=\"\">anxiety</a>.

In Wilson\u2019s study, people were encouraged to turn their minds to friends and family rather than boring, practical stuff like scheduling.</p> <p>I am in a hotel room, alone, on a work trip. I am sitting on the bed, writing emails. I have an hour before my next appointment, so I run a bath. I\u2019m usually more of a shower person, but baths seem to be a big part of the relaxation industry. As I lower myself into the warm water, I remember to breathe slowly and deeply. Breathing is part of the relaxation industry, too. I try to clear my mind but it is, of course, impossible. The more silence and stillness in a room, the more scope my brain has to flit about, searching for things to worry about: I have some invoices to submit; I need to catch a 6am train the next morning and book a taxi to get me to the station in time; I am behind on several deadlines (including for this article \u2013 it\u2019s hard to find the time to write about doing nothing when you are tied up with trying to do nothing). Thinking about family is stressful. I miss my wife and kids. Other relatives have done various things to irritate me. I get out of the bath. Baths take ages. Now I am worried about being late for my appointment. I am no good at taking thought breaks.</p> <p>Why can\u2019t I focus? I call Guy Burgs, founder and chief tutor at the <a href=\"https://theartofmeditation.org/\" title=\"\">Art Of Meditation</a>, which organises silent retreats in the UK, and tell him about my struggle. \u201cWhen we have nothing to do, all we are left with is how we feel,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo we distract ourselves from our unsettled feeling. At some point, we need to learn how to be at peace with those feelings, and we can\u2019t do that if we keep consuming all the time. I use the water analogy. It won\u2019t reach a calm state if you keep throwing things into it.\u201d</p> <p> I search \u201chow to do nothing\u201d on Google. I find an author called Jenny Odell, who actually wrote a book called <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-do-nothing-9781612197494.html\" title=\"\">How </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-do-nothing-9781612197494.html\" title=\"\">To Do Nothing: Resisting </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-do-nothing-9781612197494.html\" title=\"\">The Attention Economy</a>. I call her up in Oakland, California. \u201cWe are obsessed with being goal-orientated. I suggest doing things that are not goals-driven or results-based,\u201d she says. Odell is a bird-watcher. She took it up as a hobby to help rest her mind. \u201cPeople become too streamlined in what they pay attention to,\u201d she says. \u201cChanging your perspective can give your mind a break.\u201d</p> <p>I am strongly attracted to this idea. In winter, robins often land in my back garden. I watch them from the window when I am waiting for the kettle to boil, first thing in the morning. I wonder what they\u2019re up to; what\u2019s their agenda for the day? Odell is right: it\u2019s restful to switch perspective in this way. But can I do it to order? It is easy when my mind is only half operational, and the rest of the family are still waking up. It is harder when you have to press pause on your day and start actively searching for a passing robin.</p> <p>I shut my laptop and stand at the back window, examining the tree tops for flapping wings, like a predatory cat. Five minutes pass. No robins. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about bird-watching, you have no control over it,\u201d Odell warns. \u201cLearning how to release control over a situation is really important.\u201d I become annoyed with the local bird community. They are too unreliable.</p> <p>Perhaps a more radical approach is required. Burgs tells me his silent retreats and meditation courses are a form of aversion therapy, whereby people can confront their fear of doing nothing until it eventually dissipates.</p> <p>\u201cDoing nothing won\u2019t be comfortable at first, however you try,\u201d he says. \u201cYou must deliberately put the time aside to do nothing, and have the discipline to get through it, even when it is boring or creates anxiety. You have to sweat it out and gnash your teeth doing nothing for a while, until you learn to cope. The only person you have to live with 24/7 is yourself, so you might as well learn how to do it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I realise that what I really need is a way of doing nothing that won\u2019t disrupt my busy schedule too much</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I am a self-employed dad, and I can\u2019t really justify disappearing to Wales to sit in silence for a week.

This is not quite SAS interrogation training, but it\u2019s close enough: my carriage is packed, my seat is uncomfortable, I am engulfed by a cacophony of other people\u2019s chat, and the air is filled with the smell of fast food and lager. I leave my laptop in my bag, switch off my phone, close my eyes and try to disappear to my happier place.</p> <p>I have had this place since I was about nine years old. It is an alternate footballing universe where my imaginary team, AFC Thameside, have all the best players and pretty much always win. There are other clubs, too, each of them created meticulously over the past three-and-a-half decades during idle moments just like this one. Until recently, I was too embarrassed to talk about it. Now I realise it is more than just a childish fantasy I failed to ditch in adulthood: it is a sophisticated and powerful psychological tool. It certainly helps me through my train journey (I fall asleep for the last hour, which is sort of cheating, but still). When I arrive at Thirsk, there is a pleasant lightness to my mood. My mind is clear and I feel refreshed (Thameside beat local rivals City of London FC in a 4-3 thriller, in case you\u2019re interested).</p> <p>Later, on the phone, I explain all of this to Wilson at the University of Virginia.

Eventually, he says: \u201cI think you\u2019re on to something. Jerome L Singer is considered the godfather of daydreaming research.

He pined for mainstream acceptance, but stayed stuck stubbornly left of the dial. With an indomitable spirit, he whirred through the worlds of comedy, film and music, able to conjure good fortune for those around him, if not always for himself.

It was through Ivers and his long-term partner, Lucy Fisher, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/davidlynch\">David Lynch\u2019s work</a> was introduced to Mel Brooks and Francis Ford Coppola. Ivers\u2019 closest friend was Doug Kenney, the founder of National Lampoon magazine; in the early 80s, the Lampoon star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/11/tragic-legacy-john-belushi-actor-died-overdose\">John Belushi</a> was an avid viewer of Ivers\u2019 anarchic cable TV music show New Wave Theatre, taking cues from the confrontational humour and sense of punky chaos.

It was always about having an encounter, as opposed to gliding through life unaware.\u201d</p> <p>He was, as his collaborator Paul Lenart echoes, \u201cthis thrilling individual, and absolutely fearless. He didn\u2019t give a shit. He was just going to go and be who he wanted to be.\u201d During one meeting with the Warner Brothers bigwig Mo Ostin, Ivers leapt atop a table and broke into a mean harmonica solo, waggling his hips in the executive\u2019s face. He was able to secure record deals, but not make good on them.</p> <p>Ivers met Fisher at Harvard; he was a few years her senior and already known about campus as a raffish character. They moved to LA and settled in the hippie-friendly Laurel Canyon, scraping together $250 a month for rent. \u201cIt was a fairytale land for us,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cMusic literally bounced across the canyon all the time.\u201d Ivers responded in turn, cranking out tunes day and night. He would even pack an electric piano for the beach, just in case inspiration struck. Their apartment welcomed a rotation of friends and collaborators. Kenney was so fond of Ivers and Fisher that he crashed out with them for months while struggling under the weight of National Lampoon. The trio would take trips to Disneyland to get his spirits up.</p> <p>The single most important drop-in was Lynch. Lynch and Ivers first connected at the American Film Institute in LA in 1971. In 1976, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/22/david-lynch-eraserhead\">at the end of a five-year gestation period for Eraserhead</a>, Lynch and the sound man Alan Splet knocked on Ivers\u2019 door. They arrived with a sketch of a song and a secondhand recording of the organist Fats Waller. \u201cWe only had these quarter-inch tapes of Waller\u2019s that Alan had got ahold of,\u201d says Lynch. \u201cAs we were explaining to Peter the feel of this 1936 pipe organ, he walked over to his shelf and pulled out the exact album that we had been hunting down for years. We knew we had come to the right place.\u201d</p> <p>Ivers grasped what was needed to complement the tone of the groundbreaking film. When Lynch returned a few days later, \u201cPeter laid down on his bed, put on headphones, picked up a microphone and, in this falsetto voice, he sang exactly what is in the film\u201d. Sung on screen by a ghostly apparition, In Heaven \u2013 which had the suffix \u201c(Lady in the Radiator Song)\u201d added over time for emphasis \u2013 was unnerving and enchanting. At 98 seconds long and with only 14 unique words, it was simple enough to be scrawled down quickly. And so it transpired: in 1977, when a group of eager Eraserheads from Ohio named Devo asked Lynch to grant them rights to perform the song live, all Ivers had to do was scrawl the chords and lyrics on a napkin, while Lynch sat slurping a chocolate milkshake.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLaGyXHkQEM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wLaGyXHkQEM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>\u2018Unnerving and enchanting\u2019 ...

I guess a part of me continued to feel like the small girl who slipped secretively under the table, still laden with Sunday lunch, to climb up on your knee. I always feared someone else would get there first. And I was in a rush to reach you. Some people are peaceful to be near, and that\u2019s how I found you.</p> <p>The journey under the table wasn\u2019t far \u2013 I was wise enough to arrange the chairs favourably \u2013 but it felt to me like a journey to a different land. At some point in adulthood, I came to understand that this land was Italy. If these things were measured purely in blood, well, you were no more Italian than your siblings \u2013 my dad, and my other wonderful uncle and aunt. But you, more than anyone, seemed to have one foot in Italy. As a bachelor, you continued to live in Villa Latina \u2013 not a villa, of course, but a small terrace house in Worthing, which your parents, when they settled here, named after your late father\u2019s village. It seemed like a piece of Italy to me, and not just because of its exotically turquoise bathroom suite.</p> <p>Being the eldest living sibling, you knew more about the Italian branches of the family than anyone else. You mourned the loss of the old family ice-cream recipe: there lay a secret and perhaps a treasure chest of vanilla-flavoured gold. Flush with the cash from your nocturnal fishing trips, you invested in Linguaphone cassettes to learn Italian; my grandparents hadn\u2019t taught you, wanting you to grow up English. But you were my Italian uncle, and when I sat on your knee our family background came to the fore. I could feel Italy at my shoulders.</p> <p>As a teenager, I taught myself Italian and since progress with the old Linguaphone tapes was slow, I overtook you. I resolved to live in Italy one day, and when I did, you came to visit me. We went together to find the real Villa Latina and to root out anyone we could find who shared our surname. Outside the village we stumbled upon a sign to via Fontana Cocozza and I have the photo, right here, of you pointing up at it with your stick. We never did find the fountain, but that\u2019s Italian road signs for you. In any case, by then your knee was playing up; getting around was beginning to be tricky.</p> <p>Well, Uncle Ron, I\u2019m so grateful to you for the way you brought Italy close to hand. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have found my way there without you. And at least when life got tough for you at the end, we had our Italian memories to share. I took the photo of you by the sign to show you in hospital; that gave us a chuckle. I\u2019m grateful to have had a chance that day to tell you all this, and to thank you in person, while there was still time. It would be too late now.

      "body": "<p>When I interviewed him in 2008, Juli\u00e1n Leyzaola P\u00e9rez strutted with a military gait. As he should: a former lieutenant colonel in the Mexican army, he had been summoned to command the police force, then head public security in Tijuana, at the time Mexico\u2019s second-most dangerous city. We met on his first day in the job.</p> <p>But now, he arrives in a wheelchair to talk.</p> <p>Leyzaola \u2013 one of the most remarkable, imposing and controversial figures to emerge from Mexico\u2019s cartel carnage \u2013 wielded office with famous (some say infamous) ruthlessness and efficacy, driving down murder rates in Tijuana, then Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. But in 2015 came the payback: while with his wife and son in Ju\u00e1rez, Leyzaola was ambushed by a hit squad, took two bullets as he shielded his child, and has since been paralysed from the waist down.</p> <p>After the attack, Leyzaola has twice run for election as mayor of Tijuana, and was twice narrowly defeated \u2013 for the second time this summer. Tijuana \u2013 after a period of relative calm \u2013 is now the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-mexico-tijuana-violence-20190314-story.html\">murder capital of the world</a>, with a terrifying 2,518 homicides last year, and on course to beat that in 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd1cc1fdd109d1192733657814726fc3a3b55dc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd1cc1fdd109d1192733657814726fc3a3b55dc4/0_92_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juli\u00e1n Leyzaola P\u00e9rez, center, walks past the body of a top municipal police officer in Ciudad Juarez.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juli\u00e1n Leyzaola P\u00e9rez, center, walks past the body of a top municipal police officer in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymundo Ruiz/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We meet at a favourite restaurant of his beside the Pacific shore, for coffee and <em>pan dulce</em>, the ocean beyond the window under a leaden sky. Col Leyzaola is wheeled in by a man with the erect spine of a soldier, and is palpably furious at his immobility.</p> <p>\u201cMy mission has not changed,\u201d he says. \u201cTo fight organised crime until it is broken. This is not a strategy that can be implemented from behind a desk. It has to be done on the street and that is where I intend to be, even now.\u201d</p> <p>Back in 2008, Leyzaola was everywhere to be seen around Tijuana. Whenever there was a shootout or bodies dumped \u2013 and there were plenty \u2013 there he was, surveying the crime scene, consulting his officers and addressing the press \u2013 prowling the beat.</p> <p>Back then, Leyzaola used the term \u201csocial terrorism\u201d to describe cartels. \u201cWhat I can do is increase a police profile to avert the social psychosis the narcos want to generate,\u201d he told me back then, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/07/mexico-war-drugs-dead\">stressing</a> they needed \u201cphysical presence to reassure people, and intelligence to fight the criminals themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Leyzaola was so successful in reducing homicides, the federal government transferred him to do the same in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, then Mexico\u2019s and the world\u2019s homicide capital \u2013 which he did.</p> <p>When Leyzaola took over public security in Tijuana, the murder rate had just begun to rise from a stable average of around 250 per year to a sudden record of 1,250 in 2008. This was due to an assault on the border drug-smuggling \u201cplaza\u201d by the Sinaloa cartel of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n against the local Arellano F\u00e9lix Organisation (AFO), for control of routes into California.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e750aadf9fde9d1679a15937798218100c7f85a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e750aadf9fde9d1679a15937798218100c7f85a9/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A burning bus, set alight by cartel gunmen to block a road, is pictured during clashes with federal forces following the detention of Ovidio Guzman, son of drug kingpin Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A burning bus, set alight by cartel gunmen, during clashes with federal forces following the detention of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, son of \u2018El Chapo\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two of the AFO\u2019s lieutenants defected to Guzm\u00e1n to lead a bloody war of attrition: Teodoro \u201cEl Teo\u201d Garc\u00eda Simental and his henchman Santiago Meza L\u00f3pez, \u201cEl Pozolero\u201d, named after pork soup because he dissolved hundreds of his victims in acid. </p> <p>Leyzaola says now: \u201cI studied the criminal groups \u2013 their own rules, language, even religion [Sant\u00edsima Muerte, most holy death] \u2013 their cult of excessive violence, how they penetrate society. And I devised a strategy with the then mayor to neutralise them, and recover the city.\u201d At first, this meant coordinating branches of law enforcement at odds with one another. In mayor Jorge Ramos Hern\u00e1ndez, Leyzaola found a rare political ally against corruption.</p> <p>With the Arellano F\u00e9lix syndicate in decline, \u201cmy real war was against the Sinaloa cartel\u201d, recalls Leyzaola. \u201cThey offered me money\u201d \u2013 reportedly $80,000 a week \u2013 \u201cas they had done to my predecessors, but I refused, for which they tried to kill me five times\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>After the third attempt on his life, Leyzaola moved his family across the border to San Diego, and took up residence in a military base. He brought in military officers with limited police experience to lock down zones in the city, barrio by barrio. \u201cEl Pozolero\u201d was arrested in 2009, and \u201cEl Teo\u201d a year later.</p> <p>By the end of 2010, homicides in Tijuana had halved. There are two explanations: one, that the Sinaloa cartel won the war and established a \u201cpax mafiosa\u201d in town. The other, that Leyzaola applied a <em>mano f\u00e9rrea</em> \u2013 iron hand \u2013 with such force that it worked. An exhaustive report by a trans-border team of academics working under the umbrella <a href=\"https://justiceinmexico.org/\">Justice in Mexico</a>, allows for both.</p> <p>But Leyzaola waged another war: against many of his own officers. Mayor Ramos\u2019s predecessor, Jorge Hank Rhon, who owns a betting empire and the Tijuana Xolos football team, had undertaken a recruitment drive into the city\u2019s police, which the Justice in Mexico report says \u201cenabled large numbers of corrupt officers to join the city\u2019s roughly 2,000-member police force\u201d.</p> <p>In Mexico, police forces are infamously contaminated, either willingly or after offers from the cartels, payment for services rendered, or death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"124692428ea39a38d6c747b418db71524cfaf886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/124692428ea39a38d6c747b418db71524cfaf886/0_0_5432_3262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Leyzaola speaks with his police officers in Tijuana, Mexico in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juli\u00e1n Leyzaola speaks with his police officers in Tijuana, Mexico, in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guillermo Arias/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Against these corrupt officers, Leyzaola was ruthless. \u201cIt was my other war\u201d, he says.

He took a call from a former police officer in Ju\u00e1rez, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Acosta, by now working for the Sinaloa cartel, saying: \u201cThis is Diego, I am at your service\u201d \u2013 suggesting that the new chief and cartel work in tandem.

To take back the city <em>colonia</em> by <em>colonia.</em>\u201d</p> <p>But, as in Tijuana, that was not all. Leyzaola speaks like no one of his ilk about corrupt Mexican law enforcement operating as a crime syndicate. \u201cWhen I arrived\u201d, he recalls, \u201cI set myself against two cartels: the Ju\u00e1rez and Sinaloa cartels. Then I realised there was a third cartel: the federal police cartel. It had a force of 5,000 officers, moving drugs, running extortion rackets. Just like the criminal cartels, they occupied territory by violence and fear. I confronted all three, head-on.\u201d</p> <p>After three years in office, Leyzaola\u2019s tenure came to an end. Murders in Ju\u00e1rez had plunged from 1,926 in 2011 to 514 in 2013.

      "bodyText": "When I interviewed him in 2008, Juli\u00e1n Leyzaola P\u00e9rez strutted with a military gait. As he should: a former lieutenant colonel in the Mexican army, he had been summoned to command the police force, then head public security in Tijuana, at the time Mexico\u2019s second-most dangerous city. We met on his first day in the job. But now, he arrives in a wheelchair to talk. Leyzaola \u2013 one of the most remarkable, imposing and controversial figures to emerge from Mexico\u2019s cartel carnage \u2013 wielded office with famous (some say infamous) ruthlessness and efficacy, driving down murder rates in Tijuana, then Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. But in 2015 came the payback: while with his wife and son in Ju\u00e1rez, Leyzaola was ambushed by a hit squad, took two bullets as he shielded his child, and has since been paralysed from the waist down. After the attack, Leyzaola has twice run for election as mayor of Tijuana, and was twice narrowly defeated \u2013 for the second time this summer. Tijuana \u2013 after a period of relative calm \u2013 is now the murder capital of the world, with a terrifying 2,518 homicides last year, and on course to beat that in 2019. We meet at a favourite restaurant of his beside the Pacific shore, for coffee and pan dulce, the ocean beyond the window under a leaden sky. Col Leyzaola is wheeled in by a man with the erect spine of a soldier, and is palpably furious at his immobility. \u201cMy mission has not changed,\u201d he says. \u201cTo fight organised crime until it is broken. This is not a strategy that can be implemented from behind a desk. It has to be done on the street and that is where I intend to be, even now.\u201d Back in 2008, Leyzaola was everywhere to be seen around Tijuana. Whenever there was a shootout or bodies dumped \u2013 and there were plenty \u2013 there he was, surveying the crime scene, consulting his officers and addressing the press \u2013 prowling the beat. Back then, Leyzaola used the term \u201csocial terrorism\u201d to describe cartels. \u201cWhat I can do is increase a police profile to avert the social psychosis the narcos want to generate,\u201d he told me back then, stressing they needed \u201cphysical presence to reassure people, and intelligence to fight the criminals themselves\u201d. Leyzaola was so successful in reducing homicides, the federal government transferred him to do the same in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, then Mexico\u2019s and the world\u2019s homicide capital \u2013 which he did. When Leyzaola took over public security in Tijuana, the murder rate had just begun to rise from a stable average of around 250 per year to a sudden record of 1,250 in 2008. This was due to an assault on the border drug-smuggling \u201cplaza\u201d by the Sinaloa cartel of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n against the local Arellano F\u00e9lix Organisation (AFO), for control of routes into California. Two of the AFO\u2019s lieutenants defected to Guzm\u00e1n to lead a bloody war of attrition: Teodoro \u201cEl Teo\u201d Garc\u00eda Simental and his henchman Santiago Meza L\u00f3pez, \u201cEl Pozolero\u201d, named after pork soup because he dissolved hundreds of his victims in acid. Leyzaola says now: \u201cI studied the criminal groups \u2013 their own rules, language, even religion [Sant\u00edsima Muerte, most holy death] \u2013 their cult of excessive violence, how they penetrate society. And I devised a strategy with the then mayor to neutralise them, and recover the city.\u201d At first, this meant coordinating branches of law enforcement at odds with one another. In mayor Jorge Ramos Hern\u00e1ndez, Leyzaola found a rare political ally against corruption. With the Arellano F\u00e9lix syndicate in decline, \u201cmy real war was against the Sinaloa cartel\u201d, recalls Leyzaola. \u201cThey offered me money\u201d \u2013 reportedly $80,000 a week \u2013 \u201cas they had done to my predecessors, but I refused, for which they tried to kill me five times\u201d. *** After the third attempt on his life, Leyzaola moved his family across the border to San Diego, and took up residence in a military base. He brought in military officers with limited police experience to lock down zones in the city, barrio by barrio. \u201cEl Pozolero\u201d was arrested in 2009, and \u201cEl Teo\u201d a year later. By the end of 2010, homicides in Tijuana had halved. There are two explanations: one, that the Sinaloa cartel won the war and established a \u201cpax mafiosa\u201d in town. The other, that Leyzaola applied a mano f\u00e9rrea \u2013 iron hand \u2013 with such force that it worked. An exhaustive report by a trans-border team of academics working under the umbrella Justice in Mexico, allows for both. But Leyzaola waged another war: against many of his own officers. Mayor Ramos\u2019s predecessor, Jorge Hank Rhon, who owns a betting empire and the Tijuana Xolos football team, had undertaken a recruitment drive into the city\u2019s police, which the Justice in Mexico report says \u201cenabled large numbers of corrupt officers to join the city\u2019s roughly 2,000-member police force\u201d. In Mexico, police forces are infamously contaminated, either willingly or after offers from the cartels, payment for services rendered, or death. Against these corrupt officers, Leyzaola was ruthless. \u201cIt was my other war\u201d, he says. He purged some 600 officers and departmental personnel \u2013 nearly a third of the roll. \u201cI adopted a policy of zero tolerance in applying the law, against no matter who, whether they wore uniform or not,\u201d Leyzaola says. \u201cI undertook to clean the police force of corrupt officers by whatever means were necessary, and I did so. By the end, it was harder for officers to serve the cartel, and harder for the cartel to move around safe houses in this city\u201d. But Leyzaola\u2019s purges provoked allegations of human right abuses, and even of his own presence during the torture of police officers believed to be on the cartel payroll . He was censured by the Baja California Human Rights Commission for a litany of abuses against suspect officers, and in 2014 banned from public office for eight years \u2013 a ruling overturned last year by state magistrates, citing lack of proof. Challenged about allegations that he abused human rights of prisoners and suspect officers, Leyzaola retorts: \u201cThe only way to fight crime is to apply the law. It was these people who violated human rights, why defend them, and not the law?\u201d *** By 2011, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, midway along the border, was murder capital of the world. Leyzaola was duly transferred there and endeavoured to repeat his Tijuana record. But while he had had the backing of Tijuana\u2019s Mayor Ramos, authorities in Chihuahua were unimpressed.

Leyzaola\u2019s retort was erudite: four months later, Acosta was arrested along with a number of his collaborators, among them police officers. Leyzaola mounted \u201cintense harassment patrols block by block, barrio by barrio. To take back the city colonia by colonia.\u201d But, as in Tijuana, that was not all.

      "body": "<p>After the disaster of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/dec/12/uk-general-election-2019-full-results-live-labour-conservatives-tories\" title=\"\">general election</a>, Labour figures of a certain age started pointedly sharing on social media a video of a conference speech. It is of course <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3xNxnPsQ\" title=\"\">Neil Kinnock</a>, in 1985, attacking the \u201crigid dogma\u201d leading to the \u201cgrotesque chaos\u201d of Liverpool\u2019s Labour council, then under the heavy influence of the Trotskyist Militant tendency. The implication didn\u2019t even need to be stated: this is what needs to happen now. A centrist leader such as Kinnock is going to purge you Trots, tack back to the centre and then win an election \u2026 in 12 years.</p> <p>It\u2019s history repeating itself, they say. An ineffectual pacifist who didn\u2019t genuflect enough to patriotism \u2013 Michael Foot then, Jeremy Corbyn now \u2013 led the party to oblivion, and allowed in a horde of far-left \u201centryists\u201d, who brought the party into disrepute. But who are the entryists today, and who should be purged? The first to name names is a Corbyn-sympathetic figure, Paul Mason, <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/12/next-labour-leader-must-challenge-sectarian-left\" title=\"\">who has already argued</a> that Corbyn staffers Andrew Murray and Seumas Milne are \u201cStalinists\u201d who must be forced out. \u201cStalinists\u201d is generally shorthand for ageing trade unionists unable to get with the times with the same ease as ex-Trotskyists such as Mason.</p> <p>But isn\u2019t Momentum just like Militant, you may ask? The <a href=\"https://newsocialist.org.uk/the-spectre-of-militant/\" title=\"\">latter</a> was a tightly organised Leninist party: a small sect based mainly in Merseyside that collectively joined Labour almost unnoticed in the early 60s; it took 20 years for it to control the party\u2019s youth wing, take over several constituency Labour parties and elect three MPs. Following Kinnock\u2019s mass expulsions, Militant had a major role in the campaign against the poll tax, but after its abolition disappeared back into the margins.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine a more different beast to Momentum \u2013 a massive, unwieldy coalition.

      "bodyText": "After the disaster of the general election, Labour figures of a certain age started pointedly sharing on social media a video of a conference speech. It is of course Neil Kinnock, in 1985, attacking the \u201crigid dogma\u201d leading to the \u201cgrotesque chaos\u201d of Liverpool\u2019s Labour council, then under the heavy influence of the Trotskyist Militant tendency. The implication didn\u2019t even need to be stated: this is what needs to happen now. A centrist leader such as Kinnock is going to purge you Trots, tack back to the centre and then win an election \u2026 in 12 years. It\u2019s history repeating itself, they say. An ineffectual pacifist who didn\u2019t genuflect enough to patriotism \u2013 Michael Foot then, Jeremy Corbyn now \u2013 led the party to oblivion, and allowed in a horde of far-left \u201centryists\u201d, who brought the party into disrepute. But who are the entryists today, and who should be purged? The first to name names is a Corbyn-sympathetic figure, Paul Mason, who has already argued that Corbyn staffers Andrew Murray and Seumas Milne are \u201cStalinists\u201d who must be forced out. \u201cStalinists\u201d is generally shorthand for ageing trade unionists unable to get with the times with the same ease as ex-Trotskyists such as Mason. But isn\u2019t Momentum just like Militant, you may ask? The latter was a tightly organised Leninist party: a small sect based mainly in Merseyside that collectively joined Labour almost unnoticed in the early 60s; it took 20 years for it to control the party\u2019s youth wing, take over several constituency Labour parties and elect three MPs. Following Kinnock\u2019s mass expulsions, Militant had a major role in the campaign against the poll tax, but after its abolition disappeared back into the margins. It\u2019s hard to imagine a more different beast to Momentum \u2013 a massive, unwieldy coalition. Its activists tend to be long-term party members \u2013 often, like its chair, Jon Lansman, with backgrounds in the post-1968 new left. The new left in Labour \u2013 which produced figures as disparate as Ken Livingstone and Margaret Hodge \u2013 were much more committed to anti-racist and feminist politics than Militant\u2019s shop-floor Leninism, and saw no need for centralist structures.

Most of all, it seems Kinnock and Corbyn share the fact that each losing two consecutive elections themselves didn\u2019t lead to their total discrediting within the party.

      "body": "<p>It was the penultimate day of our holiday: I\u2019d gone snowboarding in France with my little brother and what we lacked in skill we made up for in enthusiasm, catching the first ski lift in the morning and the last lift in the afternoon. That day, fresh snow had been falling and we were in high spirits. We stopped near the top of an off-piste section that went through forests. I\u2019d done this route a few times before and, as I was faster and more experienced, I let my brother disappear into the trees ahead, figuring I would soon catch up.</p> <p>I began to pick up speed when I was suddenly thrown off balance.

I didn\u2019t lose consciousness but within a split second I was lying crumpled around the trunk. The pain was instantaneous and overwhelming, I knew pretty much immediately that my back was broken and quickly realised the situation could get very serious. I was off-piste, so nobody would be coming past. There was no phone signal. My brother knew I was on the mountain, but we often lost each other during our descents and would just meet at the bottom, so he might not worry for some time. Even if he did, he had no way of knowing where I was. It was snowing and cold. I reckoned if I waited, I would probably be rescued, eventually. But the chance of freezing to death before that happened was too high for me to risk staying put.</p> <p>I tried to stand but collapsed and almost blacked out with pain before I got halfway up. Walking was not an option. Crawling was too slow and painful. I had another idea: I managed to get the board unclipped from my feet and manoeuvred it under my stomach so I was lying on it. I faced down the mountain and, using the board as a luge, I started to drag and slide my body down the steep, tree-lined slope. The incline was sharp but the snow was quite deep so I could use my arms to stop myself sliding out of control. I descended at a slow jogging pace, trying to slow myself as much as possible.</p> <p>At one stage I lost control and slid down into a bunker, about 6ft deep. I came off the board and into the snow. I felt the coldness around my back and it temporarily eased the intense pain. I briefly thought of staying, there before a louder voice repeated, \u201cNo. I must get down.\u201d I took a deep breath and pushed hard with my hands to get myself back on to my stomach. The sides were steep, almost impossible to slide up. I cried out in pain but didn\u2019t make it. I tried again \u2013 this time, I took a deep breath and pushed hard and fast, trying to do it before my brain registered the pain. I succeeded. Once over I had to slide myself on to the board and pull myself up out of the bunker with my hands. It was agony. But I knew this was the only option. It took about an hour before I slid out on to a cross-country ski path and another hour before a skier found me and got help. The mountain rescue team came, with my brother arriving shortly afterwards.

That was a rarity in a season in which they have already played 32 matches, successfully combining a Europa League campaign with domestic duties.

And recovery is going to be particularly important this weekend.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday night Wolves host Manchester City and then, less than 48 hours later, they take on Liverpool at Anfield. \u201cFortunately they are the two worst teams in the league,\u201d says Sa\u00efss before bursting out laughing again.</p> <p>There is a lot of laughter around the Wolves camp these days. Sa\u00efss explains the technical factors that have enabled them to bear their workload without losing form but he says the first reason is the atmosphere in the squad. \u201cWe spend so much time together with the travel, the hotels and everything that I think I see more of my teammates than I do of my wife and kids,\u201d he says. \u201cSo can you imagine how things would be if we didn\u2019t like each other? But outside the pitch we are very close to each other, and you can see that on it.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any different groups in the dressing room; everybody talks to everybody and you can joke with anybody. We are from Africa, Europe and South America and the mix is really good. It\u2019s a big strength of this team. That\u2019s what the manager wants to create. He wants good unity between everyone, the staff and the team. For us to be like a family. A wolf pack.\u201d</p> <p>The manager, of course, is Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, whose success since arriving in the Midlands in 2017 has brought acclaim and envious glances. Arsenal considered approaching him to replace Unai Emery before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/19/arsenal-mikel-arteta-gamble-manager-appointment-mr-mentality\" title=\"\">plumping for Mikel Arteta</a> but Sa\u00efss says he was not worried \u2013 \u201cbecause I was sure he was going to stay with us\u201d. Did he ask the manager? \u201cYeah,\u201d he replies with another raucous laugh. \u201cBut I can understand [Arsenal\u2019s interest] because he\u2019s been doing a fantastic job for three years now. He won promotion, got seventh place in the Premier League last season and now we\u2019re doing well in the Europa League and the Premier League. It\u2019s normal that other teams want him. Like if a player does well for several seasons, all eyes are on you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d795fb12a8cf9027f04a179f9e0f0b0d55e1bd01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d795fb12a8cf9027f04a179f9e0f0b0d55e1bd01/0_38_2486_1491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Romain Sa\u00efss was recently made captain of Morocco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Romain Sa\u00efss was recently made captain of Morocco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel French/PA Wire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All eyes have not been on Sa\u00efss, however, even though he, too, has contributed a lot to Wolves\u2019 rise since arriving from Angers in 2016.

He played in midfield in the promotion season but now he is thriving in central defence, where he also plays for Morocco, of whom he was recently appointed captain.</p> <p>Sa\u00efss\u2019s versatility is one reason why Wolves have not suffered as badly as some feared since losing the key central defender Willy Boly to a fractured fibula in October. Nuno likes to work with a relatively small squad \u2013 that way it is easier to preserve team spirit \u2013 but that is only possible with players who can play in numerous positions. \u201cThat\u2019s why we will not struggle,\u201d says Sa\u00efss. \u201cIt was the same when Ryan Bennett got injured and Leander [Dendoncker] came back from midfield to play in his position [the right-hand side of central defence] because he can do both. The versatility of this team is another reason why we are not struggling with all the demands. Another example is Adama [Traor\u00e9]. Sometimes he plays up front, sometimes as a right-winger and sometimes a right-back.\u201d</p> <p>Traor\u00e9 played up front in October when he scored both Wolves\u2019 goals in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/manchester-city-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">a 2-0 win away at Manchester City</a>. Pep Guardiola has probably spent time this week trying to figure out how to stop a player who seems to improve with every game. \u201cIt is very hard to stop him \u2013 I find that out every day in training,\u201d says Sa\u00efss. \u201cAnd he is much better than last season. This season he is more intelligent in how he plays. I think he\u2019s more focused on the tactics and the way to show defenders. He knows he is faster than every other player in the world but sometimes, like last season, the opponents came on him with two or three players and reduce the space. Now he is trying to create more one-on-one situations and open up more space. It is very hard to stop him. Did you see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/20/killing-transition-fouling-tottenham-wolves\" title=\"\">what Tottenham did to him</a>? The whole left side of their team could have been booked because of him.\u201d</p> <p>Sa\u00efss is no stranger to a booking himself and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/22/crystal-palace-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">in September</a>, he was shown a red card for a couple of fouls on Wilfried Zaha, one of the few players in the Premier League who could be compared to Traor\u00e9. \u201cI think Zaha may be more skilful than Adama but Adama is stronger, faster and is good with both feet,\u201d says Sa\u00efss. \u201cHe needs space. If he gets it, you\u2019re finished. But it\u2019s good to play against these kinds of players because, if every game is easy for you, you stay at the same level instead of getting better.\u201d</p>",

Oh, your ears will be full to the brim of each dish\u2019s description and of tales of the chef\u2019s commitment to banning clingfilm or importing veg \u2013 and did you know he is currently making his own plates out of reclaimed tampon inner tubes? Or that this is a woman-only kitchen crew, and the pastry chef made the croquembouche while literally pumping her own breasts?</p> <p>This was a year when it was vital that the cognoscenti thought very deeply about our dinners. And I do \u2013 but sometimes I just can\u2019t be bothered, which is why my favourite meal of 2019 was at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/21/darbys-london-sw11-restaurant-review-grace-dent\" title=\"\">Darby\u2019s</a>, a Robin Gill restaurant tucked behind the brand new US embassy in Vauxhall.

      "bodyText": "In 2019, I spent a lot of time waiting for a buzzer, in vast, open spaces and sometimes next to carefully commissioned graffiti, where a bowl of curried cabbage or an egg sarnie plus a bottle of pop costs \u00a312 \u2013 sorry, that\u2019s a yoga fire vegan curry or an egg sando. The names are alluring, the prices hysterical: welcome to the world of the food hall. An industry bigwig recently told me that the demise of actual restaurants will not be down to Brexit, but to the Generation Z attitude that pledging loyalty to a particular place that serves a three-course, sit-down menu is a quaint, vintage notion. Newness is all. Creating fresh memories, and social media content, around eating is now crucial to our self-worth, apparently. \u201cWhy would you open a restaurant if you could open a bubble waffle stand that dished out amazing-looking cheap carbs at nine quid a throw? And when your clientele have all taken a photo of that, you can just start making something else.\u201d \u201cBecause, because \u2026 people like proper chairs, cutlery, their regular dinner,\u201d I spluttered, wriggling furiously in the grip of reason. \u201cAnd they still want somewhere to go on dates or to take small kids?\u201d \u201cGrace,\u201d she replied, \u201cthey are not dating in restaurants. And they are not having babies.\u201d And with that I was silenced. Welcome to the era of the \u201cincubation-focused mezzanine kitchen space\u201d, enjoy the communal tables, bus your own food and then eat it sitting a metre away from the owner while he\u2019s conducting HR appraisals. But if this is the final hurrah for traditional hospitality, then it\u2019s going out on a terrific high. Over the past 12 months, I ate gnocchi at Bottega Caruso in Margate, a love-filled, family-run joint that made me giddy. A day trip to Folkestone was made wondrous by the 26-seat nirvana that is The Folkestone Wine Company, with its seafood, raspberry french toast and Appassimento Salento by the glass. I loved The Yan in Grasmere, where a trek through the mountains brings you to a delicious pit-stop that does Cumberland sausage sharing platters. In London, I spent numerous Sundays with the long-suffering Charles slurping belt noodles and nibbling wood ear fungus at Xi\u2019an Biang Biang in Spitalfields. I still rate Wagamama, Itsu, Leon and Busaba highly. Don\u2019t ask me to feign shock about the end of Jamie\u2019s Italian, Prezzo or Levi Roots\u2019 Caribbean Smokehouse. Britain in 2019 has some great casual dining: Nando\u2019s is still a crowdpleaser, and the food at Brewdog is surprisingly good. Casual dining crunch be damned: the Big Mamma group, which has dazzled London with Gloria and Circolo Popolare, proved that an 11 quid margarita pizza and a silly cocktail served with panache in a meticulously styled palace of bric-a-brac will draw queues down the street nightly. That said, if casual isn\u2019t your thing, 2019 also brought a plethora of places in which to burn money: Lucky Cat by Gordon Ramsay, The Betterment by Jason Atherton and Siren by Nathan Outlaw are all living proof that investors know there are still big bucks to be made at lunchtime. At Peter Sanchez-Iglesias\u2019s Decimo, the small version of the tortilla with caviar costs \u00a345, and at Arros QD, Quique Dacosta\u2019s lobster paella is \u00a385 for two. I filed 52 columns this year, and ate out at least 150 times; the ticker-tape parade of restaurant receipts that I loosely term an office tells a story of how easy it is in Great Britain to spend \u00a3225 on dinner for two and still walk away with a virtually empty belly. Oh, your ears will be full to the brim of each dish\u2019s description and of tales of the chef\u2019s commitment to banning clingfilm or importing veg \u2013 and did you know he is currently making his own plates out of reclaimed tampon inner tubes? Or that this is a woman-only kitchen crew, and the pastry chef made the croquembouche while literally pumping her own breasts? This was a year when it was vital that the cognoscenti thought very deeply about our dinners. And I do \u2013 but sometimes I just can\u2019t be bothered, which is why my favourite meal of 2019 was at Darby\u2019s, a Robin Gill restaurant tucked behind the brand new US embassy in Vauxhall. They\u2019re fancy and Irish; they do Guinness, chablis, oysters, lobster brioche rolls and seriously buttery mash. They serve brown butter waffles with smoked salmon and cultured cream, and truffled baron bigod cheese with fig and walnut sourdough. I certainly didn\u2019t have any big, deep thoughts about anything when I waddled out of Darby\u2019s. Pass the Gaviscon, here\u2019s to 2020.",

      "body": "<p>The long decade closes with no consensus on what we were supposed to call it (the \u201cteens\u201d?) nor about what ground has been gained or lost in the big cinema debates of the past 10 years. Steven Spielberg <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/columns/steven-spielberg-vs-netflix-a-preview-of-the-war-for-cinemas-future-1203159522/\" title=\"\">warned</a> of a colossal evolutionary crisis in theatrical distribution, whereby the film business becomes over reliant annually on three or four big \u201ctentpole\u201d movies that will then crash, leaving us with the movie equivalent of 2008 or even 1929. And the tentpoles that everyone is betting on are the superhero films, which Spielberg warned will go the way of the western. Well, this hasn\u2019t happened yet.</p> <p>So a new hero/villain has arisen: Marvel Studios, which has enjoyed a staggering explosion of box-office popularity, blessed by cinema chains for providing surefire hits, but increasingly loathed by cinephiles for dumbing down the movies. Martin Scorsese, in his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html\" title=\"\">widely shared New York Times article</a>, expanded his personal view that superhero films are just glorified theme-park rides without the individual artistry and humanity of real cinema.</p> <p>But Scorsese created a controversy of his own by taking his new film to Netflix. Two of the best films of the year, Scorsese\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-irishman-review-martin-scorseses-finest-film-for-30-years\" title=\"\">The Irishman</a> and Noah Baumbach\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/15/marriage-story-review-noah-baumbach-adam-driver-scarlett-johansson\" title=\"\">Marriage Story</a>, are Netflix products, released in cinemas for a short while and then absorbed on to the site to attract new subscribers and gratify existing ones.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just Netflix. One of the best films of this year \u2013 and the decade \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/02/2019-braddies-peter-bradshaw-films-of-the-year\" title=\"\">Beanpole</a>, by the brilliant young Russian director Kantemir Balagov; it had a handful of big-screen showings at the London film festival, then went straight to Mubi streaming. It\u2019s an awful shame, although the streaming sites offer large-scale viewer access and hospitality to newer, younger film-makers. (And for independent arthouse films to exist only briefly in cinemas is nothing new.)</p> <p>As for superhero films (Gen-Z westerns), there is no doubt that many studio executives are mesmerised by their bankability and less likely to take a punt on other genres of film. I have, however, written about tendencies that are more worrying: high frame-rate and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/05/tom-cruise-motion-smoothing-interpolation\" title=\"\">\u201cmotion smoothing\u201d</a> on new TVs that can make films clearer, but flatter and blander, like daytime TV. As for cinema admissions, they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/14/big-screen-boom-uk-cinemas-on-track-for-best-year-since-1971\" title=\"\">holding pretty steady</a> at 170m annually in the UK, helped by the investment in the cinema-going experience \u2013 although the novelty of getting food delivered to your seat is surely a step too far.</p> <p>In this decade, Hollywood woke up, or was rudely awakened, to issues of diversity and social justice by the #OscarsSoWhite and #MeToo movements, driven by social media. Voting membership of the Academy has also been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/28/academy-oscars-new-members-diversity-gal-gadot-barry-jenkins\" title=\"\">changed</a> to bring in a younger generation, women and people of colour.

There is outstanding work from female British film-makers such as Carol Morley, Joanna Hogg, Clio Barnard and Rungano Nyoni \u2013 and elsewhere, great directors such as Kelly Reichardt, Anna Biller, Lucrecia Martel, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao and Debra Granik.</p> <p>As for auteur cinema, some commentators have found it too bound up in male privilege. But great \u2013 even historic \u2013 work has come from Jessica Hausner, Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve and Martel, as well as established silverbacks such as Quentin Tarantino, Yorgos Lanthimos and Paul Thomas Anderson, whose most recent film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/07/phantom-thread-review-daniel-day-lewis-paul-thomas-anderson\" title=\"\">Phantom Thread</a>, was the curtain-call for that extraordinary acting talent, Daniel Day-Lewis. From Asia, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Jia Zhangke and Bong Joon-ho have continued to produce dazzling work. But if there is a big auteur whose stock is a bear market, it has to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/27/abdellatif-kechiche-interview-blue-warmest\" title=\"\">Abdellatif Kechiche</a>, whose multi-part epic of sexiness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/13/mektoub-my-love-review-abdellatif-kechiche-shain-boumedine-ophelie-bau\" title=\"\">Mektoub My Love</a>, is increasingly baffling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps there are \u2013 at present \u2013 too many documentarians chasing too few genuinely strong subjects</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The decade\u2019s other great issue is Brexit \u2013 and it is remarkable how movies in the UK have failed to address it (although the new romcom Last Christmas, for all its ickiness, does mention the B-word and attempt to dramatise its attendant issues). From within the industry, producers such as Eric Fellner and Jeremy Thomas are railing against the woeful division that it is opening up, especially with regard to the free movement of people and equipment across the Channel. Brexit burdens film with a bureaucratic nightmare.</p> <p>With the decade coming to an end, I am optimistic about many of the issues I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/05/top-50-films-of-the-demi-decade-peter-bradshaw\" title=\"\">wrote</a> about to mark the half-decade, especially the way digital technology has enabled young film-makers to get their work made, and raise money for new work, through sites such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter. I am less happy about the state of documentary. Five years ago, we were in the middle of a \u201csurge\u201d; now I am seeing documentaries that feel lightweight, sometimes almost negligible, often taking refuge in postmodern self-reference about the chaotic difficulties of making documentaries. Perhaps there are \u2013 at present \u2013 too many documentarians chasing too few genuinely strong subjects.</p> <p>Britain has endured austerity for the past 10 years, so it is extraordinary how documentaries have not reflected this. It has been left to the eightysomething veteran Ken Loach (in partnership with the screenwriter Paul Laverty) to tackle the issue directly and simply with I, Daniel Blake and Sorry We Missed You.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/100-best-films-movies-of-the-21st-century\">The 100 best films of the 21st century</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the other issue is the nature of criticism itself. It is tiresome and self-pitying for critics to complain about social media \u2013 especially as social media has done so much to galvanise and invigorate criticism \u2013 but in the teens there was more retrenchment, more abuse. Along with a handful of other critics, I disliked Joker, the new origin myth movie for Batman\u2019s great villain, starring Joaquin Phoenix. But whatever that film\u2019s problems, it is incomparably more interesting and intelligent than its online fanboy trolls and hatebombers, though I was spared the misogyny that women writers experienced on this subject.</p> <p>What is extraordinary is how threatened people still are by dissenting opinion, an aggressive neurosis that is probably intensified by the bizarre consensus machine Rotten Tomatoes and its meaninglessly pseudo-scientific ratings that paralyse the idea of considered analysis. Individual critical voices are what count; what count even more are individual film-making talents.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The long decade closes with no consensus on what we were supposed to call it (the \u201cteens\u201d?) nor about what ground has been gained or lost in the big cinema debates of the past 10 years. Steven Spielberg warned of a colossal evolutionary crisis in theatrical distribution, whereby the film business becomes over reliant annually on three or four big \u201ctentpole\u201d movies that will then crash, leaving us with the movie equivalent of 2008 or even 1929. And the tentpoles that everyone is betting on are the superhero films, which Spielberg warned will go the way of the western. Well, this hasn\u2019t happened yet. So a new hero/villain has arisen: Marvel Studios, which has enjoyed a staggering explosion of box-office popularity, blessed by cinema chains for providing surefire hits, but increasingly loathed by cinephiles for dumbing down the movies. Martin Scorsese, in his widely shared New York Times article, expanded his personal view that superhero films are just glorified theme-park rides without the individual artistry and humanity of real cinema. But Scorsese created a controversy of his own by taking his new film to Netflix. Two of the best films of the year, Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman and Noah Baumbach\u2019s Marriage Story, are Netflix products, released in cinemas for a short while and then absorbed on to the site to attract new subscribers and gratify existing ones. And it\u2019s not just Netflix. One of the best films of this year \u2013 and the decade \u2013 was Beanpole, by the brilliant young Russian director Kantemir Balagov; it had a handful of big-screen showings at the London film festival, then went straight to Mubi streaming. It\u2019s an awful shame, although the streaming sites offer large-scale viewer access and hospitality to newer, younger film-makers. (And for independent arthouse films to exist only briefly in cinemas is nothing new.) As for superhero films (Gen-Z westerns), there is no doubt that many studio executives are mesmerised by their bankability and less likely to take a punt on other genres of film. I have, however, written about tendencies that are more worrying: high frame-rate and \u201cmotion smoothing\u201d on new TVs that can make films clearer, but flatter and blander, like daytime TV. As for cinema admissions, they are holding pretty steady at 170m annually in the UK, helped by the investment in the cinema-going experience \u2013 although the novelty of getting food delivered to your seat is surely a step too far. In this decade, Hollywood woke up, or was rudely awakened, to issues of diversity and social justice by the #OscarsSoWhite and #MeToo movements, driven by social media. Voting membership of the Academy has also been changed to bring in a younger generation, women and people of colour. Harvey Weinstein may be about to reach a deal in the civil courts, to the outrage of many, but Roman Polanski has faced a resurgence of discontent with his reputation. His new film, An Officer and a Spy \u2013 although favourably received on the film festival circuit \u2013 has had no UK showing. The question of diversity (so long disputed by men of a certain age who wish to be congratulated on their courage in rejecting \u201cquotas\u201d) is far from answered, but new voices are emerging in Britain with fascinating and brilliant films. There is outstanding work from female British film-makers such as Carol Morley, Joanna Hogg, Clio Barnard and Rungano Nyoni \u2013 and elsewhere, great directors such as Kelly Reichardt, Anna Biller, Lucrecia Martel, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao and Debra Granik. As for auteur cinema, some commentators have found it too bound up in male privilege. But great \u2013 even historic \u2013 work has come from Jessica Hausner, Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve and Martel, as well as established silverbacks such as Quentin Tarantino, Yorgos Lanthimos and Paul Thomas Anderson, whose most recent film, Phantom Thread, was the curtain-call for that extraordinary acting talent, Daniel Day-Lewis. From Asia, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Jia Zhangke and Bong Joon-ho have continued to produce dazzling work. But if there is a big auteur whose stock is a bear market, it has to be Abdellatif Kechiche, whose multi-part epic of sexiness, Mektoub My Love, is increasingly baffling. The decade\u2019s other great issue is Brexit \u2013 and it is remarkable how movies in the UK have failed to address it (although the new romcom Last Christmas, for all its ickiness, does mention the B-word and attempt to dramatise its attendant issues). From within the industry, producers such as Eric Fellner and Jeremy Thomas are railing against the woeful division that it is opening up, especially with regard to the free movement of people and equipment across the Channel. Brexit burdens film with a bureaucratic nightmare. With the decade coming to an end, I am optimistic about many of the issues I wrote about to mark the half-decade, especially the way digital technology has enabled young film-makers to get their work made, and raise money for new work, through sites such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter. I am less happy about the state of documentary. Five years ago, we were in the middle of a \u201csurge\u201d; now I am seeing documentaries that feel lightweight, sometimes almost negligible, often taking refuge in postmodern self-reference about the chaotic difficulties of making documentaries. Perhaps there are \u2013 at present \u2013 too many documentarians chasing too few genuinely strong subjects. Britain has endured austerity for the past 10 years, so it is extraordinary how documentaries have not reflected this. It has been left to the eightysomething veteran Ken Loach (in partnership with the screenwriter Paul Laverty) to tackle the issue directly and simply with I, Daniel Blake and Sorry We Missed You. Perhaps the other issue is the nature of criticism itself. It is tiresome and self-pitying for critics to complain about social media \u2013 especially as social media has done so much to galvanise and invigorate criticism \u2013 but in the teens there was more retrenchment, more abuse. Along with a handful of other critics, I disliked Joker, the new origin myth movie for Batman\u2019s great villain, starring Joaquin Phoenix. But whatever that film\u2019s problems, it is incomparably more interesting and intelligent than its online fanboy trolls and hatebombers, though I was spared the misogyny that women writers experienced on this subject. What is extraordinary is how threatened people still are by dissenting opinion, an aggressive neurosis that is probably intensified by the bizarre consensus machine Rotten Tomatoes and its meaninglessly pseudo-scientific ratings that paralyse the idea of considered analysis. Individual critical voices are what count; what count even more are individual film-making talents.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThere is no escape from this dilemma \u2013 either all matter is conscious, or consciousness is something distinct from matter\u201d: Alfred Russel Wallace put the point succinctly in 1870, and it is hard to see how his colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/charles-darwin\" title=\"\">Charles Darwin</a>, the great evolutionary gradualist, could disagree. Wallace, however, wanted us to have souls; he believed that consciousness was indeed distinct from matter. Darwin was a staunch materialist; he had no doubt that consciousness was wholly material. As early as 1838 he took it for granted that thought is \u201ca secretion of brain\u201d, using the word \u201cthought\u201d in Descartes\u2019s way to cover any conscious experience. He wondered why people found this harder to believe than the fact that gravity is a property of matter.</p> <p>Darwin didn\u2019t explicitly endorse panpsychism \u2013 the view that there is an element of consciousness in all matter, or, somewhat more cautiously, that consciousness is one of the fundamental properties of matter. But he saw the force of the position, and saw that it implied our profound ignorance of the nature of matter: \u201cWhat is matter? the whole thing a mystery\u201d. Certainly he understood the point that William James made in 1890: \u201cIf evolution is to work smoothly, consciousness in some shape must have been present at the very origin of things. Accordingly we find that the more clear-sighted evolutionary philosophers are beginning to posit it there.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Goff\u2019s engaging <em>Galileo\u2019s Error</em> is a full\u2011on defence of panpsychism. It\u2019s plainly a difficult view, but when we get serious about consciousness, and put aside the standard bag of philosophical tricks, it seems that one has to choose, with Wallace, between some version of panpsychism or fairytales about immaterial souls. This is of course too simple; <em>Galileo\u2019s Error</em> lays out many of the complexities. It\u2019s an illuminating introduction to the topic of consciousness. It addresses the real issue \u2013 unlike almost all recent popular books on this subject. It stands a good chance of delivering the extremely large intellectual jolt that many people will need if they are to get into (or anywhere near) the right ballpark for thinking about consciousness. This is a great thing.</p> <p>Goff\u2019s historical remarks about panpsychism are misleading, however, in giving pride of place to Arthur Eddington and Bertrand Russell with no mention of Alfred North Whitehead\u2019s panpsychism, or of WK Clifford, or the American panpsychists CA Strong and Durant Drake, whose writings from 1918-1925 were certainly known to Russell and Eddington. He also perpetuates the myth that David Chalmers \u201cswept away decades of evasion\u201d of the question of consciousness in 1995 and \u201cforced us to confront the real mystery head-on\u201d. This is wholly untrue in philosophy (as has been said before), and it\u2019s a weird kick in the face to all those who thought so very hard and well about the problem for several centuries before 1995. There was a great surge of outstanding work in precisely the decades Goff dismisses, including Thomas Nagel\u2019s article \u201cWhat Is It Like to Be a Bat?\u201d (1974), John Searle\u2019s \u201cChinese room argument\u201d (1980), Frank Jackson\u2019s parable about Mary and the black and white room (1982) and Robert Kirk\u2019s 1974 revival of Descartes\u2019s \u201czombie argument\u201d (in philosophy, \u201czombies\u201d are imaginary creatures who seem just like us but lack consciousness). Goff testifies to its importance by devoting a considerable part of <em>Galileo\u2019s Error</em> to it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The illusionists sail off the edge of the world in the great Ship of Fools, crewed by Flat Earthers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Goff is also wrong to identify materialism, the ancient and overwhelmingly plausible view that everything in the universe including consciousness is wholly material, with the obviously false and hyperscientistic view that everything in the universe, including feelings of pain, sexual joy, experiences of colour, and so on, can be \u201cexhaustively described\u201d (ie described in such a way that its nature is fully conveyed) in the language of the physical sciences. I don\u2019t know any materialists who think this, and it\u2019s certainly not true of Thomas Hobbes in 1651, or the electrifying materialist panpsychist Margaret Cavendish in 1666, or Joseph Priestley in 1777, and thousands of others since. Panpsychism is a wholly materialist view in almost all its versions, and Goff himself recommends the materialist panpsychist view that \u201cconsciousness is located in the intrinsic nature of the physical world\u201d.</p> <p>There are, to be sure, people who think materialism requires them to deny the existence of consciousness, \u201cillusionists\u201d who are adamant that our brains are machines and there is really no feeling, no pain, no joy, no sensory experience. They are, however, a recent and wildly anomalous group among materialists, and this is unsurprising, because illusionism is the silliest view about reality that has ever been held by any human being. (No one has ever really suffered in any way!) The illusionists sail off the edge of the world in the great Ship of Fools, crewed by Flat Earthers, under the command of Rear Admiral Daniel Dennett, and we must let them go. I don\u2019t know why Goff calls their view a \u201cbeautiful, elegant solution to the problem of consciousness\u201d, because you can\u2019t solve the problem of consciousness by denying its existence \u2013 and he himself says that illusionism is certainly false.

It remains to be seen whether it will ever advance to \u201cobvious\u201d. Certainly it seemed obvious to three winners of the Nobel prize for physics interviewed in the Observer in 1931: Ernst Schr\u00f6dinger (\u201cthe material universe and consciousness are made out of the same stuff\u201d), Louis de Broglie (\u201cI regard consciousness and matter as different aspects of one and the same thing\u201d) and Max Planck (\u201cI regard consciousness as fundamental\u201d).

      "body": "<p>A 105-year-old Seattle woman who died last year has left almost $10m to community colleges across Washington state.</p> <p>Eva Gordon was known for accumulating a small fortune by being both thrifty and a shrewd investor. She bought up stocks early in such famed north-west companies as Nordstrom, Microsoft and Starbucks.</p> <p>\u201cShe was a very intelligent woman, meticulous record keeper, very organized, and had the wherewithal to buy stocks and hold on to them that a lot of people at that age didn\u2019t really do too much,\u201d said John Jacobs, 61, Gordon\u2019s godson and personal representative for the estate.</p> <p>About one month ago, Eva Gordon\u2019s estate sent checks for $550,000 to 17 colleges across the state, including North Seattle College and Seattle Central College. The contribution was a shock for many of the institutions, as it was one of the largest donations the colleges have ever received.</p> <p>Gordon was known for caring deeply for youth and education, and she regularly donated to and volunteered for children\u2019s and educational programs. She also never attended college, which was something she regretted later in life. Jacobs said this could have contributed to her decision to leave her money to these schools.</p> <p>Gordon was also very private about her money.

      "bodyText": "A 105-year-old Seattle woman who died last year has left almost $10m to community colleges across Washington state. Eva Gordon was known for accumulating a small fortune by being both thrifty and a shrewd investor. She bought up stocks early in such famed north-west companies as Nordstrom, Microsoft and Starbucks. \u201cShe was a very intelligent woman, meticulous record keeper, very organized, and had the wherewithal to buy stocks and hold on to them that a lot of people at that age didn\u2019t really do too much,\u201d said John Jacobs, 61, Gordon\u2019s godson and personal representative for the estate. About one month ago, Eva Gordon\u2019s estate sent checks for $550,000 to 17 colleges across the state, including North Seattle College and Seattle Central College. The contribution was a shock for many of the institutions, as it was one of the largest donations the colleges have ever received. Gordon was known for caring deeply for youth and education, and she regularly donated to and volunteered for children\u2019s and educational programs. She also never attended college, which was something she regretted later in life. Jacobs said this could have contributed to her decision to leave her money to these schools. Gordon was also very private about her money. When the news came out about her will, it even surprised some of her closest friends, many of whom had no idea of the extent of her wealth. There are no requirements for how the money is used by the colleges, although Jacobs advised the schools that Gordon would have wanted the funds to help create educational or training opportunities for disadvantaged individuals. Renton Technical College, one of the recipients, announced on Monday that it would use the money to create student scholarships and grants for underserved students and those with financial barriers. The school\u2019s student body includes many first-generation college students, single parents and immigrants. \u201cStudents succeed at Renton Technical College through their own determination and hard work,\u201d said Renton Technical College\u2019s president, Kevin McCarthy, in a statement. \u201cBut many encounter obstacles, and sometimes a scholarship or emergency grant makes the difference that allows them to stay in school.\u201d Gordon grew up in Eugene, Oregon, and moved to Seattle after high school. She worked as a trading assistant at an investment firm, and in 1964 she married Ed Gordon, a stockbroker. Neither of them came from money, and they lived a modest life. Jacobs said it became a running joke that \u201cif it was time to go out for lunch or dinner, she always had an Applebee\u2019s coupon\u201d. The couple never had children.

But the theme of his latest Wigmore recital is a pretty obvious one. Works connected with the night dominate his choice, whether obviously, as in Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata, one of Schumann\u2019s Op 23 Nachtst\u00fccke, and the Night\u2019s Music movement from Bart\u00f3k\u2019s suite Out of Doors, or more obliquely, in a Chopin sequence that begins with the Fantaisie-Impromptu and ends with the \u201cRaindrop\u201d Prelude. Kolesnikov\u2019s programmes can sometimes seem rather bitty, but as well as the Moonlight Sonata, he also includes Beethoven\u2019s Waldstein Sonata Op 53 in this one, which should be more than enough to demonstrate that he is one of the most gifted pianists of his generation. <br><em><a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/pavel-kolesnikov-201804301930\">Wigmore Hall, W1,</a><strong><a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/pavel-kolesnikov-201804301930\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/pavel-kolesnikov-201804301930\">Friday 3 January</a></em></p> <h2>Messiah</h2> <p>Wherever you are in the weeks leading up to Christmas, there is never a shortage of performances of Handel\u2019s best-known oratorio. But chances to hear Messiah in the aftermath of the festivities are much less common. The Royal Scottish National Orchestra has kept its seasonal performance in reserve for just this time, inviting the Handel specialist Nicholas McGegan to conduct it, with a classy quartet of young soloists \u2013 Rowan Pierce, Diana Moore, Nicholas Mulroy and William Berger \u2013 and the RSNO\u2019s own chorus. It is likely to be a broadly traditional performance, but no doubt McGegan\u2019s period-instrument experience in baroque repertoire will be added into his interpretation, too. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.glasgowconcerthalls.com/Pages/EventDetail.aspx?event=1/rsno-201920-gala-concert-handels-messiah\">Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Thursday 2 January</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a893c18ca6224b5e8a7251587da69fd508e786d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a893c18ca6224b5e8a7251587da69fd508e786d2/23_252_5954_3573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kara Walker\u2019s Fons Americanus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fountain pain\u2026 Kara Walker\u2019s Fons Americanus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kara Walker</h2> <p>One of the best artworks of 2019 is Walker\u2019s colossal fountain in the Tate\u2019s Turbine Hall. At first sight, it is the most traditional sculpture ever created for this gargantuan space: a proper fountain that echoes Victorian art. But it is covered with satirical statuary that tells a savage history of racial injustice. A furious figurative romp. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/hyundai-commission-kara-walker\">Tate Modern, SE1, to 5 April</a></em></p> <h2>Elizabeth Price</h2> <p>There is nothing like a ghost story at Christmas. You could curl up with MR James or, if you really want to scare yourself silly, visit this exhibition. Price makes video art that is as atmospheric as the best horror. Her tales of terror combine chilling images, macabre facts and disturbing sound to ensnare you in darkness. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/upcomingexhibitions/elizabethprice/\">The Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, to 1 March</a></em></p> <h2>Turner in January</h2> <p>This Hogmanay highlight is one of the most laudable events in the art calendar, as the watercolours of Britain\u2019s greatest landscape artist and the godfather of modern painting are given their month in the winter sun. Scotland was one of Turner\u2019s favourite places, where he befriended Walter Scott and took a steamer to Fingal\u2019s Cave. His watercolours capture the romantic forces of sea, sky and storm. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/turner-january\">Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, New Year\u2019s Day to 31 January</a></em></p> <h2>Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece</h2> <p>Paintings of the infancy of Christ are trending at this time of year but none is stranger than Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s The Virgin of the Rocks. The National Gallery owns the second version of this surrealistic scene, which he painted after the first was rejected for being borderline heretical. It depicts Mary, Jesus, a young John the Baptist and an angel in a deserted mountainous landscape surrounded by blue water. You sink into this enigma as into a dream. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/leonardo-experience-a-masterpiece\">The National Gallery, WC2, to 26 January</a></em></p> <h2>Troy: Myth and Reality</h2> <p>The heroes of Troy fight and die all over again in this fascinating resurrection of a war somewhere between legend and history. Achilles, Helen and the rest who populate Homer\u2019s epic poems are portrayed on ancient Greek red figure vases, in frescoes from Pompeii and even an abstract painting by Cy Twombly. The emotion and drama of the Trojan war makes classical art immediate and moving. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/troy-myth-and-reality\">British Museum, WC1, to 8 March</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a2636ea3585ae9018548c2325340c00d92b7d11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a2636ea3585ae9018548c2325340c00d92b7d11/0_263_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Six\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wife lessons\u2026 Six.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Idil Sukan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mary Poppins</h2> <p>Feeling a bit cooped up inside with the family? Mary Poppins will remedy that. The 2004 production, directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne, returns to the West End with the impressive Zizi Strallen starring. There are extra songs from George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, dazzling dance routines and a cracking cameo from Petula Clark as the Bird Woman. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.princeedwardtheatre.co.uk/\">Prince Edward Theatre, W1, to 7 June</a></em></p> <h2>Ghost Quartet</h2> <p>For those looking for something a little different, this is the final week of Dave Malloy\u2019s ghostly song cycle, directed by Bill Buckhurst. It is about broken hearts and shattered memories, haunted lovers and two sisters lost in time. With a fragmented narrative and eerie atmosphere, in the intimate new Boulevard Theatre it will cast a spell over you. <br><em><a href=\"https://boulevardtheatre.co.uk/whats-on/ghost-quartet/\">Boulevard Theatre, W1, to 4 January</a></em></p> <h2>Swive [Elizabeth]</h2> <p>Playwright Ella Hickson and director Natalie Abrahami are joining forces to rewrite the story of Elizabeth I. Political mastermind, resolute survivor \u2013 or how\u2019s about a kingless queen? From the creator of The Writer and the playhouse that brought us Emilia, this should be stirring stuff.

Every run seems to be adding extra dates: there is something about this bold show \u2013 part gig, part drama, part rally \u2013 that has captured the public\u2019s imagination.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films Jojo Rabbit (12A) (Taika Waititi, 2019, Czech Republic/New Zealand/US) 108 mins Taika Waititi is one of Hollywood\u2019s more improbable success stories: from Flight of the Conchords, through the vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows, to Thor 3 (and 4), he can seemingly do no wrong. But the jury is out on this Hitler comedy, in which Waititi plays a buffoonish Adolf, the figment of a German boy\u2019s imagination. Out New Year\u2019s Day. Little Women (U) (Greta Gerwig, 2019, US) 135 mins Greta Gerwig establishes herself as a major-league director with this follow-up to her much-admired Lady Bird. Adapting the perenially popular American kids\u2019 classic, Gerwig brings together a top-notch cast, led by Saoirse Ronan, and emphasises the gentle feminism of the March family\u2019s story. A best picture Oscar nomination surely awaits. Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night (12A) (Bi Gan, 2018, China/Fra) 138 mins Not, in fact, an adaptation of Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s chronicle of crippling family dysfuncton, but a lengthy, dreamlike noir that has gone down a storm in its home country. Partly filmed in 3D, this comes on like a Chinese Leos Carax, as a drifter (played by Huang Jue) returns to his home town and starts to search for a mystery woman. Prizing visual style over thematic clarity, this is great to look at but can be tricky to get a proper handle on. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (12A) (JJ Abrams, 2019, US) 142 mins The final chunk of the grandly titled Skywalker Saga wraps up the nine-strong soap opera that has been the Star Wars story so far \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t even include the various \u201canthology\u201d films or the recent Mandalorian TV series. Now that Luke, Leia and co are history, the baton is being handed to a new generation \u2013 headed by Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige \u2013 to keep the cash tills ringing. Now that\u2019s a responsibility. Cats (U) (Tom Hooper, 2019, UK/US) 110 mins Having appalled global film audiences with a nightmarish trailer launch \u2013 featuring the unedifying sight of James Corden, Judi Dench and Jennifer Hudson messing about in cat fur on oversized tables \u2013 this will be counting on the proven appeal of Andrew Lloyd Webber to pull it through. Will that be enough? It will have to be. AP Five of the best \u2026 rock, pop &amp; jazz Mark Ronson Headlining Edinburgh\u2019s Hogmanay celebrations is a pretty good way to round out a not exactly terrible year for the expertly coiffured Mark Ronson. February saw him win an Oscar and two Grammys, while June\u2019s collab-heavy Late Night Feelings album peaked inside the UK\u2019s top five. Celebrate the start of 2020 with some sad bangers and, let\u2019s be honest, at least five plays of Uptown Funk. Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh, New Year\u2019s Eve Annie Mac DJ, curator of both festivals and compilation albums, and occasional TV presenter, Annie Mac has blazed a pretty imperious trail across music this decade. Here she is joined by a host of DJs who, like Mac, come at dance music from varying angles, including Rudimental, Groove Armada, Artwork and Krystal Klear. Mayfield Depot, Manchester, New Year\u2019s Eve Craig David &amp; TSS You are about to feel old. Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Born to Do It, David\u2019s career-launching debut that helped popularise UK garage, beanie hats and the phrase \u201cchilled on Sunday\u201d. There is a big 2020 arena tour to celebrate, obviously, but before that, why not see in the new year with pop\u2019s nicest man in a fancy hall in Westminster? Westminster Central Hall, SW1, New Year\u2019s Eve Shaka Loves You Jamie and Marty, AKA Shaka Loves You, or \u201cSLY\u201d as their bio has it, are perhaps the ultimate cross-generational party band. Fusing funk, soul, disco and hip-hop, they have supported everyone from George Clinton &amp; Parliament Funkadelic to the Jacksons to Will Smith\u2019s friend DJ Jazzy Jeff. Craig Charles has suggested that if you\u2019re not a fan you could \u201cthrow away your ears\u201d. Bit much, to be honest. Nice\u2019n\u2019Sleazy, Glasgow, Saturday 28 December; Hard Rock Cafe, Glasgow, New Year\u2019s Eve MC Scott Hamilton Quartet The 65-year-old expat American saxophonist Scott Hamilton \u2013 a perennially popular jazz itinerant around Europe \u2013 keeps confirming that his glowing tone and effortless mainstream swing are as seductive as ever. Hamilton\u2019s regular London band, including pianist John Pearce, are at his side on these gigs. Pizza Express Jazz Club, W1, New Year\u2019s Day, Thursday 2 &amp; Friday 3; touring to 16 January JF Two of the best \u2026 classical concerts Pavel Kolesnikov Even if it is not always entirely obvious, there is generally a deeper rationale in Pavel Kolesnikov\u2019s programme planning than just selecting works that fit together nicely. But the theme of his latest Wigmore recital is a pretty obvious one. Works connected with the night dominate his choice, whether obviously, as in Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata, one of Schumann\u2019s Op 23 Nachtst\u00fccke, and the Night\u2019s Music movement from Bart\u00f3k\u2019s suite Out of Doors, or more obliquely, in a Chopin sequence that begins with the Fantaisie-Impromptu and ends with the \u201cRaindrop\u201d Prelude. Kolesnikov\u2019s programmes can sometimes seem rather bitty, but as well as the Moonlight Sonata, he also includes Beethoven\u2019s Waldstein Sonata Op 53 in this one, which should be more than enough to demonstrate that he is one of the most gifted pianists of his generation. Wigmore Hall, W1, Friday 3 January Messiah Wherever you are in the weeks leading up to Christmas, there is never a shortage of performances of Handel\u2019s best-known oratorio. But chances to hear Messiah in the aftermath of the festivities are much less common. The Royal Scottish National Orchestra has kept its seasonal performance in reserve for just this time, inviting the Handel specialist Nicholas McGegan to conduct it, with a classy quartet of young soloists \u2013 Rowan Pierce, Diana Moore, Nicholas Mulroy and William Berger \u2013 and the RSNO\u2019s own chorus. It is likely to be a broadly traditional performance, but no doubt McGegan\u2019s period-instrument experience in baroque repertoire will be added into his interpretation, too. Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Thursday 2 January AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Kara Walker One of the best artworks of 2019 is Walker\u2019s colossal fountain in the Tate\u2019s Turbine Hall. At first sight, it is the most traditional sculpture ever created for this gargantuan space: a proper fountain that echoes Victorian art. But it is covered with satirical statuary that tells a savage history of racial injustice. A furious figurative romp. Tate Modern, SE1, to 5 April Elizabeth Price There is nothing like a ghost story at Christmas. You could curl up with MR James or, if you really want to scare yourself silly, visit this exhibition. Price makes video art that is as atmospheric as the best horror. Her tales of terror combine chilling images, macabre facts and disturbing sound to ensnare you in darkness. The Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, to 1 March Turner in January This Hogmanay highlight is one of the most laudable events in the art calendar, as the watercolours of Britain\u2019s greatest landscape artist and the godfather of modern painting are given their month in the winter sun. Scotland was one of Turner\u2019s favourite places, where he befriended Walter Scott and took a steamer to Fingal\u2019s Cave. His watercolours capture the romantic forces of sea, sky and storm. Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, New Year\u2019s Day to 31 January Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece Paintings of the infancy of Christ are trending at this time of year but none is stranger than Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s The Virgin of the Rocks. The National Gallery owns the second version of this surrealistic scene, which he painted after the first was rejected for being borderline heretical. It depicts Mary, Jesus, a young John the Baptist and an angel in a deserted mountainous landscape surrounded by blue water. You sink into this enigma as into a dream. The National Gallery, WC2, to 26 January Troy: Myth and Reality The heroes of Troy fight and die all over again in this fascinating resurrection of a war somewhere between legend and history. Achilles, Helen and the rest who populate Homer\u2019s epic poems are portrayed on ancient Greek red figure vases, in frescoes from Pompeii and even an abstract painting by Cy Twombly. The emotion and drama of the Trojan war makes classical art immediate and moving. British Museum, WC1, to 8 March JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows Mary Poppins Feeling a bit cooped up inside with the family? Mary Poppins will remedy that. The 2004 production, directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne, returns to the West End with the impressive Zizi Strallen starring. There are extra songs from George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, dazzling dance routines and a cracking cameo from Petula Clark as the Bird Woman. Prince Edward Theatre, W1, to 7 June Ghost Quartet For those looking for something a little different, this is the final week of Dave Malloy\u2019s ghostly song cycle, directed by Bill Buckhurst. It is about broken hearts and shattered memories, haunted lovers and two sisters lost in time. With a fragmented narrative and eerie atmosphere, in the intimate new Boulevard Theatre it will cast a spell over you. Boulevard Theatre, W1, to 4 January Swive [Elizabeth] Playwright Ella Hickson and director Natalie Abrahami are joining forces to rewrite the story of Elizabeth I. Political mastermind, resolute survivor \u2013 or how\u2019s about a kingless queen? From the creator of The Writer and the playhouse that brought us Emilia, this should be stirring stuff. Nina Cassell and Abigail Cruttenden head up the cast. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre: Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1, to 15 February Six This madly successful musical continues its whirlwind tour of the UK before the show jets off to Broadway. Every run seems to be adding extra dates: there is something about this bold show \u2013 part gig, part drama, part rally \u2013 that has captured the public\u2019s imagination. It features the six wives of Henry VIII, who take to the mic to tell their tales and rewrite history. The Lowry, Salford, to 5 January; touring to 25 July &amp; Juliet For the pop fans among us all. And the musical fans. And anyone who fancies themselves a feminist. &amp; Juliet opened to rave reviews and is based on the songs of pop-composer extraordinaire Max Martin, who has written for Britney Spears, Katy Perry, \u2018NSync and heaps more.

Birmingham Royal Ballet brings Peter Wright\u2019s production to the Royal Albert Hall for an in-the-round spectacle with a live orchestra and projections by 59 Productions.

      "body": "<p>Sam and Claire Beaumont are in the process of turning their Lake District hill farm on its head.</p> <p>Theirs is a landscape dominated by sheep. But in October they sold their flock of Swaledale sheep, keeping only a handful and replacing the rest with a small herd of hardy Shorthorn cattle.</p> <p>Where most upland farmers graze their stock on the rougher hill ground during the summer, and bring them in to lower-lying paddocks or barns during the winter, the couple\u2019s cows will spend their winter roaming the rugged fell pasture and sheltering in the woods above the farm.</p> <p>Unlike all their farming neighbours, the Beaumonts will not make any hay or silage \u2013 growing grass and then drying or compacting it to feed the animals when fresh grass is in short supply. </p> <p>And then there are the trees. Rejecting the widespread belief that woodland and livestock must not mix, the Beaumonts want to see many more trees on their land.</p> <p>Even their cows don\u2019t graze in the familiar way. Over the summer, Sam has been using electric fencing to restrict the cows to a small sector of each field at a time. They graze intensely, deposit their manure and, every one to three days, are moved onto a fresh patch. This is called regenerative grazing (also known variously as \u201cmob\u201d, \u201cconservation\u201d, \u201cholistic\u201d, \u201cadaptive multi-paddock\u201d grazing) and it is designed to mimic the way that, in intact ecosystems, predators keep large herbivores moving through the landscape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8a3707ecae1403e84ee601e0fc9c75799c561ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8a3707ecae1403e84ee601e0fc9c75799c561ba/0_0_5000_3327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam and Claire Beaumont at their farm close to Ullswater.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam and Claire Beaumont at their farm close to Ullswater</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Cullen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re keen to demonstrate to other farmers in the Lake District that you can farm in a way that increases biodiversity and helps the soil,\u201d says Claire. Crucially, the Beaumonts hope to do this in a way that is also profitable: \u201cWe need to find a farming system that is not reliant on subsidies at all,\u201d says Sam.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Livestock farming in the UK is in a state of turmoil. Farmers, many of whom are already struggling to turn a profit, are facing a rising tide of anti-meat sentiment. They must also square up to the cold reality of Brexit \u2013 and the end of EU farm subsidies that will follow. But even more important is a growing global concern that mainstream farming practices are damaging the environment and exacerbating the climate crisis.</p> <p>Decades of public subsidies that have incentivised the removal of \u201cnon-productive\u201d features, including wetlands, waterways, hedges and woodlands, have removed natural reservoirs for greenhouse gases, destabilised soils and destroyed crucial wildlife habitats. Many farmers, even in the green hills of the Lake District, have also become <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/news/new-report-shows-nature-friendly-hill-farms-can-be-more-profitable\">increasingly reliant</a> on expensive, carbon-intensive and often polluting inputs: processed animal feeds, artificial fertilisers and pesticides. Excessive use of synthetic fertiliser is also a major source of <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2019/09/19/the-greenhouse-gas-no-ones-talking-about-nitrous-oxide-on-farms-explained/\">nitrous oxide</a>, a long-lasting greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide.</p> <p>Then there is the inescapable reality that the flatulence of ruminant mammals, such as cows and sheep, is a significant source of methane, another gas with a more potent climate heating effect than carbon dioxide, at least in the short-term. Finally, there is the charge that overgrazing by sheep has turned great swathes of the UK uplands into a tree-less ecologically impoverished \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/02/lake-district-wildlife-desert-blame-wordsworth\">green desert</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da643f254c1995c80d66753876ff9f7ca3d632b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da643f254c1995c80d66753876ff9f7ca3d632b0/0_0_5000_3327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Many hill farmers rely heavily on EU subsidies for their survival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many hill farmers rely heavily on EU subsidies for their survival</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Cullen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Hall, the National Farmers\u2019 Union\u2019s (NFU) north-west regional director, who is also a sheep farmer, acknowledges that \u201chistorically, parts of the land have been pushed too hard\u201d, but explains there is a growing acceptance among upland farmers that they must find new ways to rise to the challenge of \u201coptimising productivity and playing to the strengths of their land\u201d while also nurturing \u201cnatural capital\u201d.</p> <p>Looking ahead, UK livestock farmers face a stark choice. One option is to double down and intensify their methods to maximise the amount of food they can produce per hectare. The other is to de-intensify farming methods, cut costs and work to restore ecology and resilience, and rely on the market to reward them. That is the path the Beaumonts are pursuing.</p> <p>The Beaumonts are not alone in <a href=\"https://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/17931501.lake-district-hill-farms-fearful-futures/\">reducing stocking densities</a> and switching from sheep to cattle. Much of what this small but growing number of forward-thinking farmers and landowners scattered through the northern uplands are doing is, by their own admission, experimental. But these are experiments the farming community urgently needs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38fbe27bd3e5c7922f56d33a9cec59b775e3e83b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38fbe27bd3e5c7922f56d33a9cec59b775e3e83b/0_0_5000_3327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Beaumonts sold their flock of Swaledale sheep and replaced them with Shorthorn cattle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Beaumonts sold their flock of Swaledale sheep and replaced them with Shorthorn cattle</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Cullen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/news/new-report-shows-nature-friendly-hill-farms-can-be-more-profitable\">report published</a> in November by the RSPB, National Trust and The Wildlife Trusts concluded that farming with lower stocking densities and less costly inputs could be more financially viable for hill farmers.</p> <p>In announcing their ambition to make UK farming <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/news/latest-news/achieving-net-zero-meeting-the-climate-change-challenge/\">carbon neutral by 2040</a>, the NFU tacitly admitted that the whole sector needs to be overhauled to play its part in addressing the climate emergency.</p> <p>\u201cIf you always do what you\u2019ve always done, you\u2019ll always get what you\u2019ve always got,\u201d says Hall. On balance, he is optimistic that real change is afoot. \u201cWe need the early adopters, the innovators and the thought leaders,\u201d he says, but as more farmers start to restructure their businesses, they need advocacy and support too.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Claire grew up on this farm, which sits above the idyllic north shore of Ullswater, before training as an engineer and moving to London to launch her career. During the decade she was there she met Sam, whose family run a sheep farm in Derbyshire. Then in 2017, Claire and Sam took the bold decision to move to the Lake District and steer the family farm in a new direction.</p> <p>Back in the very early days of the project, Caroline Grindrod, a former hill farmer, who founded Wilderculture, an organisation working on rewilding and regenerative agriculture, came to visit the Beaumonts and look at their soil. She took a spade\u2019s-depth of turf and topsoil from the edge of one of the hay meadows. Beneath the closely sheep-cropped grass was a shallow layer of root, and below that sticky, clay-heavy earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"81c3e7b9903b532dec8537faa53690abf5f81bb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81c3e7b9903b532dec8537faa53690abf5f81bb9/0_0_5000_3326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam and Claire Beaumont\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire grew up on the farm before leaving to train as an engineer.

One of its co-authors is Aberdeen University\u2019s Professor Pete Smith, who is also a senior author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Assessment Reports. Smith points to a widespread \u201cmisunderstanding between carbon stocks and carbon sinks\u201d.</p> <p>As he explains it, grassland soils only sequester carbon actively when they are recovering from a state of serious degradation, or when converting from arable to pasture. Once grassland is in a mature state, which he says is the state of most of Britain\u2019s permanent pasture, \u201cthe carbon that comes in is equal to the carbon that\u2019s going out. So you\u2019ve got a high carbon stock but a zero carbon sink.\u201d \u201cAs a climate change solution it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he concludes.</p> <p>Grindrod points to relatively new research <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2017105\">describing pathways</a> thought to fix carbon at greater depths, via the association between plant roots and microbes and mycorrhizal fungi, a process called rhizodeposition. Smith acknowledges that it\u2019s a plausible mechanism, but says there is still little or no evidence that it is a major soil-building mechanism in the UK. So, \u201cif you\u2019re going to be claiming a carbon credit for it, the burden of proof is really to show that it\u2019s happening\u201d.</p> <p>Nor does Smith have much time for the <a href=\"https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/reports/Climate-metrics-for-ruminant-livestock.pdf\">proposed reappraisal</a> of the climatic effect of methane, based on the fact that it is a relatively short-lived greenhouse gas. In his view, methane\u2019s strong warming effect over a short lifetime should be \u201call the more reason to put a lot of effort into reducing that [gas] now\u201d, in order to reach fast-approaching targets for net zero.</p> <p>As Smith acknowledges, the greenhouse gas budget of livestock farms could shift dramatically, once increased tree cover becomes part of the plan.</p> <p>Despite being the dominant mode of farming for many thousands of years, silvopasture, the practice of integrating livestock with woodland, is something of a forgotten art in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ce824a6072fa3fbbb3a43e9e7ac87e3b483984c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ce824a6072fa3fbbb3a43e9e7ac87e3b483984c/0_163_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cattle on pasture\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cattle will spend winter roaming the rugged fell pasture and sheltering in the woods above the farm</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Cullen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The upper part of the Beaumonts\u2019 farm is soggy underfoot and dominated by a monotonous sea of unpalatable soft rush and rank purple moor-grass.

He hopes more farmers will come to see them \u201cas a benefit rather than a hindrance to their stock\u201d.</p> <p>Combining grazing with significant new tree growth is the clearest path towards reducing the climate impact of cows and sheep. As Smith explains, each hectare of trees can sequester around 300 tonnes of carbon as they grow to maturity. Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/\">Project Drawdown</a>, a climate change mitigation initiative, identified silvopasture as one of<a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank\"> the top </a><a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank\">10 solutions</a> to climate change.

Grindrod disagrees emphatically. \u201cFencing off and planting trees isn\u2019t really rewilding, and it certainly isn\u2019t functional ecosystem restoration,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Citing the work of Dutch ecologist Frans Vera, Grindrod points out that, before humans made a substantial impact, this part of the world was not exclusively forested. Mixed woodland would have been interspersed by grassy meadows, clearings and scrub. Large herbivores played a crucial role in maintaining these rich and diverse ecosystems. \u201cA woodland without livestock is not a truly functional ecosystem\u201d she says. The Beaumonts want to see their cows recycling nutrients, spreading seed and clearing out dominant grasses and bracken that can lock up fertility and choke out young trees.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The Beaumonts are still in the early stages of their journey, but already there are signs of hope. After just one summer, they describe finding scabious, ragged robin and other wildflowers they have never seen there before, as well as young oak and alder trees establishing themselves.

      "bodyText": "Sam and Claire Beaumont are in the process of turning their Lake District hill farm on its head. Theirs is a landscape dominated by sheep. But in October they sold their flock of Swaledale sheep, keeping only a handful and replacing the rest with a small herd of hardy Shorthorn cattle. Where most upland farmers graze their stock on the rougher hill ground during the summer, and bring them in to lower-lying paddocks or barns during the winter, the couple\u2019s cows will spend their winter roaming the rugged fell pasture and sheltering in the woods above the farm. Unlike all their farming neighbours, the Beaumonts will not make any hay or silage \u2013 growing grass and then drying or compacting it to feed the animals when fresh grass is in short supply. And then there are the trees. Rejecting the widespread belief that woodland and livestock must not mix, the Beaumonts want to see many more trees on their land. Even their cows don\u2019t graze in the familiar way. Over the summer, Sam has been using electric fencing to restrict the cows to a small sector of each field at a time. They graze intensely, deposit their manure and, every one to three days, are moved onto a fresh patch. This is called regenerative grazing (also known variously as \u201cmob\u201d, \u201cconservation\u201d, \u201cholistic\u201d, \u201cadaptive multi-paddock\u201d grazing) and it is designed to mimic the way that, in intact ecosystems, predators keep large herbivores moving through the landscape. \u201cWe\u2019re keen to demonstrate to other farmers in the Lake District that you can farm in a way that increases biodiversity and helps the soil,\u201d says Claire. Crucially, the Beaumonts hope to do this in a way that is also profitable: \u201cWe need to find a farming system that is not reliant on subsidies at all,\u201d says Sam. *** Livestock farming in the UK is in a state of turmoil. Farmers, many of whom are already struggling to turn a profit, are facing a rising tide of anti-meat sentiment. They must also square up to the cold reality of Brexit \u2013 and the end of EU farm subsidies that will follow. But even more important is a growing global concern that mainstream farming practices are damaging the environment and exacerbating the climate crisis. Decades of public subsidies that have incentivised the removal of \u201cnon-productive\u201d features, including wetlands, waterways, hedges and woodlands, have removed natural reservoirs for greenhouse gases, destabilised soils and destroyed crucial wildlife habitats. Many farmers, even in the green hills of the Lake District, have also become increasingly reliant on expensive, carbon-intensive and often polluting inputs: processed animal feeds, artificial fertilisers and pesticides. Excessive use of synthetic fertiliser is also a major source of nitrous oxide, a long-lasting greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Then there is the inescapable reality that the flatulence of ruminant mammals, such as cows and sheep, is a significant source of methane, another gas with a more potent climate heating effect than carbon dioxide, at least in the short-term. Finally, there is the charge that overgrazing by sheep has turned great swathes of the UK uplands into a tree-less ecologically impoverished \u201cgreen desert\u201d. David Hall, the National Farmers\u2019 Union\u2019s (NFU) north-west regional director, who is also a sheep farmer, acknowledges that \u201chistorically, parts of the land have been pushed too hard\u201d, but explains there is a growing acceptance among upland farmers that they must find new ways to rise to the challenge of \u201coptimising productivity and playing to the strengths of their land\u201d while also nurturing \u201cnatural capital\u201d. Looking ahead, UK livestock farmers face a stark choice. One option is to double down and intensify their methods to maximise the amount of food they can produce per hectare. The other is to de-intensify farming methods, cut costs and work to restore ecology and resilience, and rely on the market to reward them. That is the path the Beaumonts are pursuing. The Beaumonts are not alone in reducing stocking densities and switching from sheep to cattle. Much of what this small but growing number of forward-thinking farmers and landowners scattered through the northern uplands are doing is, by their own admission, experimental. But these are experiments the farming community urgently needs. A report published in November by the RSPB, National Trust and The Wildlife Trusts concluded that farming with lower stocking densities and less costly inputs could be more financially viable for hill farmers. In announcing their ambition to make UK farming carbon neutral by 2040, the NFU tacitly admitted that the whole sector needs to be overhauled to play its part in addressing the climate emergency. \u201cIf you always do what you\u2019ve always done, you\u2019ll always get what you\u2019ve always got,\u201d says Hall. On balance, he is optimistic that real change is afoot. \u201cWe need the early adopters, the innovators and the thought leaders,\u201d he says, but as more farmers start to restructure their businesses, they need advocacy and support too. *** Claire grew up on this farm, which sits above the idyllic north shore of Ullswater, before training as an engineer and moving to London to launch her career. During the decade she was there she met Sam, whose family run a sheep farm in Derbyshire. Then in 2017, Claire and Sam took the bold decision to move to the Lake District and steer the family farm in a new direction. Back in the very early days of the project, Caroline Grindrod, a former hill farmer, who founded Wilderculture, an organisation working on rewilding and regenerative agriculture, came to visit the Beaumonts and look at their soil. She took a spade\u2019s-depth of turf and topsoil from the edge of one of the hay meadows. Beneath the closely sheep-cropped grass was a shallow layer of root, and below that sticky, clay-heavy earth. She then hopped over the wall to the fringe of a wood that had not been grazed. The grass grew longer, but so too did the roots - dramatically so. And attached to the deep roots were crumbly aggregates of brown, well-aerated soil. The field soil, already waterlogged, refused to absorb any more water. The wood-edge soil, although based on identical geology, absorbed water like a sponge: a graphic demonstration of the dramatic role healthy soils can play in preventing flooding, erosion and nutrient leaching by holding water on the land. \u201cThe soil comes first,\u201d says Sam, explaining that bringing the farm\u2019s soil back to thriving health is their central ambition. Healthy soils don\u2019t just store water, they also lock down large amounts of greenhouse gases. Maintaining healthy soils is not just critical for food production and biodiversity, but also at the vanguard of the fight to tackle climate breakdown. \u201cRest,\u201d says Sam, \u201cis the most important tool in managing grassland.\u201d During the un-grazed weeks or months, advocates of regenerative grazing report that the grasses and other plants expand their root systems, lay down leaf litter, and encourage the growth of soil-forming bugs, worms and microorganisms, which all build fertility and accumulate carbon underground. The degree to which soil can sequester carbon, and whether it can keep doing so in perpetuity, is the subject of rapidly advancing scientific research and increasingly rancorous debate, however. A 2017 report challenged the bold claims made by some champions of regenerative grazing. One of its co-authors is Aberdeen University\u2019s Professor Pete Smith, who is also a senior author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Assessment Reports. Smith points to a widespread \u201cmisunderstanding between carbon stocks and carbon sinks\u201d. As he explains it, grassland soils only sequester carbon actively when they are recovering from a state of serious degradation, or when converting from arable to pasture. Once grassland is in a mature state, which he says is the state of most of Britain\u2019s permanent pasture, \u201cthe carbon that comes in is equal to the carbon that\u2019s going out. So you\u2019ve got a high carbon stock but a zero carbon sink.\u201d \u201cAs a climate change solution it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he concludes. Grindrod points to relatively new research describing pathways thought to fix carbon at greater depths, via the association between plant roots and microbes and mycorrhizal fungi, a process called rhizodeposition. Smith acknowledges that it\u2019s a plausible mechanism, but says there is still little or no evidence that it is a major soil-building mechanism in the UK. So, \u201cif you\u2019re going to be claiming a carbon credit for it, the burden of proof is really to show that it\u2019s happening\u201d. Nor does Smith have much time for the proposed reappraisal of the climatic effect of methane, based on the fact that it is a relatively short-lived greenhouse gas. In his view, methane\u2019s strong warming effect over a short lifetime should be \u201call the more reason to put a lot of effort into reducing that [gas] now\u201d, in order to reach fast-approaching targets for net zero. As Smith acknowledges, the greenhouse gas budget of livestock farms could shift dramatically, once increased tree cover becomes part of the plan. Despite being the dominant mode of farming for many thousands of years, silvopasture, the practice of integrating livestock with woodland, is something of a forgotten art in the UK. The upper part of the Beaumonts\u2019 farm is soggy underfoot and dominated by a monotonous sea of unpalatable soft rush and rank purple moor-grass. The Beaumonts want to turn it into wood pasture. As well as providing much-needed winter cover for their cows, the Beaumonts explain that trees improve soil by aerating it and making available nutrients and minerals from deep below the surface. The NFU\u2019s Hall is also supportive, pointing to the positive role trees play in flood management. He hopes more farmers will come to see them \u201cas a benefit rather than a hindrance to their stock\u201d. Combining grazing with significant new tree growth is the clearest path towards reducing the climate impact of cows and sheep. As Smith explains, each hectare of trees can sequester around 300 tonnes of carbon as they grow to maturity. Moreover, Project Drawdown, a climate change mitigation initiative, identified silvopasture as one of the top 10 solutions to climate change. By their calculations, it is not far behind the deployment of solar farms. Some will always argue that if restoring biodiversity, managing water and locking down carbon are our priorities, we should remove large herbivores from the uplands altogether. Grindrod disagrees emphatically. \u201cFencing off and planting trees isn\u2019t really rewilding, and it certainly isn\u2019t functional ecosystem restoration,\u201d she says. Citing the work of Dutch ecologist Frans Vera, Grindrod points out that, before humans made a substantial impact, this part of the world was not exclusively forested.

One of their neighbours is James Rebanks, author of The Shepherd\u2019s Life, which describes the traditional way of life of Cumbrian shepherds. Rebanks, who is himself experimenting with some regenerative agriculture techniques, is supportive of the Beaumonts\u2019 plans.

      "bodyText": "Australian coal exporters have experienced the biggest annual drop in thermal coal prices in more than a decade during 2019, raising doubts about industry projections that demand will continue to grow. The spot price of thermal coal, which is burned to generate electricity, was US$66.20 ($95) last week, down more than a third from US$100.73 ($145) a year earlier. According to the government\u2019s latest resources and quarterly energy report, it is expected to cut export earnings from the industry from last year\u2019s record A$26bn to A$20.6bn this year and A$18.8bn next year. The drop in price came as China increased its reliance on domestic coal stocks and tightened its use of imported coal, particularly from Australia. The International Energy Agency recently found global thermal coal use declined this year after rising in 2017 and 2018, but forecast a slight increase over the next five years as rising demand from India offset a shift away from it in Europe and the US. A more detailed analysis of 2019 trends by several thinktanks found coal-fired electricity was headed for a 3% fall, the biggest drop on record after more than four decades of near-uninterrupted growth in which coal-fired power has been a primary driver of the climate crisis. The decrease has been driven by a historically sharp reduction in Europe, where demand for coal-fired power fell 23%, and the US, where it dropped 14% in the first nine months of the year despite Donald Trump\u2019s vow that he would resurrect the local industry. In major Asian markets, where Australia sells its coal, the analysis found generation in China increased 0.5% but dipped in India due to a much smaller increase in demand for electricity than in recent years and a large monsoon boosting hydro energy. For Australian coal exporters, the biggest change has been China imposing what effectively amounted to an unannounced ban on taking their product while boosting the domestic industry as it faced a trade war with the US. Several Chinese ports restricted or delayed Australian coal imports. Tim Buckley, from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said China had constrained supply from Australia while increasing it from some producers, such as Mongolia. Beyond China\u2019s greater emphasis on domestic production, Buckley said the fall in coal use had been driven by the rise of increasingly cheap renewable energy and liquified natural gas, a fossil fuel with about half the emissions of coal when burned but possibly more, according to some research, when extracted. He said the drop in the thermal coal price would not necessarily continue into 2020, but current trends suggested the Australian industry could not rely on demand from south and south-east Asia continuing to grow. Buckley\u2019s assessment is at odds with that of the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), which suggested Australia\u2019s thermal coal exports would increase 1.6% a year until 2024 as demand from India and southeast Asia grew. The IEA report, released earlier this month, thanked experts from coal companies and the Minerals Council of Australia for their input into its analysis. Matthew Canavan, the resources minister, recently told The Australian that Australia would \u201cneed more than Adani\u201d to keep up with the expected growth in demand from developing Asian countries. He said that would likely lead to the opening of not just the Carmichael mine being developed by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, but further coal mines in Queensland\u2019s Galilee Basin. A previous analysis by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie found any new mines in the Galilee Basin would be expected to be in competition with existing mines in the state and New South Wales. Buckley said the IEA had repeatedly underestimated the pace of growth in renewable energy, and it was likely Asia would follow a similar pattern as Europe and the US. He gave the example of Vietnam, which had increased its installation of solar power tenfold this year, albeit off a low base. \u201cCoal-fired power is down because it\u2019s the highest marginal cost source of electricity in most markets,\u201d he said. \u201cRenewable energy is now available at scale and at lower prices. That will increasingly be the case.\u201d The government\u2019s resources and energy quarterly report said the collapse in the thermal coal price had created major problems for US miners, leading to seven filing for bankruptcy in the past four months. It said Australian producers had faired better due to their higher quality coal and the weaker currency, but would also be affected by market conditions. Analysts say the slump has threatened the viability of billions of dollars of coal projects. The report said prices for metallurgical coal, which is used in steel-making and accounts for around 60% of Australia\u2019s coal export earnings, had also fallen noticeably. Buckley said China\u2019s targeting of Australian coal appeared political, and was ongoing. \u201cIt introduced an artificial barrier to Australian coal on an ad hoc basis, saying it could not unload ships, and that intensified later in the year,\u201d he said. Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that limiting global warming to 1.5C, a goal referenced in the Paris climate agreement, would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. The Minerals Council declined to comment.",

He put on a momentum-changing 150 with Tim Paine whose dashing 79 was his highest Test score as captain. A late slog for quick runs ended with Australia all out for 467, a first innings total well above par considering the amount of movement on offer with the new ball.</p> <p>That total was soon made to look gargantuan when Pat Cummins dismantled makeshift opener Tom Blundell\u2019s technique (15) and Kane Williamson (9) miscued a pull off James Pattinson to leave his side miles behind. </p> <p>With three scorching hot days to come New Zealand face the prospect of long drawn out torture simply to remain alive in the series.

On its way to the fence the ball thumped into the robot camera that patrols the boundary and hit it with such force the nearly-new Kookaburra needs replacing.

A couple more follow soon after for Blundell, who is very still and very crouched at the crease.

We also take a fifteen-minutes break at the end of the third session, and return for a \u2018fourth session\u2019. The first three can be shorter in duration (24 overs each) to ensure the same amount of significant play happens in the fourth one, with the players recharged and at the top of their games more frequently than what a Test\u2019s current format allows. The presence of this \u2018fourth session\u2019 will contribute to more dynamic passages of play tactics, especially under the lights, and also attract bigger crowds to the match after working hours.

For Travis Head, this really is one of those hits. Despite his impressive 2019 numbers, it\u2019s clear the South Australian sits lowest on the Australian top six pecking order. A big ton on this big stage could change that in a real hurry. Getting a start during a tough period last night, now\u2019s the moment for him to come back to the MCG - on what will most likely be the best day to bat during the contest - and fill his boots alongside Steve Smith. </p> <p>For the former captain, he has 23 runs to collect in order to clock his fifth Boxing Day Test ton. He spent the majority of day one in the middle, facing 192 balls along the way. So far, it has been a long way from his most fluent hand in the green helmet but that means nothing to a machine like Smith. Indeed, it is the least pretty tons that he values highest - take his gems at Pune and Brisbane in 2017.</p> <p>As for the visitors, they get a window this morning with a second new ball that\u2019s still relatively hard. But it won\u2019t be open for long. The pitch, which had so much in it on the opening morning, was really flattening out by the close yesterday. They need to be well into Australia\u2019s lower order by drinks this morning. Don\u2019t doubt for a moment them coming out hard with a predominantly short-pitched barrage. </p> <p>Thanks for joining our day two coverage. Along with JP Howcroft, we\u2019re looking forward to your company throughout.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the report of day two at the MCG. If Australia shaded Boxing Day they stamped their authority all over this Test match on day two against New Zealand, batting the tourists into distraction for most of the day and then firing out two top-order stars before the close. The Kiwis are already facing an uphill task to avoid consecutive humiliating defeats. Steve Smith laid the platform, patiently accumulating 85 before Travis Head (114) took on the job of shepherd, inching to his second Test century and securing his short-term future in the process. He put on a momentum-changing 150 with Tim Paine whose dashing 79 was his highest Test score as captain. A late slog for quick runs ended with Australia all out for 467, a first innings total well above par considering the amount of movement on offer with the new ball. That total was soon made to look gargantuan when Pat Cummins dismantled makeshift opener Tom Blundell\u2019s technique (15) and Kane Williamson (9) miscued a pull off James Pattinson to leave his side miles behind. With three scorching hot days to come New Zealand face the prospect of long drawn out torture simply to remain alive in the series. To find out if they can survive tomorrow\u2019s examination join Adam Collins and I right here. 18th over: New Zealand 44-2 (Latham 9, Taylor 2) Lyon gets another opportunity and he finds a tempting line and length outside off stump that has Taylor watchfully smothering anything coming his way. 17th over: New Zealand 43-2 (Latham 9, Taylor 1) Pattinson continues to hurl himself into his work but Latham is up to the task, defending anything straight, leaving anything wide, and working a couple off his pads for good measure. 16th over: New Zealand 41-2 (Latham 7, Taylor 1) Nathan Lyon with an early look at the pitch and he begins by inducing a thick edge from Latham\u2019s lope forward. Not much else worth reporting as New Zealand put their shots away with the close of play under ten minutes away. Cummins\u2019 superb opening spell was seven overs, one for eight, by the way. 15th over: New Zealand 40-2 (Latham 6, Taylor 1) Oh boy, if Cummins to Latham is a match-up Australia like then they love Pattinson to Taylor. The first ball of the over is clipped in the air to short leg but it\u2019s too hot to hold for the man under the lid. The second rips through Taylor\u2019s forward press, smacks into the pad and umpire Erasmus raises his finger! TAYLOR REVIEWS, AND DRS INDICATES THE BALL WAS BOUNCING OVER THE TOP. That was full enough to give with the naked eye but Taylor survives. 14th over: New Zealand 40-2 (Latham 6, Taylor 1) Latham is not happy at all repeatedly facing Cummins. His latest interrogation features a short ball that leaves a cherry red mark on his white shirt just below his silver fern. Pinned to his crease Cummins then targets the pads but Latham gets enough bat in the way to prolong his torture. 13th over: New Zealand 39-2 (Latham 6, Taylor 0) To use host broadcaster parlance, Pattinson is up and about. When he gets his tail up like this he reminds me of a juvenile Rottweiler, muscular and eager, with that slight hint of undomesticated menace about him. With the added energy boost of his wicket he beats Latham for pace and arrows in a superb yorker that is only just repelled. Full and wide from Pattinson so Williamson reaches and strokes a cover drive that travels about as far as a cricket ball can in a Test arena without touching a rope. The all-run four means Williamson retains the strike and he perishes next ball! Quick and short from Pattinson, tucking Williamson up, but the Kiwi skipper nonetheless tries the pull, but he can only top-edge high in the air for Paine to run around to leg-gully and pouch the catch. Huge dismissal. Australia steamrollering their way through this match now. 12th over: New Zealand 35-1 (Latham 6, Williamson 5) Latham accepts a rare invitation to get forward and pushes a couple through the covers. The movement and timing probably warranted a boundary but Latham\u2019s closed bat face once again proved his undoing. Ricky Ponting then goes on to forensically examine Latham\u2019s flawed technique, concluding that it is not good, especially outside off stump. Cummins illustrates the point by whistling a delivery past the outside edge, getting one to hold its line from around the wicket. 11th over: New Zealand 33-1 (Latham 4, Williamson 5) Pattinson must bowl about the heaviest ball in the game. It really does thud into the bat. New Zealand play him well this over though, trusting the length, and the pitch, which has so far not misbehaved since the innings break. 10th over: New Zealand 31-1 (Latham 3, Williamson 4) The first slightly wayward over from Cummins in his spell but Latham can only fashion two from it, missing out on a leg stump full toss. This is Cummins we\u2019re talking about, so even a below-par set of six contains the odd pearler, including the final delivery that cuts Latham in half and almost grazes the inside-edge of his bat. During the drinks break another AFL footballer is interviewed by the host broadcaster. That particular intervention with Steele Sidebottom was about as vapid as you could design, including an admission from Sidebottom that he\u2019d never watched a Test at the G before, which is about as un-Victorian as it gets. 9th over: New Zealand 29-1 (Latham 1, Williamson 4) Time for James Pattinson, and the parochial Victorian crowd roars its approval. Pattinson is a big strong fella, built like a rugby union centre, or the trunk of a gum tree in the Dandenong Ranges. He starts well, finding a Cummins-like line and length in excess of 140kph. Williamson squirts a single behind point and Latham scampers a leg-bye as New Zealand inch their score along as the final drinks break of the day begins. 8th over: New Zealand 27-1 (Latham 1, Williamson 3) Cummins now coming around the wicket to Latham, and he almost gets his man with a beauty that jags in off the seam and almost finds the inside edge. Cummins ends the over with his third maiden, moreover, there\u2019s been just one scoring shot in the 24 deliveries he\u2019s sent down this afternoon so far. 7th over: New Zealand 27-1 (Latham 1, Williamson 3) Williamson can\u2019t resist chasing a wide one off Starc and he almost perishes in the gully. Starc then bowls a bouncer so high it\u2019s called a wide then slings down a wicked in-swinging yorker. Line and length then completes the variations from this fast bowling enigma. 6th over: New Zealand 26-1 (Latham 1, Williamson 3) Williamson off the mark with a late cut for three down to third-man, but the over belonged to Pat Cummins and yet another demonstration of his class. Simply too good for Tom Blundell. He needed just three sighters before landing the ball on the precise line and length required to snare his man. Wonderful controlled fast bowling. Blundell has started positively but the signs of some technical deficiencies are starting to emerge. He does like to feel bat on ball away from his body... and right on cue... he drives at a tempting length and feathers a regulation behind. Terrific start for Australia and another selection headache at the top of the order for the Kiwis. 5th over: New Zealand 23-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 15) There\u2019s that backfoot drive again from Blundell, right up en pointe, guiding Starc through point for three. Australia\u2019s big quick is reaching some tasty speeds but his radar isn\u2019t quite calibrated. 4th over: New Zealand 20-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 12) If Starc to Blundell is unpredictable and full of incident, Cummins to Latham is a study of discipline. The bowler, charging in over the wicket, is aiming to hit the seam and angle the ball away from the batsman just short of a good length. Latham is watchful, hanging back and leaving as often as he can. He is doing so as much on height as line but it almost undoes him late in the over when Cummins produces the one that goes the other way and almost pins his man LBW. 3rd over: New Zealand 20-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 12) Beautiful shot from Blundell, emerging from his crouch like a sunflower addressing the sky , standing tall, and executing a classic backfoot square drive for four. Starc, with his dander up, then hurls down his first bouncer of the day and it flies and flies and flies, over the batsman, over the keeper, one bounce for four byes! Oh dear. On its way to the fence the ball thumped into the robot camera that patrols the boundary and hit it with such force the nearly-new Kookaburra needs replacing. The second ball of the innings is soon back where the first one perished, courtesy of a fine glance for four. All action at the MCG with Starc touching 150kph. 2nd over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 4) Cummins shares the new ball and he almost has Latham first up! Short and on the hip Latham can only glove nervously around the corner and look on in relief as the Kookaburra lands between short-leg and the keeper. The remainder of the over is angled across the batsman, the final delivery beating the outside edge for pace and bounce. \u201cAfternoon Jonathan from a rather grey and very strike-bound Paris. (France, not Texas),\u201d Gervase Greene, always a pleasure to hear from you. \u201cI have been waiting much of the day for Pain(e) to miscue a square cut down to fine-leg off CdG so I could contribute a witty bon mot on this game of French cricket. Like hopeful passengers on the Metro, I\u2019m still waiting.\u201d 1st over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 4) Starc opens with a no-ball that the left-handed Latham works away for a single. The right-handed Blundell then survives a nifty in-swinger before nudging off his pads for his first two runs as a Test opener. A couple more follow soon after for Blundell, who is very still and very crouched at the crease. The over ends with Blundell playing and missing a howitzer that thunders into Paine\u2019s gloves. No bouncer from Starc that over so it\u2019s hard to discern what the pitch is doing. There was a bit of shape in the air but nothing prodigious. There will be 20 more overs before the close of play. The heavy roller rumbles away from centre stage. Mitchell Starc prowls at the top of his mark. Toms Latham and Blundell adjust their grilles. Here we go! The obvious question now is: how will the pitch behave? It\u2019s hard to answer conclusive I\u2019m afraid. The surface is generally on the slowish side but there are the small indentations created yesterday by the new ball on the soft top that allow for occasional uneven bounce. If Australia\u2019s taller, faster, pacemen can hit those pock marks, the wicket could prove a handful. Trent Boult found those spots in his most recent spell and there was enough in his effort balls to suggest the New Zealand openers will not relish the conditions. Australia\u2019s first innings began poorly with the cheap dismissal of Joe Burns but it\u2019s been all uphill since then, ending with a very healthy 467. Travis Head\u2019s second Test century is the standout individual score but much is owed to Steve Smith for grafting his way through 242 deliveries when New Zealand were at their most threatening. Tim Paine\u2019s rapid 79 gave the innings some impetus late-on, setting up the post-tea thrash. What have New Zealand got in response? That\u2019s your lot. Lyon can\u2019t resist hooking Southee and he helps it all the way to the safe hands of Wagner on the fine-leg boundary. 155th over: Australia 467-9 (Pattinson 14, Lyon 1) Wagner is hunting a five-for but he can\u2019t bag it this over. Pattinson looks to be ending any debate over who bats eight in the future when he lines up alongside both Cummins and Starc. 154th over: Australia 463-9 (Pattinson 11, Lyon 0) Before Cummins\u2019 wicket Pattinson absolutely smoked Southee through midwicket for four. After it Lyon dabbed three defensive prods. Another one goes hitting out, Cummins this time, swiping Southee to midwicket where Latham holds on. 153rd over: Australia 458-8 (Pattinson 6, Cummins 0) Australia continue to bat on despite the wickets falling and Wagner - in the 153rd over of the innings - celebrates a wicket-maiden. Head holes out, miscuing Wagner high to point where Santner takes a simple running catch. Superb innings. Deserves the standing ovation from 50,000+ inside the MCG. 152nd over: Australia 458-7 (Head 114, Pattinson 6) Southee is just cannon fodder now with Australia in T20 mode, but with the field well-placed he concedes just four singles. 151st over: Australia 454-7 (Head 112, Pattinson 4) Edges, run outs, LBW appeals, Mitchell Santner, nothing has gone right for New Zealand this match so far. And Head, of course, rubs salt into the wounds, ramping Wagner for four then belting him for four like a Roger Federer crosscourt backhand. Australia are now out here for a good time, not a long time. Wagner invites Williamson to go upstairs again in search of an LBW and it looks a good call. He beats Head down the leg-side with the batter well across his stumps. Was there an inside-edge? DRS reveals it is as close to out as you can get but the margin for error on height is just - barely - umpire\u2019s call, so Head survives. New Zealand\u2019s poor fortune continues to stalk them. 150th over: Australia 444-7 (Head 104 Pattinson 4) After Head raised his bat, Pattinson leaned into a cover drive sweeter than any we\u2019ve seen all Test. Sumptuous timing for four. Australia hurtling towards a declaration now. By the way, Head is the first South Australian since... Jason Gillespie to score a Test century. The batsmen crossed during Starc\u2019s dismissal, meaning Head is on strike for a possible five deliveries of Southee\u2019s over. He needs only two to bring up his second Test century, driving square on the off-side for four, removing his helmet and smiling in relief after finally converting one of his many starts into an historic contribution. Southee replaces Santner and jags a wicket first ball. Starc tried to send a mid-iron into the Yarra but he chunked it, lobbing a simple catch to mid-on. Both Cummins and Pattinson must be giggling into their Fast Bowling Cartel (TM) apparel. 149th over: Australia 435-6 (Head 99, Starc 1) #Declarationspeculation just got exciting. Intrigue over who would bat eight for Australia was supposed to be about Cummins and Pattinson but out strides Starc, presumably to long-handle a few en route to a declaration sooner rather than later. He does his bit for Head and gets off strike smartish, but the man 99 not out cannot squeeze his way to a ton from three Wagner deliveries despite one of them being a knee-high slow full toss. Wagner comes around the wicket for the second over after tea, and he begins with a full fast delivery that raps Paine on his front pad. An LBW appeal follows, declined on-filed, but sent upstairs by Williamson. DRS has to consider whether Paine got his pad outside the line (he didn\u2019t) and whether the ball would have bounced over the bails (it wouldn\u2019t) which means the Aussie skipper has to depart for a well-made 79. 148th over: Australia 434-5 (Head 99, Paine 79) Single to Paine, then a single to Head, a couple of dots, then Santner beats Paine for bounce before the skipper pinches a single to leave Head at the non-striker\u2019s end on 99 at the start of the next over. Ian Loiterton (not using his wife\u2019s phone today, it must be stressed) has combined storylines, roping in both Graeme Hick and dodgy declarations into this awkward moment in Ashes history. \u201cThis in response to an earlier tweet asking about declarations that left a batsman short of a milestone - from Wisden\u2019s all time list of notorious declarations: In the mid-90s, England\u2019s cricketers were on a downer. But contriving to sabotage a positive position in an Ashes Test was some effort, even by their standards. After bowling Australia out for 116 to lead by 198 on first innings, captain Mike Atherton wanted quick runs to set the Aussies a stiff target and have time to bowl them out again. But irritated by Graeme Hick\u2019s slow scoring \u2013 36 runs in 80 minutes on the fourth afternoon \u2013 he declared with Hick just two runs shy of a maiden Ashes century. The match petered out into a draw, and Hick allegedly refused to speak to Athers for the remainder of the tour.\u201d Peter Kell is on the front line at the MCG, and the news is worrying. \u201cAfter 3 o\u2019clock, patrons at the bar in the Great Southern Stand are restricted to two beers per customer. They are serving weak mid-strength beer, hardly conducive to a mutiny. But there is a stampede for the urinals. Maybe the MCG is going retro as it\u2019s US army camp days as Camp Murphy when it was dry and alcohol free? Maybe the corporate bars and areas are the only places to get full strength beer?\u201d. Thoughts and prayers Peter, thoughts and prayers. Australia have progressively asphyxiated New Zealand during this Test and they tightened their grip during a dominant afternoon session. There is surely now only one possible winner in this match, all that remains to be seen is if the Kiwis can mount a rearguard with the bat to force a draw. Join us in about 20 minutes or so when we\u2019ll find out if Head and Paine can raise their bats, and for an escalation in #Declarationspeculation. 147th over: Australia 431-5 (Head 98, Paine 77) Maiden from Boult. Head will have to stew over his brew during the tea break. 146th over: Australia 431-5 (Head 98, Paine 77) Head moves to 98 courtesy of another Santner over with all the menace of a mung bean. Can he sneak to three figures before Tea? 145th over: Australia 428-5 (Head 96, Paine 76) Travis Head has toiled in the 90s like a studio engineer on a Smashing Pumpkins record. His wait for a ton is now in excess of 30 minutes. Michale Barker has joined in the #Declarationspeculation. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the magic number for the declaration, or is it a magic time of the day today?\u201d I reckon it\u2019s a time thing. There are 34 overs left in the day. Australia would want around 15 of them at New Zealand I\u2019d guess, so a declaration in around 20 overs or so feels right to me. Head cramping up on his way to a ton has confused matters, but I reckon Australia will come out after tea in T20 mode and blast it for an hour before jogging in. 144th over: Australia 422-5 (Head 95, Paine 76) Santner continues his filler overs. He is to Test bowling today what Diagnosis Murder or Escape To The Country are for TV schedulers. 143rd over: Australia 417-5 (Head 92, Paine 74) Desperate to hold our attention Paine and Head almost conspire for a run out but the latter makes his ground following an unnecessarily tight single. Boult responds by flinging down the most fearsome couple of deliveries of the day - and perhaps the match - that will have Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson licking their lips. Both balls short, but not on Boult\u2019s toes, and both had Travis Head hopping nervously and flinching inside the line. 142nd over: Australia 417-5 (Head 92, Paine 74) Santner, and New Zealand, going through the motions. Three off the over. This has sparked plenty of debate during the Test... 141st over: Australia 414-5 (Head 91, Paine 72) Trent Boult replaces Neil Wagner in some forlorn attempt by Kane Williamson to convince us New Zealand remain committed to taking 20 wickets. The paceman goes for three in an over highlighted by a Paine drive that was timed sweetly but just reminded all involved that this multi-paced surface is far from a road. This, this is why I do this job. \u201cHi Jonathan,\u201d hi Keith. \u201cYour story about AEJ Collins smashing 628 not out reminded me of the last day of school back in 1988. Most of the kids didn\u2019t turn up. Another teacher and myself set up the Kanga Cricket set and told the 20 or so kids around that they could have a bat when they got either Mr Hume or myself out. At little lunch, we were 394-0 and the fielding side had reduced to 14. By lunch, we had pushed on to 781-0. Humey had survived a couple of close LBW decisions and I had been caught off a no ball. Only six fielders returned after the main break and they lost interest when they discovered we weren\u2019t going to declare. Not sure what the total was when the last kid gave up but we were well beyond a thousand. It sounds mean but we calculated that between us we had spent more than 230 lunchtimes that year coaching cricket and had become very adept at eating while standing.\u201d 140th over: Australia 411-5 (Head 91, Paine 69) Just the one from Santner\u2019s latest over. 139th over: Australia 410-5 (Head 91, Paine 68) Wagner bowls some chin music to Paine, who is circumspect, until he hooks just short of fine-leg. Head then allows his thigh-pad to deflect four leg-byes. I reckon we\u2019re 20-25 overs until the declaration, allowing Australia 15-20 overs at New Zealand tonight. 138th over: Australia 405-5 (Head 91, Paine 67) Nobody winced at any of Santner\u2019s deliveries that over. So that\u2019s a win, right? He\u2019s still 0-68 from 15 overs this Boxing Day Test and clearly lost the confidence of his skipper though. Australia are now on 405 - the sum their batting coach achieved all on his own a few years ago. 137th over: Australia 402-5 (Head 90, Paine 65) Paine moves to his second highest Test score with a dab into the off-side. It\u2019s the only scoring shot of an over of Wagner bumpers that features Paine charging the Kiwi like a confident physics teacher demonstrating some kind of scientific principle that prevents Wagner bowling a delivery low enough to hit a man of average height on the move. 136th over: Australia 401-5 (Head 90, Paine 64) \u201cIt\u2019s another pie\u201d exclaims Ricky Ponting, after one delivery of Mitchell Santner\u2019s over, with pain coursing through his commentary, like a restaurant critic enduring the world\u2019s worst degustation. That pie went for four, by the way. Australia pass 400. #Declarationspeculation must be 4.30-5pm, right? 135th over: Australia 395-5 (Head 85, Paine 63) The hopelessness of the situation isn\u2019t going to stop Neil Wagner from committing every ounce of energy to chucking bouncers at Australian batsmen. He does so again for the 32nd time this Test and after striking a glancing blow to Travis Head he concedes a few runs. Tim Paine now has his highest Test score as skipper. This is splendid sh*tposting. Very subtle, bravo. But in case it needs pointing out... 134th over: Australia 391-5 (Head 83, Paine 62) Santner bowls, Australia score runs; get used to this for the next couple of hours. This match has lost all its vim and is unlikely to find it again until this pair turn on the afterburners and set a declaration target. Now Adam\u2019s taken his leave remember to retune your emails and tweets to the following addresses: @JPHowcroft and jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. Thank you very much Adam, my favourite trans-Tasman cricketing A Collins since AEJ Collins. Arthur Edward Jeune Collins, I\u2019m sure you recall, held the record for the highest ever score for over a century. As a schoolboy in 1899 he smashed 628 not out. Hilariously, nobody else in the match passed 50. Although AEJ wasn\u2019t a Kiwi himself, he was part of a cricketing lineage that extended to New Zealand and he is featured in the New Zealand Cricket Museum in Wellington. Tragically, he died aged only 29 during the first battle of Ypres. 133rd over: Australia 383-5 (Head 82, Paine 61) Wagner is back and Head backs himself to take on the short ball right away, uppercutting the first bouncer over the cordon for a boundary that moves him into the 80s and the partnership beyond 100. The quicker bumper comes later, which Head wisely ducks. Drinks! I\u2019ll pass the baton to JP Howcroft, who can take you through to a couple of tons. Enjoy! 132nd over: Australia 383-5 (Head 76, Paine 61) Head once again gets off strike from the first ball of the over - good batting. They exchange a couple more through the field. I\u2019ve said it before and will again: this is drifting. New Zealand have really blown the opportunity they earned for themselves earlier today. We\u2019re already nearing the territory where only one team can realistically win the Test Match. 131st over: Australia 380-5 (Head 74, Paine 60) Santner gives Head a ball to push away for one to begin, the spinner then keeping Paine quiet until the final delivery, which he sweeps really well and fine enough for four more. Into the 60s he goes. \u201cLove four sessions for a day test,\u201d tweets Dan Pollard in response to OB Jato\u2019s idea. \u201cBrilliant idea, especially in a hot Australian summer.\u201d 130th over: Australia 375-5 (Head 73, Paine 56) That\u2019s excellent batting from the captain, leaving CdG a couple of times, defending him with soft hands then leaping on the half-volley that arrives when striving for something more, cover driving for four. These two have put on 91. There\u2019s no reason Australia won\u2019t try to bat until late this afternoon, giving enough time for - I\u2019ll say it again - a Paine ton. 129th over: Australia 371-5 (Head 73, Paine 52) Santer is bowling and doing so with a bit of enthusiasm, stopping a Head drive in his follow through. Warne and Waugh aren\u2019t that interested on TV, discussing hats and haircuts and so on. 128th over: Australia 369-5 (Head 72, Paine 51) Head plays and misses a third time in three overs at CdG deliveries he would be far better served leaving alone. He keeps the strike with one to cover. The game might be drifting but this can\u2019t be another of those days where the South Australian falls short of three figures. 127th over: Australia 368-5 (Head 71, Paine 51) Santner is back for his ninth over - or seventh spell, if you prefer. It\u2019s not a bad one. All the same, it prompts a Warne/Waugh chat about bowlers who have lost their way on the biggest stage. Poor old Simon \u2018Milo\u2019 Kerrigan gets a mention. As does Glenn Trimble, who famously had a \u2018mare on debut in 1986. A gift from me to you - the video. 126th over: Australia 367-5 (Head 70, Paine 51) Head is once again beaten by CdG, who is making him earn everything here en route to what might be his second Test ton. There remains no hurry for either of him - they have a big base now. He\u2019s better to finish, pushing a quick single to mid-off. Positive calling and running. OB Jato has a left-of-field idea for us to consider. \u201cFollowing is an amended version of a proposal I had sent you earlier: we should play with the pink ball in all Test matches (it is a work in progress but good enough). We also take a fifteen-minutes break at the end of the third session, and return for a \u2018fourth session\u2019. The first three can be shorter in duration (24 overs each) to ensure the same amount of significant play happens in the fourth one, with the players recharged and at the top of their games more frequently than what a Test\u2019s current format allows. The presence of this \u2018fourth session\u2019 will contribute to more dynamic passages of play tactics, especially under the lights, and also attract bigger crowds to the match after working hours. Thoughts?\u201d I\u2019ll open it up. 125th over: Australia 366-5 (Head 69, Paine 51) Southee changes it up to go around the wicket at Paine by the end of this over. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit of a compulsive puller,\u201d notes Mike Hussey of the Australian captain as he launches into that very stroke, smashing the bowler off the back foot with the horizontal bat to bring up his seventh Test half-century in just 72 balls. He\u2019s batted wonderfully. 124th over: Australia 361-5 (Head 68, Paine 47) Blundell is off, de Grandhomme his replacement. As my man Dan Norcross - helming the BT Sport overnight coverage - notes, Blundell only bowled nine overs in First Class cricket before that spell. Why wouldn\u2019t Williamson back himself in that situation? Anyway, it\u2019s over now but let\u2019s be happy it happened. CdG is right on it, prompting a waft from Head. He\u2019s got to be leaving that alone - this is the de Grandhomme playbook: bore you senseless. He makes Paine play later in the over, finding his edge with one that shaped nicely away from the right-hander. Excellent return to the attack. 123rd over: Australia 360-5 (Head 67, Paine 47) Four more for Paine when taking on Southee\u2019s bumper, his hook landing just inside the rope before crossing it. A better stroke through covers follows, a couple more added. He\u2019s positively fluent. Speaking of the excellent MCG crowd, good areas from them here: 122nd over: Australia 354-5 (Head 67, Paine 41) Tom, mate, don\u2019t let me down. I\u2019ve just talked you up. This is not a good over. There\u2019s the half-tracker, the full toss. Another half-tracker. Very part-time. Head capitalises, carving four out past point. 121st over: Australia 348-5 (Head 62, Paine 40) Excellent innings this from Paine, just when the usual suspects are starting to vaguely agitate for Adam Gilchrist to return to the Test team. Sorry, I mean, Alex Carey to replace him asap. The skipper pulls Southee away for four to move into the 40s, getting into position nice and early. This might be his best chance for a Test ton since 2010 in India. 120th over: Australia 344-5 (Head 62, Paine 36) Blundell isn\u2019t trash. The balls he gets up there on the dancefloor turn more than Santner\u2019s have been. A bit like Raval in Perth, the part-timer might end up outbowling the main tweaker. There are already 55,532 people in the MCG. Fantastic numbers. I wonder how many will be there on day two at Sydney next week? 20-something, I reckon. 119th over: Australia 343-5 (Head 62, Paine 35) Southee gets the first go from the Members\u2019 End to start the session, keeping Paine honest on a solid line and length. A couple of times he finds the inside part of the bat, suggesting there\u2019s still a little bit of movement to be found with this now 39-over old ball. 118th over: Australia 342-5 (Head 62, Paine 34) Blundell, barely walking to the crease for his first over in Test Match cricket, gives Head a gimme down the legside to move into the 60s. Thanks for coming. But he beats him with his next offering, turning it a long way past the edge. \u201cYou do not want to get out to someone like this,\u201d insists Mike Hussey on the telly. Neither do here. Another one? I reckon so. The players are back on the field. Tom Blundell is going to bowl the first over! Some offies. Unorthodox from Williamson. Head is on strike - he\u2019s 57. PLAY! If a podcast is more your vibe, Geoff Lemon and I had Mel Jones on for a long chat, across a great many topics, for our Final Word Christmas Special. Enjoy! A lunch break read for you. About the great Johnny Mullagh. Australia\u2019s session. But it wasn\u2019t necessarily trending that way into the second hour, the Black Caps giving up just 27 runs in the first stanza then picking up Smith shortly thereafter on 85. It was Wagner once again sorting him out with an excellent short ball, taking just as superbly by Nicholls with one hand in the gully. They earned the wicket and thus the chance to race through the home side\u2019s lower order but Paine was having none of that, the captain putting the foot straight down to transfer the pressure back onto the tourists. With Head - who advanced his score from 25 overnight to 57 at the break - they have put on 52 in just 74 balls. They can now sit down to a sandwich knowing that 400 is well within their grasp. 117th over: Australia 336-5 (Head 57, Paine 33) Last over before lunch but that doesn\u2019t dissuade Paine from going at a Santner half-tracker first up, pulling it away with ease. He looked good in the first dig at Perth and he\u2019s very much on the money so far today. He goes again at the penultimate delivery, cutting hard from deep in the crease, once again running away to the rope. It beings up the 50 partnership between this pair from 73 balls. To finish the job for now the captain pulls a couple more, making 12 from the over - the most productive of the session. 116th over: Australia 324-5 (Head 57, Paine 21) Not a lot going on with Big Col, so Watling comes up to the stumps. After a very neat and disciplined first 80 minutes or so, New Zealand\u2019s intensity has fallen away at just the wrong time. 115th over: Australia 322-5 (Head 56, Paine 20) Santner is back for his sixth spell. \u201cIn the 70s,\u201d says Kerry O\u2019Keeffe, \u201cif you bowled seven overs in five spells it was because you had a hangover.\u201d Very good. The spinner is under a bit of pressure, needing to find a way to get his name in the book far more often. That doesn\u2019t happen here, three runs added when missing his length. Two overs until lunch. 114th over: Australia 319-5 (Head 55, Paine 18) It is nearing lunch but this is Australia\u2019s most productive period of the session so they keep on keeping on, taking five runs from de Grandhomme without any risks to speak of. Good batting. 113th over: Australia 314-5 (Head 51, Paine 17) Wagner does go again - he\u2019s unstoppable. Bharat Sundaresan, who watches closer than anyone in the press box, noted yesterday that he regularly goes back to his mark after the sixth ball not realising his over is done. He just wants to bowl all the time. Paine has shown real intent since walking out, pulling hard through square leg to the sweeper for one. Head keeps the strike with a single to cover. They\u2019ve put on 30 in 50 balls. Solid. 112th over: Australia 312-5 (Head 50, Paine 16) Rewaded for his patience, Head moves to his eighth Test half-century to go with the ton he made at Canberra in February. He reaches the mark with a drive through cover off de Grandhomme, worth a couple. We said off the top that this is a big day in his story. \u201cIs this the day that Travis Head said that I belong?\u201d asks Kerry O\u2019Keeffe, along those same lines. 111th over: Australia 310-5 (Head 48, Paine 16) That\u2019ll be enough for Wagner for now I reckon, this his eighth over going for seven with Head driving three down the ground to begin then Paine getting on top of the bounce to steer a boundary behind point. But he\u2019s still banging it in there to finish. Another fine spell. 110th over: Australia 303-5 (Head 45, Paine 12) Boult replaced by de Grandhomme for his first trundle today, on to restrict the runs with his accurate medium pace. Head is off strike first up with one to point, Paine defending and leaving the rest. 109th over: Australia 302-5 (Head 44, Paine 12) Paine deals well with the Wagner interrogation, ducking and weaving as required but also looking to pull. How long can he keep going in this spell? He\u2019s been on for seven overs on the bounce. 108th over: Australia 302-5 (Head 44, Paine 12) Paine on the counterattack, hammering Boult through cover with a picture-perfect cover drive. \u201cShot of the day,\u201d says Warne on the telly before they quickly return to talking about Alex Carey. The skipper is into double figures two balls later with a delightful clip. A ropey wide one to finish and Head obliges, throwing his hands at a cut. He doesn\u2019t control the stroke, through the air just the fielder, but it completes the biggest over of the day - worth 11, taking Australia beyond 300. The replay shows that Santner nearly got a hand to it at point. Now back to the main game: Neil Wagner. 107th over: Australia 291-5 (Head 40, Paine 5) Wagner is right in this game, beating Paine again with a short ball that fizzes past the outside edge. Superb bowling. He pulled him well to start the over, picking up three to boost the confidence, but the thing about Wagner is he never allows a new batsman to settle. 40 minutes until lunch, so, about eight overs. The most important mini-session of the Test so far. 106th over: Australia 286-5 (Head 39, Paine 1) Boult\u2019s picked up his pace after the wicket, sensing an opportunity against the new man Paine, beating him with one that cuts across the right hander from over the wicket. He\u2019s off the mark with a push to point from the next ball, albeit after some nervous running. Head\u2019s turn and he cops a biting bouncer, playing it well with soft hands with the ball reaching him with both feet off the ground. Boult\u2019s best over today by a long way. 105th over: Australia 284-5 (Head 38, Paine 0) Paine walks out with plenty to do for Australia if they are to push this score up towards 400. But forget about that, New Zealand have a chance to run through the lower order with the indefatigable Wagner going and going and going. Sure enough, he beats Paine first ball, the captain wafting nervously at one well outside the off stump. The Kiwi crowd love this bloke, giving him a mighty ovation at the end of the successful over. Smith falls to Wagner\u2019s short ball again! A fantastic short ball too, finding the shoulder of the bat. Nicholls had plenty of work to do at gully, pulling the catch in with one outstretched hand. Excellent, patient cricket from the Black Caps. 104th over: Australia 284-4 (Smith 85, Head 38) Boult is up and about with an lbw appeal to finish his over, cutting back at Head and beating his inside edge. But they elect not to review, the ball looking to go well over the top. Until that point, Smith was on strike and handling the attack without any concerns. That\u2019s drinks. Australia made 27 runs in the hour across 14 patient overs. No hurry here. 103rd over: Australia 283-4 (Smith 84, Head 38) Oi! Wagner\u2019s quicker bumper nearly whacks Head this time, anging from around the wicket at the left-hander. That\u2019s the lenth. More smiles from Wagner and the Australians. He changes it up with the slower ball bouncer, which Head deflects down to Latham at bat pad. They\u2019re giving them nothing in the field. The end of another probing over. 102nd over: Australia 281-4 (Smith 84, Head 36) Boult is swung around to the Great Southern Stand End and Head immediately enjoys getting stuck into a shorter ball outside the off stump, crashed away to the point rope. When on song, Head is probably the best cutter in Australia. He has a big chance today. 101st over: Australia 276-4 (Smith 84, Head 31) Australia were 292/4 after 100 overs in Perth, the TV tells me. New Zealand did better than the scorecard looked there, never coughing up more than 80 runs in a session - the problem was it too them five sessions to take ten wickets. Wagner is right on Head\u2019s body with his first ball here, the left-hander able to deflect it tidily behind square for one. Over the wicket to Smith, he\u2019s absolutely spot on with consecutive bouncers, the right-hander leaving both to go just over his helmet. After the second, Smith winks at Wagner. I like that a lot. He then hits Smith with his final delivery, the batsman trying to duck for a third time but it is too full so he\u2019s clobbered on his front arm before the ball lands in his right glove! More smiles between the two. Top contest. 100th over: Australia 275-4 (Smith 84, Head 30) Southee misdirects his first to Smith here, called a wide. He finds his groove thereafter, working the angle across the right haner from around the wicket from a variety of lengths, giving him nothing to score off. Australia have added 18 runs in ten overs so far today. 99th over: Australia 274-4 (Smith 84, Head 30) Smith isn\u2019t bothered by Wagner in their first exchanges of the day, taking a good look before flicking one off the hip. Head continues to use his bat against the short stuff, getting behind two lifters. 98th over: Australia 273-4 (Smith 83, Head 30) Southee around the wicket to Smith, backing in the Wagner attack from the other end. He flicks one to backward square before Head drives the last three balls to fielders in front of the wicket. I said off the top that New Zealand have a window this morning but it won\u2019t be open for much longer. They have to stay the course at Smith. 97th over: Australia 272-4 (Smith 82, Head 30) Time for Wagner, and you know what that means. His first short one at Head wasn\u2019t on target but the next couple were, aimed right in that difficult spot just below the shoulder. Head\u2019s electing to play by default, jumping in line to defend with soft hands a couple of times. It\u2019s that or the Matt Wade approach of wearing them on the body. 96th over: Australia 272-4 (Smith 82, Head 30) Not much for Southee so far this morning, Head getting well on top of an impotent short ball, pulling it away for three. He\u2019s better to Smith, squaring him up with a good\u2019un. 95th over: Australia 269-4 (Smith 82, Head 27) A better over from Boult, finding the outside portion of Smith\u2019s bat early in the over before cutting him in half from around the wicket to finish with one that did plenty. Ian Smith on TV is lamenting Santner\u2019s lack of penetration yesterday, only called upon for seven overs of spin. 94th over: Australia 267-4 (Smith 81, Head 27) So close to some luck for New Zealand! Smith\u2019s straight drive clips Southee\u2019s fingers in his follow through, deflecting back onto Head\u2019s stumps. They go upstairs to check it out but he\u2019s back into his ground in the nick of time. On strike later in the over, the left-hander is unlucky not to add a boundary to the score, the athletic Southee again in the act in his follow through, stopping a well-struck drive with one hand. 93rd over: Australia 266-4 (Smith 80, Head 27) \u201cYou can never judge a pitch until both sides have batted on it,\u201d insists Warne when Boult\u2019s bumper leaps at Head two balls after a length delivery bounces before reaching the \u2018keeper. Might be that kind of day. Defending off the back foot later in the over, the South Australia times it so well he gets two past the bowler - his first runs of the day. That\u2019s the 50 partnership between the pair, brought up in 115 balls together. 92nd over: Australia 264-4 (Smith 80, Head 25) Whoa, four byes to start Southee\u2019s morning from the Great Southern Stand End, a delivery that drifted down leg and kept swinging after passing Smith, beyond the diving left glove of Watling. When using his bat, Smith picks out the fielder at cover a couple of times. There\u2019s a catcher now in at very straight and close midwicket, but he isn\u2019t required here. The TV calls reminds us that Southee has never dismissed Smith in a Test. 91st over: Australia 260-4 (Smith 80, Head 25) Easy peasy, Smith into the 80s from the first ball of the day, steering a long half-volley through cover for three. It requires an athletic dive from Williamson on the rope, pulling up awkwardly after pulling the ball back in. By contrast, Head cops a beauty to begin, a bumper that follows his swaying helmet, the left-hander just getting his head out of the way. The visiting supporters love it. As the Test progresses, the percentage of New Zealand fans is likely to grow given they will surely be in for the full five days. The vice captain is making solid contact by the end of the over. Good re-start. \u201cHappy belated Christmas.\u201d And to you, Ruth Purdue. \u201cI for one can\u2019t wait to see Cummins and Pattinson on this.\u201d Yes - that\u2019s a tasty proposition later today. To think he\u2019s had to wait eight years for a second home Test Match. They love him in Melbourne, make no mistake. The players are on the field! Boult has the ball in his hand for the first over of this second day, ready to race in from the MCC End. Smith is on strike. He\u2019s counting the fielders, preparing to resume his innings on 77. PLAY! \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Hello, Andrew James. \u201cIs it perhaps finally time for us armchair experts to take over as groundsman of the MCG? The recent Shield match clearly went too far, and now it appears to have swung back the other way. And will today see the famous Black Cap Bad Luck\u2122 finally give them a few wickets in return for yesterday\u2019s abject run? Unlikely when Smith is still at the crease, you\u2019d think.\u201d Close watchers, I felt, were willing to give the MCG curator a bit of breathing space after the shambolic Shield round earlier this month. Sure, there was nothing good about the cancellation of that game - no excusing it. But you could see what he was trying to do, finding a way to prepare a lively Test track for the first time at the MCG since, gosh, 2010? That\u2019s harder than it looks with the old drop-in technology he has inherited for the time being, which I don\u2019t pretend to understand. Secondary point: isn\u2019t it great that we are the only country in the cricket world (as far as I\u2019m ware) that calls their chief groundman a \u2018curator\u2019? Nothing better/sillier than the annual press conference we do with Damien Hough, the main man at Adelaide Oval, before the Test there. We\u2019re a country of amatuer horticulturalists. Kevin Roberts has just held a press conference. He was pumping the volume up on the day one success with over 80,000 in the MCG. That made it the eighth highest attendance ever at a day of Test cricket in Australia. Long story short: don\u2019t expect New Zealand to wait 32 years for their next Boxing Day appearance. In case you missed it, an eventful day at Centurion. The first of the South Africa v England series, four Tests coming up between them over the next four weeks. Dave Warner was on SEN radio ahead of play this morning. Some innings are bigger than others. For Travis Head, this really is one of those hits. Despite his impressive 2019 numbers, it\u2019s clear the South Australian sits lowest on the Australian top six pecking order. A big ton on this big stage could change that in a real hurry. Getting a start during a tough period last night, now\u2019s the moment for him to come back to the MCG - on what will most likely be the best day to bat during the contest - and fill his boots alongside Steve Smith. For the former captain, he has 23 runs to collect in order to clock his fifth Boxing Day Test ton. He spent the majority of day one in the middle, facing 192 balls along the way. So far, it has been a long way from his most fluent hand in the green helmet but that means nothing to a machine like Smith. Indeed, it is the least pretty tons that he values highest - take his gems at Pune and Brisbane in 2017. As for the visitors, they get a window this morning with a second new ball that\u2019s still relatively hard. But it won\u2019t be open for long. The pitch, which had so much in it on the opening morning, was really flattening out by the close yesterday. They need to be well into Australia\u2019s lower order by drinks this morning. Don\u2019t doubt for a moment them coming out hard with a predominantly short-pitched barrage. Thanks for joining our day two coverage. Along with JP Howcroft, we\u2019re looking forward to your company throughout. You know the drill: drop me a line. To begin, did we all see this new report? A fair bit going on here. Interesting.",

      "body": "<p>While <em>The God Child</em> is a debut novel, its author is already well known in the art world. Like John Berger, to whom the book is dedicated, Nana Oforiatta Ayim is an art historian and critic unafraid of challenging the establishment. Her pioneering works range from an open-source, pan-African cultural encyclopedia project to a mobile museum and, most recently, the curation of the first ever Ghanaian pavilion at the Venice biennale. Ayim\u2019s desire to question assumptions about African art (and the continent in general) is shared by Maya, the protagonist of her coming-of-age story set between Germany, Britain and Ghana.</p> <p>When the novel begins, Maya is living in Germany, the only child of Ghanaian parents.

      "bodyText": "While The God Child is a debut novel, its author is already well known in the art world. Like John Berger, to whom the book is dedicated, Nana Oforiatta Ayim is an art historian and critic unafraid of challenging the establishment. Her pioneering works range from an open-source, pan-African cultural encyclopedia project to a mobile museum and, most recently, the curation of the first ever Ghanaian pavilion at the Venice biennale. Ayim\u2019s desire to question assumptions about African art (and the continent in general) is shared by Maya, the protagonist of her coming-of-age story set between Germany, Britain and Ghana. When the novel begins, Maya is living in Germany, the only child of Ghanaian parents. Her father is a reserved and bookish doctor, while her shopaholic mother, Yaa Agyata, is outgoing and gregarious. Yaa is Ayim\u2019s most vividly painted character: loud and flamboyant, she is described as having \u201cgold trapped beneath her skin\u201d and a voice \u201cpeppery with chicken stew\u201d. Comfortable with herself, she doesn\u2019t care what others think of her - including her daughter, who finds her embarrassingly disorderly next to her German friends with their \u201ctall, blonde, neat parents\u201d.

She became a champion of privately run, publicly funded charter schools and vouchers that enable families to take tax dollars from the public education system to the private sector.</p> <p>Since taking office, she has proposed billions of dollars in cuts to her own department, hitting class size reductions, after-school programmes, full-service community schools and student loan forgiveness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/28/trump-reverses-special-olympics-funding-cut-betsy-devos\">Even Trump overruled her</a> on plans to gut the Special Olympics, and she has recently run into opposition from the Democratic-controlled House, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lily_NEA/status/1141457951154221056?s=20\">which passed significant budget increases.</a></p> <p>Weingarten commented: \u201cHere you have someone whose job it is to help students, 90% of whom go to public schools in America, and to help students in higher education navigate through their student debt or try to mitigate it. She\u2019s failed on both accounts. Instead, she\u2019s tried to defund and dismantle public education and make it harder for us to help kids in public education.\u201d</p> <p>DeVos is currently attacking a programme, known as \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d, intended to forgive federal loans for students whose colleges misrepresent the quality of their education or otherwise commit fraud. The programme was expanded under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a> but DeVos has been accused of stalling it for more than a year while she altered the rules and made it harder for students to get loan relief, resulting in a large backlog.</p> <p>Last month, a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/us/politics/education-dept-loan-repayments-corinthian.html\">held DeVos in contempt</a> for violating an order to stop collecting loan payments from former Corinthian Colleges students, a for-profit college chain that collapsed in 2015 amid allegations that it lied about the success of its graduates in order to get students to enroll.</p> <p>Weingarten commented: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that a judge held her in contempt because, just like her boss, she mocks the rule of law. Her rule is: she\u2019s rich and she\u2019s a believer in her ideology and that should drive it, not her oath of office, not that this is democracy, not that she is the secretary of education. So the mood [among teachers] is: we told you so, we knew she\u2019d be like this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd1fbf29c95e888bf71d5c9de17643e44dda081d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd1fbf29c95e888bf71d5c9de17643e44dda081d/0_0_3088_2017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters against Betsy DeVos in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters against Betsy DeVos in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pacific Press/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition, the 11th education secretary is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/12/03/education-secretary-betsy-devos-wants-spin-off-federal-student-aid-office-into-new-agency/?utm_campaign=the_daily_202&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_source=Newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_daily202&amp;wpmm=1\">seeking to spin off the Federal Student Aid</a> office \u2013 which provides more than $150bn a year in federal grants, loans and work-study funds to college students \u2013 into a new agency. She says the office is an \u201cuntamed beast\u201d in \u201cdistress\u201d; critics regard the proposal as a waste of time and resources.</p> <p>The long charge sheet against DeVos also includes <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-k-12/reports/2019/05/30/470509/3-ways-devos-put-students-risk-deregulating-education/\">the withdrawal of federal guidance,</a> developed under the Obama administration, that spelled out protections for transgender students under title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.</p> <p>DeVos has also proposed a requirement that colleges allow cross-examination of sexual assault and harassment accusers. Activists argue this would discourage victims from coming forward. Former vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> has promised to reverse the guidance if he becomes president.</p> <p>Weingarten said: <em>\u201c</em>She\u2019s unwound any number of protections that kids have in education because the Department of Education is supposed to be the civil rights agency for children. And when it comes to higher education, she really has betrayed the aspirations of kids who need and have student loans in order to make their aspirations real in postsecondary education.\u201d</p> <p>DeVos\u2019s job appears safe as long as Trumpis president. But she has been sharply criticised by Democratic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">2020</a> candidates, including moderates. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\">Pete Buttigieg</a> has vowed that, should he reach the White House, he would appoint a secretary who actually believes in public education. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/440116-klobuchar-devos-shouldnt-be-in-her-job\">Senator Amy Klobuchar</a> has promised to fire DeVos immediately.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/13/john-delaney-don-quixote-american-dream-president-2020\">John Delaney,</a> the first Democrat to jump into the race, joined the condemnation. \u201cIf we were grading her on a report card, I would give her very low grades if not a failing grade,\u201d he said by phone from Iowa. \u201cThe reason I think she has not been a successful secretary of education was obvious from the day she was given the job, which is she doesn\u2019t believe in the public education system in this country. She would voucherise the whole system if she could.\u201d</p> <p>But for now, DeVos and other cabinet secretaries seem relatively safe from the spotlight as Trump\u2019s flame-throwing, attention-grabbing antics intensify. Delaney warned: \u201cWe have to be careful not to be so preoccupied with every single ridiculous thing the president does because, to some extent, it might be a strategy to distract us from the bad policy that\u2019s actually getting done. Obviously the things he did with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> deserve this attention they\u2019re getting. But in some ways he\u2019s the bright, shiny light and every little tweet causes people to just be incredibly preoccupied.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/13/los-angeles-high-school-planned-parenthood-sexual-mental-health\">LA high schools to open sexual and mental health clinics in pioneering program</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMeanwhile, environmental regulations are getting rolled back.

DeVos pushed her policies on state schools and the chickens have come home to roost in Michigan.\u201d</p> <p>Sroka, spokesman for the political action committee <a href=\"http://www.democracyforamerica.com/\">Democracy for America,</a> added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say in administration like Donald Trump\u2019s who the biggest villain is. The Trump administration has been a rogues\u2019 gallery but Betsy DeVos, from the sheer lack of expertise to her defence of rapists and attempted rapists to her attack on any effort for students to throw off the yoke of student debt in their lifetime, ticks all the boxes.</p> <p>\u201cThe scion of wealth and privilege has never had a real job but made it her life\u2019s work to attack public schools, teachers and students. She only escapes scrutiny because so much incompetence, grief and evil comes out of this administration that she\u2019s been able to ride out the storm. But she\u2019s made it much more likely we\u2019ll get a Democratic education secretary who\u2019s a real champion for teachers.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Education did not respond to requests for an interview with DeVos.</p>",

She became a champion of privately run, publicly funded charter schools and vouchers that enable families to take tax dollars from the public education system to the private sector. Since taking office, she has proposed billions of dollars in cuts to her own department, hitting class size reductions, after-school programmes, full-service community schools and student loan forgiveness. Even Trump overruled her on plans to gut the Special Olympics, and she has recently run into opposition from the Democratic-controlled House, which passed significant budget increases. Weingarten commented: \u201cHere you have someone whose job it is to help students, 90% of whom go to public schools in America, and to help students in higher education navigate through their student debt or try to mitigate it. She\u2019s failed on both accounts. Instead, she\u2019s tried to defund and dismantle public education and make it harder for us to help kids in public education.\u201d DeVos is currently attacking a programme, known as \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d, intended to forgive federal loans for students whose colleges misrepresent the quality of their education or otherwise commit fraud. The programme was expanded under Barack Obama but DeVos has been accused of stalling it for more than a year while she altered the rules and made it harder for students to get loan relief, resulting in a large backlog. Last month, a federal judge held DeVos in contempt for violating an order to stop collecting loan payments from former Corinthian Colleges students, a for-profit college chain that collapsed in 2015 amid allegations that it lied about the success of its graduates in order to get students to enroll. Weingarten commented: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that a judge held her in contempt because, just like her boss, she mocks the rule of law. Her rule is: she\u2019s rich and she\u2019s a believer in her ideology and that should drive it, not her oath of office, not that this is democracy, not that she is the secretary of education. So the mood [among teachers] is: we told you so, we knew she\u2019d be like this.\u201d In addition, the 11th education secretary is seeking to spin off the Federal Student Aid office \u2013 which provides more than $150bn a year in federal grants, loans and work-study funds to college students \u2013 into a new agency. She says the office is an \u201cuntamed beast\u201d in \u201cdistress\u201d; critics regard the proposal as a waste of time and resources. The long charge sheet against DeVos also includes the withdrawal of federal guidance, developed under the Obama administration, that spelled out protections for transgender students under title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. DeVos has also proposed a requirement that colleges allow cross-examination of sexual assault and harassment accusers. Activists argue this would discourage victims from coming forward. Former vice-president Joe Biden has promised to reverse the guidance if he becomes president. Weingarten said: \u201cShe\u2019s unwound any number of protections that kids have in education because the Department of Education is supposed to be the civil rights agency for children. And when it comes to higher education, she really has betrayed the aspirations of kids who need and have student loans in order to make their aspirations real in postsecondary education.\u201d DeVos\u2019s job appears safe as long as Trumpis president. But she has been sharply criticised by Democratic 2020 candidates, including moderates. Pete Buttigieg has vowed that, should he reach the White House, he would appoint a secretary who actually believes in public education. Senator Amy Klobuchar has promised to fire DeVos immediately. John Delaney, the first Democrat to jump into the race, joined the condemnation. \u201cIf we were grading her on a report card, I would give her very low grades if not a failing grade,\u201d he said by phone from Iowa. \u201cThe reason I think she has not been a successful secretary of education was obvious from the day she was given the job, which is she doesn\u2019t believe in the public education system in this country. She would voucherise the whole system if she could.\u201d But for now, DeVos and other cabinet secretaries seem relatively safe from the spotlight as Trump\u2019s flame-throwing, attention-grabbing antics intensify. Delaney warned: \u201cWe have to be careful not to be so preoccupied with every single ridiculous thing the president does because, to some extent, it might be a strategy to distract us from the bad policy that\u2019s actually getting done. Obviously the things he did with Ukraine deserve this attention they\u2019re getting. But in some ways he\u2019s the bright, shiny light and every little tweet causes people to just be incredibly preoccupied. \u201cMeanwhile, environmental regulations are getting rolled back. Ethanol waivers are being granted. There are proposals to spin off the entire student loan portfolio of the Department of Education. The list goes on and on and on of real policies that are happening that deserve much more attention. She has largely kept her head down and gone about her business, which I think is ideologically driven and hasn\u2019t attracted that much attention.\u201d DeVos \u2013 whose brother, Erik Prince, is the founder of Blackwater, a private security contractor notorious for its operations in Iraq \u2013 is the former chair of the Michigan Republican party. Critics say she used her wealth to push legislators to defund public education in favour of for-profit charter schools in the state, and students\u2019 test results have suffered badly as a consequence. Neil Sroka, a progressive activist based in Detroit, Michigan, said: \u201cIn the state of Michigan, \u2018DeVos\u2019 is a one-word epithet for everything broken in our education system. Michigan was a Petri dish and the future is now. DeVos pushed her policies on state schools and the chickens have come home to roost in Michigan.\u201d Sroka, spokesman for the political action committee Democracy for America, added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say in administration like Donald Trump\u2019s who the biggest villain is. The Trump administration has been a rogues\u2019 gallery but Betsy DeVos, from the sheer lack of expertise to her defence of rapists and attempted rapists to her attack on any effort for students to throw off the yoke of student debt in their lifetime, ticks all the boxes. \u201cThe scion of wealth and privilege has never had a real job but made it her life\u2019s work to attack public schools, teachers and students. She only escapes scrutiny because so much incompetence, grief and evil comes out of this administration that she\u2019s been able to ride out the storm. But she\u2019s made it much more likely we\u2019ll get a Democratic education secretary who\u2019s a real champion for teachers.\u201d The Department of Education did not respond to requests for an interview with DeVos.",

It\u2019s outside the Queen\u2019s House and gives a great view through the Royal Naval College to the Thames, creating a scenic skating experience. It\u2019s less pricey than competing museum ice rinks, and less busy, too \u2013 no need to book online, simply turn up and buy tickets on the door. Next to the outdoor ice rink there is an indoor bar for those who simply wish to watch, and it\u2019s open until late ...<br>\u2022 <em>Until 12 Jan, adult from \u00a313.50, child from \u00a36.75,<a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/see-do/we-recommend/attractions/queens-house-ice-rink\" title=\"\"> rmg.co.uk</a></em><br><strong>Ruby</strong></p> <h2><strong>Skating Heroes, Hungary</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1aa080b7f8063cc2ce7daea87593d66fc37bc13d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1aa080b7f8063cc2ce7daea87593d66fc37bc13d/197_0_4667_2802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"City Park in Budapest, with ice skater.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">City Park, Budapest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Budapest\u2019s City Park ice rink opens daily from November to February: it\u2019s one of the largest and oldest open-air rinks in Europe and, for me, the most beautiful. Bordered on one side by Heroes\u2019 Square and the other by Vajdahunyad Castle, it is easily reached by tram or metro. Skating through the early morning winter mist or the afternoon sunshine provides exercise for the soul, as well as the body.

      "body": "<p>I believe that on Wednesday something odd happened. Probably 2.7 million people went to a Christmas service in their local Anglican church, a total that has <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/more/media-centre/news/christmas-attendance-highest-level-more-decade\" title=\"\">risen steadily</a> over the past decade. On Sunday, however, the number will plummet back to a weekly 700,000 and falling. Christian faith in the UK is in decline, with less than half of the population now believing \u201cin God or a higher power\u201d. Of these, <a href=\"http://www.natcen.ac.uk/news-media/press-releases/2017/september/british-social-attitudes-record-number-of-brits-with-no-religion/\" title=\"\">just 15% claim to be \u201cChurch of England\u201d</a>, let alone go to church. Just 3%of 18- to 24-year-olds describe themselves as Anglican. The only booming churches are those catering to immigrant and minority ethnic communities. Adherents to Pentecostalism have risen by 40% since 2010.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The quality of therapy through meditating beauty should apply to most churches. But they need to offer more than that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet more people not only go to Christmas services, they also pack out England\u2019s 42 Anglican cathedrals, whose worshipping congregations have grown some 30% since the turn of the century, even as church attendance has fallen by the same amount. This can be explained partly by a lingering family attachment to childhood ritual, and in the case of cathedrals by the appeal of music, especially the ever popular evensong. But clearly this gulf between the <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2019-11/Cathedral%20Statistics%202018_0.pdf\" title=\"\">cathedral haves and the parish church have-nots</a> is significant. </p> <p>As a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2019/nov/26/stairways-to-heaven-britains-top-ten-cathedrals\" title=\"\">church-lover</a> but not church-goer, I despair at the looming presence in the centre of almost every city, town and village of what the radical bishop of Worcester, John Inge, deplores as \u201c<a href=\"https://anglicanmainstream.org/bishop-warns-church-leaders-they-must-work-harder-to-make-their-places-of-worship-more-fun-or-risk-closure/\" title=\"\">locked mausoleums</a> marginal to the lives of their communities\u201d. A quarter of the 15,000 Anglican parish churches now have fewer than 16 worshippers, with a large and historic building at their disposal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/14/church-of-england-predicts-rise-part-time-churches-attendance-plummet\" title=\"\">left empty six days a week</a>. That building was paid for by the tithes of local people. The government rightly prevents it from being demolished, as embodying local identity, memory and craftsmanship. The prospect is of these churches going the way of medieval castles, to become barricaded vacant ruins, as Philip Larkin wrote, \u201cA shape less recognisable each week / A purpose more obscure.\u201d</p> <p>I cannot believe they are beyond reuse. One avenue might be termed traditional. It lies in a recent survey of GPs who complained that they were becoming \u201cthe new clergy\u201d. Ever more people have no symptoms beyond loneliness and despair. They say, \u201cDoctor, <a href=\"https://bjgp.org/content/68/suppl_1/bjgp18X697061\" title=\"\">I\u2019m not sure there is any point to all this</a>.\u201d Doctors dare not prescribe churchgoing even for devout patients, though I am told some do have a priest on call. <a href=\"https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/13-october/features/features/the-vicar-will-see-you-now\" title=\"\">One practice in Cumbria is even a joint vicar\u2019s/doctor\u2019s surgery</a>: \u201cThe vicar will see you now.\u201d </p> <p>I once visited a council estate in Leeds, where the vicar told me he was the last professional person living anywhere nearby. Teachers, doctors, social workers, police officers had all fled. His door was an all-purpose port of call for those in distress. He was alone on the frontline where the welfare state was in retreat, his priestly duty of dispensing comfort and support overlapping with that of the therapist and care-worker. For many people, there must be some complementarity between faith and healing. One thing to be said for the established church is that, unlike much of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/20/queens-speech-lacks-courage-fix-societys-urgent-crises\" title=\"\">social care</a>, it has not all but given up.</p> <p>Another clue lies in the experience of cathedrals. Sanctity as such is clearly no barrier to popularity. While a few, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/18/englands-cathedrals-financial-crisis-running-costs-soar\" title=\"\">Peterborough and Guildford</a>, are in financial trouble, most English cathedrals are doing fine. Everywhere they offer catering, shopping and a performance stage. There has been golf at Rochester, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-gloucestershire-35974275/gloucester-cathedral-taken-over-by-skate-festival\" title=\"\">skateboarding at Gloucester</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2019/08/09/helter-skelter-norwich-cathedral/\" title=\"\">helter-skelter at Norwich</a>. Liverpool is never still. St Albans is the cultural focus of its city.</p> <p>Somehow, cathedrals have contrived to snap free of the sectarian exclusivity of the parish church.

      "bodyText": "I believe that on Wednesday something odd happened. Probably 2.7 million people went to a Christmas service in their local Anglican church, a total that has risen steadily over the past decade. On Sunday, however, the number will plummet back to a weekly 700,000 and falling. Christian faith in the UK is in decline, with less than half of the population now believing \u201cin God or a higher power\u201d. Of these, just 15% claim to be \u201cChurch of England\u201d, let alone go to church. Just 3%of 18- to 24-year-olds describe themselves as Anglican. The only booming churches are those catering to immigrant and minority ethnic communities. Adherents to Pentecostalism have risen by 40% since 2010. Yet more people not only go to Christmas services, they also pack out England\u2019s 42 Anglican cathedrals, whose worshipping congregations have grown some 30% since the turn of the century, even as church attendance has fallen by the same amount. This can be explained partly by a lingering family attachment to childhood ritual, and in the case of cathedrals by the appeal of music, especially the ever popular evensong. But clearly this gulf between the cathedral haves and the parish church have-nots is significant. As a church-lover but not church-goer, I despair at the looming presence in the centre of almost every city, town and village of what the radical bishop of Worcester, John Inge, deplores as \u201clocked mausoleums marginal to the lives of their communities\u201d. A quarter of the 15,000 Anglican parish churches now have fewer than 16 worshippers, with a large and historic building at their disposal left empty six days a week. That building was paid for by the tithes of local people. The government rightly prevents it from being demolished, as embodying local identity, memory and craftsmanship. The prospect is of these churches going the way of medieval castles, to become barricaded vacant ruins, as Philip Larkin wrote, \u201cA shape less recognisable each week / A purpose more obscure.\u201d I cannot believe they are beyond reuse. One avenue might be termed traditional. It lies in a recent survey of GPs who complained that they were becoming \u201cthe new clergy\u201d. Ever more people have no symptoms beyond loneliness and despair. They say, \u201cDoctor, I\u2019m not sure there is any point to all this.\u201d Doctors dare not prescribe churchgoing even for devout patients, though I am told some do have a priest on call. One practice in Cumbria is even a joint vicar\u2019s/doctor\u2019s surgery: \u201cThe vicar will see you now.\u201d I once visited a council estate in Leeds, where the vicar told me he was the last professional person living anywhere nearby. Teachers, doctors, social workers, police officers had all fled. His door was an all-purpose port of call for those in distress. He was alone on the frontline where the welfare state was in retreat, his priestly duty of dispensing comfort and support overlapping with that of the therapist and care-worker. For many people, there must be some complementarity between faith and healing. One thing to be said for the established church is that, unlike much of social care, it has not all but given up. Another clue lies in the experience of cathedrals. Sanctity as such is clearly no barrier to popularity. While a few, such as Peterborough and Guildford, are in financial trouble, most English cathedrals are doing fine. Everywhere they offer catering, shopping and a performance stage. There has been golf at Rochester, skateboarding at Gloucester, a helter-skelter at Norwich. Liverpool is never still. St Albans is the cultural focus of its city. Somehow, cathedrals have contrived to snap free of the sectarian exclusivity of the parish church. They answer to a longing for congregation and communal space. Their key is a quality unfashionable to social analysis, the offer of solitude with beauty. You need not to be of faith to sit quietly and contemplate the loveliness of a cathedral. As a dean once hinted to me in a whisper, \u201cHere we don\u2019t bang on about God.\u201d The sociologist Grace Davie described a cathedral as \u201cvicarious religion\u201d, somewhere an individual can be private, undisturbed and uplifted by architecture and music.

However, two former Bank interest rate-setters warned the UK economy would continue to struggle for growth as Johnson faces complex trade talks with Brussels next year. The also warned the prime minister\u2019s decision to leave the option of no-deal Brexit on the table will hold back business investment. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), said: \u201cA new government and a new Bank of England governor. This should be a fresh start for the UK economy. But the dark shadow of Brexit continues to overhang our economic performance and prospects.\u201d To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian monitors eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. City economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before the data was released and in four cases the outcome was worse than expected, while in three cases it was better. The pound has rallied strongly and stock markets have surged in recent weeks amid hopes that Johnson\u2019s new government, with an 80-seat majority, can make progress towards smoothly extracting Britain from the EU. There are also hopes for stronger economic growth spurred by a splurge in government spending. The FTSE 100 has raced ahead since the election on the back of the unexpectedly large Tory majority and amid signs of a breakthrough in the US-China trade war \u2013 a dispute that has dragged down global trade volumes and harmed economic growth around the world this year. However, the UK economy appears to have suffered in the run-up to the election. Employment growth relied on public sector job creation, as business across the private sector shed workers and wage growth slowed. The Resolution Foundation warned that weak growth in 2020 would be consistent with falling employment levels. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the thinktank, said: \u201c2019 was a bad year for the economy, which looks set to have recorded its weakest GDP growth outside of recessions since the war.\u201d According to surveys of business activity compiled by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, the snap winter election depressed companies\u2019 activity levels in November. Suggesting the economy stalled in the fourth quarter, Britain\u2019s dominant services sector \u2013 which accounts for about 80% of the economy \u2013 failed to grow for the third month in a row. Manufacturing and construction activity also dropped. Economists said Johnson\u2019s election victory could provide companies with greater clarity required to boost activity levels, supporting stronger economic growth, but warned that lingering uncertainty over a trade deal with the EU would continue to hold back growth in 2020. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC, said: \u201cForeign firms and even some British firms will find it more attractive for many years to take whatever investment money they have to Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark or Sweden \u2013 which all look like safer havens than the UK.\u201d \u201cFirms continue to stockpile as insurance against possible disruption from a disorderly Brexit. None of this is good for UK growth.\u201d",

Anderson\u2019s husband Ray, better known around town as Butch, woke at 4am unable to breathe properly before he fell into unconsciousness. Within minutes, an ambulance delivered him to the emergency room and on to a vent that saved his life. So Anderson, like almost everyone else in Kennett, was alarmed when just a few weeks later Twin Rivers\u2019 corporate owners suddenly announced its closure. Once one of the largest commercial hospital operators in the US, Community Health Systems said the facility was being \u201cconsolidated\u201d with a new medical centre it had recently built an hour\u2019s drive along to the north. In deciding to shut Twin Rivers, company executives made a calculation. Close one hospital and patients will be forced to use the other. Costs down, profits up.

It breaks my heart that they put money over people. I know that they have to make money \u2026 but they were making money,\u201d she said. CHS said it shut Twin Rivers because medical innovation has reduced demand for overnight stays. The company said that 95% of people treated at the hospital were outpatients who would be better served by the \u201clarger resources\u201d at the newer hospital in Poplar Bluff. It claimed that what it called the consolidation was \u201cthe most sustainable plan for the future\u201d, implying that Twin Rivers was not financially viable because of falling revenues. But a senior company executive told a Wall Street conference that CHS was getting out of markets that did not have the potential for significant growth. Doctors who worked at the hospital said the number of overnight stays fell in part because CHS sharply raised its prices in order to make more from the publicly funded Medicaid programme for low-income Americans. That drove away people with private insurance in need of non-emergency operations. Dr Chancellor Wayne, a chiropractor who was elected Kennett\u2019s mayor earlier this year, said Twin Rivers was charging $5,000 for an MRI so he sent patients to a hospital in Arkansas when they could get it for $800. Wayne accused CHS of closing Kennett\u2019s hospital \u201cout of greed\u201d. CHS did not respond to requests for comment. As private business faded, so the number of specialists employed at the hospital dropped. Even then, it remained profitable. \u201cThis hospital was closed mostly by the greed of the corporation,\u201d said Dr Jain. \u201cThis hospital was making money and the hospital in Poplar Bluff owned by the same corporation wasn\u2019t. But they had built a brand new hospital in Poplar Bluff that they couldn\u2019t close and they thought if they closed the hospital in Kennett everybody would flood there.\u201d CHS finally put the abandoned hospital up for auction this month with a reserve price of a dollar. But because it has been closed for more than a year, regulations would require millions of dollars in renovations for it to reopen as a medical facility. Doctors in the city see the delay as a cynical move to discourage another company from taking it over. But if CHS\u2019s calculation was that patients would come flooding from Kennett to Poplar Bluff, then it got it wrong. Some people in Kennett in need of routine hospital care didn\u2019t want to make the 120-mile round trip along a difficult road that flooded in winter. They instead opted for an equally long but much easier drive to facilities in neighbouring Arkansas and Tennessee. Anderson said others are boycotting CHS. \u201cWhat they didn\u2019t bargain for was that people were going to be so mad at them that they wouldn\u2019t go to Poplar Bluff,\u201d she said. \u201cI am blown away that that company would just leave all these people with no way to get medical treatment in an emergency. They just betrayed the people here.\u201d",

You were patient with my clumsiness, and everybody respected you, and more importantly, enjoyed your company. Little did we know, then, how it would all turn out. \u201cI think that cream is off\u201d, you furrowed your brow, holding out a frappuccino for me to test. As I leaned in to sniff it, you dunked my head in. I flicked it at your face, and mayhem ensued.</p> <p>A few years, and many more practical jokes later, I nervously told you I was pregnant. You didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cAnything you decide to do, anything you need, I\u2019ll support you,\u201d you said. I was so frightened, and you were so strong and steadfast. It\u2019s been that way ever since.

You want something that romanticises the world around you and makes you feel better about it.\u201d Knaggs\u2019 heroes are John Betjeman, Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan; his songs, about fishing, Wetherspoons, flip phones and the M5, similarly find uplifting poetry in the everyday.</p> <p>One of their first songs, Stanton, was about the fire warden at their Cambridge college. \u201cHe would stand on this barrow, and say: \u2018I\u2019ve seen people burn to death!\u2019\u201d Knaggs says. \u201cHe took his job seriously, but it was intense.\u201d Musically, the band bonded over bands such as Pavement. \u201cGuitar music was not very cool,\u201d Rice says. So to make their shows seem like \u201canything but a guitar music gig\u201d, they invented Poundband, a club night with \u00a31 entry that would feature sideshows such as their keyboardist, Ben Mack, doing, by his own admission, \u201cfreestyle rapping over eskibeats\u201d.</p> <p>These japes evaporated when they graduated and moved in together in London, doing jobs in everything from social care to social media. \u201cThere was a sense of frustration at the social contract: you graduate, you get this job, and you\u2019re supposed to feel fulfilled and happy,\u201d says the drummer, Al Greenwood. \u201cIt very quickly became so routine. We were so lucky \u2013 it\u2019s amazing to have a job and live independently in London. But there was a sense that there must be something more. A lot of friends are very successful, but very few of them say they are happy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86cea62a85c9343f1287cea17c4c7aff73d70c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86cea62a85c9343f1287cea17c4c7aff73d70c2a/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Rice of Sports Team.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Rice of Sports Team.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorne Thomson/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rice agrees: \u201cWe really enjoyed Cambridge, going to lectures, thinking about things. It was quite stark for me that, when you come out, you\u2019re really required to stop thinking to an enormous extent.\u201d He says that a big part of the band is \u201cto provide people with an alternative way to live their lives \u2013 we try to make it look joyful\u201d.</p> <p>They are an endearing group, frequently bursting into laughter around the pub table, and weren\u2019t always enamoured of their moodier London peers. \u201cHaving just moved to London you\u2019d think everyone that was involved in music was a Goldsmiths graduate \u2013 some kind of Gucci magician,\u201d Rice says, meaning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/23/one-to-watch-hmltd-interview\" title=\"\">hyped glam troupe HMLTD</a>, who Rice describes as \u201cone of the worst bands ever\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s rather refreshing to have them indulge in the kind of sniping that once powered petty intra-scene dramas in the NME \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/12/the-idea-of-a-rock-star-is-offensive-meet-shame-britains-most-exciting-new-band\" title=\"\">Shame have been another target</a> of their light-hearted beef. \u201c[Indie magazines] DIY and Dork, they have to call every band the greatest band in the world because they rely on social media shares, and we just got a bit sick of it,\u201d Rice says. \u201cPart of having a sense of identity as a band is saying: this is what we\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>For Greenwood, what they\u2019re not is \u201clazy, Martin Parr-esque\u201d imagery; for Knaggs, it\u2019s \u201cposing in leather jackets with cigarettes in moody landscapes, that level of Strokes-yness. They\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, we\u2019re poets, we got our lyrics by sitting in a pub and channelling James Joyce.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Hang on, you\u2019re sitting in a pub saying you\u2019re channelling Betjeman!</p> <p>\u201cAt least our lyrics were written on a laptop in the studio, desperately trying to find a word that rhymes with rhododendrons,\u201d Knaggs grins. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a wilted rose to have some great significance \u2013 it could be a Motorola. It doesn\u2019t have to be a skull, or a child smoking \u2013 it could be Ashton Kutcher. That could be your memento mori, that incredible poetic image. It doesn\u2019t have to be a raven, or a grave, or Dublin in the rain. It could be London in the sunshine. It could be Thorpe Park on a Wednesday.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08ddb6145d34d515396b91ec8b640f79e07c2456\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ddb6145d34d515396b91ec8b640f79e07c2456/0_0_1500_1014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sports Team.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sports Team.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Maccabee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDublin in the rain\u201d is, of course, a lyric by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/05/irish-punks-fontaines-dc-you-can-feel-the-growing-anglophobia\" title=\"\">Joyce-inspired band </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/12/fontaines-dc-dogrel-album-review-irish-punks-debut\" title=\"\">Fontaines DC</a>, but Knaggs says they all love them, and Rice agrees: \u201cThere\u2019ll always be a place for post-punk, but no one\u2019s doing anything that new in it. Fontaines played last week and the average age [in the crowd] must have been mid-40s \u2013 brilliant, but it\u2019s not that punk. It\u2019s incredibly wealthy craft-ale fans. You go to our front row, it\u2019s kids, it feels more vital and important.\u201d</p> <p>Rice\u2019s flouncing, peacocking stagecraft is a key part of the band\u2019s vitality. \u201cI hate every minute of being in the studio, I find it painfully dull, but performing is incredible \u2013 riling up a crowd for an hour,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople want something that feels a bit heroic on stage. They do want to feel a part of the gang, but you shouldn\u2019t be too accessible.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cAnd yet everyone has your number on a WhatsApp group,\u201d says the bassist, Oli Dewdney, after a perfect comic beat.</p> <p>With their Cambridge education and rhododendron-based lyrics, \u201cthere\u2019s a risk of throwaway comments: \u2018Oh, they\u2019re Tories\u2019\u201d, Greenwood says. One journalist even accused them of a \u201cpoverty safari\u201d by visiting Margate. Yet Sports Team\u2019s complicated, sometimes contradictory character portraits are a noble, or perhaps naive attempt to avoid the factionalism of modern society and politics.</p> <p>Rice says \u201cwe\u2019re all pretty Labour\u201d, but \u201cnot tribal ... that Idles record, just coming out with a \u2018fuck Boris\u2019 attitude, it\u2019s the tritest, cheapest form of politics. We\u2019ve got this opportunity to be really subtle and actually engage people, rather than just trotting out talking points.\u201d A union-jack-wearing character in their song The Races appears to be your typical side of Tory gammon \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019ll never buy you a drink / But he\u2019ll let you know he can\u201d \u2013 but Rice says \u201cthere\u2019s always an empathetic take. Even Kutcher, about a guy who\u2019s frustrated with his haircut, is quite an empathetic portrayal.\u201d</p> <p>Lots of people won\u2019t have empathy with middle England right now, of course \u2013 but it\u2019s just as much a part of Britain as anything and, as Rice says: \u201cIt would be far more dangerous if we turned up in flat caps and started doing northern accents, and you\u2019ve seen plenty of bands doing that.\u201d For once, he doesn\u2019t name them.</p>",

These are the middle-class kids who might have turned to rap, but now have, in Sports Team, a band singing about their lives. \u201cWe had this experience of life being quite mundane,\u201d says the frontman, Alex Rice, whose bandmates grew up in Cheshire, Kent and Leeds. \u201cIf you\u2019re a kid from Tunbridge Wells and you\u2019re going to Pitcher and Piano on a Thursday, where\u2019s the music for you? You want something that romanticises the world around you and makes you feel better about it.\u201d Knaggs\u2019 heroes are John Betjeman, Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan; his songs, about fishing, Wetherspoons, flip phones and the M5, similarly find uplifting poetry in the everyday. One of their first songs, Stanton, was about the fire warden at their Cambridge college. \u201cHe would stand on this barrow, and say: \u2018I\u2019ve seen people burn to death!\u2019\u201d Knaggs says. \u201cHe took his job seriously, but it was intense.\u201d Musically, the band bonded over bands such as Pavement. \u201cGuitar music was not very cool,\u201d Rice says. So to make their shows seem like \u201canything but a guitar music gig\u201d, they invented Poundband, a club night with \u00a31 entry that would feature sideshows such as their keyboardist, Ben Mack, doing, by his own admission, \u201cfreestyle rapping over eskibeats\u201d. These japes evaporated when they graduated and moved in together in London, doing jobs in everything from social care to social media. \u201cThere was a sense of frustration at the social contract: you graduate, you get this job, and you\u2019re supposed to feel fulfilled and happy,\u201d says the drummer, Al Greenwood. \u201cIt very quickly became so routine. We were so lucky \u2013 it\u2019s amazing to have a job and live independently in London. But there was a sense that there must be something more. A lot of friends are very successful, but very few of them say they are happy.\u201d Rice agrees: \u201cWe really enjoyed Cambridge, going to lectures, thinking about things. It was quite stark for me that, when you come out, you\u2019re really required to stop thinking to an enormous extent.\u201d He says that a big part of the band is \u201cto provide people with an alternative way to live their lives \u2013 we try to make it look joyful\u201d. They are an endearing group, frequently bursting into laughter around the pub table, and weren\u2019t always enamoured of their moodier London peers. \u201cHaving just moved to London you\u2019d think everyone that was involved in music was a Goldsmiths graduate \u2013 some kind of Gucci magician,\u201d Rice says, meaning the hyped glam troupe HMLTD, who Rice describes as \u201cone of the worst bands ever\u201d. It\u2019s rather refreshing to have them indulge in the kind of sniping that once powered petty intra-scene dramas in the NME \u2013 Shame have been another target of their light-hearted beef. \u201c[Indie magazines] DIY and Dork, they have to call every band the greatest band in the world because they rely on social media shares, and we just got a bit sick of it,\u201d Rice says. \u201cPart of having a sense of identity as a band is saying: this is what we\u2019re not.\u201d For Greenwood, what they\u2019re not is \u201clazy, Martin Parr-esque\u201d imagery; for Knaggs, it\u2019s \u201cposing in leather jackets with cigarettes in moody landscapes, that level of Strokes-yness. They\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, we\u2019re poets, we got our lyrics by sitting in a pub and channelling James Joyce.\u2019\u201d Hang on, you\u2019re sitting in a pub saying you\u2019re channelling Betjeman! \u201cAt least our lyrics were written on a laptop in the studio, desperately trying to find a word that rhymes with rhododendrons,\u201d Knaggs grins. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a wilted rose to have some great significance \u2013 it could be a Motorola. It doesn\u2019t have to be a skull, or a child smoking \u2013 it could be Ashton Kutcher. That could be your memento mori, that incredible poetic image. It doesn\u2019t have to be a raven, or a grave, or Dublin in the rain. It could be London in the sunshine. It could be Thorpe Park on a Wednesday.\u201d \u201cDublin in the rain\u201d is, of course, a lyric by the Joyce-inspired band Fontaines DC, but Knaggs says they all love them, and Rice agrees: \u201cThere\u2019ll always be a place for post-punk, but no one\u2019s doing anything that new in it. Fontaines played last week and the average age [in the crowd] must have been mid-40s \u2013 brilliant, but it\u2019s not that punk. It\u2019s incredibly wealthy craft-ale fans. You go to our front row, it\u2019s kids, it feels more vital and important.\u201d Rice\u2019s flouncing, peacocking stagecraft is a key part of the band\u2019s vitality. \u201cI hate every minute of being in the studio, I find it painfully dull, but performing is incredible \u2013 riling up a crowd for an hour,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople want something that feels a bit heroic on stage. They do want to feel a part of the gang, but you shouldn\u2019t be too accessible.\u201d \u201cAnd yet everyone has your number on a WhatsApp group,\u201d says the bassist, Oli Dewdney, after a perfect comic beat. With their Cambridge education and rhododendron-based lyrics, \u201cthere\u2019s a risk of throwaway comments: \u2018Oh, they\u2019re Tories\u2019\u201d, Greenwood says. One journalist even accused them of a \u201cpoverty safari\u201d by visiting Margate. Yet Sports Team\u2019s complicated, sometimes contradictory character portraits are a noble, or perhaps naive attempt to avoid the factionalism of modern society and politics. Rice says \u201cwe\u2019re all pretty Labour\u201d, but \u201cnot tribal ... that Idles record, just coming out with a \u2018fuck Boris\u2019 attitude, it\u2019s the tritest, cheapest form of politics. We\u2019ve got this opportunity to be really subtle and actually engage people, rather than just trotting out talking points.\u201d A union-jack-wearing character in their song The Races appears to be your typical side of Tory gammon \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019ll never buy you a drink / But he\u2019ll let you know he can\u201d \u2013 but Rice says \u201cthere\u2019s always an empathetic take. Even Kutcher, about a guy who\u2019s frustrated with his haircut, is quite an empathetic portrayal.\u201d Lots of people won\u2019t have empathy with middle England right now, of course \u2013 but it\u2019s just as much a part of Britain as anything and, as Rice says: \u201cIt would be far more dangerous if we turned up in flat caps and started doing northern accents, and you\u2019ve seen plenty of bands doing that.\u201d For once, he doesn\u2019t name them.",

Collaborations with major players such Cardi B, Bad Bunny, J Balvin and Diplo speak to someone who is well on their way to the top, thanks very much. But in the UK, where awareness and exposure of Latinx pop remains limited, his bratty vocal trills and fire-starting energy could easily see him swoop in and conquer the charts in 2020. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBdxvLgoTE\">Jesse James Solomon</a></strong></h2> <p>Solomon released his first EP in 2014, and has since become a true cult figure \u2013 a storytelling south London MC who doesn\u2019t fit into any of the neat British rap boxes (grime, backpacker, drill, Afro trap), but walks his own path. The excellent 2019 mixtape Bleak sat somewhere between Frank Ocean, King Krule and A Tribe Called Quest, a downbeat trudge through a rainswept night \u2013 but new single Tit for Tat is quite the opposite, a crisply headnodding roller with a Giggs guest spot. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOWkbX03faw\">Chippy Nonstop</a></strong></h2> <p>Starting the decade as a rapper whose wittily trashy aesthetic made Nicki Minaj look like Audrey Hepburn, Toronto-based Chippy Nonstop ended it as one of the most purely enjoyable DJs out there. A typical set can take in dancehall, Miami bass, R&amp;B, trap, jungle, Afrobeats and more \u2013 all of it seemingly designed to goad anyone, however inappropriately, into feverish twerking on all fours. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong>Nala Sinephro</strong></h2> <p>Keen watchers of recent performances by south-east London jazz collective <a href=\"https://www.steamdown.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Steam Down</a> may have spotted Nala Sinephro performing alongside the likes of Rosie Turton and Nadeem Din-Gabisi. She\u2019ll take the spotlight in 2020 to release her beguiling debut album: backed by a small ensemble, the Caribbean-Belgian musician plays pedal harp through modular and analogue synths, the effect gorgeously woozy and tidal \u2013 and not unworthy of comparison to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/05/alice-coltrane-turiyasangitananda-higher-state-of-consciousness\" title=\"\">Alice Coltrane</a>. <em>LS</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9d466d7be3717a556ad09c30a03bc0bcb16ba7d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d466d7be3717a556ad09c30a03bc0bcb16ba7d5/0_212_1332_1665/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Lykez.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Lykez.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Musical D</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSuOAUh6-B4\">Lady Lykez</a></strong></h2> <p>By blending the firehose delivery of jungle MCs with lipsmacking lyricism, wavey bashment energy and deadpan darts of pure disparagement (\u201cyuh pussy have gangrene\u201d), Lady Lykez is a formidable British rap talent. Live shows are a riot of audience participation, and she found a perfect foil in producer Scratcha DVA for her 2019 EP Muhammad Ali \u2013 like him, she delivers on claims of greatness. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6LmFJcYTzQ\">Lynda Dawn</a></strong></h2> <p>First heard when Gilles Peterson put her song Move on the November 2018 edition of his <a href=\"https://brownswoodbubblers.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">Brownswood Bubblers</a> compilation, London classicist Lynda Dawn harks back to Whitney Houston\u2019s earliest work with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/oct/04/cult-heroes-kashif-boogie-r-and-b-whitney-houston\" title=\"\">boogie pioneer Kashif</a>. Like Houston, Dawn was raised in the Pentecostal church and her gospel-influenced vocals dazzle like shafts of light through a stained-glass window. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_qn-f7XfJo\">Sech</a></strong></h2> <p>Despacito is looking more and more like a one-off: few of the Latin artists who get literally billions of streams elsewhere in the world cross over to the UK mainstream. But if anyone can, it\u2019s ursine Panamanian singer Sech, whose voice is deeper and earthier than peers such as Ozuna, Bad Bunny or Maluma \u2013 he croons it over keeningly romantic R&amp;B, powered by the relentless hip-swing of reggaeton. After the success of Latin Grammy-nominated single Otro Trago, be sure that he\u2019s beavering away on the song of the summer. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS_IuQcXOAY\">Charl\u00e8ne Darling</a></strong></h2> <p>Borrowing her name from the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053479/\" title=\"\">Andy Griffith Show</a> character, Paris\u2019s Charl\u00e8ne Darling makes off-kilter, shimmering chanson post-punk that connects the dots between the feminist troubadours of Agn\u00e8s Varda\u2019s L\u2019Une Chante, L\u2019Autre Pas, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_asia/article/mvxdmy/thailand-country-psychedelic-music-comeback\" title=\"\">Thai molam music</a>, the Raincoats and the way Cate Le Bon slides between bucolic melody and clanging post-punk.

But actually, a bit like their fellow Scandi bands Motorpsycho and the Night Flight Orchestra, the Norwegian quartet sit at the tunefully proggy end of classic rock. There\u2019s a fair bit of neanderthal chugging, but songs such as True Eyes show their range, with a smoky, soulful sweetness. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu4gLqqN0mE\">Meggie Brown</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53b0c65c1438ab63c3f94fe2fa12556763a693a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53b0c65c1438ab63c3f94fe2fa12556763a693a1/0_0_1287_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meggie Brown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"796\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meggie Brown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a ruthless energy to Meggie Cousland. The London musician has said <a href=\"http://www.artefactmagazine.com/2019/01/28/sounds-meggie-brown/\" title=\"\">she uses ketamine</a> to help write her prowling, Cramps-tinged punk, some of which she has recorded with Franz Ferdinand\u2019s Alex Kapranos in Edwyn Collins\u2019s studio. She fired one band when they weren\u2019t cutting the mustard: her new, eight-strong rabble supply intimidating gang vocals on recent single I Said Salute Me, which finds Cousland ordering a crush who doesn\u2019t return her ardour to drop and give her 20 in a Rocky Horror-worthy refrain. Odd tactic, but you wouldn\u2019t say no to her. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDwPtXxnmJw\">Marsicans</a></strong></h2> <p>This Leeds indie quartet have the same slick arena-indie heft of Foals, Two Door Cinema Club and Circa Waves. They released their first recordings back in 2014, and have lurked around the big time ever since \u2013 but could finally break through thanks to some of their strongest songs yet, such as the heavy yet deft single Your Eyes. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaOScwq_lZs\">Destiny Rogers</a></strong></h2> <p>Although she taught herself to play guitar from watching videos of Justin Bieber on YouTube, 20-year-old Californian Destiny Rogers sounds more like Ariana Grande in the way she conceals sharp truths in her effervescent, hip-hop-inflected vocal runs. \u201cI don\u2019t do no favours for the studio time,\u201d she states on calling card Tomboy, its chorus an excellent tribute to Cher\u2019s motto: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZsL5R_CR-k\" title=\"\">\u201cMom, I</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZsL5R_CR-k\" title=\"\">am a rich man.\u201d</a> <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVV8PGXJrag\">Beatrice Dillon</a></strong></h2> <p>Somewhere between the primly playful dub techno of Moritz Von Oswald and the bright science of Mark Fell sits Beatrice Dillon, a truly magical electronic producer whose tracks are as airy, spacious and elegantly designed as a modernist library. But you needn\u2019t be hushed and reverent: there is even a strain of absurdist humour to the way it all hangs together, and that sense of fun suffuses her unmissable DJ sets, too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/27/beatrice-dillon-the-most-thrilling-new-artist-in-electronic-music\">Read our interview with her here</a>. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohUGXrBrhU\">Pillow Queens</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b73feee860706aa97f1c795082f9a56a93240b53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b73feee860706aa97f1c795082f9a56a93240b53/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pillow Queens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pillow Queens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Dublin four-piece embody the shared DNA between first-wave emo and country, putting their tender approach and keen, hooky song craft in service of empathetic songs about male bonding (Brothers) and body image (HowDoILook), and slyly subversive punk: Gay Girls turns the names of the saints into a list of crushes. Together since 2016, the four women are aiming to release their debut album in 2020. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0tosWrWkBE\">Mass Worship</a></h2> <p>Start the strength conditioning exercises for the sternocleidomastoid muscles in your neck, because this Stockholm \u201cdarkened metal\u201d band invite the kind of deep, profound headbanging that could put you in bed with a whiplash injury. Having been recorded somewhere called Fuck Life Studios, their self-titled debut album is stern, abrasive and kicks total, utter and comprehensive ass: all righteous downforce and terrifying declarations. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hldPo5Vts4\">Cable Ties</a></strong></h2> <p>Formed in Melbourne\u2019s DIY punk scene, Cable Ties have signed to US indie Merge to release their second album in 2020. Their rough, determined ragers evoke Against Me! and the Velvet Underground, and in Jenny McKechnie they have a wailing tempest to rival Sleater-Kinney\u2019s Corin Tucker. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you walk out your bedroom and steal your brother\u2019s guitar,\u201d she suggests on Tell Them Where to Go, an irresistible call to arms. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbVln-3F0-w\">Bad Boy Chiller Crew</a></strong></h2> <p>A hyperlocal phenomenon in their native Bradford, Bad Boy Chiller Crew make ridiculously enjoyable bassline house anthems topped with dextrous patter about beer, designer clothes and *checks notes* the excellence of an obscure Teesside car wash called Billy\u2019s. They\u2019re the sort of people that get dismissed as chavs (or, to use their reclaimed Bradford version, \u201ccharvas\u201d), but their breezy good humour is what makes this country great \u2013 and tracks such as 450 and Pablo genuinely bang. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKkwRvm7KQM\">Badsista</a></strong></h2> <p>Brazilian producer Badsista has been a crucial part of the S\u00e3o Paulo scene for a few years now, as much for her activism \u2013 she\u2019s part of Bandida, a collective organising parties where only women and non-binary people perform \u2013 as her hectic, exhilarating kaleidoscope of baile funk, techno and house. She\u2019s set to release her debut album in 2020, <a href=\"https://remezcla.com/features/music/badsista-bahidora-profile/\" title=\"\">promising a sound</a> that is \u201cgood on the dancefloor, but also for crying in your bed\u201d. <em>LS</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"247712c5e5979ed5d96164a9233aa6dc5dbec3c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/247712c5e5979ed5d96164a9233aa6dc5dbec3c7/0_0_2048_2560/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pop Smoke.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pop Smoke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usu0XY4QNB0\">Pop Smoke</a></strong></h2> <p>Drill originally filtered over from Chicago to the UK, but now, with British MCs having made it their own with an unmistakable taunting metre, the influence is moving back across the pond. Brooklyn rapper Pop Smoke\u2019s debut release was produced entirely by Londoner 808MeloBeats, Tottenham MC Skepta hopped on a remix of hit single Welcome to the Party, and tracks like Flexin could have come straight out of Loughborough Junction \u2013 but Smoke\u2019s deep, beautiful, characterful voice has a grandeur than only comes from living in New York. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z97qLNXeAMQ\">100 Gecs</a></strong></h2> <p>100 Gecs\u2019 music starts out sounding more like noise than signal, as if Dylan Brady and Laura Les had hung an electromagnet over pop\u2019s junkyard and lured the most vivid, violent parts into a mutant whole. But over repeat exposure, the St Louis-born duo\u2019s assault of happy hardcore, dubstep and corrupted cartoon theme tunes takes on its own strangely soothing and endearing logic. Destined to be as influential as they are divisive. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YKH7y1hVFo\">Deli Girls</a></strong></h2> <p>Shuttling around the Brooklyn underground for a couple of years, the duo Deli Girls broke through to a wider audience with the release of their 2019 album I Don\u2019t Know How To Be Happy. Over lo-fi industrial beats that swing with reggaeton syncopation or bustle around with a raver\u2019s energy, Danny Orlowski rants, raves, yelps and screams \u2013 a menagerie of startled vocals that places the whole endeavour in a glorious interzone of rap, metal, punk, no wave and techno. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMj3pmnZ4ho\">Shygirl</a></strong></h2> <p>Had Peaches come up through grime and garage rather than electroclash, you would have something like Shygirl, AKA Blane Muise, whose nom de disque is probably misleading enough to get her done by Trading Standards. Her sound is deeply malevolent \u2013 Uckers pairs a sample of the scream from Psycho with a haunted dancehall beat \u2013 and she unspools her unruffled bars like a sadistic bully whispering in your ear about exactly what they plan to do to you in the graveyard after school. <em>LS</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b43b5ecb0d53c9326fc72aa8409f80b8a7f6de5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b43b5ecb0d53c9326fc72aa8409f80b8a7f6de5d/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shygirl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shygirl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burak \u00c7\u0131ng\u0131/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCqDTJfBmF8\">James Massiah</a></strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2014/sep/03/spoken-words-james-massiah-brixton-village-gentrification-video\" title=\"\">London performance poet</a> is moving into music, and his first step was perfect. His endlessly replayable track Natural Born Killers (Ride For Me) was like Dean Blunt going in on a Chicago house jam: distorted free-flowing poetry over a slowing vogueing bassline, and an enormously exciting harbinger of things to come. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmUS56Q4rM\">Dolphin Midwives</a></strong></h2> <p>Liminal Garden, the debut album proper by Portland composer Sage Fisher, tingles the upper registers of human hearing: she plays the highest notes of her harp, processing and fracturing the results in search of an effect that she likens to how it feels to experience trauma. Dolphin Midwives are unabashedly new age \u2013 right down to the <a href=\"https://www.wweek.com/music/2016/05/17/introducing-dolphin-midwives/\" title=\"\">purposefully \u201cgross\u201d name</a>, which references the apparently real practice of giving birth surrounded by dolphins.

Fake (we assume) blood pours from their mouths over white greasepaint and black leather; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ndgRJGG55s\" title=\"\">videos feature priests getting roughed up</a> and pentagrams aplenty. But this is no mere cabaret \u2013 their recently released second album Dawn of Infinite Fire is a totally exhilarating blast of permanently crescendoing metal majesty. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qMGpq_P_Ec\">Bossy Love</a></strong></h2> <p>Bossy Love are Amandah Wilkinson and John Baillie Jr and they\u2019re the best Scottish pop act since Chvrches. Released in October, their debut album Me + U is the stuff that fantasies are made of: Girlfriend brings to mind Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s passing collaborations with Danny L Harle, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU_HWKoNd0k\" title=\"\">Foreign Lover</a> could be post-breakdown Britney singing classic Erasure. Plus, they have a taste for bludgeoning arpeggiated synths straight out of Robyn\u2019s playbook. Their live shows have been inspiring cultish adoration at home in Glasgow. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRrMo8DzvW4\">Darkoo</a></strong></h2> <p>Born in Nigeria and raised in London, Darkoo sits at the subtle, delicate end of the Afro-pop spectrum. The teenager\u2019s androgynous alto allows her to be both braggadocious and coy, sometimes almost in the same line, and has already netted millions of streams for breakout hit Gangsta. Some of her peers can end up letting charisma do the heavy lifting, but with her melancholic yet swaggering chorus lines, she has the songs to match her considerable charm. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXU6X6CrdbE\">Eli Winter</a></strong></h2> <p>As a teenager in Houston, Eli Winter had his mind blown by footage of guitarist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bMVMjOMRkU\" title=\"\">Steve Gunn performing in NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk Concert series</a>. It prompted his own excursion into American primitive guitar music and a move to Chicago, as much for college as for the lineage of cross-pollinated weirdo music that came out of local labels Drag City and Thrill Jockey. His gorgeous debut album, <a href=\"https://eliwinter.bandcamp.com/album/the-time-to-come-2\" title=\"\">The Time to Come</a>, channels late local forebear Jack Rose and finds the 22-year-old considering the death of a friend and the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/27/eli-winter-discover-the-young-folk-guitarist-making-sense-of-loss\">Read our interview with him here</a>. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1AJEv50Ld4\">Celeste</a></strong></h2> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/06/soul-singer-celeste-named-winner-of-brits-rising-star-award\" title=\"\">the winner of the Brit Rising Star award</a> \u2013 previous winners include Adele, Sam Smith, and Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man \u2013 Celeste is the artist in this list most likely to cross into genuine stardom. The industry excitement is justified: her voice, which has the same scuffed melancholy as Amy Winehouse or Billie Holiday, gives such vivid life to a breakup song Strange or a moody midnight crooner such as Both Sides of the Moon. <em>BBT</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e889051a639f65da5a042089ea7f75415306065c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e889051a639f65da5a042089ea7f75415306065c/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Monet.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Monet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMGkrWD5fNg\">Victoria Mon\u00e9t</a></strong></h2> <p>Best known for her long-term writing partnership with Ariana Grande (their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0pryRrJvfI\" title=\"\">skittish collab Monopoly</a> was a 2019 highlight), Mon\u00e9t has been releasing solo material for five years but looks set to break out properly in 2020. Her upcoming EP moves away from her cutting-edge productions with Grande in favour of more luscious instrumentation indebted to Stevie Wonder\u2019s Innervisions and Frank Ocean\u2019s dreamy Blonde.

Can he keep up the momentum? Even if he struggles in the bhangra-resistent quarters of the UK, it won\u2019t be down to his voice, which is delicately mellifluous even with its power maxed out. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zDBg4amAl8\">Jack Name</a></strong></h2> <p>A stalwart of the LA psychedelic scene who has played with musicians including Ariel Pink and Tim Presley, Jack Name\u2019s own music is eerier than that of his energetic peers. He prefers close moods and chicken-scratch guitars, and shares Bradford Cox\u2019s knack for weird and lovely melodies that sparkle like specks of flint in the dirt. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbQrhOWkonk\">Ashnikko</a></strong></h2> <p>Her fairly generic breakthrough song Hi, It\u2019s Me had us fearing a Billie Eilish knockoff, but then Ashnikko \u2013 US-born, Baltics-raised, London-based \u2013 brought out Stupid. With its wild mood swings \u2013 maniacal laughter into monotone lyric recital \u2013 it was tailor made for miming on TikTok and became an unlikely divorce anthem, plus a massive streaming hit. Here and elsewhere, her central lyrical focus is the teasing and withholding of sex: one minute she\u2019ll be comparing the taste of a certain male organ to a scented candle, the next she\u2019ll decide her vibrator is a much better option. <em>BBT</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d06a2eba35642b3d477abd6a08533b4fcc0e5fc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d06a2eba35642b3d477abd6a08533b4fcc0e5fc7/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashnikko.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashnikko.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucrecia Taormina</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls1K2WPo7uw\">Galen Tipton</a></strong></h2> <p>Not a million miles from the <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/100-gecs-1000-gecs/\" title=\"\">100 Gecs</a> nexus, this Ohio producer\u2019s music sometimes evinces the deranged energy of a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/trecartin\" title=\"\">Ryan Trecartin</a> film, yet at others channels the soothing wonder of strolling your video game avatar through a pixellated rainforest. Their music is vivid and playful, qualities they share with the Japanese footwork scene: \u201cTo me, the music these artists make sounds like pure freedom and play, and that\u2019s the space I like to create from,\u201d <a href=\"https://mixmag.net/feature/post-pc-music-pop-continuum\" title=\"\">Tipton told Mixmag</a>. \u201cOne of unrestricted expression and emotion.\u201d <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4ErQRLTi54\">Mortimer</a></strong></h2> <p>As traditional roots reggae continues to flourish, someone well placed to cross over to an audience returning to its easygoing charms is Jamaican singer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4ErQRLTi54\" title=\"\">Mortimer</a>. His voice is hands-down gorgeous, the sort of thing that reduces even the most pursed-lip muso to blissful sighs at 100 paces: rich and robust in its depths, flinty and feathery in his lovely top range.

While she is hyper-prolific, releasing more than 24 singles in two years, her 2019 album, Error 93, shares its immersive, focused insularity with Rihanna\u2019s Anti. She\u2019s as iconoclastic as the Bajan star, too: her lyrics extol female empowerment in a male-dominated scene, and she often performs with a green handkerchief in support of the movement to legalise abortion in Argentina. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUyHJKNHN1o\">Cashh</a></strong></h2> <p>With the much larkier moniker Cashtastic, things were looking good for this rapper, with a healthy buzz and a Universal contract. But despite growing up in Peckham, London, and a protest led by Kano, he was deported to Jamaica in 2014 on murky immigration grounds. Now back in the UK, all his legal woes have at least left him with a distinctive Jamaican-tinged accent, put to propulsive use on gleaming trap tracks such as the brand new Incognito. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkceNkbD95g\">India Jordan</a></strong></h2> <p>London producer India Jordan is known for running New Atlantis, a monthly ambient Sunday session at London venue Rye Wax. Yet her debut EP, DNT STP MY LV, is a thumping rampage through rave, jungle and boogie (the title track samples Don\u2019t Stop My Love by \u2013 there he is again \u2013 Kashif). She\u2019s swiftly becoming indispensable for both the wee hours and the recovery the next day. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7XcDX7iI0\">Disq</a></strong></h2> <p>Not yet out of their teens, this band based around the duo of Isaac deBroux-Slone and Raina Bock are emerging from the absolute middle of nowhere in Wisconsin with startlingly accomplished songs. Like seemingly any young band at the moment, Pavement seem to be a touchstone, and there\u2019s Parquet Courts\u2019 blend of snot and soul. Keep an eye out for unreleased songs such as Loneliness and Daily Routine: genuine classics of new-school indie rock. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqfb3uaigwY\">L Devine</a></strong></h2> <p>Olivia Devine moved from Newcastle to London, the idea being to write for other artists. Which she did (Icona Pop, of I Love It fame, recorded one of her songs), but when Warner offered her a solo deal, she thought: well, why not. The 22-year-old has swiftly developed her sound: where last year\u2019s Peer Pressure EP channelled Haim and Devine\u2019s labelmate Dua Lipa, her excellent recent singles are more idiosyncratic: the minimal, windscreen-washer funk of Naked Alone would have been a massive hit had Mark Ronson released it, while Peachy Keen is a trance-y cyborg ballad. Charli XCX has called her \u201cthe motherfucking future\u201d of pop. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxYoogRg5fs\">Anz</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7048aad80ab593960d27eef10b3d0bc8ea481539\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7048aad80ab593960d27eef10b3d0bc8ea481539/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anz\u2019s No Harm, a wriggling, squiggly slice of high-speed vintage boogie, was one of the most feted tracks in the electronic underground in 2019 \u2013 as was the rest of the Mancunian producer\u2019s Invitation 2 Dance EP. Even better are her \u201cdubs\u201d mixes, where her own tracks are threaded through imaginative reworks, like a <a href=\"http://kaliuchis.com/\" title=\"\">Kali Uchis</a> vocal laid over harp-driven UKG to deliriously beautiful effect. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7df3SXK2xU\">Eve Owen</a></strong></h2> <p>The cresting voice on Where Is Her Head, from the National\u2019s 2019 album I Am Easy to Find, belonged to Eve Owen (daughter of the actor Clive). In 2020, the 19-year-old will release her debut album produced by the National\u2019s Aaron Dessner. There\u2019s something of early Sharon Van Etten (another Dessner collaborator) about her emphatic balladry and the way she holds her own against orchestral-tinged rock tumult. It\u2019s not hard to fathom her finding mainstream appeal alongside the likes of Lewis Capaldi. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5fv0ORwl4I\">Life</a></strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s little wonder this Hull band supported Idles on their 2019 European tour, given they also rant anthemically over chugging indie-punk. They also have Idles\u2019 anger at inequality in society \u2013 two of their number work with a social enterprise to help vulnerable young people make music \u2013 and raggedly brilliant tunes such as Half Pint Fatherhood will get circle pits instantly opening up. <em>BBT</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"586b80350a15b4a51b648895bb8d656ac023f122\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/586b80350a15b4a51b648895bb8d656ac023f122/0_0_3600_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hcJuPRGQIc\">Kiko El Crazy</a></strong></h2> <p>Kiko El Crazy joins El Alfa in helping dembow come to rival reggaeton in the global pop stakes \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/the-rise-of-dembow-el-alfa-lirico-en-la-casa-907678/\" title=\"\">Rolling Stone reported</a> that Spotify listening figures for the genre doubled between January 2018 and August 2019, while <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/arts/music/dembow-rhythm-drake-justin-bieber.html\" title=\"\">the New York Times proclaimed it</a> the \u201csecret ingredient in songs of summer\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Sports Team This boisterous six-piece, formed at the University of Cambridge, have garnered serious hype despite indie music being a bit of a cultural backwater of late. Yes, they are outspoken in the press and willing to poke fun at their peers, but the buzz is mostly thanks to their songs, with flamboyant and charismatic frontman Alex Rice stacking up the singalong choruses. Read our interview with them here. BBT Alyona Alyona A former kindergarten teacher, Ukranian rapper Alyona Alyona keeps her material clean in case kids are listening. But her music \u2013 trap tinged with traditional vocal melodies \u2013 is far from toothless. Her breakout hit, Ribki, was about fish, but also young women who feel out of place \u2013 just as she did when people kept telling her that a plus-size female rapper would never make it in Ukraine. She raps about her regular life, touching on feminism, body positivity and tolerance, and switched from rapping in Russian back to Ukranian \u2013 a \u201cbeautiful, soft, tender, more poetic language\u201d \u2013 after the country\u2019s 2014 revolution. LS Normani Disbanded girl group Fifth Harmony is looking like a pretty successful training ground for a series of solo stars \u2013 Lauren Jauregui is currently looking to replicate the success of Camila Cabello, but in with an even better chance is Normani. Her duet with Sam Smith, Dancing With a Stranger, brought maturity and pain to the dancefloor, her solo single Motivation was totally irrepressible, and she is the first artist to get 1bn streams on Spotify without releasing an album. Stardom will surely be sealed when that debut LP arrives this spring. BBT Kalie Shorr While there\u2019s probably no greater indictment of country music\u2019s conservatism than the fact that Kalie Shorr remains unsigned, her self-released debut album was likely better off for evading the genre\u2019s nervy gatekeepers. Open Book covers the worst year of the 25-year-old Maine native\u2019s life: her sister\u2019s fatal heroin overdose, Shorr\u2019s anorexia and physical abuse from ex-boyfriends. Astonishingly, she addresses her past with mordant wit and vast reserves of empathy \u2013 plus gigantic hooks worthy of Nashville-era Taylor Swift, pop-punk icons Paramore and Jagged Little Pill-era Alanis. LS Lynks Afrikka Smeared in lipstick and eyeshadow beneath an impressive collection of ripped masks, the drag persona of Bristol\u2019s Elliot Brett is like Christeene crossed with the Mighty Boosh. His tinny electroclash tracks include the absurd sandwich metaphors of BLLT (\u201cI\u2019m a toastie / The boys they never ghost me / Not all the time but mostly\u201d) and the Str8 Acting\u2019s confusion at going to non-queer nightclubs (\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a pub but with slightly less chairs\u201d), adding up to the kind of English eccentric we need now more than ever. BBT Twst Thousands of bedroom producers mimic the sounds of mainstream pop, but few actually pull off its heart-stopping sense of scale. Twst, AKA 21-year-old Wales-born Chlo\u00e9 Davis, is one of them. Her three songs to date suggest St Vincent reborn as an internet-spawned pop star: Girl on Your TV inflates lullaby-worthy melodies like a swelling Thanksgiving parade balloon, and she slips razor-sharp observations about sexualisation and the lie of technology into her lyrics. Always, a wracked conversation with Siri, plays like a Gen Z makeover of Kate Bush\u2019s Deeper Understanding. LS El Alfa The idea that El Alfa is in any way a 2020 hopeful will seem ludicrous to the Dominican Republic-born dembow artist\u2019s fans, who have watched his charismatic, booty-heavy videos upwards of 20m, 30m, 40m times. Collaborations with major players such Cardi B, Bad Bunny, J Balvin and Diplo speak to someone who is well on their way to the top, thanks very much. But in the UK, where awareness and exposure of Latinx pop remains limited, his bratty vocal trills and fire-starting energy could easily see him swoop in and conquer the charts in 2020. LS Jesse James Solomon Solomon released his first EP in 2014, and has since become a true cult figure \u2013 a storytelling south London MC who doesn\u2019t fit into any of the neat British rap boxes (grime, backpacker, drill, Afro trap), but walks his own path. The excellent 2019 mixtape Bleak sat somewhere between Frank Ocean, King Krule and A Tribe Called Quest, a downbeat trudge through a rainswept night \u2013 but new single Tit for Tat is quite the opposite, a crisply headnodding roller with a Giggs guest spot. BBT Chippy Nonstop Starting the decade as a rapper whose wittily trashy aesthetic made Nicki Minaj look like Audrey Hepburn, Toronto-based Chippy Nonstop ended it as one of the most purely enjoyable DJs out there. A typical set can take in dancehall, Miami bass, R&amp;B, trap, jungle, Afrobeats and more \u2013 all of it seemingly designed to goad anyone, however inappropriately, into feverish twerking on all fours. BBT Nala Sinephro Keen watchers of recent performances by south-east London jazz collective Steam Down may have spotted Nala Sinephro performing alongside the likes of Rosie Turton and Nadeem Din-Gabisi. She\u2019ll take the spotlight in 2020 to release her beguiling debut album: backed by a small ensemble, the Caribbean-Belgian musician plays pedal harp through modular and analogue synths, the effect gorgeously woozy and tidal \u2013 and not unworthy of comparison to Alice Coltrane. LS Lady Lykez By blending the firehose delivery of jungle MCs with lipsmacking lyricism, wavey bashment energy and deadpan darts of pure disparagement (\u201cyuh pussy have gangrene\u201d), Lady Lykez is a formidable British rap talent. Live shows are a riot of audience participation, and she found a perfect foil in producer Scratcha DVA for her 2019 EP Muhammad Ali \u2013 like him, she delivers on claims of greatness. BBT Lynda Dawn First heard when Gilles Peterson put her song Move on the November 2018 edition of his Brownswood Bubblers compilation, London classicist Lynda Dawn harks back to Whitney Houston\u2019s earliest work with boogie pioneer Kashif. Like Houston, Dawn was raised in the Pentecostal church and her gospel-influenced vocals dazzle like shafts of light through a stained-glass window. LS Sech Despacito is looking more and more like a one-off: few of the Latin artists who get literally billions of streams elsewhere in the world cross over to the UK mainstream. But if anyone can, it\u2019s ursine Panamanian singer Sech, whose voice is deeper and earthier than peers such as Ozuna, Bad Bunny or Maluma \u2013 he croons it over keeningly romantic R&amp;B, powered by the relentless hip-swing of reggaeton. After the success of Latin Grammy-nominated single Otro Trago, be sure that he\u2019s beavering away on the song of the summer. BBT Charl\u00e8ne Darling Borrowing her name from the Andy Griffith Show character, Paris\u2019s Charl\u00e8ne Darling makes off-kilter, shimmering chanson post-punk that connects the dots between the feminist troubadours of Agn\u00e8s Varda\u2019s L\u2019Une Chante, L\u2019Autre Pas, Thai molam music, the Raincoats and the way Cate Le Bon slides between bucolic melody and clanging post-punk. Her debut album, Saint-Guidon, is one of 2019\u2019s buried treasures. LS The New Death Cult With their skull masks, black robes and unequivocally morbid band name, the New Death Cult look like a threatening cross between drill rappers and black metallers. But actually, a bit like their fellow Scandi bands Motorpsycho and the Night Flight Orchestra, the Norwegian quartet sit at the tunefully proggy end of classic rock. There\u2019s a fair bit of neanderthal chugging, but songs such as True Eyes show their range, with a smoky, soulful sweetness. BBT Meggie Brown There\u2019s a ruthless energy to Meggie Cousland. The London musician has said she uses ketamine to help write her prowling, Cramps-tinged punk, some of which she has recorded with Franz Ferdinand\u2019s Alex Kapranos in Edwyn Collins\u2019s studio. She fired one band when they weren\u2019t cutting the mustard: her new, eight-strong rabble supply intimidating gang vocals on recent single I Said Salute Me, which finds Cousland ordering a crush who doesn\u2019t return her ardour to drop and give her 20 in a Rocky Horror-worthy refrain. Odd tactic, but you wouldn\u2019t say no to her. LS Marsicans This Leeds indie quartet have the same slick arena-indie heft of Foals, Two Door Cinema Club and Circa Waves. They released their first recordings back in 2014, and have lurked around the big time ever since \u2013 but could finally break through thanks to some of their strongest songs yet, such as the heavy yet deft single Your Eyes. BBT Destiny Rogers Although she taught herself to play guitar from watching videos of Justin Bieber on YouTube, 20-year-old Californian Destiny Rogers sounds more like Ariana Grande in the way she conceals sharp truths in her effervescent, hip-hop-inflected vocal runs. \u201cI don\u2019t do no favours for the studio time,\u201d she states on calling card Tomboy, its chorus an excellent tribute to Cher\u2019s motto: \u201cMom, I am a rich man.\u201d LS Beatrice Dillon Somewhere between the primly playful dub techno of Moritz Von Oswald and the bright science of Mark Fell sits Beatrice Dillon, a truly magical electronic producer whose tracks are as airy, spacious and elegantly designed as a modernist library. But you needn\u2019t be hushed and reverent: there is even a strain of absurdist humour to the way it all hangs together, and that sense of fun suffuses her unmissable DJ sets, too. Read our interview with her here. BBT Pillow Queens The Dublin four-piece embody the shared DNA between first-wave emo and country, putting their tender approach and keen, hooky song craft in service of empathetic songs about male bonding (Brothers) and body image (HowDoILook), and slyly subversive punk: Gay Girls turns the names of the saints into a list of crushes. Together since 2016, the four women are aiming to release their debut album in 2020. LS Mass Worship Start the strength conditioning exercises for the sternocleidomastoid muscles in your neck, because this Stockholm \u201cdarkened metal\u201d band invite the kind of deep, profound headbanging that could put you in bed with a whiplash injury. Having been recorded somewhere called Fuck Life Studios, their self-titled debut album is stern, abrasive and kicks total, utter and comprehensive ass: all righteous downforce and terrifying declarations. BBT Cable Ties Formed in Melbourne\u2019s DIY punk scene, Cable Ties have signed to US indie Merge to release their second album in 2020. Their rough, determined ragers evoke Against Me! and the Velvet Underground, and in Jenny McKechnie they have a wailing tempest to rival Sleater-Kinney\u2019s Corin Tucker. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you walk out your bedroom and steal your brother\u2019s guitar,\u201d she suggests on Tell Them Where to Go, an irresistible call to arms. LS Bad Boy Chiller Crew A hyperlocal phenomenon in their native Bradford, Bad Boy Chiller Crew make ridiculously enjoyable bassline house anthems topped with dextrous patter about beer, designer clothes and *checks notes* the excellence of an obscure Teesside car wash called Billy\u2019s. They\u2019re the sort of people that get dismissed as chavs (or, to use their reclaimed Bradford version, \u201ccharvas\u201d), but their breezy good humour is what makes this country great \u2013 and tracks such as 450 and Pablo genuinely bang. BBT Badsista Brazilian producer Badsista has been a crucial part of the S\u00e3o Paulo scene for a few years now, as much for her activism \u2013 she\u2019s part of Bandida, a collective organising parties where only women and non-binary people perform \u2013 as her hectic, exhilarating kaleidoscope of baile funk, techno and house. She\u2019s set to release her debut album in 2020, promising a sound that is \u201cgood on the dancefloor, but also for crying in your bed\u201d. LS Pop Smoke Drill originally filtered over from Chicago to the UK, but now, with British MCs having made it their own with an unmistakable taunting metre, the influence is moving back across the pond. Brooklyn rapper Pop Smoke\u2019s debut release was produced entirely by Londoner 808MeloBeats, Tottenham MC Skepta hopped on a remix of hit single Welcome to the Party, and tracks like Flexin could have come straight out of Loughborough Junction \u2013 but Smoke\u2019s deep, beautiful, characterful voice has a grandeur than only comes from living in New York. BBT 100 Gecs 100 Gecs\u2019 music starts out sounding more like noise than signal, as if Dylan Brady and Laura Les had hung an electromagnet over pop\u2019s junkyard and lured the most vivid, violent parts into a mutant whole. But over repeat exposure, the St Louis-born duo\u2019s assault of happy hardcore, dubstep and corrupted cartoon theme tunes takes on its own strangely soothing and endearing logic. Destined to be as influential as they are divisive. LS Deli Girls Shuttling around the Brooklyn underground for a couple of years, the duo Deli Girls broke through to a wider audience with the release of their 2019 album I Don\u2019t Know How To Be Happy. Over lo-fi industrial beats that swing with reggaeton syncopation or bustle around with a raver\u2019s energy, Danny Orlowski rants, raves, yelps and screams \u2013 a menagerie of startled vocals that places the whole endeavour in a glorious interzone of rap, metal, punk, no wave and techno. BBT Shygirl Had Peaches come up through grime and garage rather than electroclash, you would have something like Shygirl, AKA Blane Muise, whose nom de disque is probably misleading enough to get her done by Trading Standards. Her sound is deeply malevolent \u2013 Uckers pairs a sample of the scream from Psycho with a haunted dancehall beat \u2013 and she unspools her unruffled bars like a sadistic bully whispering in your ear about exactly what they plan to do to you in the graveyard after school. LS James Massiah The London performance poet is moving into music, and his first step was perfect. His endlessly replayable track Natural Born Killers (Ride For Me) was like Dean Blunt going in on a Chicago house jam: distorted free-flowing poetry over a slowing vogueing bassline, and an enormously exciting harbinger of things to come. BBT Dolphin Midwives Liminal Garden, the debut album proper by Portland composer Sage Fisher, tingles the upper registers of human hearing: she plays the highest notes of her harp, processing and fracturing the results in search of an effect that she likens to how it feels to experience trauma. Dolphin Midwives are unabashedly new age \u2013 right down to the purposefully \u201cgross\u201d name, which references the apparently real practice of giving birth surrounded by dolphins. One for fans of Holly Herndon and Mary Lattimore. LS Asagraum This all-female satanic black metal band from Holland have a terrific sense of theatre. Fake (we assume) blood pours from their mouths over white greasepaint and black leather; videos feature priests getting roughed up and pentagrams aplenty. But this is no mere cabaret \u2013 their recently released second album Dawn of Infinite Fire is a totally exhilarating blast of permanently crescendoing metal majesty. BBT Bossy Love Bossy Love are Amandah Wilkinson and John Baillie Jr and they\u2019re the best Scottish pop act since Chvrches. Released in October, their debut album Me + U is the stuff that fantasies are made of: Girlfriend brings to mind Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s passing collaborations with Danny L Harle, while Foreign Lover could be post-breakdown Britney singing classic Erasure. Plus, they have a taste for bludgeoning arpeggiated synths straight out of Robyn\u2019s playbook. Their live shows have been inspiring cultish adoration at home in Glasgow. LS Darkoo Born in Nigeria and raised in London, Darkoo sits at the subtle, delicate end of the Afro-pop spectrum. The teenager\u2019s androgynous alto allows her to be both braggadocious and coy, sometimes almost in the same line, and has already netted millions of streams for breakout hit Gangsta. Some of her peers can end up letting charisma do the heavy lifting, but with her melancholic yet swaggering chorus lines, she has the songs to match her considerable charm. BBT Eli Winter As a teenager in Houston, Eli Winter had his mind blown by footage of guitarist Steve Gunn performing in NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk Concert series. It prompted his own excursion into American primitive guitar music and a move to Chicago, as much for college as for the lineage of cross-pollinated weirdo music that came out of local labels Drag City and Thrill Jockey. His gorgeous debut album, The Time to Come, channels late local forebear Jack Rose and finds the 22-year-old considering the death of a friend and the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Read our interview with him here. LS Celeste As the winner of the Brit Rising Star award \u2013 previous winners include Adele, Sam Smith, and Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man \u2013 Celeste is the artist in this list most likely to cross into genuine stardom. The industry excitement is justified: her voice, which has the same scuffed melancholy as Amy Winehouse or Billie Holiday, gives such vivid life to a breakup song Strange or a moody midnight crooner such as Both Sides of the Moon. BBT Victoria Mon\u00e9t Best known for her long-term writing partnership with Ariana Grande (their skittish collab Monopoly was a 2019 highlight), Mon\u00e9t has been releasing solo material for five years but looks set to break out properly in 2020. Her upcoming EP moves away from her cutting-edge productions with Grande in favour of more luscious instrumentation indebted to Stevie Wonder\u2019s Innervisions and Frank Ocean\u2019s dreamy Blonde. Her ambition to be a Pharrell-type double threat looks eminently likely to pay off. Read our interview with her here. LS Sidhu Moose Wala South Asian music rarely crosses over into the UK charts, but Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala managed it in October with blockbuster track 47, flanked by British rappers Mist and Stefflon Don. Can he keep up the momentum? Even if he struggles in the bhangra-resistent quarters of the UK, it won\u2019t be down to his voice, which is delicately mellifluous even with its power maxed out. BBT Jack Name A stalwart of the LA psychedelic scene who has played with musicians including Ariel Pink and Tim Presley, Jack Name\u2019s own music is eerier than that of his energetic peers. He prefers close moods and chicken-scratch guitars, and shares Bradford Cox\u2019s knack for weird and lovely melodies that sparkle like specks of flint in the dirt. LS Ashnikko Her fairly generic breakthrough song Hi, It\u2019s Me had us fearing a Billie Eilish knockoff, but then Ashnikko \u2013 US-born, Baltics-raised, London-based \u2013 brought out Stupid. With its wild mood swings \u2013 maniacal laughter into monotone lyric recital \u2013 it was tailor made for miming on TikTok and became an unlikely divorce anthem, plus a massive streaming hit. Here and elsewhere, her central lyrical focus is the teasing and withholding of sex: one minute she\u2019ll be comparing the taste of a certain male organ to a scented candle, the next she\u2019ll decide her vibrator is a much better option. BBT Galen Tipton Not a million miles from the 100 Gecs nexus, this Ohio producer\u2019s music sometimes evinces the deranged energy of a Ryan Trecartin film, yet at others channels the soothing wonder of strolling your video game avatar through a pixellated rainforest. Their music is vivid and playful, qualities they share with the Japanese footwork scene: \u201cTo me, the music these artists make sounds like pure freedom and play, and that\u2019s the space I like to create from,\u201d Tipton told Mixmag. \u201cOne of unrestricted expression and emotion.\u201d LS Mortimer As traditional roots reggae continues to flourish, someone well placed to cross over to an audience returning to its easygoing charms is Jamaican singer Mortimer. His voice is hands-down gorgeous, the sort of thing that reduces even the most pursed-lip muso to blissful sighs at 100 paces: rich and robust in its depths, flinty and feathery in his lovely top range. Recent EP Fight the Fight is a good place to start. BBT Cazzu The 26-year-old Argentinian-born Julieta Cazzucheli spent a decade trying her luck with a variety of sounds from reggaeton to rock, but finally broke out with her melancholy, emo-tinged trap (Bad Bunny jumping on a remix of her 2017 single Loca helped, too). While she is hyper-prolific, releasing more than 24 singles in two years, her 2019 album, Error 93, shares its immersive, focused insularity with Rihanna\u2019s Anti. She\u2019s as iconoclastic as the Bajan star, too: her lyrics extol female empowerment in a male-dominated scene, and she often performs with a green handkerchief in support of the movement to legalise abortion in Argentina. LS Cashh With the much larkier moniker Cashtastic, things were looking good for this rapper, with a healthy buzz and a Universal contract. But despite growing up in Peckham, London, and a protest led by Kano, he was deported to Jamaica in 2014 on murky immigration grounds. Now back in the UK, all his legal woes have at least left him with a distinctive Jamaican-tinged accent, put to propulsive use on gleaming trap tracks such as the brand new Incognito. BBT India Jordan London producer India Jordan is known for running New Atlantis, a monthly ambient Sunday session at London venue Rye Wax. Yet her debut EP, DNT STP MY LV, is a thumping rampage through rave, jungle and boogie (the title track samples Don\u2019t Stop My Love by \u2013 there he is again \u2013 Kashif). She\u2019s swiftly becoming indispensable for both the wee hours and the recovery the next day. LS Disq Not yet out of their teens, this band based around the duo of Isaac deBroux-Slone and Raina Bock are emerging from the absolute middle of nowhere in Wisconsin with startlingly accomplished songs. Like seemingly any young band at the moment, Pavement seem to be a touchstone, and there\u2019s Parquet Courts\u2019 blend of snot and soul. Keep an eye out for unreleased songs such as Loneliness and Daily Routine: genuine classics of new-school indie rock. BBT L Devine Olivia Devine moved from Newcastle to London, the idea being to write for other artists. Which she did (Icona Pop, of I Love It fame, recorded one of her songs), but when Warner offered her a solo deal, she thought: well, why not. The 22-year-old has swiftly developed her sound: where last year\u2019s Peer Pressure EP channelled Haim and Devine\u2019s labelmate Dua Lipa, her excellent recent singles are more idiosyncratic: the minimal, windscreen-washer funk of Naked Alone would have been a massive hit had Mark Ronson released it, while Peachy Keen is a trance-y cyborg ballad. Charli XCX has called her \u201cthe motherfucking future\u201d of pop. LS Anz Anz\u2019s No Harm, a wriggling, squiggly slice of high-speed vintage boogie, was one of the most feted tracks in the electronic underground in 2019 \u2013 as was the rest of the Mancunian producer\u2019s Invitation 2 Dance EP. Even better are her \u201cdubs\u201d mixes, where her own tracks are threaded through imaginative reworks, like a Kali Uchis vocal laid over harp-driven UKG to deliriously beautiful effect. BBT Eve Owen The cresting voice on Where Is Her Head, from the National\u2019s 2019 album I Am Easy to Find, belonged to Eve Owen (daughter of the actor Clive). In 2020, the 19-year-old will release her debut album produced by the National\u2019s Aaron Dessner. There\u2019s something of early Sharon Van Etten (another Dessner collaborator) about her emphatic balladry and the way she holds her own against orchestral-tinged rock tumult. It\u2019s not hard to fathom her finding mainstream appeal alongside the likes of Lewis Capaldi. LS Life It\u2019s little wonder this Hull band supported Idles on their 2019 European tour, given they also rant anthemically over chugging indie-punk. They also have Idles\u2019 anger at inequality in society \u2013 two of their number work with a social enterprise to help vulnerable young people make music \u2013 and raggedly brilliant tunes such as Half Pint Fatherhood will get circle pits instantly opening up. BBT Kiko El Crazy Kiko El Crazy joins El Alfa in helping dembow come to rival reggaeton in the global pop stakes \u2013 Rolling Stone reported that Spotify listening figures for the genre doubled between January 2018 and August 2019, while the New York Times proclaimed it the \u201csecret ingredient in songs of summer\u201d. The pink \u2019fro-sporting Dominican admitted that he once didn\u2019t respect the genre because it seemed \u201ctoo underground\u201d to offer much potential for growth, but happily, since leaving the rap group El Army, he has disproven his own theory, pebbledashing his gritty bars all over the addictive rhythm.

      "bodyText": "As homelessness surged to crisis levels in California in 2019, so did the violent attacks on people living in tents and on sidewalks and the political and law enforcement efforts to keep homeless encampments off the streets. Physical assaults and criminalization efforts combined have made 2019 a particularly grim and terrifying year for many Californians struggling to survive without a roof over their head. \u201cThey are trying to shove us underneath the carpet, and it\u2019s just not fair,\u201d said Shanna Couper Orona, 46, who is currently living out of an RV in San Francisco. \u201cSan Francisco is supposed to be progressive, a place where you love everyone, take care of everyone \u2026 But they\u2019ve turned their backs on us just because we\u2019re unhoused. They are leaving us with nothing.\u201d Amid expanding crisis, a surge in homeless victims In a state with the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, an IPO tech boom and some of the richest people on earth, California\u2019s severe affordable housing shortage has become what advocates describe as a moral failing and public health emergency. Los Angeles experienced a 16% increase in homelessness this year, with a total of 36,000 people now homeless across the city, including 27,000 without shelter. San Francisco\u2019s homeless count surged 17% to more than 8,000 people. There was a 42% increase in San Jose, a 47% increase in Oakland, a 52% increase in Sacramento county and increases in the Central Valley agricultural region and wealthy suburbs of Orange county. There were patterns across cities: huge numbers of people experiencing homelessness for the first time, evictions and unaffordable rents leading people to the streets, families and seniors increasingly homeless, and higher rates of the homeless not getting shelter. \u201cHomeless people are everywhere now, and they are becoming more and more desperate,\u201d said Stephen \u201cCue\u201d Jn-Marie, an LA pastor who was formerly homeless and now works with people living on Skid Row, known for its massive encampments. \u201cAll of these people are human beings. We need to respond to this as if it\u2019s an earthquake.\u201d The growing visibility has led to an increase in complaints, news coverage focused on housed people who reside near encampments, and intense media attention on the rare cases of violence perpetuated by people living on the streets. Communities have largely declined to treat the crisis like a natural disaster that demands humanitarian aid. In many places, what followed instead was a backlash, and in some cases overt attacks. There were at least eight incidents in LA where people threw flammable liquids or makeshift explosives at homeless people or their tents this year, according to authorities and the Los Angeles Times. A 62-year-old beloved musician\u2019s tent was set on fire in Skid Row in August, killing him in what police say was an intentional killing. That month, two men also allegedly threw a \u201cfirework\u201d at an encampment, causing a blaze that grew into a major brush fire just outside of the city. One of the men arrested was the son of a local chamber of commerce president. Police said this fire was intentional. In a separate attack, a molotov cocktail destroyed tents and donations. In San Francisco, a man was caught on video appearing to dump a bucket of water on a homeless woman and her belongings on the sidewalk in June. Witnesses said it seemed to be a deliberate \u201cattack\u201d. Three months later, San Franciscans who said they were upset with homeless people in their neighborhood paid to install two-dozen knee-high boulders along a sidewalk in an effort to stop them from living on the streets. In neighboring Oakland, a resident recently put up an unauthorized concrete barrier in the middle of the street to deter homeless people from parking RVs. A real estate developer taunted homeless people by shouting \u201cfree money\u201d at them and offering to pay them to leave their encampment in Oakland. Residents repeatedly organized against proposed homeless shelters in their neighborhoods, most notably in a wealthy San Francisco area where locals crowdfunded $70,000 to hire an attorney to fight a shelter project. \u201cA lot of it is brought out by this fear of the other as if their homeless neighbors are not neighbors at all, or not even people for that matter,\u201d said TJ Johnston, who is currently staying in shelters in San Francisco and is an editor with Street Sheet, a local homelessness publication. Hearing wealthy residents complain this year was like watching angry online comment sections come to life, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s very dehumanizing to be looked upon as a nuisance.\u201d A \u2018terrifying\u2019 trend: jailing people for being \u2018too poor\u2019 As the crisis has worsened, local governments have spent billions to create new housing and provide services, but the scale of the response has been inadequate. Cities have increasingly looked to law enforcement and legal maneuvers to tackle the problem. Those political efforts to further criminalize the homeless in turn have sparked intense anger and fear among the homeless population and their advocates. LA leaders fought to ban people from sleeping on streets and sidewalks throughout the city. In Lancaster, a desert city north of LA, the mayor has pushed a proposal to ban groups that provide food to homeless people and suggested people should buy firearms to protect themselves from violent people on the streets. This month, in a case closely watched by many west coast cities, the US supreme court dealt a victory to homeless advocates by allowing an existing ruling to stand that states governments cannot ban people from living on the street if they don\u2019t offer enough shelter beds. Officials in Oakland have proposed a new policy to cite homeless people in parks while some have suggested setting up a shelter in a defunct jail. Law enforcement leaders in Bakersfield in the Central Valley pushed a plan to throw homeless people in jail for misdemeanor offenses. A state taskforce has also suggested a similar system of forcibly placing homeless people into shelters. These efforts ignore the overwhelming evidence that criminalization and locking people up are costly and harmful responses that fail to fix the crisis, said Eve Garrow, homelessness policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. \u201cThere\u2019s a dangerous and disturbing movement in California to address homelessness not by expanding access to safe, affordable and permanent housing \u2026 but by jailing people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying prospect of a world in which we segregate, incarcerate and restrict the civil liberties of people just because they have disabilities and they are too poor to afford a home in our skyrocketing private rental market.\u201d Fears and unfounded stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness seem to be driving these policy pushes to jail those in need, she said. The Trump administration has created further anxiety by repeatedly suggesting he might pursue some kind of police crackdown in California to clear the streets of encampments. The president has used the crisis to attack Democratic leaders in the state, and has complained about homeless people in LA and San Francisco taking up space on the \u201cbest highways, our best streets, our best entrances to buildings \u2026 where people in those buildings pay tremendous taxes, where they went to those locations because of the prestige\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge concern \u2013 are they just going to take people to jail?\u201d said Kat Doherty, an LA woman who became homeless this year and is living at a shelter at Skid Row. Trump\u2019s talk has terrified her and others, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrendous. It sounds like a death camp situation.\u201d With the president promoting criminalization, it could inspire some anti-Trump Democrats in California to push back, said Jennifer Friedenbach, the executive director for the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco. \u201cThere\u2019s some hopefulness that it will force the local municipalities to shift in opposition to Trump and talk about how criminalization doesn\u2019t work.\u201d But some are not optimistic about 2020, especially since the crisis is on track to continue escalating, with people falling into homelessness at rates that far outpace governments\u2019 ability to find housing for those on the street. \u201cConditions are going to get worse \u2013 and the responses are going to get worse,\u201d said Jn-Marie. If the political attacks continue next year, some said they hoped to see more communities fighting to stand up for the homeless. \u201cI want people to give a fuck and help. Don\u2019t just ignore it,\u201d Orona said. \u201cJust because we\u2019re unhoused doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not San Francisco residents. We still have a heartbeat. We still buy food.

While Nas and TI cut some of her songs, her most fertile songwriting relationship is with Grande\u2013 the pair have worked together since Grande\u2019s 2013 debut album, Yours Truly. \u201cIt was a slow build \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like the first time I met her we were best friends,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like we have enough differences to bring the best out of each other, but enough similarities to last and get along.\u201d In between songwriting for others, she sporadically released her own music, and while she is proud of her four previous EPs, they always involved compromise. \u201cThey didn\u2019t necessarily pay the bills,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to survive in LA, so songwriting was a little more promising.\u201d For her forthcoming opus, however, she made the decision to stop writing for everybody else for a month. \u201cI had never done that before and I got to dig deeper into what I personally love.\u201d That relaxed confidence permeates Ass Like That, a honey-drenched ode to self-confidence that dismisses music\u2019s current rules about brevity to slowly ease you into its world of sweat-soaked, glute-focused gym routines. \u201cI\u2019ve heard male rappers talking about [women] in certain ways \u2013 why can\u2019t we sing about how we feel and what we want?\u201d she says. Plus, she thinks the songs are encased in such elegant packaging, all Motown horns and Maxwell-esque neo-soul, that people \u201cmight miss a lot of the lyrical content\u201d. Even the song slathered in orgasmic crescendos? \u201cNo, you\u2019re right,\u201d she laughs. \u201cUnless you\u2019re really, really airy.\u201d Has she figured out how to play her family \u2013 so often the soundboard for past releases \u2013 the new songs? She thinks for a moment. \u201cMaybe just play them the instrumental, don\u2019t worry about the lyrics,\u201d she concludes.",

The idea of black work being a \u201crisk\u201d is redundant \u2013 the numbers don\u2019t lie. Black theatre sells, and we have shown that if the work is varied, interesting and diverse, black people will come.

I hope we increase in numbers, and stop becoming the minority backstage. I hope that black British people recognise working backstage as a legitimate career, and you can make a living. We should workshop it more to schools so people of colour know the career prospects exist. However, I believe this is slowly growing as black British people are producing more. That becomes a domino effect, where they try to seek a POC backstage team. Some amazing, thought-provoking, heartfelt work is being created. Plays I have worked on like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/13/edinburgh-fringe-theatre-whales-revlon-girl-venus-adonis-half-breed-review\">Half Breed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/26/barber-shop-chronicles-review-roundhouse-inua-ellams\">Barber S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/26/barber-shop-chronicles-review-roundhouse-inua-ellams\">hop Chronicles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/01/nine-night-review-dorfman-national-theatre-london\">Nine Night</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/09/seven-methods-of-killing-kylie-jenner-review-royal-court-theatre\">Seven Methods of Killing Kylie Jenner</a> all have their own powerful messages. I feel that they are timeless and relevant to this era, and our generation.</p> <h2><strong>Tobi Kyeremateng (producer and founder of Black Ticket Project)</strong></h2> <p>Black producers deserve better development opportunities to support other black makers to create authentic work. I see us moving and shape-shifting the sector massively. I\u2019ve seen black producers move into executive roles, applying for artistic director roles, leading participation departments and becoming associates. I set up Black Ticket Project because I was really tired of the laziness around bringing in new audiences, especially in the midst of conversations around \u201cdiversity\u201d \u2013 as if venues felt they had completed their due diligence by programming black artists, even if their audience remained really white. This was matched with a frustration of the way black working-class young people are treated by the sector as statistics and participants and not as the next generation of cultural creators. Who will pass on the legacy of theatre-going once our current, loyal audiences are gone? Black Ticket Project is not a revolutionary thing. It\u2019s really simple. Organisations with much more infrastructure and resource than me could\u2019ve done it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c552918c11e26904226f38717176085bd15648e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c552918c11e26904226f38717176085bd15648e9/0_504_3744_5112/732.jpg\" alt=\"Winsome Pinnock.\" width=\"732\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winsome Pinnock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bronwen Sharp</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Winsome Pinnock (writer)</strong></h2> <p>It can seem as though there is a lot of black theatre around, but when you take a closer look there is far less from black British authors. I have been following the work of a particular London theatre for a long time, but to my knowledge they haven\u2019t produced the work of a single black British writer in the last decade. I have seen some great plays by African Americans there but never a black British writer.</p> <p>People have started to write historical plays \u2013 of which there are very few by black British playwrights. There are so many untold histories so I would see this becoming a trend over the next decade. I hope that stories about the black British experience will be written by writers who have experienced it and not be appropriated. How are black British writers to gain experience and skill if they are not given the opportunity to tell their own stories? There have been a couple of incidents in the last decade where the black writing community has been hit by being excluded from telling their own stories. I would like to see the continued revival of black British classics by writers such as Una Marson, Barry Reckord, Edgar White, Mustapha Matura \u2026 All these writers have sadly passed away and won\u2019t answer back if a bright new director decides to do something surprising and wonderful with their plays.</p> <h2><strong>Justin Audibert (artistic director of the Unicorn theatre)</strong></h2> <p>The optimist in me would say that the last decade has seen black voices move from the margins to the mainstream of British theatre. We now have black writers and directors regularly working on stages in our national theatres, our international festivals and in regional theatres up and down the country. I have no doubt that the new swathe of artistic directors, my contemporaries such as Lynette Linton, Roy Alexander Weise and Matthew Xia, will continue to push the boundaries in ensuring that everyone is represented in the work that is made.</p> <p>It must be said \u2013 or shouted from the rooftops \u2013 that all of this progress runs the risk of being stymied or reversed because of the continuing backdrop of financial austerity. I worry that boards will appoint artistic directors who programme in more conventional and \u201crisk averse\u201d ways. We need funding to take risks. We need to take risks to keep evolving the artform. And we need to keep evolving the artform to keep challenging, exciting and growing our audiences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"108cbe0cc7706dc3e42e068364142f4e3bd67746\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/108cbe0cc7706dc3e42e068364142f4e3bd67746/0_0_4950_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seven Methods of Killing Kylie Jenner by Jasmine Lee-Jones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seven Methods of Killing Kylie Jenner by Jasmine Lee-Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jasmine Lee-Jones (writer)</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s been a very exciting, earth-shaking year and I feel very privileged to have been a part of it. A couple of weeks ago Jane Fallowfield, the literary manager at the Royal Court, alluded to a new wave of writers who seem to be critiquing the establishment and traditional structures, while drawing inspiration from and paying homage to the artists who have come before them. I love the idea that we are drawing on past, present and maybe even the future to make our art. Every black British theatrical voice I hear when I go to the theatre feels so deeply rooted in authenticity. I think the most beautiful thing to observe is that it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re explaining ourselves to people that don\u2019t understand or haven\u2019t attempted to make the imaginative leap to understand.</p> <p>Attention must be paid to expanding our definition of what black Britishness and \u2013 therefore black British theatre \u2013 can be. That means making space for LGBTQI+ and disabled voices in our digital and physical spaces. I saw Travis Alabanza\u2019s Burgerz recently last week and was spellbound by the excellence and execution and the necessity of that story being told now. I\u2019m so excited by the inclusion of a plethora of experiences and stories being told within the black British theatre landscape.</p> <p>Looking back in history too many of our predecessors have been ousted out of their rightful place and recognition because of the failure of traditional structures to keep a record of their achievements.

Now is the time to be creatively bold. Anyone can make a bold political statement or choice. Making genuinely bold creative choices is a far trickier prospect.</p> <p>I am arguably a \u201cposter boy\u201d for black British theatrical success. Make no mistake: I didn\u2019t \u201cluck out\u201d or \u201cwin the lottery\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s been hard earned and hard fought. One cannot argue with the success of the National Theatre\u2019s Amadeus \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t take into account the letters of complaint, online abuse, and downright vitriol directed towards me personally and the National as an organisation. The same can be said of me playing Iago at the RSC. Let\u2019s make no bones here, all of the nay-saying when it comes down to it is purely because I am a black man. The colour of my skin. No account is taken of ability, of experience, of taste, of artistry, of preference, and yet I played those parts to commercial and critical acclaim. Theatregoers voted with their feet and their pockets. The real issue is that this country, culture and society has not yet fully dealt with race and empire. For me it isn\u2019t about revisionism; it\u2019s about consistent, prickly, horrible, uncomfortable, robust conversations. To sum it all up: the day I am no longer referred to as \u201cblack British-Tanzanian-Zimbabwean actor\u201d will be the day that the change is complete.

There was general agreement in Nato that Moscow had cheated, but it was far from clear what advantage the US had gained by ripping up the treaty altogether. It tested some <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-russia/u-s-tests-ground-launched-ballistic-missile-after-inf-treaty-exit-idUSKBN1YG287\">medium-range missiles</a> but as yet there is nowhere to deploy them, in the absence of willing hosts in Europe or Asia.</p> <p>The death of the INF leaves the world with a single surviving arms control agreement, New Start, which imposes caps on the US- and Russian-deployed strategic arsenals at 1,550 warheads each. It is due to expire in February 2021, but can be extended for up to five years by signatures from US and Russian leaders. Trump has declared himself a supporter of arms control but his administration has so far blocked an extension of New Start, another Obama legacy.</p> <p>Officially, the administration wants a new treaty that includes China, but Beijing has refused to get drawn in. Its estimated arsenal is less than a 20th of the US or Russia\u2019s, and its strategic warheads are not deployed on missiles. Insisting on Chinese inclusion is equivalent to condemning New Start to oblivion. A clue to that intention is the fact that the US has yet to put forward a concrete proposal, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/01/us-arms-control-office-understaffed-trump\">staffing numbers have been cut</a> in the office responsible for negotiating arms control.</p> <p>The New Start treaty appears doomed by its provenance (the Obama administration) \u2013 and for that whimsical reason <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-03/news/inf-treaty-falls-new-start-teeters\">the last limits on world\u2019s two biggest nuclear arsenals</a> are due to disappear in a little over 13 months. An extensive regime of mutual inspections and exchanges of data will disappear with it, with the result that the US and Russia will lose a vital window into each other\u2019s nuclear capabilities and intentions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/inf-treaty-us-russia-arms-control-to-end\">Lapse of US-Russia arms treaty will heighten missile threat, says UN</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the absence of coherent policy, there are certain themes that run through Trump\u2019s actions on the world stage. The problem is they often conflict with one another. On the whole, Trump has sought to cut short the country\u2019s long-running military entanglements, and to bring US troops home. His decision to call back the bombers aimed for Iran in June reflected that. But his withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran and his subsequent attempt to strangle Iran economically has significantly raised the potential for conflict in the Gulf. While reducing the US presence in Syria by a few hundred, the administration deployed 1,800 troops to Saudi Arabia, supposedly to deter Iran.</p> <h2>Dictators</h2> <p>Another Trump theme is the seemingly instinctive preference for foreign dictators over democratically elected allies. The former offer him at least an illusory promise of cutting a big deal to would cement a legacy, and he clearly believes that personal flattery of Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and Xi Jinping is the path to such a deal. Allies he sees as freeloaders, living rent free under an expensive US security umbrella.</p> <p>Hence Trump\u2019s deeply sceptical view of Nato. He has refused to commit the US to come to the defence of its European allies in the event of a Russian attack, ignoring the obligation of collective defence that is at the core of the alliance\u2019s founding treaty. If Trump wins re-election, the alliance\u2019s future will be under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/02/nato-donald-trump-second-term\">a question mark</a>.</p> <p>The pendulum swings are likely to become more pronounced as Trump enters his fourth year in office and dedicates himself to a re-election campaign. Impeachment has clearly not restrained his instinct to mine foreign relations for electoral advantage. Rudy Giuliani is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/as-impeachment-tide-swirls-around-trump-giuliani-drops-anchor-in-ukraine/2019/12/06/8f454a7a-184e-11ea-bf81-ebe89f477d1e_story.html\">still flying to Ukraine</a> to dig for dirt on Trump\u2019s rivals. In the coming months, with the North Korean nuclear threat returning to centre stage, and Iran having less and less to lose in its standoff with the US, the stakes could be far higher.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The new decade is about to start under many shadows, but none is more ominous than North Korea\u2019s threat to return to nuclear and long-range missile tests after a two-year lull. Pyongyang\u2019s pendulum swing from enthusiastic summit diplomacy back to name-calling and threats comes as Donald Trump is increasingly focused on his re-election campaign. That may be a good thing, as the US president will be wary of provoking a crisis to spoil his narrative of peace and prosperity. Or it could be a very bad thing: Kim Jong-un could seek to exploit a moment of maximum leverage and miscalculate. The last time there was a standoff, Trump and Kim took to brandishing their nuclear buttons (the US president boasted his was bigger and more functional). According to a new account of events during the crisis in 2017, Trump stunned his aides by calling for the entire 25-million population of Seoul to be moved further away from the border with the North so they would not be held hostage to Pyongyang\u2019s fearsome artillery. He also ordered US military families to be evacuated from South Korea \u2013 despite being told that such a move would probably be seen by the North Koreans as the precursor for an attack. The order was quietly killed by the then defence secretary, James Mattis. But Mattis resigned a year ago, stripping the administration of an important restraining influence. It is less likely his successor, Mark Esper, would ignore such a direct order. With the departure of the supposed \u201cadults in the room\u201d Trump is less constrained in his conduct towards the world, dispensing with advice altogether and trusting his gut. The once-lumbering process by which national security decisions were debated and agreed in the past has been hollowed out. Decisions tend to come direct from the president\u2019s thumbs through Twitter \u2013 often as a surprise to his own top officials. Over the course of 2019, Trump\u2019s foreign policy has become ever more personalised and consequently both transactional and erratic, swerving wildly with the president\u2019s mood swings, foreign influence and second thoughts. In their second summit in Hanoi in February, Trump tried jolting Kim into disarmament with a surprise proposal. US and North Korean diplomats had been discussing a phased agreement in which each step towards Pyongyang\u2019s disarmament would be met by a proportional lifting of sanctions. At the summit, Trump presented the North Korean leader with an all-for-all deal \u2013 total disarmament. It was the sort of gambit that may have thrown competitors off balance in the real estate market, but not a paranoid dictator in possession of a nuclear arsenal. The talks collapsed and relations have been sliding downward ever since. The US national security staff are spending the holiday braced for the \u201cChristmas gift\u201d Pyongyang has threatened to send, with a long-range missile test thought the most likely seasonal surprise. Syria In Syria, the president\u2019s abrupt change of mind caused whiplash for soldiers on the ground. Following a 6 October phone conversation with Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, in which the Turkish president appears to have convinced him to let Ankara take the lead in the military campaign against Isis, Trump ordered all US troops out of the country, without consulting the Pentagon or US allies. Within a day, special forces were ordered to vacate their outposts on the Turkish-Syrian border, abandoning the Kurdish allies who had taken the brunt of the fight with Isis, at the cost of 11,000 deaths in their ranks. Two weeks later, however, Trump was trying to rein Turkey back, firing off one of the stranger presidential missives in history in which he implored Erdo\u011fan: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool.\u201d At the same time, US troops were ordered back into Syria, with the mission \u2013 in Trump\u2019s words \u2013 to \u201csecure the oil\u201d. Extracting the resources of another country would be a potential war crime, and Pentagon officials sought to interpret the president\u2019s diktat in a more benign manner, as part of a counter-terrorist campaign to prevent oil installations falling under Isis control, and as a mandate for US commanders to continue their collaboration with the Syrian Kurds. There are no guarantees on how long this new equilibrium will remain. Erdo\u011fan sees the Kurds as direct threat, and will use any leverage he has on Trump to get him to cut them loose. Afghanistan In Afghanistan, there were two U-turns. The US envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, spent nearly a year leading direct talks with the Taliban, much to the unease of the government in Kabul. But in early September, when an agreement looked imminent, Trump suddenly declared the negotiations \u201cdead\u201d, canceling what he had intended as a surprise Camp David meeting with the Taliban, in the wake of an attack in the Afghan capital. The decision took all concerned by surprise, as both sides had fought and talked at the same time at different phases of the 18-year war. But less than three months on, on the occasion of Trump\u2019s first visit to the country, he declared the talks back on. It was unclear what, if anything, had changed his views. In possibly the most dramatic about-face of all, Trump gave a green light to airstrikes against Iran following the downing of a US drone in June but changed his mind with 10 minutes to spare, when warplanes were already in the air, declaring he had been motivated by a desire to avoid casualties, though he had been briefed on the estimated death tolls before ordering the attacks in the first place. In this and other war-or-peace decisions, the underlying thought process is obscure or perhaps not there at all. The term \u201cforeign policy\u201d may no longer be a useful way of describing what is going on, suggesting as it does a sustained coordinated effort towards a national security goal. Business Some policy endures in the muscle memory of the state department and the Pentagon, but there are no guarantees it will ultimately determine what the US does. When established policy clashes with the interests of the president, his family and their business concerns, it usually loses. Such a conflict is, after all, what is at the core of the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump\u2019s 18 December impeachment. The formal goal of US foreign policy was to support the new government in Kyiv in its fight to push back Russian military encroachment, but Trump jammed his foot on the brake, turning US official support into leverage for extracting kompromat on his domestic political rivals. The White House has also intervened to try to stop punitive measures against Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey for reasons that were left obscure. The business empires of Trump\u2019s extended family have dealings with all those countries, as well as Israel and China. The president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, was supposed to be devising an Israel-Palestinian deal at the same time the Kushner family firm was borrowing money from Israeli financial institutions. Beijing has meanwhile been assiduous in issuing patents to Ivanka Trump, at a time it was negotiating a trade deal with Washington. Personal vanity has been as much a wild card as vested financial interests, and arguably more so. It appears to have been the driving force behind Trump\u2019s determination to destroy the legacy of his predecessors and replace it with his own, for its own sake. Vast amounts of administration and congressional effort were devoted to ripping up the Nafta free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, to replace it with the very similar USMCA deal that Trump claims as a personal triumph. Other agreements have been destroyed with no replacement. In the 19 months since the US abrogation of the multilateral nuclear deal with Iran, Barack Obama\u2019s signature foreign policy achievement, the campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Tehran has yielded no new negotiations with Tehran, let alone a successor agreement. Arms control In February Trump pulled the US out of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia that has kept missiles out of Europe since the cold war. There was general agreement in Nato that Moscow had cheated, but it was far from clear what advantage the US had gained by ripping up the treaty altogether. It tested some medium-range missiles but as yet there is nowhere to deploy them, in the absence of willing hosts in Europe or Asia. The death of the INF leaves the world with a single surviving arms control agreement, New Start, which imposes caps on the US- and Russian-deployed strategic arsenals at 1,550 warheads each. It is due to expire in February 2021, but can be extended for up to five years by signatures from US and Russian leaders. Trump has declared himself a supporter of arms control but his administration has so far blocked an extension of New Start, another Obama legacy. Officially, the administration wants a new treaty that includes China, but Beijing has refused to get drawn in. Its estimated arsenal is less than a 20th of the US or Russia\u2019s, and its strategic warheads are not deployed on missiles. Insisting on Chinese inclusion is equivalent to condemning New Start to oblivion. A clue to that intention is the fact that the US has yet to put forward a concrete proposal, and staffing numbers have been cut in the office responsible for negotiating arms control. The New Start treaty appears doomed by its provenance (the Obama administration) \u2013 and for that whimsical reason the last limits on world\u2019s two biggest nuclear arsenals are due to disappear in a little over 13 months. An extensive regime of mutual inspections and exchanges of data will disappear with it, with the result that the US and Russia will lose a vital window into each other\u2019s nuclear capabilities and intentions. In the absence of coherent policy, there are certain themes that run through Trump\u2019s actions on the world stage. The problem is they often conflict with one another. On the whole, Trump has sought to cut short the country\u2019s long-running military entanglements, and to bring US troops home. His decision to call back the bombers aimed for Iran in June reflected that. But his withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran and his subsequent attempt to strangle Iran economically has significantly raised the potential for conflict in the Gulf. While reducing the US presence in Syria by a few hundred, the administration deployed 1,800 troops to Saudi Arabia, supposedly to deter Iran. Dictators Another Trump theme is the seemingly instinctive preference for foreign dictators over democratically elected allies. The former offer him at least an illusory promise of cutting a big deal to would cement a legacy, and he clearly believes that personal flattery of Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and Xi Jinping is the path to such a deal. Allies he sees as freeloaders, living rent free under an expensive US security umbrella. Hence Trump\u2019s deeply sceptical view of Nato. He has refused to commit the US to come to the defence of its European allies in the event of a Russian attack, ignoring the obligation of collective defence that is at the core of the alliance\u2019s founding treaty. If Trump wins re-election, the alliance\u2019s future will be under a question mark. The pendulum swings are likely to become more pronounced as Trump enters his fourth year in office and dedicates himself to a re-election campaign. Impeachment has clearly not restrained his instinct to mine foreign relations for electoral advantage. Rudy Giuliani is still flying to Ukraine to dig for dirt on Trump\u2019s rivals. In the coming months, with the North Korean nuclear threat returning to centre stage, and Iran having less and less to lose in its standoff with the US, the stakes could be far higher.",

NHK ran a newsflash on its website and news app at 12.22 am, but corrected the error about 20 minutes later, according to the Nikkei daily business paper. The broadcaster apologised for the mistake, saying it had been intended for \u201ctraining purposes\u201d. The original report stated that the missile had landed in the sea about 2,000km east of Hokkaido. North Korea sent missiles over the island in 2017 to demonstrate its ability to strike US military targets on the Pacific island of Guam. Two launches in August and September that year triggered alerts urging million of residents in northern Japan to take cover in sturdy buildings or underground. Friday\u2019s erroneous online bulletin comes at a time of heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, as Pyongyang\u2019s end-of year deadline approaches for the US to make concessions to resurrect stalled denuclearisation talks. US special envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, dismissed the deadline but said Washington was ready to resume negotiations at any time during a visit to South Korea earlier this month. Speculation that the North is preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile rose after its foreign ministry recently warned it would send the US a \u201cChristmas gift\u201d depending on what concessions Washington was prepared to make. But there were no reports of missile of other tests by the regime on Christmas Day. NHK was forced to apologise in January 2018 after mistakenly sending out a J-alert warning that North Korea had fired a missile. The error drew a rebuke from the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga. \u201cJ-alert provides extremely important information that affects the safety and security of Japanese citizens. We want NHK to do their utmost to prevent a recurrence,\u201d Suga said.",

But we are also shrinking available habitat indirectly as a result of climate change.\u201d On Friday, Ley said the government was doing enough on climate change. \u201cClimate change is a huge issue and we are playing our part,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are meeting and beating our targets, it\u2019s very important that we do that. \u201cMy focus is on the things we can do on the ground, with practical action here in Australia that do make a difference.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ministers have ordered yet another review into why some flood-hit homes cannot get insurance and promised another \u00a31m to help those affected after around 100 homes were hit over Christmas. Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, said she was commissioning an inquiry into why some flooded communities were unable to get sufficient insurance, despite an agreement between insurers and the government in 2015 that was supposed to mean everyone would have access to affordable cover. Boris Johnson has been criticised for failing to visit any of the areas affected in the latest round of flooding. The prime minister spent Christmas in Downing Street with his partner, Carrie Symonds, and the pair are expected to fly to the exclusive private Caribbean island of Mustique to see in the new year. Areas of southern England and north Lincolnshire are still at risk of groundwater flooding, with 88 warnings still in place and 100 properties having flooded since last Thursday. Before that, 4,200 homes in South Yorkshire and surrounding counties were flooded during the election campaign in November. Ministers said on Thursday that a charity that helps flood victims in South Yorkshire would get another \u00a31m of funding, while other areas have been given \u00a3300,000. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said the flooding had been \u201cdevastating\u201d but he praised the role of charities and volunteers in helping families whose homes have been ruined. \u201cBut more support is still needed, which is why we\u2019re matching money raised by the South Yorkshire Flood Disaster Relief Appeal Fund pound-for-pound, to help vulnerable people facing hardship to recover and get back on their feet,\u201d he said. There was a major review of flood insurance in 2008 and the government spent years in talks with insurers before reaching the Flood Re agreement in 2015. But Villiers appeared to acknowledge there were problems with the system as she ordered another review. \u201cWe have listened to communities that have been affected by flooding and understand just how important it is to ensure that everyone is able to access sufficient insurance cover,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we will be reviewing insurance cover following the recent flooding to understand any lessons to be learned for the future.\u201d Earlier this month, Dan Jarvis, the mayor of Sheffield city region, said there were problems with Flood Re, the government-backed scheme that promised to provide insurance for domestic properties deemed at significant risk of flooding. \u201cI don\u2019t think this scheme has worked,\u201d he said, suggesting that central government had a \u201cmoral duty\u201d to help those unable to get insurance. The government said 20 million households now have buildings insurance that covers flood risk and the introduction of Flood Re has seen four out of five households with a previous flood claim getting price reductions of more than 50% for their insurance. However, the recent flooding has seen reports of people not having sufficient insurance cover, which has triggered the latest review. As well as reviewing insurance, Johnson has also faced calls to overhaul the system for deciding where flood-defence funding is spent and launch an emergency response unit to prevent a repeat of the catastrophic damage caused by the November floods. The Environment Agency warned on Thursday that communities needed to remain vigilant. Clare Dinnis, a flood duty manager at the agency, said: \u201cWhile the weather outlook is improving, groundwater levels continue to rise after recent rainfall meaning that there is a continued risk of groundwater flooding in parts of southern England over the next few days. \u201cWe continue to monitor rainfall and river levels closely and to operate our flood defences, reducing the risk of flooding to thousands of homes and businesses and helping to keep people safe.

Health Harms, a Public Health England (PHE) scheme, has previously sought to harness new year resolutions in January to encourage the 6 million tobacco smokers in the country to quit through vaping and visualising how cancer-causing chemicals and tar are inhaled. Rates of smoking are declining, also thanks to the introduction of plain packaging and tax increases, but the government has been urged not to be \u201ccomplacent\u201d after it emerged the overall anti-smoking budget had been reduced to \u00a33.8m from \u00a35m. The move came after PHE\u2019s marketing budget was cut by a fifth earlier this year, from about \u00a335m to \u00a328m. \u201cSlashing budgets for these campaigns is a foolhardy decision which not only lets down smokers who are looking to quit but will also result in further pressure on the NHS due to smoking-related illnesses,\u201d warned British Lung Foundation\u2019s (BLF) senior policy officer Rachael Hodges. \u201cAlthough smoking rates are declining, we must not be complacent. Mass media campaigns are vital in encouraging smokers to quit and stay smoke free.\u201d The charity added the drop in funding \u201cundermines the government\u2019s aim to make England smoke free by 2030\u201d since \u201cmass media campaigns are essential in helping people quit\u201d. It said PHE\u2019s 28-day \u201cStoptober\u201d campaign had resulted in fewer successful quit attempts after less advertising coverage on TV and radio. The rate of successful attempts to quit fell from 8% of all smokers in 2015 to 6% in 2016 after spending on media messaging was reduced from \u00a33.1m to \u00a3390,000, according to the charity. Overall, the Stoptober campaign is believed to have led to almost 2 million attempts to quit since 2012 and the BLF said there was evidence showing stop smoking campaigns were effective in helping people kick the habit. Around 78,000 people in the UK die as a result of smoking each year, making it one of the country\u2019s biggest causes of death and illness. Many more live with debilitating smoking-related illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and pneumonia. The BLF urged the Treasury to \u201creinstate comprehensive funding for both Stoptober and the January Health Harms campaign\u201d, saying smoking \u201ccosts society more than \u00a311bn per year\u201d of which \u201c\u00a32.5bn falls directly on the NHS\u201d. In the September spending review the chancellor, Sajid Javid, announced an unspecified \u201creal terms increase to the public health grant budget\u201d. It followed sustained cuts which caused spending on public health services by councils to fall 8% from 2013/14 to 2017/18, leading to \u201cdramatic\u201d changes in the availability of stop smoking services, according to Action on Smoking and Public Health. \u201cWithin the available money, campaigns have been reprioritised, with the agreement of ministers \u2013 with an emphasis on the best start to life, continuing to tackle tobacco harm, raising awareness of the symptoms of cancer, tackling antimicrobial resistance and promoting good mental health,\u201d PHE\u2019s chief executive, Duncan Selbie, said.

Many unusual birds and butterflies ended up on UK soil over the past 12 months, whisked in by high winds or attracted by unseasonably hot spells, and there was good news for native grey seals, dragonflies and wildflowers, the survey from the National Trust reveals.

There were record numbers of bee orchids, dark-red helleborine and autumn lady\u2019s tresses at some sites. However, the picture was grim for other species. The fires on Marsden Moor in West Yorkshire damaged 700 acres of precious habitat for mountain hares and ground-nesting birds such as curlew and twite, undoing years of peat restoration work. It was another challenging year for natterjack toads, who rely on pools of water in their dune habitat to thrive. Because many of these dried out in May and June, spawn and tadpoles were lost. Heavy periods of rainfall affected many species this year, according to the audit.

      "bodyText": "Hospitals will be required from April to provide free car parking for disabled blue badge holders, parents of sick children staying overnight and staff working night shifts in England under plans promised in the Tory manifesto. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, announced that the new regime would be rolled out within months, making sure all hospitals follow the same rules to provide free parking for those in the most need. The rules currently vary from hospital to hospital, but will now be standardised. The Department for Health and Social Care gave no details of how much it would cost to scrap parking charges for these groups, but a government source said there would be extra funding from central government to help offset any shortfall in hospital budgets. During the election campaign, the Tories said around \u00a378m would be available to help hospitals move to new parking regimes. Hancock said the issue of hospital parking charges for the vulnerable had been \u201cone of the concerns mentioned regularly on the doorsteps\u201d saying that voters were concerned \u201cthat vulnerable people, and staff working nights, have to pay for hospital car parking\u201d. He said: \u201cSo we are today delivering on our manifesto commitment and setting out our new approach to NHS hospital parking charges. \u201cCurrently, the situation varies from hospital to hospital. Instead, from April, across the country those with the greatest need - such as disabled people, parents staying overnight with sick children in hospital, and NHS staff working nightshifts - will no longer have to pay for parking.\u201d During the election, Labour went even further and promised to scrap hospital parking charges altogether. The Tory promise, while not going as far, still marks a shift from the current regime under which NHS Trusts are responsible for setting any car park charges and reinvesting any profits into frontline care. Hancock also said the policy was about delivering a promise to people who put their trust in the Tories at the election, with \u201cmany voting Conservative for the first time\u201d. In a separate policy aimed at showing the Tories are aiming to hold on to their new voters, the government unveiled a promise to improve open data information about bus services across England. Baroness Vere, a transport minister, promised a new \u201cgolden age\u201d for buses, even though services have been slashed in recent years. She said this will mean information on routes, timetables, location and fares will be easier to access, and allow passengers to plan their journeys down to the minute. Under the plans, operators will have to provide information on routes and timetables from early 2020, followed by location and fares data by 2021. This will allow web developers will be able to add the information into existing apps or develop new products to help people get around. Vere said the government recognised that \u201cbuses are the most frequently used form of public transport\u201d across the country. However, critics of the government point out that bus services have been severely reduced under nine years of the Conservatives amid much lower funding for local councils. The Campaign for Better Transport found in October that well over 3,000 bus routes have been cut back or withdrawn in England since 2010, with overall funding \u00a3400m a year lower over that period.",
