When Trump heard about the briefing, he railed at the acting DNI, Joseph Maguire, in the Oval Office, over what the president saw as disloyalty, the Washington Post reported. Until then, Maguire had been a leading candidate to become permanent DNI and is understood to have told colleagues he expected to stay on in the position. But in the wake of the briefing and Oval Office confrontation, Trump announced the appointment of a hardline loyalist, the US ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, in an acting capacity, which does not require Senate confirmation. According to the New York Times, the briefing last Thursday to the House intelligence committee was delivered by an aide to Maguire, Shelby Pierson, described as having \u201ca reputation for delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms\u201d. The Washington Post reported that Trump had been under the false impression that the briefing had been provided exclusively to the House intelligence committee chair, Adam Schiff, who had acted as chief prosecutor in the president\u2019s impeachment trial. Trump is said to have become convinced that the briefing would be used against him in the election. Unlike Maguire, a retired vice-admiral who ran the National Counterterrorism Center, Grenell has no intelligence experience (he was a spokesman for the US mission at the UN before being named ambassador) and is an outspoken partisan, particularly on social media. \u201cSo the Grenell appointment is exactly what it looks like \u2013 a bid to politicize intelligence and hide information from Congress in an election year where Russia is again helping Trump,\u201d said Matthew Miller, a former justice department spokesman, in a tweet. According to the New York Times account, last week\u2019s briefing was contentious, with Trump\u2019s allies on the intelligence committee challenging the conclusions, arguing that the administration had been tough on Russia. As Grenell was confirmed in his ambassadorial job, the president has the authority to install him as acting DNI under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, but under the same act, he can only serve until 11 March, unless the president formally nominates a candidate for the permanent position. If a nomination is being reviewed by the Senate, the acting director could stay in the post for a few more months during the confirmation process. Grenell said on Twitter that \u201cthe president will announce the nominee (not me) sometime soon\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Roger Stone, a longtime ally of Donald Trump and a self-described political dirty trickster, was sentenced on Thursday to more than three years in prison for his attempts to sabotage a congressional investigation that posed a political threat to the president. In handing down the sentence, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the US district court for the District of Columbia lambasted Stone, 67, calling his attempts to thwart a congressional inquiry of \u201cgreat national significance\u201d a \u201cthreat to our most fundamental institutions, to the very foundation of our democracy\u201d. But she sentenced Stone to 40 months in prison, far less than the punishment prosecutors originally sought. Stone was convicted in November on seven felony charges, including lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia in the 2016 presidential election. Stone had denied wrongdoing. Jackson argued Stone\u2019s disregard for the truth should worry all those who care about American democracy and accused him of covering up for Trump. \u201cThe dismay and disgust at the defendant\u2019s belligerence should transcend party,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe truth still exists,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth still matters.\u201d After the sentencing, a spokeswoman for Stone appealed directly to Trump for a pardon. \u201cIt falls on President Trump to use the power of a pardon as the final means of checks and balances to right this horrible wrong,\u201d Kristin Davis said in a statement. Trump, who issued 11 high-profile pardons earlier this week, said he was holding off for now. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything in terms of the great powers bestowed upon a president of the United States,\u201d Trump said during an appearance in Las Vegas. \u201cI want the process to play out. I think that\u2019s the best thing to do because I would love to see Roger exonerated.\u201d Adam Schiff, a high-profile California Democrat who chairs the House intelligence committee, said to pardon Stone when his crimes were committed to protect Trump would be a \u201cbreathtaking act of corruption\u201d. Stone wore a bemused look for much of the nearly three-hour hearing on Thursday, standing with his defense team to receive his sentence. A small group of male supporters with mostly trendy haircuts, designer bags and Make America Great Again embellishments watched the proceedings from an overflow room next to where Stone was being sentenced. At one point, security removed one of the men after he began protesting against Jackson\u2019s remarks. \u201cRidiculous. This is a sham,\u201d he cried as he was escorted out of the room. Outside the courtroom, rightwing activists chanted \u201cPardon Roger Stone\u201d while opponents shouted:\u201cLock him up.\u201d The sentencing went ahead despite an 11th-hour request by Stone\u2019s defense team for a new trial. Jackson has not yet ruled definitively on that motion, but she determined that postponing the sentencing would not be \u201ca prudent thing to do given all the circumstances\u201d. Stone will not have to report to prison until the court rules on that motion, which is based on a claim of juror bias. Stone, a flamboyant Republican operative who began his political career as a junior staffer on Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election campaign in 1972, had become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for supporters of the president, who said he was being punished for defending his longtime friend. Jackson forcefully rejected such claims, stating that Stone was not being prosecuted \u201cfor standing up for the president\u201d but for \u201ccovering up for the president\u201d. Stone\u2019s sentencing hearing followed an extraordinary series of events in which justice department officials overruled a sentencing recommendation by the prosecutors of between seven and nine years in federal prison, a punishment Trump assailed on Twitter as \u201chorrible and very unfair\u201d. After the president condemned the prosecutors directly and decried a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d, the attorney general, William Barr, intervened and sought a more lenient punishment. His intervention prompted the entire prosecution team to resign in protest, including one member who left the justice department altogether. Barr \u2013 a close ally of the president \u2013 also publicly reproached Trump, saying the president\u2019s online commentary about politically sensitive investigations made it \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to do his job. Trump eventually said on Twitter that he had not asked the attorney general to \u201cdo anything in a criminal case\u201d, but argued that, as president, he had \u201cthe legal right to do so\u201d and had \u201cso far chosen not to!\u201d Despite Barr\u2019s rebuke, Trump continued to weigh in on the case on Twitter. On Tuesday, he quoted the Fox News analyst Andrew Napolitano who claimed that the jury harbored biases against the president and that \u201calmost any judge in the country\u201d would throw out the conviction. \u201cEverything having to do with this fraudulent investigation is badly tainted and, in my opinion, should be thrown out,\u201d Trump wrote in another tweet. On Thursday, Jackson asked the new prosecution team to explain its position, noting that the justice department had not actually withdrawn its initial sentencing recommendation of seven to nine years in prison. \u201cI fear that you know less about the case than just about everybody else in the courtroom,\u201d Jackson told John Crabb, the prosecutor newly assigned to the case. Crabb apologized for the \u201cconfusion\u201d surrounding the sentencing recommendation and defended the initial trial team, who he said had received approval to submit the initial sentencing memo. \u201cThis prosecution was, and this prosecution is, righteous,\u201d Crabb said. Asked by Jackson whether he had written the court filing that reversed the original sentencing recommendation, Crabb declined to say. Jackson told the court that she believed the original recommendation was well-researched but unnecessarily punitive, a conclusion she said she reached notwithstanding the \u201cunprecedented actions of the Department of Justice in the past week\u201d. Stone\u2019s attorney, Seth Ginsberg, asked Jackson to consider the man and not the \u201clarger-than-life\u201d public persona his client had cultivated over the course of decades. Stone, Ginsberg argued, is a faithful family man with no criminal record whose political activism includes support for football players who suffered concussions and animal rights groups. \u201cMr Stone is, in fact, not simply that public persona, but a human being,\u201d Ginsberg said. Since Trump was acquitted by the Senate of charges that he abused power and obstructed Congress, he has embarked on a campaign of retribution against his perceived political enemies while intervening to protect allies who have been loyal. His defense of Stone came just days after the conclusion of the Senate impeachment trial. Trump has not ruled out pardoning his longtime friend. On Thursday he appeared to raise that possibility again. The president tweeted out a clip of the Fox News host Tucker Carlson saying Stone should be pardoned and also pinned it to the top of his feed. Stone\u2019s convictions stem from the former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. During the course of the week-long trial, the jury heard from Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, that Stone was the campaign\u2019s \u201caccess point\u201d to WikiLeaks, which published a trove of stolen Democratic emails in the final weeks of the last presidential campaign.

The Fine Gael leader and his administration will continue to work in their current roles until successors are appointed but will avoid major policy decisions, financial allocations and public appointments \u201cunless absolutely necessary\u201d, and only then after consultation with other parties. Varadkar, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, the Fianna F\u00e1il leader, Miche\u00e1l Martin, and the Green party leader, Eamon Ryan, were nominated for taoiseach by their parties but all, as expected, fell far short of an 80-seat majority in the 160-seat chamber.

Two years later, in September 2018, she suffered a freak head injury that caused mild brain trauma and meant she could not cope with bright light or noise for more than nine months. She was on holiday with her boyfriend, now husband, and threw back her head and laughed when he told her a joke. She hit her head against a brick wall and the damage became evident as the days, weeks and months passed.

CFR Cluj 1-1 Sevilla Club Brugge 1-1 Man Utd Copenhagen 1-1 Celtic Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 Red Bull Salzburg Getafe 2-0 Ajax Ludogorets 0-2 Inter Shakhtar 2-1 Benfica Sporting 3-1 Istanbul Basaksehir Olympiakos 0-1 Arsenal Rangers 3-2 Braga Wolves 4-0 Espanyol Apoel 0-3 Basel AZ 1-1 LASK Linz Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 Porto Roma 1-0 Gent Wolfsburg 2-1 Malmo That\u2019s a very good effort from Arsenal, who looked happy to take a 0-0 but late on realised they could have better so took it. Also Bukayo Saka is a star. I\u2019m really not quite sure how Rangers have managed this, because they were absolutely played off the park for an oor. But here we go! It\u2019s over! Four minutes of injury time at Ibrox, five in Athens. Arsenal are killing time by putting Olympiakos under more pressure. This has been a very acceptable away effort from them. Braga are trying to find something, and the reality is that they\u2019ll still back themselves to do enough at home. But what a comeback from Rangers, who\u2019ve dredged up a comeback from naewhere. I missed this, but I think it was given for handball. Back in Athens, Lacazette almost scored again, but Sa lept right to push his shot away. It\u2019s a hat-trick! Jota runs towards the box and no one closes him down, so he makes an angle for a shot then drives low into the corner! Espanyol said they\u2019d not come to sight-see, which sounded like a stroke of luck. But perhaps they\u2019d have been better off spending the night in Kwik Save after all. Oh my days! Rangers get a free-kick, 25 yards out, and Hagi curls into the top of the wall ... to see the ball loop off a head and over the keeper! Outrageous! Aubameyang chases a long, er, diag, then slips infield for Saka, who orders Lacazette into the middle feeds a perfect cross for him to tap home. Saka is so good; how many 18-year-olds can play left-wing and left-back? How many 28-year-olds can? Olympiakos-Arsenal is the only goalless game. There\u2019ve not been many chances either. Rangers well fancy this now. Braga have gone! A free-kick swerves in and though Hrdecky keeps out the first header, Ze Luis is there to bundle in the loose ball. Absolutely well! Aribo somehow weaves and fights, fights and weaves past three challenges on his way into the box and finds the composure to pass hime the equaliser! What a turnaround, and there\u2019s plenty of time for Rangers to find a winner! Arsenal send on Pepe for Willock. Another lovely goal. A long switch finds Doherty, who glides inside and slides a fine reverse ball into the box that Jota pounces upon, lashing a riser high into the net at the near post. That was a difficult finish made to look pips. Georghe Hag is in the crowd, I\u2019m delighted to report. Where there\u2019s Hagi there\u2019s hope! Davis spreads play out right and Hagi ducks inside then drills a low shot in off the base of the near post. Ibrox is rocking now! A punt downfield, a flick, and a low drive from 20 yards. Apoel are done. A header flicks off the defender, and Wolfsburg have turned it around. It\u2019s just occurred to me that we could get another Man United v Wolves tie. That must not happen. Ok, I missed what actually happened here. Havertz missed the penalty, play went down the other end, then VAR called it back because the keeper moved too early and Havertz scored second time. How did we cope for 130 years pre-VAR? I don\u2019t think anyone will fancy Leverkusen in the next round. Ruiz collects a deft flick and motors across the face of the box and the face of the nearest defender before suddenly whipping into a shot which races past McGregor and into the bottom corner. This tie is ten to over. Arsenal make a change in Athens, Ceballos \u2013 who was good against Newcastle \u2013 replacing Martinelli. Back at Ibrox, Rangers have been hanging on, but oh dear: Morelos has missed another. Hagi goes down the right, crosses, and from three yards Morelos turns against the keeper. He is having one. Traore goes down the right and crosses, the ball headed out ... but only as far as Neves, who controls on his chest, under pressure, then unleashes a swerving, screaming volley that fizzes, hisses and spits into the roof of the net. He does not score dodgy ones! This is nice finish, taken first-time ad planted inside the near post. Brekalo, who hit the bar with a fine shot in the first half, drags the ball outside the defender and with his left foot, blazes a brilliant shot that screeches across the keeper and right inside the top corner. A stray arm blocks a header and Thelin rolls home the spot-kick; Malmo haven\u2019t played in months, the Swedish season finishing before winter, but they\u2019re set here. Lacazette dwells on the ball in the box, allowing Ba to motor over and tackle. That was extremely sluggish. But only a heavy touch by Paulinho, running onto a loose backpass from Kamara, saves Rangers from falling further behind. This is a big half for Rangers. The league has near enough gone, and if they don\u2019t improve, the Europa will be gone too. It\u2019s caning it down in Athens, as it was in Bruges. Is this yet another metaphor for Brexit? Right then, eyes down. We go again. Arsenal have done well enough against Olympiakos, but in Glasgow, Braga are outclassing Rangers. See you in 10 or so. Olympiakos 0-0 Arsenal Rangers 0-1 Braga Wolves 1-0 Espanyol Apoel 0-1 Basel AZ 0-1 LASK Linz Bayer Leverkusen 1-0 Porto Roma 1-0 Gent Wolfsburg 0-0 Malmo Wolfsburg\u2019s Brekalo has just rammed a shot against the bar while Espanyol\u2019s Iturraspe has just pushed his brow into Jota\u2019s phizog. He does well to avoid a red card for that, not because it was so terrible but because red cards are often given for precisely that. In Athens, Arsenal are huffing but pushing. I daresay they\u2019ll be happy with 0-0. Meanwhile, behind their goal, the home end is literally bouncing. Braga look a really useful outfit. Rangers need to score at least once and probably twice here, because the away game is going to be a brute. so of course Morelos ploughs through the back of someone, gets himself booked, misses the second leg and has a little tantrum. He\u2019s a joker. Steven Davis has just timed a slide-tackle to perfection, robbing a Braga attacker inside his own box. A split-second later, and that was a penalty. Bukayo Saka is a player, and he lifts a tasty-looking cross into the box. But Willock, looking for a header, can only bundle wide. \u201cThe team playing Basel look like they\u2019ll have a tough away leg,\u201d tweets Gary Naylor. \u201cStill, at least they\u2019ll have their white away kit.\u201d At Ibrox Stadium, Morelos has missed another chance, this time coming in on the left. It was a trickier one than its predecessor, but at least Rangers are creating. A near post header, a sweep at the far post, and there you go. \u201cHave you lost your bearings, mate?\u201d asks David Hunter. \u201cHardly a humblebrag about that Beyonce and Jay-Z concert. On the other hand, can\u2019t fault your taste!\u201d Heh, definitely not. I just saw the Olimpico and thought about the football I\u2019d seen there \u2013 the 07-08 quarter and 08-09 final \u2013 then remembered the last time I was there. And get a load of this: we turned up to discover that no one took cards, so not only could we get no booze, we couldn\u2019t even get water and it was 4,623 degrees. I\u2019m not sure what Mikel Arteta\u2019s plan is, exactly. As far as I can see, his best front three, by far, is Pepe, Aubameyang, Martinelli. But he never picks it, though he must know he\u2019s got until the end of the season to find bed in a team, and that Lacazette is never good enough to get his team to where he wants it to be. Meanwhile, in Athens, Xhaka has just had a free-kick deflected that almost foxed the keeper. Naturally, he gesticulates like that was part of the plan, and fortune conspired to deny him what was rightfully his. This is little more than a swipe, but a defender\u2019s leg, a deflection, and there\u2019s the ball looping over the keeper. Back at Ibrox, Morelos zones into the box from the right, and should score! But he doesn\u2019t really think about what he\u2019s doing driving directly into the keeper\u2019s legs. \u201cWolves will be looking forward to the return leg in Spain,\u201d says Simon McMahon, \u201cespecially if they can take a healthy lead with them. Y Viva Espanyol!\u201d I think that might be cheating, and have ordered a steward\u2019s inquiry. Arsenal just enjoyed a couple of decent situations, Lacazette\u2019s cushioned touch almost playing Martinelli in, and then when he retrieved the ball, Lacazette turned a shot just wide. And from Club Brugge 1-1 Manchester United. Here\u2019s our report from Copenhagen 1-1 Celtic. \u201cAny idea who the apparently home supporting fans are behind the goal Arsenal are defending?\u201d asks Stephen Wales. Looks unconventional to have them prowling behind it!\u201d I\u2019m not sure \u2013 I\u2019m watching a few games here, so hadn\u2019t noticed, but there do appear to be a few black-coats mooching about. A ball over the top and a finish lifted over the keeper. Wolves won a free-kick down the right, changed the angle slightly, and when the cross was flicked on, Jota turned in adroitly from close range. I\u2019ve been to the Stadio Olimpico to see Ronaldo\u2019s header and Barcelona\u2019s brilliance, but the last time I was there I saw this: The new signing marks his first start with his first goal! Dzeko put him in, he opened his body, and punched a composed finish into the far corner. Whut a hut thus us! Rangers are sloppy in possession and the Braga captain takes aim from 25 yards, lashing high past McGregor, who gets a touch but can\u2019t stop the ball fizzing by. Rangers can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned. The turnaround between game slots was so quick we\u2019ve not had time to talk about line-ups. But it\u2019s fair to say Arsenal are going for this: Willock is in for Ozil \u2013 he should be as a matter of course, now that you don\u2019t ask me \u2013 and Martinelli is in for Pepe \u2013 he should be in for Lacazette as a matter of course, now that you don\u2019t ask me. But otherwise, Arsenal are at full-strength, more or less. But as I type that, Kent is just shy of sliding in Morelos\u2019 cross while, in Athens, Lacazette is just shy of Aubameyang\u2019s cross. Have Rangers gone? They\u2019ve been in rotten form recently, and Braga have already missed two chances at Ibrox. The Europa is a proper standard this term, and Arsenal nearly fell behind just there, Valbuena wedging a glorious pass to the back post, where Masouras climbed well only to head wide. \u201cI can\u2019t take Ludogorets seriously,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cbecause when I hear the name I have to finish singing \u2018My way\u2019. Surely that\u2019s one of their more endearing attributes. I feel similarly about Aarhus. Olympiakos v Arsenal Rangers v Braga Wolves v Espanyol Apoel v Basel AZ v LASK Linz Bayer Leverjusen v Porto Roma v Gent Wolfsburg v Malmo Celtic will be disappointed with a draw they\u2019d probably have taken at kick-off. They played really well in the first half, missing a fair few chances, then conceded an avoidable and slightly unfortunate penalty. Still, they\u2019ll have expected that, to progress, a home win would be required and they\u2019ll back themselves to get one. CFR Cluj 1-1 Sevilla Club Brugge 1-1 Man Utd Copenhagen 1-1 Celtic Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 Red Bull Salzburg Getafe 2-0 Ajax Ludogorets 0-2 Inter Shakhtar 2-1 Benfica Sporting 3-1 Istanbul Basaksehir \u201cWe\u2019d\u2019ve took that\u201d, is what Ryan Giggs is presumably thinking. United were dreadful in the opening half-hour but Anthony Martial capitalised on a gift to finish brilliantly. They rested Fred, Fernandes and Wan-Bissaka too, while Brugge\u2019s Dennis looked a serious talent. Ajax are in huge trouble now. Getafe break, Kenedy tries a shot, and it flicks off Serginho \u2013 enough to take it past Bruno Varela, in for the suspended Onana. In Bruges, United have another free-kick, this one slightly further out \u2013 a better distance for Fernandes. But Mata hits it into the wall, though I\u2019m not sure his little legs can kick the ball very much further than that. Another classic Lukaku finish. They\u2019re playing injury-time at the moment, and Lingard has just passed the ball into the keeper\u2019s arms. It\u2019s lucky Manchester United didn\u2019t bother having Fernandes\u2019 passing the ball forward, whipping in corners and generally running about from the start of the season, or even from the start of January. Because really, who needs all that nonsense? A shot following a corner finds De Jong inside the box and the keeper comes out, expecting a shot, but he cleverly squirts a square pass across the face and the tap-in is tapped in. Fernandes digs it into the top of the wall. In Bruges, United look a different team now Fernandes is on and are pushing for the win. They have a free-kick, just outside the D, just left of dead centre. Another livener! Hwang, incidentally, is a player. The kick goes to his right, he dives low and full-length, and tips it against the post and away! Bruno Fernandes is on in Bruges and has just floated a lovely ball over the top for Mata. Mata managed to miss the chance, but the flag was up. That\u2019s the first of its kind in this competition! Christie is booked \u2013 that\u2019s harsh \u2013 and will miss the second leg. The ref comes over to check for a handball, a header hitting an arm that was up in a challenge. I don\u2019t think we can complain whatever the decision... A livener in Lisbon! WHAT A MISS! Brugge have just cut Manchester United apart, the extremely impressive Dennis \u2013 apparently wanted by Dortmund to replace Sancho \u2013 pulling Maguire out wide and duly bousting past him. His cross was a good one too, which someone stepped over for Kossounou ... only for him to place wide. In Copenhagen, Johnsson has just made a fine save from Edouard, who slid in to meet Hayes\u2019 cross from the left. Still 1-1 there. Fine work from Junior Moraes down the left allowed him to cut back, and Kovalenko met it on the move, thunking a fine finish inside the near post. In Getaf\u00e9, the home side still lead Ajax 1-0. And things are only going to get worse for the visitors, with Ziyech definitely leaving and Van de Beek probably doing likewse. Phew! Back in Bruges, United have made another change, Fred replacing Pereira. After a dodgy first half, Inter are playing much better now. Ludogorets had their chances in the first half, and in ruining them, probably ruined the tie for themselves. There\u2019s his first goal for Inter, driven home low from outside the box after Lukaku, who came on at half-time, found him. Well played sir. There was every opportunity for him to bottle that in the confusion, but his absolutely shmiced it high into the net. In Bruges, Ighalo has replaced Martial. Lovely stuff. That goal is now being VARed... Lovely play from Taraabt \u2013 he\u2019s still got those feet and that change of pace \u2013 combining with Tavares, who proceeded into the box and then took advantage of a ricochet to tap in the equaliser. After some hot VAR action, Deac slots home from the spot. Oh dear oh dear! McGregor breaks on halfway, skates around the first challenge, and Celtic have a three on one! But he hands onto the ball for too long, forcing Edouard, who\u2019s free to his left, to run inside to stay onside, and from there all he can do is blaze over. This is a lovely goal, caressed home from just outside the box, curling off the inside of the foot, kissing the post on its way in. Celtic have been sloppy so far this half and under pressure for almost all of it. N\u2019Doye, sent clear inside the box, drives home in off the near post. On the plus side, Chris Sutton is displeased. Twelve goals and twelve assists for Kostic, who slips into something more comfortable inside the near post. Another tie over. Vietto calmly lifts a finish over the keeper, and IBS, as BT have kindly abbreviated them, are very close to done. It\u2019s a hat-trick! (If you\u2019re not German; Germans require the goals to come in the same half). But a simple header from a cross did the trick, and this tie is done. It\u2019s almost as if losing your best players is a killer. Frankfurt are stroking it around nicely; they seem to have recovered from the loss of Haller. Gosh, United are actually doing something. Mata picks up a gift and feeds Martial, who should score homing towards goal from the left. But, killer that he is, he opts to give Mata a tap-in instead of finding the far corner himself, and the defender intercepts. Brugge then go down the other end and the excellent Dennis leaves Shaw, forcing a decent save out of Romero at his near post. In Copenhagen, the team are only just coming out. Meanwhile, back in Bruges, Lingard has just stretched a decent cross from Dalot wide. Poor old Balanta of Brugge is having one. He got booked for very little just before half-time, and now he\u2019s gone off, groggy. Evening all. We\u2019re underway again in Bruges... The second half, and the second set of matches from the evening will be looked after by Daniel Harris. Hopefully, Ludogorets v Inter will take off. Celtic have been rather good in Copenhagen. Hope springs eternal. CFC Cluj 0-0 Sevilla Club Brugge 1-1 Manchester United Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 Salzburg FC Copenhagen 1-1 Celtic Getafe 1-0 Ajax Ludogorets 0-0 Inter Shakhtar 0-0 Benfica Sporting 2-0 Basaksehi The Cluj v Sevilla game is the last to finish the first half, as there was a delay in it starting due to a communication breakdown. It\u2019s been a poor affair between the teams. The weather in Bruges is brutal, a storm lashing down as Manchester United leave the field at 1-1 with the Belgians. Goal! Sporting Lisbon 2-0 Basaksehir (Sporar, 44) Vietto laid that one on a plate for the Slovakian, whose finish was well placed. Goal! Eintracht 2-0 Salzburg (Kamada, 43) Lovely skill from the Japanese player, coming half the length of the field, cutting past a defender and chipping the Salzburg keeper. It\u2019s tight for an offside. But VAR has been called and that\u2019s a goal. Manchester United seem to have improved in Bruges. Brandon Williams gets excited and misses a good chance. A reminder that an Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r United team have never won game in which they have fallen behind. Which goes completely against the team he played for. Getafe 1-0 Ajax (Deyverson, 37) Deyverson slots in from close range, and runs away to celebrate. Suddenly, he falls to the floor, and clutches his side. What caused it? It seems he has been hit by a fag lighter lobbed by the Ajax fans. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez has been booked for Inter at Ludogorets, and that means he will miss the second leg. He is a player with an \u2018edge\u2019 to his play. FC Brugge 1-1 Manchester United (Martial, 36) The Frenchman sped through, gave Mignolet the eyebrows and scored calmly. Bryan Oviedo playing for Copenhagen v Celtic, and he\u2019s gone close against Celtic. Everton fans used to sing his name, with the addition of \u2018baby\u2019 to the tune of the Human League\u2019s Don\u2019t You Want Me, Baby. Getafe having the better of things against Ajax, who have been pinned back in Madrid. Eintracht Frankfurt currently lead Salzburg, and look good for a win against the Red Bull outfit. Manchester United\u2019s malaise continues; their inability to play against \u2018lesser\u2019 opposition has come to the fore once more. VAR strikes once more, and it\u2019s Sporting denied their second against Basaksehir. Jovane Cabral slapped in a rebound off but had been offside when the original shot was struck. Inter go close after a bit of wing play from Victor Moses, and Cristiano Biraghi\u2019s shot is well saved by the Ludogorets goalkeeper. Hold your horses: VAR rules out that Shakhtar goal for offside. That\u2019s the first ever disallowed goal for VAR in the Europa League. That\u2019s back to 0-0 between them. Goal! Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0 Benfica (Marlos, 21) Shakhtar broke with real pace, and Marlos had chance to score from close range from a rebound. By the way, United wanted VAR to rule that it was a corner for that goal, but nothing doing. They were caught the wrong end of the pitch. And Celtic lead Copenhagen 1-0 too. McGregor plays in Eduoard, and this time the striker does not miss. That\u2019s a vital goal. Goal for FC Brugge! 1-0 v Manchester United and it\u2019s been coming. Long ball over the top, and Romero comes out on safari and Emmanuel Dennis lobs the Manchester United keeper. Dreadful from United. Some good noise in Frankfurt but not much of a game...but suddenly they take the lead as the Japanese striker Daichi Kamada makes his escape and slots home. That\u2019s Red Bull Salzburg 1-0 down. Remember, this is the team who sold Haaland and Takumi Minamino. N\u2019Doye has had to leave the field for Copenhagen. Looked like he took a bang to the chops...in Bulgaria, Ludogorets are banging on the Inter door. Victor Moses, one of those many Premier League emigres, has been put through his defensive paces. A warning sign for Celtic as Dame N\u2019Doye, once of Hull, goes close, only to overrun the ball. The word from Bruges is that Manchester United have started in shambolic fashion. Sporting already lead Istanbul Ba\u015faksehir, and the goal came from Liverpool legend Sebastian Coates, grandson of Ralph. Celtic almost got off to a perfect start! Christie intercept the ball, plays in Eduoard, and the striker\u2019s shot is straight at the Copenhagen keeper. That has to count as a miss. And away we go in the Europa League knockout rounds.... The teams are making their ways on to the fields of play and it is very wet indeed in Bruges, while it looks positively dry in Glasgow. Well, relatively speaking. It\u2019s windy, mind. Ryan Babel is back at Ajax, the club where he began his career. It was as long ago as 2007 that he joined Liverpool, but he\u2019s on loan from Galatasaray this time for a third spell. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has made six alterations for Manchester United. Sergio Romero started in goal for the round of 32 first leg in Belgium, where Victor Lindel\u00f6f returned to the starting line-up after illness. Juan Mata, Jesse Lingard, Andreas Pereira and Diogo Dalot also start against Club Brugge. Former Liverpool player Simon Mignolet is in goal for Brugge. For Celtic, Jeremie Frimpong makes his European debut for Celtic at Copenhagen at Parken stadium. The right-back returned after picking up an injury against Kilmarnock last month and he was joined on the other flank by Jonny Hayes, in for injured left-back Greg Taylor. With striker Leigh Griffiths left behind in Glasgow with a niggle, Celtic boss Neil Lennon has brought in attacker Ryan Christie. Espanyol\u2019s fans have been making themselves heard ahead of their match with Wolves. And the name of the day there is referee Ruddy Buquet, who will be in charge at Getafe today.

Just ask Chelsea and Arsenal from last season. And five British clubs are playing in this last-32 round of matches. Manchester United in Bruges is being catered for by the excellent Tumaini Carayol in a separate MBM but will also be covered here alongside the rest. The first half of Thursday\u2019s matches, kicking off at 5.55pm UK time, includes Celtic\u2019s match at Copenhagen and Getafe, taking La Liga by storm, will play Ajax, still smarting after dropping out of the Champions League. Expect boos aplenty for Red Bull Salzburg at Eintracht Frankfurt, what with their being associated with the hated corporate toy RB Leipzig. Inter, their hopes of winning Serie A for the first time in 10 years having taken a bit of a jolt at the weekend in losing to Lazio, are at Ludogorets in Bulgaria. Here\u2019s the first half of the action, those 5.55pm GMT kick-offs: CFR Cluj v Sevilla Club Brugge v Man Utd Copenhagen v Celtic Eintracht Frankfurt v Red Bull Salzburg Getafe v Ajax Ludogorets v Inter Shakhtar v Benfica Sporting v Istanbul Basaksehir",

She died by manual strangulation on 2 December during sex in the man\u2019s hotel room in central Auckland. The pair had met on the dating app Tinder.</p> \n<p>After Millane\u2019s death, the man packed her body into a suitcase and buried her in the Waitakere ranges, a bushland area west of New Zealand\u2019s largest city. Her remains were found eight days after she died.</p> \n<p>Her parents, David and Gillian, appeared via videolink in the courtroom, with a framed photograph of Grace hung on the wall behind them. Grace\u2019s brothers were also present, as was extended family, and the public gallery was packed to capacity, especially with young women.</p> \n<p>Gillian Millane said losing Grace had made her depressed, suicidal and anxious, and she delivered her victim impact statement to the courtroom with a mixture of anger and tears. The man found guilty of her murder bowed his head as Gillian spoke, appearing to cry. It was the most emotion he had shown at any time throughout the murder trial.</p> \n<p>David Millane did not deliver a statement, but his wife said the impact on him had been \u201cprofound\u201d and she had been unable to support him fully, as she too, had been sick and incapacitated with grief, including being unable to get out of bed, leave the house, or even listen to the radio.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe tears I shed are never-ending, at the thought of never having the chance to be being able to kiss my darling Grace goodbye,\u201d said Gillian.</p> \n<p>\u201cGrace was never just a daughter, she was my friend, my very best friend.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI torment myself over what you did to my Grace, the terror and pain she must have experienced at your hands.<strong> </strong>As a mother I would have done anything to change places with her.</p> \n<p>\u201cI should have been there, but she died terrified and alone in a room with you.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a3205a61-f68b-43f9-a4c3-f547478de834\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cd-EkDBV-cI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The crown prosecutor Brian Dickey said the man\u2019s crime against Millane had been \u201cpersonalised, depraved and callous\u201d and the crime had a profound impact on young women\u2019s sense of safety in New Zealand, with many reassessing their relationships with men, or dating life, and how safe they should feel.</p> \n<p>The man\u2019s consumption of explicit pornography and intimate photographs taken of Millane after she died, were evidence of \u201cdepravity\u201d, Dickey argued. He said his disposal of her body in a suitcase in a shallow grave in bushland made it a unique case in New Zealand for its \u201cextensive cruelty\u201d during and after her death, and its wide ramifications in the community, especially for women.</p> \n<p>Ian Brookie, the defence counsel, argued the man was young at the time of the murder, had no significant prior criminal convictions, and could be rehabilitated with a lower sentence of 10 years. The man has maintained his innocence throughout.</p> \n<p>Brookie also said the man was isolated from his M\u0101ori culture, estranged from his family and had a \u201ctraumatic\u201d childhood and upbringing.</p> \n<p>In November last year a jury of seven women and five men took five hours to find the 28-year-old man \u2013 who has name suppression and cannot be identified \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/22/grace-millane-murder-trial-guilty-new-zealand-man-british-backpacker\">guilty of Millane\u2019s murder</a>.

The man had been assessed in his pre-sentencing report as being of \u201cvery high risk\u201d, based on his \u201ccomplex needs\u201d and the severity of the offending. \u201cManual strangulation is a particularly intimate form of violence \u2026 cold-blooded,\u201d Moore said. \u201cYour actions reveal a complete disregard for your victim.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t ring an ambulance, or call the police, instead you embarked on a well-planned and sustained and coordinated course of action to conceal any evidence of what had occurred in your room.\u201d There was no emotion shown by the man found guilty of Millane\u2019s murder, and he listened to his sentencing impassively. Millane, 22, from Essex, arrived in New Zealand in November 2018 as part of a round-the-world trip. She died by manual strangulation on 2 December during sex in the man\u2019s hotel room in central Auckland. The pair had met on the dating app Tinder. After Millane\u2019s death, the man packed her body into a suitcase and buried her in the Waitakere ranges, a bushland area west of New Zealand\u2019s largest city. Her remains were found eight days after she died. Her parents, David and Gillian, appeared via videolink in the courtroom, with a framed photograph of Grace hung on the wall behind them. Grace\u2019s brothers were also present, as was extended family, and the public gallery was packed to capacity, especially with young women. Gillian Millane said losing Grace had made her depressed, suicidal and anxious, and she delivered her victim impact statement to the courtroom with a mixture of anger and tears. The man found guilty of her murder bowed his head as Gillian spoke, appearing to cry. It was the most emotion he had shown at any time throughout the murder trial. David Millane did not deliver a statement, but his wife said the impact on him had been \u201cprofound\u201d and she had been unable to support him fully, as she too, had been sick and incapacitated with grief, including being unable to get out of bed, leave the house, or even listen to the radio. \u201cThe tears I shed are never-ending, at the thought of never having the chance to be being able to kiss my darling Grace goodbye,\u201d said Gillian. \u201cGrace was never just a daughter, she was my friend, my very best friend.\u201d \u201cI torment myself over what you did to my Grace, the terror and pain she must have experienced at your hands. As a mother I would have done anything to change places with her. \u201cI should have been there, but she died terrified and alone in a room with you.\u201d The crown prosecutor Brian Dickey said the man\u2019s crime against Millane had been \u201cpersonalised, depraved and callous\u201d and the crime had a profound impact on young women\u2019s sense of safety in New Zealand, with many reassessing their relationships with men, or dating life, and how safe they should feel. The man\u2019s consumption of explicit pornography and intimate photographs taken of Millane after she died, were evidence of \u201cdepravity\u201d, Dickey argued. He said his disposal of her body in a suitcase in a shallow grave in bushland made it a unique case in New Zealand for its \u201cextensive cruelty\u201d during and after her death, and its wide ramifications in the community, especially for women. Ian Brookie, the defence counsel, argued the man was young at the time of the murder, had no significant prior criminal convictions, and could be rehabilitated with a lower sentence of 10 years. The man has maintained his innocence throughout. Brookie also said the man was isolated from his M\u0101ori culture, estranged from his family and had a \u201ctraumatic\u201d childhood and upbringing. In November last year a jury of seven women and five men took five hours to find the 28-year-old man \u2013 who has name suppression and cannot be identified \u2013 guilty of Millane\u2019s murder. The reason for the name suppression is also suppressed by court order. The prosecution argued that he had used \u201creckless violence\u201d while strangling Millane during sex, and disregarded the risk to her life when choking her so hard and for so long that she died. A forensic pathologist said it would have taken five to 10 minutes for Millane to have died, and she would first have fallen unconscious due to the pressure on her neck. \u201cYou can\u2019t consent to your own murder,\u201d said crown prosecutor Brian Dickey during the three-week-trial in Auckland\u2019s high court. The man found guilty of Millane\u2019s murder had a long history of Tinder dating, with a number of his former dates cutting off contact with him because they felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with his behaviour. The accused, who lived in an inner-city hotel, had a reported interest in choking and domination, and a history of telling exaggerated stories and lies \u2013 including that he had cancer, was a professional athlete, and worked as an \u201coil manager\u201d offshore. Millane\u2019s murder shocked New Zealand, which has a low homicide rate, and prompted the prime minister Jacinda Ardern to offer a public apology. \u201cOn behalf of New Zealand, I want to apologise to Grace\u2019s family \u2013 your daughter should have been safe here and she wasn\u2019t, and I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d Thousands of people attended candlelit vigils after Millane died, calling for an end to violence against women, and Ardern said New Zealanders collectively experienced \u201churt and shame\u201d around the tragedy. According to the Ministry of Justice 80,000 are the victims of domestic violence in New Zealand each year. A charity started in Millane\u2019s name, Love Grace, launched in New Zealand this week and has seen an influx of donations. The charity donates handbags full of essentials and luxuries to women-in-need, and has already helped hundreds of women in Millane\u2019s home county of Essex.",

      "bodyText": "Ukraine\u2019s effort to quarantine more than 70 people evacuated from China over the new virus outbreak was plunged into chaos on Thursday as local residents hurled stones at buses carrying the evacuees and engaged in violent clashes with police. The vehicles were finally able to reach the designated place of quarantine after hours of clashes. The masked evacuees, exhausted by the long journey, peeked through shattered bus windows as they drove slowly under heavy police escort. Since the early morning, several hundred residents of the village of Novi Sanzhary in Ukraine\u2019s central Poltava region had barricaded the road to a sanitarium intended to host the evacuees, fearing that they could become infected. Demonstrators, some of whom appeared drunk, put up road blocks, burned tyres and clashed with hundreds of riot police who moved to restore access. One protester tried to ram police lines with his car. The Ukrainian authorities say all passengers on board had been screened twice for the virus before being allowed to fly, but that was not enough to pacify the protesters. \u201cIsn\u2019t there any other place in Ukraine that can host 50 people, that is located in more or less remote villages or in far-off areas where there is no threat to population?\u201d queried resident Yuriy Dzyubenko. One protester was heard suggesting they should be kept at Chernobyl, the site of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster in 1986. Another suggested taking them to parliament, while another said Zelenskiy, Ukraine\u2019s president, should house them himself if he really believed there was no danger. \u201cThis is what I am telling him, telling the president: \u2018Take 10 people, then I will take two,\u2019\u201d a man called Yuriy, who did not give his last name, said. Nine police and one civilian were hospitalised, regional police said in a statement. More than 10 protesters were detained, and Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, Arsen Avakov, visited the site of the skirmishes to try to calm the crowd down. He urged the protesters \u201cnot to fall for provocations and be understanding of the necessity for these temporary measures\u201d. \u201cThe situation is rather heated,\u201d Poltava\u2019s regional police spokesman Yuri Sulayev said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy also weighed in, saying the protests showed \u201cnot the best side of our character\u201d. In a statement on his Facebook page, Zelenskiy said the authorities had done everything possible to make sure the virus would not spread to Ukraine. \u201cBut there is another danger that I would like to mention. The danger of forgetting that we are all human and we are all Ukrainian,\u201d he said. Municipal legislators in the village vowed to continue opposing the evacuation, saying that the sanitarium\u2019s sewage system was linked to the one in the village and ends up in a nearby waste facility. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow putting the health and life of local residents at risk, and demand that top officials take urgent moves to prevent people from China from being put here,\u201d they said in a statement. Amid the clashes between local residents and police, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Oleksiy Honcharuk, said he would immediately fly to the site to oversee matters personally. A plane with 45 Ukrainians and 27 foreign nationals took off from Wuhan early on Thursday, the origin of the outbreak that has infected more than 75,000 people worldwide and killed over 2,100. Those evacuated included nationals from Belarus, Kazakhstan, Argentina, Ecuador, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Panama.",

I feel like the infrastructure in Scotland needs to improve, we need more money in the game without a doubt and not just in terms of signing players.\u201d It would be a pity if Glasgow City aren\u2019t central to such growth. Without them, women\u2019s football in Scotland would have no broader resonance at all.",

The nine-page letter written by Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP, offers scathing criticism of the police\u2019s continued use of tactics against Indigenous people which she had previously warned against. The document was released as Justin Trudeau\u2019s government struggles to deal with a growing protest movement in support of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation\u2019s fight against a controversial natural gas pipeline in British Columbia. In recent weeks, demonstrations have sprung up across the country, blockading major railway lines and obstructing access to ports and government buildings. On Thursday, Canada\u2019s largest rail operator, CN Rail, obtained a court injunction giving it permission to remove a blockade in St-Lambert, a suburb of Montreal. Quebec\u2019s premier, Fran\u00e7ois Legault, promised swift police-backed action to remove the protest, which since Wednesday has prevented trains from traveling between Montreal and eastern Canada, as well as the US.

      "body": "<p>A victim of the devastating 2011 Queensland floods says he hopes insurer QBE will rule out appealing against a landmark class action decision that could result in hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation.</p> <p>The former Ipswich deputy mayor Paul Tully, whose home was inundated in the floods, said QBE should follow the lead of the state government, which had already ruled out appealing a judgment handed down by the New South Wales supreme court in November.</p> <p>The court found two water authorities, Sunwater and Seqwater, were negligent because they failed to follow their own procedures during the floods by releasing water during heavy rains.</p> <p>This made the eventual flood, which damaged thousands of homes and businesses, far worse, the court found.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/17/townsville-flood-victims-allegedly-targeted-by-centrelink-robodebt-program\">Townsville flood victims hit by Centrelink robodebt program</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In December, the Queensland government said it would not appeal the decision. However, the two water authorities kept their options open by lodging notices they intended to appeal \u2013 a decision the government said was in the hands of their insurance companies, which it did not name.</p> <p>Guardian Australia can reveal that Sunwater\u2019s insurer for the floods was QBE, according to <a href=\"https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/documents/tableOffice/TabledPapers/2019/5619T1650.pdf\">documents tabled in Queensland parliament</a>.</p> <p>It is unknown whether QBE also insures Seqwater. QBE and the water authorities declined to comment.</p> <p>A QBE spokesman also declined to comment when asked whether the company had the financial capacity to meet its share of a compensation bill estimated to total between $400m and $1bn.</p> <p>However, it is expected the insurers will make their intentions clear on Friday, when the class action returns to court for a directions hearing.</p> <p>The state government sacked Tully and the rest of the Ipswich council in August 2018 after a crime commission investigation into the troubled body. No allegations were made against Tully.</p> <p>Tully was among claimants in the 2014 lawsuit, which was filed by lawyers Maurice Blackburn in NSW because at the time Queensland\u2019s courts could not hear class actions.</p> <p>He said working out how much class action members should receive would involve a detailed consideration of their individual circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cI see it as being a very laborious process,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Assessing individual claims could take another year, he said.</p> <p>\u201cDepending on the geographical area and the suburb involved, if people\u2019s claims are reasonable then that\u2019s the basis for paying out.\u201d</p> <p>He said that if the insurers decided to appeal it could drag the process out for \u201canother two or three years\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who are calling the shots and holding this up to the NSW court of appeal and ultimately the high court,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are frustrated, angry.\u201d</p> <p>Insurers usually reduce the amount they have to pay out due to big disasters such as the 2011 floods \u2013 or this season\u2019s deadly bushfires \u2013 by taking out reinsurance.</p> <p>However, it is not clear how much reinsurance cover QBE has available regarding the 2011 floods.</p> <p>In QBE\u2019s 2011 annual report, the then chief executive Frank O\u2019Halloran said that the year\u2019s performance had been protected by an \u201cextensive\u201d reinsurance program but complained that there was \u201climited market capacity to purchase cost effective reinsurance cover for a frequency of catastrophes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf available, it is often far too expensive,\u201d O\u2019Halloran, who left the company in 2012, said.</p> <p>On Monday, QBE declared a profit for 2019 of $550m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A victim of the devastating 2011 Queensland floods says he hopes insurer QBE will rule out appealing against a landmark class action decision that could result in hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation. The former Ipswich deputy mayor Paul Tully, whose home was inundated in the floods, said QBE should follow the lead of the state government, which had already ruled out appealing a judgment handed down by the New South Wales supreme court in November. The court found two water authorities, Sunwater and Seqwater, were negligent because they failed to follow their own procedures during the floods by releasing water during heavy rains. This made the eventual flood, which damaged thousands of homes and businesses, far worse, the court found. In December, the Queensland government said it would not appeal the decision. However, the two water authorities kept their options open by lodging notices they intended to appeal \u2013 a decision the government said was in the hands of their insurance companies, which it did not name. Guardian Australia can reveal that Sunwater\u2019s insurer for the floods was QBE, according to documents tabled in Queensland parliament. It is unknown whether QBE also insures Seqwater. QBE and the water authorities declined to comment. A QBE spokesman also declined to comment when asked whether the company had the financial capacity to meet its share of a compensation bill estimated to total between $400m and $1bn. However, it is expected the insurers will make their intentions clear on Friday, when the class action returns to court for a directions hearing. The state government sacked Tully and the rest of the Ipswich council in August 2018 after a crime commission investigation into the troubled body. No allegations were made against Tully. Tully was among claimants in the 2014 lawsuit, which was filed by lawyers Maurice Blackburn in NSW because at the time Queensland\u2019s courts could not hear class actions. He said working out how much class action members should receive would involve a detailed consideration of their individual circumstances. \u201cI see it as being a very laborious process,\u201d he said. Assessing individual claims could take another year, he said. \u201cDepending on the geographical area and the suburb involved, if people\u2019s claims are reasonable then that\u2019s the basis for paying out.\u201d He said that if the insurers decided to appeal it could drag the process out for \u201canother two or three years\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who are calling the shots and holding this up to the NSW court of appeal and ultimately the high court,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are frustrated, angry.\u201d Insurers usually reduce the amount they have to pay out due to big disasters such as the 2011 floods \u2013 or this season\u2019s deadly bushfires \u2013 by taking out reinsurance. However, it is not clear how much reinsurance cover QBE has available regarding the 2011 floods. In QBE\u2019s 2011 annual report, the then chief executive Frank O\u2019Halloran said that the year\u2019s performance had been protected by an \u201cextensive\u201d reinsurance program but complained that there was \u201climited market capacity to purchase cost effective reinsurance cover for a frequency of catastrophes\u201d. \u201cIf available, it is often far too expensive,\u201d O\u2019Halloran, who left the company in 2012, said. On Monday, QBE declared a profit for 2019 of $550m.",

      "bodyText": "A former student of St Kevin\u2019s College who was sexually groomed by his athletics coach has angrily condemned Andrew Bolt and Gerard Henderson\u2019s characterisation of the crime, saying their comments made him \u201csick\u201d. Bolt and Henderson, who have both now apologised for the comments, were critical of a Four Corners report about the school and its handling of the incident in a segment on Tuesday that drew the ire of child protection advocates. Bolt used of the phrase \u201chit on\u201d to describe the former coach Peter Kehoe\u2019s predatory behaviour towards the then year nine student Paris Street, while Henderson remarked the school\u2019s handling of the case was \u201cnot [terrible] at all\u201d. Bolt said Kehoe \u201chit on a boy at that school \u2013 no sex occurred\u201d. Street posted a lengthy rebuke of the Sky News segment on Facebook on Thursday. \u201cPlease, both of you, build some common decency and human courtesy into what is required in relation to sexual abuse,\u201d Street posted on Facebook. \u201cEspecially if you are to make public comments about it. \u201cGerard Henderson and Andrew Bolt, how would you feel if someone acted the way Peter Kehoe did towards me, towards children of your own? Would your comments be any different? \u201cReflect on the comments you have made and never make them again in the future. They make me sick.\u201d Street told the Four Corners journalist Louise Milligan on Monday\u2019s program he was repeatedly exposed to offensive comments by Kehoe, who was convicted in 2015 for grooming. Street said he was then let down by the headmaster Stephen Russell, who wrote a character reference for the offender. Street accused Bolt and Henderson of \u201ctrivialising\u201d and \u201cminimising\u201d his experience, before describing in graphic terms what \u201chitting on\u201d him actually meant. \u201cI was invited to jump into a 59 year olds bed,\u201d Street said. \u201cI was invited to lick the pre-cum off that same 59 year olds penis. The Facebook messages he sent me. I was fifteen. He was convicted of grooming me. For your own knowledge, (it clearly needs enhancement), please refer to the relevant legislation of what grooming actually is. \u201cSpeaking of facts Gerard, you said, and I quote: \u2018I can understand the victims annoyance after the event but if you look at the hard facts of the case and you consider the time when this occurred\u2026\u2019 Well, this occurred alongside a royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. \u201cI was a victim of child sexual abuse. St Kevin\u2019s is an institution. Please refer to the findings of that royal commission because this might enhance your knowledge (and hopefully some understanding) of the pain and suffering that victims endure from not being supported.\u201d Street also factchecked some of Bolt and Henderson\u2019s claims, including why he returned to the school after the trial, Kehoe\u2019s sentence, the dates of the reference and Henderson\u2019s claim that Kehoe had a clean record before this incident. Bolt is a supporter of the convicted paeodophile George Pell. In an editorial on Wednesday\u2019s Bolt Report he addressed what he called the \u201cmalicious\u201d attacks on him by the ABC. Bolt said that he supported Pell because he believed his friend was innocent. He repeated his belief that Four Corners misrepresented the Kehoe case. \u201cThe principal has now been forced to resign,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cWell done you. \u201cNowhere did I say or imply that in some way this disgusting behaviour was a small matter,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by their outrage. This is not about what I said last night \u2026 This is an excuse for them, this is a weapon.\u201d Hours after Street\u2019s Facebook post Bolt apologised on the Bolt Report for using the term \u201chit on\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry to you Paris,\u201d he said after telling viewers about Street\u2019s post. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I regret it. I spend every hour since thinking about it and I hate what happened. I wrote a book with the title Still Not Sorry and I am sorry.\u201d Henderson has also apologised to Street, saying his criticism was aimed at Four Corners and not at the victim himself. \u201cInitially I should state that I had no intention of upsetting a victim of child sexual assault \u2013 of whom I know several,\u201d Henderson told Guardian Australia. \u201cI am very sorry for upsetting Paris Street \u2013 obviously a fine young man \u2013 with respect to my comments on The Bolt Report on Tuesday. \u201cBy way of background, the fact is that my comments essentially were directed at Louise Milligan\u2019s Four Corners program Boys Club and I made little reference to Paris Street in response to the questions I received.\u201d",

After arriving at Stamford Bridge on Monday with only one league win in 2020, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s team stole away with three points and offered all a rare opportunity to relax and bask in the glory of a job well done. There were pleasing performances from Harry Maguire (despite his<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/17/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\"> stray boot\u2019s </a>attempts to ruin everything)<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/17/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">,</a> Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Erick Bailly, Bruno Fernandes and many more. In the end they were too busy celebrating to hear Mino Raiola\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/17/paul-pogba-manchester-united-mino-raiola-ole-gunnar-solskjaer\">new proclamations of war</a>.</p> <p>As always, the question is whether they can use a solid win like this to build some momentum and United\u2019s biggest problem this season is how frequently they have been in this position. This season has included wins against Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City, Leicester City and two other wins over Chelsea, yet the answer has usually been a resounding no. United have shrunk against lesser teams and struggled to piece together consistent form throughout. Here they stand once again attempting to use a big result to propel them forward.</p> <p>With a 7 games in 21 days on the horizon across the Premier League, Europa League and FA Cup, Solskjaer says that he will be rotating his squad against Club Brugge tonight. The most interesting piece of news is the possibility that Odion Ighalo will contend for his first start after signing in January.<br></p> <p>Across the pitch will be the team currently dominating the Belgian Pro League. After winning last year\u2019s title with Genk, new manager Phillippe Clement has brought his winning mentality to Brugge and they currently have more wins and fewer losses than anyone else, leading the league by 9 points. They have conceded just 12 goals so far this season.<br></p> <p>They know as well as anyone else Manchester United represent another level. The last time they faced United, in the 2015-16 Champions League qualifying, United rolled through them 5-1 and 4-0. Club Brugge will be looking for their first win against an English side since the 1994-95 Cup Winner\u2019s Cup quarters, a run that spans 10 games. That sure is a very long time but don\u2019t count out the team that has made winning a habit throughout this season. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-20T15:36:34.785Z\">at 3.36pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That is all from me tonight. Thanks for following. Bye. Ouch. Here is tonight\u2019s report from Jamie Jackson. That was not bad at all. An excellent performance from the Belgian league leaders, particularly from Emmanuel Dennis who made Maguire\u2019s life hell and he was perhaps the man of the match throughout. Other standout performances came from Maxim De Cuyper and Simon Mignolet was not bad at all in goal. For United, there were two notable performances. After a horrendous opening 35 minutes from the away team, Anthony Martial showed such impressive industry to score the goal and inject confidence into the team. Despite being substituted with only 9 minutes to go, Bruno Fernandes was a class above and it felt like he was everywhere as United pushed for a winner, playing progressive passes with every touch. Good game. The teams will head to Old Trafford with all even and everything to play for. Both had their chances to score the winner, neither can really be mad at the result. 90+4 min Another anti-climatic free kick into the wall from United late in the game, this time from Mata. Time is running out. 90+3 min Fernandes just keeps on picking up the ball and eventually he wins a foul on the edge of the area. Another scary free kick for the home team to defend... 90 min Four minutes of added time. Meanwhile, Fernandes just picked up the ball and took a shot that was well blocked. The rebound eventually found Lingard outside the box, who could only direct his shot at Mignolet. 89 min After threatening for the winner and creating the perfect opportunity, suddenly Club Brugge players are struggling to breathe. United are moving forward in waves now. The home side will do well to hold out here. 87 min A deep sigh of relief from the home team as Fernandes\u2019 freekick failed to clear the wall, and his attempt the whip in a cross on the rebound was probably even worse. There will surely be a few more chances here... 85 min Goodness, United fans should be very excited by how quickly Fernandes has changed the game. Suddenly United are crowding the box and he keeps on finding Mata in space. Now, a free kick for United on the edge of the area. 82 min Nearly a huge chance for United. Bruno Fernandes, United\u2019s shiny new signing, had been on for all of two seconds (he replaced Dalot) when he received the ball on the break and chipped a gorgeous ball to send Mata clear. Mata couldn\u2019t quite get his finish past Mignolet, but then he was called for offside. Still, that was a lovely pass. 81 min This is great. End to end stuff with both teams chasing the winner. The game just stopped after Dennis was down with injury. Sadly for United, it seems like he will be fine. 77 min Club Brugge miss a huge opportunity! Great work from Dennis who, not for the first time today, left Maguire completely for dead and rolled in a low cross. In the box, Schrjvers smartly let the ball run to Kossounou who sent a limp shot well wide. From Anwesh Mishra: For me, Martial has all the skills required to be a top number 9. His hold up is decent when he does showcase it. He has the pace to get past the defenses, the trickery to beat a man, and is easily United\u2019s best finisher. The problem lies in the fact that he really doesn\u2019t really like to play with his back to the goal, or run channels creating options for his midfielders. He also has a habit of drifting wide when playing as a 9, which often leaves the team without a focal point. If he could really find those striker\u2019s instincts, he could be a world beater. 74 min A final substitution for the home side. Maxim De Cuyper, who is making his debut and had a standout performance, receives a standing ovation as he is replaced by Siebe Schrijvers. 72 min A chance there for Club Brugge! Dennis, who has been a menace all day, was released with a long ball and he tore up the field in pursuit. Maguire, who hasn\u2019t been great, did extremely well to barge the Brugge forward off the ball and scupper the danger. 71 min Minutes after receiving a yellow card, Andrea Pereira has been subbed off. Fred will take his place. 69 min Some more really nice combination play from Brugge on the left flank before the ball rolled out to Ruud Vormer. The midfielder took a shot from distance and the ball flew well wide. 67 min Anthony Martial has been replaced by Odion Ighalo. Another good evening of work from the Frenchman. He changed the game with a classy goal. 65 min of nowhere, they home team just launched into a huge coordinated press on the United team as the crowd roared in unison. Jesse Lingard was promptly nicked well inside his own half and the home team quickly worked the ball into the final third. It came to nothing, but it sure was fun. 63 min A bit of a scare from Mignolet as he passed out from the back but the home team survived. Meanwhile, De Cuyper just attempted to karate kick the ball in a 50/50 challenge. This time, a free kick was given. 62 min Great work from Mata, who nicked the ball from deep, drove forward at the Brugge midfield and found Martial with a nice ball on the flank. The Frenchman was barged off the ball and for some reason it wasn\u2019t called for a foul. 60 min This second half has settled down after a hectic start. A nice spell of possession for the home team. From Paul Moody on twitter: I\u2019m in Brazil so early mufc start took me by surprise. Martial can be very frustrating, but also sensational. Also this is his best season, still very young too. 56 min Another good spell for United ends with Pereira, who has played well since the end of the first half, going for goal from distance. That was not troubling Mignolet but it is certainly clear that Pereira is desperate to score. 53 min Yellow card for Vanaken. He protested just a little too hard after a free kick was given to United\u2019s Williams. 50 min End to end stuff at the beginning of half. Moments after Martial failed to finish Mata\u2019s pass, Vanaken found Dennis with a nice pass at the other end. Good shot from Dennis but a very good save from Romero. 49 min Two chances from United to open up. First Lingard very nearly got onto the end of a cross, then Juan Mata picked up a loose Brugge pass and found Martial in the box with a nice ball. Martial had a great chance on his left foot but he bizarrely tried to cut back to Mata. The ball bounced off a Brugge defender and rolled to a thankful Mignolet. 47 min By no means will the home team be shedding tears over that substitution. Ruud Vormer had been struggling with injury but he is one of the best players and he is responsible for 15 league assists and 2 in Europe this year. Not bad. 45 min The second half begins. About one kick into the second half, Balanta went down again with the same injury from the final minutes of the first half. He has now been replaced by Ruud Vormer. Meanwhile, Celtic lead 1-0 in Copenhagen. It will be interesting to see how Manchester United start the second half. That was a rancid opening 35 minutes from them against a glittering Club Brugge. They had endless possession yet looked so timid on the ball and they could have conceded more. The game changed in the blink of an eye with one moment of intelligence and industry from Martial, which galvanised the team. By the end of the first half, United had 6 shots to 5. From Ciar\u00e1n: I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s going to score many more goals like that, but it proves the worth of working a little bit harder off the ball. A lot Anelka to his game. One can\u2019t doubt his talent (he\u2019s just smashed the ball off the post as I write this) but there are infuriatingly lethargic spells from him almost every game. Fair enough. Well, that was an interesting half. Brugge dominated a completely lacklustre United for 35 minutes before Martial changed the game by taking advantage from a mistake by Mechele and nailing his finish. Neither team will be happy with the goal they conceded, but here we are. 45 min Balanta is down with a knock for Brugge and the physio is on. He looks quite dazed but he walked off and it seems like he should continue. 43 min Martial once again creates something from nothing, this time rattling the post with a wicked strike from outside the box. That was going in if not for an excellent fingertip save from Mignolet to roll the ball onto the post. This is much better from United. 40 min That was a big miss from Brandon Williams, who booted his shot miles over the bar from a great position. Much better work from United, who worked the ball up the pitch and to Pereira who then fizzed in a great cross to Williams, who was in space at the far post. That was something. Brugge defender Mechele received a throw in from a completely neutral position but he clearly didn\u2019t realise how close Martial was. As he let the ball run past him, Martial sprinted forward and nicked the ball, dribbling free and then finishing with plenty of composure. Industrious work from the Frenchman and we will see if he can single-handedly inject some confidence into his team. Out of nowhere, United are level! After a bad mistake from Mechele, a great run and finish from Martial. From Justin: With United opting to play with a fly keeper tonight behind Lindelof, who always seems to be in the wrong post code when the ball is delivered, I\u2019m not sure Bruges will need the full-on \u201cmiracle\u201d to beat United in this competition. No walking on water required, Monsieur Clement; just tell them to bring their waders and hoof it up into the deep end. Well then. 30 min United are now up to 62.5% possession here and they continue to do absolutely nothing but pass sideways with it. This time, Brugge\u2019s Mata steals the ball and flits about 40 yards up the right flank. This time he was just too quick for his teammates to catch up, but again, that is just too easy. 28 min Tau, De Cuyper and Dennis have been electric so far from the left. Another chance for them as the trio combine with some quick one touch combinations before Dennis fires off a shot from the tight angle. Well saved by Romero in the end but the home team is strolling through the United midfield at the moment. 26 min This time, it\u2019s Cuyper who produces a lovely through ball in Tau\u2019s direction after a quick break. Tau was just offside and United breathe. 24 min United have had 61.3% of the ball so far today but they really aren\u2019t doing anything with it. The home team is happily waiting for space on the counter and, so far, tearing the English team apart with quick passing. 21 mins Another heart-in-mouth moment for United. This time, Maguire failed to win a header from a long ball and the ball bounced over him as Brugge\u2019s Tau chased it. Solid work from United keeper Romero, who was quick to meet the ball out of his box before hoofing it out. 17 min So much for a slow start! Brugge are moving the ball so quickly in the final third and, minutes after their first goal, they are already after a second. Quite a poor miss from Rits at the end of another great move from the home team. The United defence looks shaken. The home team go in front! From a corner for United, Mignolet found Dennis with a long ball. A beautiful lob from Dennis flies over Romero, who was well off his line. 13 min With the exception of the opening scare for United, there is not too much happening here. This has been quite a sterile start. 9 min United are settling down and have commanded possession a couple of minutes, but the ball is mostly in their own half. Meanwhile, the rain has officially stopped. 6 min Brugge are already showing exactly what have made them so successful this year. They are passing out from the back and have started with some crisp passing through the lines - they lead the Belgian Pro League in possession and passes played. Dennis was just offside after a lovely through ball by Vanaken. They are here to play. 2 min Goodness. Brugge immediately generate a big chance to begin! United\u2019s Brandon Williams suffered a tough tackle as the ball was pushed out. Brugge took the throw in quickly, with Vanaken whipping a ball into the box. Carnage in the box, but the ball was eventually cleared by Lindelof. That was a warning. 1 min: United kick off tonight. We begin. Andreas Pereira, a philosopher, in his BT Sport interview: Goals are like ketchup, if you score one, loads more will come\u201d The teams are heading out onto the pitch. A reminder: VAR is now being used in the Europa league. Let\u2019s see what carnage that brings up. The weather is absolutely miserable in Bruges. The rain is heavy and the camera has already cut to many sad people wearing big coats. Recommended reading: The Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on BT Sport: [Ighalo\u2019s] not trained too many days with us. We\u2019re still waiting. Hopefully we can get him on at the end of the game today. [Bailly] got a knock against Chelsea, so he wasn\u2019t able to play today. We know the conditions here aren\u2019t great but we have to concentrate here.. We\u2019ll just have to play a good game of football, try to control our game and try to play at our tempo. Some big changes for both teams tonight. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has made six changes from United\u2019s win at Chelsea earlier in the week. Fred, Fernandes, Wan-Bissaka, Bailly, De Gea and James all resting. Club Brugge is putting forward a strong squad after resting players on the weekend. Still, particularly notable players on the bench are Ruud Vormer, the club talisman who is responsible for 15 assists in the league this season and 2 in Europe. David Okereke, Brugge\u2019s second highest scorer in the league with 9 goals, also starts on the bench. Be sure to check out Barry Glendenning\u2019s Fiver today. Club Brugge: Mignolet, Mata, Kossounou, Mechele, Deli, Rits, Balanta, Vanaken, Bonaventure, Tau, De Cuyper Subs: Horvath, Ricca, Mitrovic, De Ketelaere, Vormer, Schrijvers, Okereke Manchester United: Romero, Dalot, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, Williams, Matic, Mata, Pereira, Lingard, Martial Subs: De Gea, Bailly, Wan-Bissaka, Fred, Fernandes, James, Ighalo Referee: Aleksei Kulbakov (Belarus) Here is Philippe Clement\u2019s sober preview of tonight\u2019s match: \u201cTo eliminate Manchester United, you really need a real miracle. People who do not think that have not looked at recent history. Agreed, United has a difficult season. But they won at Manchester City and Chelsea and won points from Liverpool. There is a lot of quality in their group. \u201c \u201cIn Europe, you have years in which you perform a miracle. We will of course throw ourselves [at United] completely. These are two games in which we have nothing to lose. Many boys are looking forward to it. Matches like these provide my players with energy. \u201d What an unusually pleasant, stress-free week this has been for United fans. After arriving at Stamford Bridge on Monday with only one league win in 2020, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s team stole away with three points and offered all a rare opportunity to relax and bask in the glory of a job well done. There were pleasing performances from Harry Maguire (despite his stray boot\u2019s attempts to ruin everything), Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Erick Bailly, Bruno Fernandes and many more. In the end they were too busy celebrating to hear Mino Raiola\u2019s new proclamations of war. As always, the question is whether they can use a solid win like this to build some momentum and United\u2019s biggest problem this season is how frequently they have been in this position. This season has included wins against Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City, Leicester City and two other wins over Chelsea, yet the answer has usually been a resounding no. United have shrunk against lesser teams and struggled to piece together consistent form throughout. Here they stand once again attempting to use a big result to propel them forward. With a 7 games in 21 days on the horizon across the Premier League, Europa League and FA Cup, Solskjaer says that he will be rotating his squad against Club Brugge tonight. The most interesting piece of news is the possibility that Odion Ighalo will contend for his first start after signing in January. Across the pitch will be the team currently dominating the Belgian Pro League. After winning last year\u2019s title with Genk, new manager Phillippe Clement has brought his winning mentality to Brugge and they currently have more wins and fewer losses than anyone else, leading the league by 9 points. They have conceded just 12 goals so far this season. They know as well as anyone else Manchester United represent another level. The last time they faced United, in the 2015-16 Champions League qualifying, United rolled through them 5-1 and 4-0. Club Brugge will be looking for their first win against an English side since the 1994-95 Cup Winner\u2019s Cup quarters, a run that spans 10 games. That sure is a very long time but don\u2019t count out the team that has made winning a habit throughout this season.",

      "bodyText": "The deadly terrorist shooting in the German town of Hanau represents the latest in a string of far-right attacks and plots in what has long been considered one of Europe\u2019s most stable countries. The murderous actions of the gunman, identified in the German media as Tobias Rathjen, came only days after a dozen German men were arrested for allegedly plotting armed attacks on mosques around the country. Their extraordinary suspected goal was to kill Muslims in \u201ccommando\u201d style attacks with the explicit intention of provoking revenge, and even civil war. Each member was expected to contribute \u20ac50,000 to fund the operation. Part of the inspiration was global: German prosecutors say the plotters were influenced by the violent attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which a gunman killed 51 people, streaming some of it live on Facebook. But there are also local factors. In the period since the migration crisis of 2015, when large numbers of often desperate people arrived in the country from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, far-right activity appears to have increased. German police said last week they were monitoring 53 potentially violent individuals associated with the extreme right, up from 22 in 2016, and the domestic intelligence and security agencies are under intense pressure because of the growing number of plots and incidents. \u201cPart of the problem is that until now the German security community doesn\u2019t seem to have been very good at dealing with the situation,\u201d said Patrik Hermansson, of the far-right monitoring group Hope Not Hate. \u201cIn some cases, extremists have had links with the police and the military.\u201d Last June it emerged that a group of rightwing extremists called Nordkreuz (Northern Cross) had used police data to compile a \u201cdeath list\u201d of leftwing and pro-refugee targets.

Last summer Stephan Ernst, a 45-year-old with a string of convictions for violent anti-migrant crime, was arrested for allegedly shooting dead a conservative politician, Walter L\u00fcbcke, at close range outside his house in Istha, central Germany. L\u00fcbcke was well known for his pro-migrant stance, and videos of his comments had circulated among far-right circles on YouTube. Ernst, whose DNA was recovered from the crime scene, was allegedly incensed by his opinions. Last month Germany banned the neo-Nazi group Combat 18, with which Ernst was believed to be in contact. Founded in Britain in the early 1990s as a militant wing of the British National party, the organisation had found a new life in a country that, on the whole, remains particularly sensitive about its fascist past. Around 200 police officers carried out raids in six German states, seizing phones, computers, weaponry as well as Nazi keepsakes from members of the group which Horst Seehofer, Germany\u2019s interior minister, said \u201cenjoys great respect within the far-right extremist scene\u201d because of the country\u2019s history. British investigators say there are links between British, German and Nordic far-right groups online, where most people are radicalised, connecting with like-minded individuals across national boundaries using specialist social media networks such as Telegram.",

      "bodyText": "Early on Thursday morning, striking staff and supportive students braved wind, rain and hailstones to picket at the University of Manchester, demanding an end to unequal pay, unfair workloads, rising pension costs and the casualisation of work. Outside the Samuel Alexander building, Spanish lecturers Adriana Bausells and Rub\u00e9n Peinado said the precariousness of pay and contracts had become the norm for their department, increasing their workloads and stymieing prospects for promotion. Peinado, 34, is on his fourth fixed-term contract in four years, which has seriously affected his income and economic security. \u201cEvery year I\u2019m offered a contract renewal for only 10 months \u2018to satisfy a temporary need in the department\u2019. I get my last paycheck in June, then nothing until the end of September. \u201cHow do you say to your landlord that you have no job over the summer so can\u2019t pay rent for two months? I go back to Spain, come back in September, then a few months in I\u2019ll get a letter saying I\u2019m no longer needed and the process starts again. It makes you feel really, really bad.\u201d Bausells, 33, said she also had to move home three times in the last five years for this reason. \u201cWhen it comes to teaching it makes it so hard to innovate, because you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll see these students next year. Last year was my first time seeing students graduate and the feeling was amazing \u2013 I\u2019ve seen them from first year through their final year. It\u2019s a brilliant but rare opportunity nowadays.\u201d Postdoc Rebecca said the systemic casualisation of work and pay marginalised people from less privileged backgrounds. \u201cIt\u2019s driving lots of people out of academia who can\u2019t afford to be on temporary contracts and constantly looking for the next job, which is really bad for diversity.\u201d She will be back on the job market next year looking for permanent lectureships that she\u2019s unlikely to find. \u201cI\u2019ve spent 10 years training for a career in academia, but I\u2019ve seen so many colleagues who couldn\u2019t find permanent work have to leave the sector altogether.\u201d Taking shelter by the Whitworth Building, students directed frustration towards university management. For third-year philosophy and politics student Orlando Phipps, this was his third consecutive term having lectures cancelled because of industrial action. \u201cI\u2019m here out of concern for my lecturers \u2013 they don\u2019t take these decisions lightly \u2013 and to stand up to the financialisation of higher education.\u201d History student Frank Roche, 21, added that the system was unsustainable. \u201cI know somebody who works part-time at [burger chain] Archie\u2019s \u2013 if he was full-time he\u2019d be making more than some of our full-time lecturers. It\u2019s just a ridiculous situation. They\u2019re constantly overworked, underpaid and suffering mentally. It can\u2019t go on.\u201d Several staff members cited that by increasing pension costs, the Universities Superannuation Scheme was ignoring the recommendations of two joint expert panels that deemed it unnecessary. English and American studies professor Jackie Stacey said younger colleagues wouldn\u2019t have a pension they could live on when they retire under the changes. She also found her workload unmanageable. \u201cThe volume of work is way too high and impossible to do in the hours that we\u2019re paid for. University management has literally no idea what our day-to-day lives are like.\u201d Monica Pearl, lecturer in 20th century American literature, added that work-life balance was non-existent. \u201cFor some of us, we\u2019re on the picket lines in the morning but afterwards we might finally get to go to the dentist or get our eyes examined. I just couldn\u2019t do those things during the semester, because I\u2019m working all the time.\u201d Daniela Caselli and John McAuliffe have both taught at the university for about 15 years and have seen a shift toward investing in regeneration of buildings, development of new parts of the campus and overseas expansion, rather than in staff, teaching and research. \u201cWe should work 37.5 hours a week, but it\u2019s actually more like 60 or 70,\u201d Caselli said. \u201cWe want to do our job well, but I feel constantly put in a position where I perform not at my best.\u201d English literature lecturer Chris Vardy said the only way to secure a more permanent role was to do research on the side, which you\u2019re not paid for, and \u201ccompounds the problem of workload more and more as I have to work far beyond the hours I\u2019m paid for\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The pleated midi skirt - ubiquitous in modern wardrobes over the past decade - is not going anywhere for autumn/winter, according to Miuccia Prada. Her latest show, in Milan on Thursday, deconstructed the trend, however, with a selection of swishy, leg-baring calf-length skirts fashioned from silken tassels and chunky strips of fabric.</p> <p>\u201cBasically the pleated skirt became fringing,\u201d the designer said after her show, \u201cbecause I wanted to use fringe as a symbol.\u201d</p> <p>It was a cracking collection which came with a clear narrative about women and power. Those skirts were combined with severe grey suit jackets, shirts and ties - business at the top, cocktail hour at the bottom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3d922748e6264f17cca9a88b32be453e22b1523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3d922748e6264f17cca9a88b32be453e22b1523/134_0_3281_1970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catwalk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Towards the end of the show the office-appropriate pieces, in grey, camel and black, were remade in tulle or embellished with crystals. Vivid coloured tights - grass green, sky blue and yolk yellow - peeked out as models strode forward. The final looks were silken suits decorated with graphic floral prints. The impression was of an army of corporate drones whose fabulous inner selves were bursting to reveal themselves.</p> <p>In line with the current movement towards longevity in trends it made a subtle departure from the previous season rather than rethinking it.</p> <p>Afterwards Prada explained that she wanted to use the collection to make a case for glamour as part of daytime dressing. \u201cIt is the quintessential cliche of what is considered femininity - sparkles, fringing, embroidery,\u201d she said, arguing that when toughness and softness are combined, women are their strongest.</p> <p>The catwalk was dominated by a plywood sculpture of Atlas - the titan who in Greek mythology was condemned to hold up for heavens for all eternity. Certainly, Prada has a lot on her plate too. She is a fashion legend - the designer who has launched a thousand global trends - but in recent years the company\u2019s financial performance has not matched its cultural impact.</p> <p>There have also been rumours swirling that Raf Simons - the acclaimed former creative director of Calvin Klein and Dior - might join the Prada group in some capacity which, <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/all-eyes-on-prada-in-milan\">trade publication Business of Fashion reports</a>, Prada has declined to comment on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"956623bdb7ec5a43b829657d754d9e934f7a4729\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/956623bdb7ec5a43b829657d754d9e934f7a4729/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catwalk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Earlier this month Prada <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/style/Prada-racism-City-Commission-on-Human-Rights.html\">reached a settlement with the New York City Commission on Human Rights</a>. The commission had been investigating the brand since 2018, when photographs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/dec/15/prada-new-york-blackface-pradamalia\">a series of figurines which recalled blackface imagery</a>, taken in the front of Prada\u2019s New York store, went viral on social media. Afterwards Prada apologised, withdrew the items and established a diversity council, with members including filmmaker Ava Duvernay.</p> <p>The agreement reached with the New York City Commission goes further, however, insisting all employees are given sensitivity training and requiring the installation of a diversity and inclusion officer to vet all designs \u201cbefore they are sold, advertised or promoted in any way in the United States.\u201d The decision could have ramifications for the industry at large \u2013 the commission is currently in talks with other brands, including Gucci, about similar missteps \u2013 and is a rare example of government intervention in a fashion brand\u2019s practices.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 February 2020 to correct a bearing/baring homophone.</p>",

Her latest show, in Milan on Thursday, deconstructed the trend, however, with a selection of swishy, leg-baring calf-length skirts fashioned from silken tassels and chunky strips of fabric. \u201cBasically the pleated skirt became fringing,\u201d the designer said after her show, \u201cbecause I wanted to use fringe as a symbol.\u201d It was a cracking collection which came with a clear narrative about women and power. Those skirts were combined with severe grey suit jackets, shirts and ties - business at the top, cocktail hour at the bottom. Towards the end of the show the office-appropriate pieces, in grey, camel and black, were remade in tulle or embellished with crystals. Vivid coloured tights - grass green, sky blue and yolk yellow - peeked out as models strode forward. The final looks were silken suits decorated with graphic floral prints. The impression was of an army of corporate drones whose fabulous inner selves were bursting to reveal themselves. In line with the current movement towards longevity in trends it made a subtle departure from the previous season rather than rethinking it. Afterwards Prada explained that she wanted to use the collection to make a case for glamour as part of daytime dressing. \u201cIt is the quintessential cliche of what is considered femininity - sparkles, fringing, embroidery,\u201d she said, arguing that when toughness and softness are combined, women are their strongest. The catwalk was dominated by a plywood sculpture of Atlas - the titan who in Greek mythology was condemned to hold up for heavens for all eternity. Certainly, Prada has a lot on her plate too. She is a fashion legend - the designer who has launched a thousand global trends - but in recent years the company\u2019s financial performance has not matched its cultural impact. There have also been rumours swirling that Raf Simons - the acclaimed former creative director of Calvin Klein and Dior - might join the Prada group in some capacity which, trade publication Business of Fashion reports, Prada has declined to comment on. Earlier this month Prada reached a settlement with the New York City Commission on Human Rights. The commission had been investigating the brand since 2018, when photographs of a series of figurines which recalled blackface imagery, taken in the front of Prada\u2019s New York store, went viral on social media. Afterwards Prada apologised, withdrew the items and established a diversity council, with members including filmmaker Ava Duvernay. The agreement reached with the New York City Commission goes further, however, insisting all employees are given sensitivity training and requiring the installation of a diversity and inclusion officer to vet all designs \u201cbefore they are sold, advertised or promoted in any way in the United States.\u201d The decision could have ramifications for the industry at large \u2013 the commission is currently in talks with other brands, including Gucci, about similar missteps \u2013 and is a rare example of government intervention in a fashion brand\u2019s practices. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 February 2020 to correct a bearing/baring homophone.",

      "bodyText": "The curious ability of the African turquoise killifish to press pause on its development could have intriguing implications for human ageing, say researchers. Certain creatures, including the killifish, can put themselves into suspended animation as an embryo \u2013 a trait known as diapause. The phenomenon is thought to have evolved in response to pressures such as seasonal changes in the environment \u2013 for example ponds drying up \u2013 or sudden challenges that pose a risk to the creatures. In other words, diapause allows the animal to put its development or birth on ice until conditions improve. In the case of the African turquoise killifish, this means that embryos can pause their development for months or even years \u2013 longer than their adult lifetime of about four to six months. Scientists say the trait is likely to be linked to annual droughts. \u201cWe actually don\u2019t think the mechanism of diapause is directly caused by drought,\u201d said Prof Anne Brunet, co-author of the research from Stanford University. \u201cBut the mechanism is indirectly linked to drought in the sense that drought provided a selective pressure for this African turquoise killifish species: over millions of years of evolution, the African killifish evolved to survive drought by having its embryos enter a state of diapause.\u201d While the process is thought to be genetically programmed, quite how it works has been something of a puzzle. Now scientists say they have unpicked the mechanism behind the phenomenon, and have revealed that pausing development as an embryo has no impact on the fish\u2019s future lifespan, fertility or how large they grow as an adult \u2013 suggesting the impact of time on cells and tissues themselves was suspended. \u201cDiapause is a fascinating state of \u2018suspended life\u2019 that can preserve a complex organism long-term, with no apparent tradeoff for subsequent life,\u201d said Brunet. Writing in the journal Science, Brunet and colleagues report how they probed the processes involved in diapause in killifish embryos, revealing the phenomenon involves genes involved in cell proliferation and organ development being dialled down, while the activity of genes linked to muscle maintenance and metabolism is also affected. Part of this seems to be down to increase in the production of a protein called CBX7. In the nucleus, DNA is packaged up by being wrapped around proteins called histones \u2013 CBX7 binds to particular histones. The team say this binding appears to influence the activity of a number of genes, including some involved in muscle function and metabolism, resulting in muscle being maintained throughout diapause. The team say it may be possible to apply these mechanisms to adults. As an accompanying editorial notes, this has previously been tried in a simpler organism \u2013 the roundworm C elegans, whose larvae can undergo diapause \u2013 and been found to extend longevity. \u201cOne can hypothesise that turning on a \u201cdiapause-like\u201d state \u2013 or tapping into the molecular machinery of diapause \u2013 in some adult tissues or cells could help preserve them long-term,\u201d said Brunet. Could this lead to a way to stop ageing in humans? \u201cWe think it\u2019s interesting from a fundamental point of view to understand how the accumulation of the damage due to the passage of time can be stopped or suspended. Diapause offers us a way to understand this,\u201d said Brunet.

Last season the club finished fifth in Serie A, so did not qualify for the Champions League. Others argue that the City decision is so firm, and the sanction so strong, that the credibility of Uefa\u2019s processes, and FFP itself, will be fundamentally damaged if the ruling body does not defend them. Unlike the CFCB, Uefa has constant sporting, commercial and political involvement with the clubs, including City, as Soriano noted. That is why compliance processes are taken out of governing bodies\u2019 core work. Ceferin\u2019s major current concern is the very future of European club football, as top clubs push for an enlarged Champions League against the wishes of leagues, and Fifa seriously advances plans for an expanded Club World Cup. Over the next three or four months it will become clearer whether Uefa sees the City case as a duty which must solemnly be performed, a problem to be managed, or a fudged combination of both. At least Ceferin and his hard-working executives now have some praise from Manchester City to warm them as they consider it.",

      "bodyText": "Scotland Yard has launched an investigation into the attempted murder of a man who was stabbed at a mosque during afternoon prayers before his alleged attacker was wrestled to the ground by worshippers. The mosque\u2019s muazzin, who calls others to prayer, was stabbed in the neck in front of hundreds of horrified onlookers at London Central Mosque in Regent\u2019s Park, in what one witness described as \u201c30 seconds of mayhem\u201d. Online footage showed the alleged perpetrator, a 29-year-old man, being pinned to the ground by police. While one witness claimed that he was a regular at the mosque, another said that he had never seen him before. The Metropolitan police, who arrested the alleged attacker on suspicion of attempted murder, said they were not treating the incident as terror-related. The victim, named locally as Raafat Maglad and said to be around 70 years old, has attended the mosque for 25 years. He was rushed to hospital after being treated by paramedics at the scene. He was \u201cseriously injured\u201d, the mosque said, but his condition was not life-threatening. A Twitter user posted footage of a man wearing jeans and a red top, sitting cross-legged in the mosque, apparently being held in cuffs behind his back by a police officer.

Nurses, lab technicians, engineers and tech experts who currently flock to the UK from the EU may not be able to afford to do so if the prime minister\u2019s proposed immigration overhaul becomes law. At \u00a31,220 per person, or \u00a3900 for those on the shortage occupation list, the fees are among the highest in the world \u2013 and this is before charges for using the NHS and costs for sponsoring employers are taken into account. Comparisons with fee structures in other countries, published by the Institute for Government (IfG) thinktank, show that a family of five with a five-year work visa for one individual would have to pay \u00a321,299 before they could enter in the country. This includes the annual \u00a3400 health surcharge that must also be paid upfront per person. This is double the fee charged by Australia and about 30 times the amount charged by Canada, where it costs just over \u00a310,000 for a family for five years.

Apart from wreaking havoc on those industries dependent on unskilled immigrants, it will impose an additional burden on that most dysfunctional of ministries, the Home Office. If they cannot manage the current immigration system, how will they deal with thousands more visa applications to the UK? Is the government really prepared to create the huge new bureaucratic machine to manage the new immigration scheme it proposes? This government has yet to demonstrate that it can introduce and manage the universal credit system, so the possibility of it successfully introducing a new scheme to manage the movement of hundreds of thousands of workers seems unlikely. Derrick Joad Leeds \u2022 In his analysis of the government\u2019s new points-based system, Larry Elliott says that \u201cworkers from overseas will be welcomed provided they can clear the high bar set for them by the new immigration rules\u201d (Taking back control is not the same as pulling up the drawbridge, 19 February). This is not how the system will work in reality. My experience of recruiting highly qualified people from non-EU countries under the current system leads me to fear that the new system will be as off-putting as the current one is: all overseas applicants will have to join a queue, and processing applications will be so slow that those in the pipeline will be tempted to look elsewhere. I am not at all confident that the government will put in place an efficient application-processing operation when implementing the new points-based immigration system. While the UK was a member of the EU, it was at least possible to recruit highly talented non-UK staff relatively straightforwardly from countries on our doorstep, and the UK benefited hugely as a result. Now that those happy days are behind us, employers can expect bureaucratic inefficiency to cause recruitment delays in appointing all overseas talent, and this will in many cases mean that those recruited will not take up their posts because of the sheer frustration involved in waiting for a decision. David Head Peterborough \u2022 While Labour are right to condemn the Tories\u2019 actions on immigration, it was their shortsightedness that allowed the Brexit debate to take us down this dead end. They allowed our biased press to blame immigration and the EU for the problems of millions of British people, rather than pointing out that most of the discontent came from years of Tory austerity policies. This allowed Boris Johnson and his rightwing supporters to take us to where we are now: Brexit, and an awful government creating an increasingly hostile environment to \u201coutsiders\u201d. I wonder who they will turn on when Brexit bites? David Reed London \u2022 It\u2019s nonsense to assert, as Maya Goodfellow does, that requiring language competency for immigrants is racist and xenophobic (There\u2019s nothing \u2018sensible\u2019 about Priti Patel\u2019s heartless immigration proposal, 19 February). Here in Canada, the ability to speak one of our official languages is a requirement universally accepted in this immigration-friendly country. The lack of such rules results in ghettoes and a disadvantaged underclass. David Moores Oakville, Ontario, Canada \u2022 Priti Patel suggests the 8 million \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d people could enter the jobs market to make up for labour shortages. There was I busily consuming and paying tax in retirement, and all the time I was economically inactive. Who knew? Martyn Taylor Newark, Nottinghamshire \u2022 As an economically inactive pensioner being treated for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, I eagerly await my call-up letter from Priti Patel to work in the fields cutting broccoli, or perhaps in a strawberry farm in sunlit polytunnels. Angela Boyd Wellington, Somerset \u2022 Are domestic marmalade makers considered to be economically active or inactive? (Letters, 20 February).

It seemed like every time I opened the app over the last 72 hours I encountered a flawless face with the cold stare of a Siberian husky \u2013 albeit one wearing fairly intense false eyelashes. The faces would pout and pose for a second, and then the filter would disappear, leaving the user howling with laughter over the contrast between their glamorous virtual visage and their real self. But yesterday, something about the Lil Icey Eyes filter was suddenly different. Why? Originally popularized by Snapchat, most of us first encountered face filters (or \u201cselfie lenses\u201d) as goofy effects and animations layered over our digital image to make us look like we were barfing rainbows or sticking our long puppy dog tongues out at our front-facing cameras. Two years ago, Snapchat began allowing users to create their own filters; Instagram followed suite last August. As a result of these platform expansions, creativity is flourishing; some filters double as mini-games, or artistic creations that turn you into an iridescent cyborg queen.

The state-owned energy company, Orano, gets a large proportion of its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-39744861\" title=\"\">uranium from Niger</a>. Total has oil fields in Mali. The French have a military base in Chad (when Macron visited in 2018, he brought enough <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20181222-macron-takes-champagne-fois-gras-french-soldiers-chad\" title=\"\">champagne for 1,300 troops</a>). Despite years of fighting, the insecurity and attacks on civilians continue. Four thousand deaths <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/envoy-devastating-surge-attacks-sahel-west-africa-200109011431355.html\" title=\"\">were reported</a> last year alone.</p> <p>Sahelian public resistance to the French military presence is a problem for Macron\u2019s government. He is under rising pressure at home because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/26/helicopter-accident-french-troops-mali\" title=\"\">recent French </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/26/helicopter-accident-french-troops-mali\" title=\"\">casualties</a> in the region. As a result, the presidents of Sahel countries came under orders from Macron to sort out anti-French sentiment. Speaking after the Nato summit in London last December, Macron put on a stern, somewhat exasperated tone. \u201cDo they want us to be there? Do they need us?\u201d he asked. To get an answer, Macron <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/france-macron-g5-sahel-presidents-set-meet-pau-200113055206729.html\" title=\"\">called a summit</a> in early January in Pau, a town in the south-west of France. On Burkinab\u00e8 television, the president of Burkina Faso, Roch Marc Kabor\u00e9, criticised the tone of this \u201csummons\u201d. Nevertheless, he later joined the presidents of Niger, Mali, Mauritania and Chad in releasing a joint statement confirming that, yes, they wanted France to stay.</p> <p>In making French military presence apparently conditional on a public show of allegiance, Macron wants to be seen as committed to democratic process in Africa. Famously, at a landmark <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20171128-france-macron-burkina-faso-tour-africa\" title=\"\">speech at the University of Ouagadougou</a> in 2017, he described himself as a president from the generation for whom \u201cthe crimes of colonisation are indisputable\u201d. He wasn\u2019t one to tell African countries what to do. And sure enough, here he is in 2020 asking African presidents what they want. But threatening foreign presidents to quell public debate and dissent at home is an autocratic gesture.</p> <p>Members of the public have responded: \u201cWe are acting legally and democratically to express our disagreement against France\u2019s policy,\u201d said one organiser in Mali, denying that protesters were to be treated as rebels or disturbers of the peace. \u201cWe need to free ourselves from this,\u201d said Valsero.</p> <p>It is no surprise that some pushback \u2013 albeit fleeting, and only directed at a domestic audience \u2013 came from Burkina Faso. Kabor\u00e9 is facing elections later this year, in a country where in 2014, after 27 years in power, popular struggle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/31/burkina-faso-president-blaise-compaore-ousted-says-army\" title=\"\">dislodged Blaise Compaor\u00e9</a>, a staunch ally of the US and France. Kabor\u00e9 is not in a position to completely ignore his electorate, even if the French president tells him to.</p> <p>In Niger, President Mahamadou Issoufou played down the significance of those protesting against the French military in his country. \u201cThose demonstrating in the street are a tiny minority,\u201d he said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwSde-drlSc\" title=\"\">in an interview</a> in December last year. This insouciance was at odds with his authorities\u2019 prohibition of a protest in the Niger capital, Niamey, the week before. The French have supported Issoufou and in turn he gives the French army free rein. French drones take off from Niamey to monitor Islamist movements in the Sahel.</p> <p>Last February, <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2019/02/07/french-fighter-jets-bomb-chadian-rebels-in-support-of-deby-s-regime\" title=\"\">French forces attacked</a> soldiers opposed to the Chad president, Idriss D\u00e9by. As the political scientist Marielle Debos has <a href=\"https://www.liberation.fr/debats/2019/02/08/que-fait-l-armee-francaise-au-tchad_1708150\" title=\"\">pointed out</a>, these soldiers were no cuddly democrats, but bombing the regime\u2019s opponents falls squarely outside the stated objectives of Operation Barkhane. It seemed to serve only to shore up the position of D\u00e9by, who himself took power by force in 1990 with French support. Seen this way, the presence of French soldiers in the Sahel has more to do with securing French interests than about achieving security for the general public.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/08/emmanuel-macron-pilloried-home-abroad-europe-best-hope\">Emmanuel Macron, pilloried at home and abroad,  is Europe\u2019s best hope</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is also a relationship between foreign policy and what\u2019s going on in mainland France. In Bamako in January, demonstrators calling for French troops to leave burned a French flag, and a man on a loudspeaker called for the abolition of the camps in Calais. In France, members of the Chad diaspora campaigning against French interference have been involved in organising with the \u201c<em>gilets </em><em>noirs</em>\u201d, a movement mobilising against the exploitation of the undocumented migrants on which the French economy depends. At the Pau summit, a collective associated with the <em>gilets </em><em>noirs</em>, La Chapelle Debout, called a protest against the theatrics of Macron\u2019s summit: \u201cWe demand the departure of French troops,\u201d one member wrote. \u201cColonisation is over.\u201d</p> <p>The <em>gilets </em><em>noirs</em> have been explicit about the connections between exploitation at home and French presence abroad. Seen through this optic, the instability in the Sahel is not a hermetic issue confined to the region. It is a part of a story of inequality across the international divisions of labour that western states and companies help produce.</p> <p>\u2022 Alexandra Reza is a junior research fellow in French at Trinity College, Oxford</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 February 2020.

Nevertheless, he later joined the presidents of Niger, Mali, Mauritania and Chad in releasing a joint statement confirming that, yes, they wanted France to stay. In making French military presence apparently conditional on a public show of allegiance, Macron wants to be seen as committed to democratic process in Africa. Famously, at a landmark speech at the University of Ouagadougou in 2017, he described himself as a president from the generation for whom \u201cthe crimes of colonisation are indisputable\u201d. He wasn\u2019t one to tell African countries what to do. And sure enough, here he is in 2020 asking African presidents what they want. But threatening foreign presidents to quell public debate and dissent at home is an autocratic gesture. Members of the public have responded: \u201cWe are acting legally and democratically to express our disagreement against France\u2019s policy,\u201d said one organiser in Mali, denying that protesters were to be treated as rebels or disturbers of the peace. \u201cWe need to free ourselves from this,\u201d said Valsero. It is no surprise that some pushback \u2013 albeit fleeting, and only directed at a domestic audience \u2013 came from Burkina Faso. Kabor\u00e9 is facing elections later this year, in a country where in 2014, after 27 years in power, popular struggle dislodged Blaise Compaor\u00e9, a staunch ally of the US and France. Kabor\u00e9 is not in a position to completely ignore his electorate, even if the French president tells him to. In Niger, President Mahamadou Issoufou played down the significance of those protesting against the French military in his country. \u201cThose demonstrating in the street are a tiny minority,\u201d he said in an interview in December last year. This insouciance was at odds with his authorities\u2019 prohibition of a protest in the Niger capital, Niamey, the week before. The French have supported Issoufou and in turn he gives the French army free rein. French drones take off from Niamey to monitor Islamist movements in the Sahel. Last February, French forces attacked soldiers opposed to the Chad president, Idriss D\u00e9by. As the political scientist Marielle Debos has pointed out, these soldiers were no cuddly democrats, but bombing the regime\u2019s opponents falls squarely outside the stated objectives of Operation Barkhane. It seemed to serve only to shore up the position of D\u00e9by, who himself took power by force in 1990 with French support. Seen this way, the presence of French soldiers in the Sahel has more to do with securing French interests than about achieving security for the general public. There is also a relationship between foreign policy and what\u2019s going on in mainland France. In Bamako in January, demonstrators calling for French troops to leave burned a French flag, and a man on a loudspeaker called for the abolition of the camps in Calais. In France, members of the Chad diaspora campaigning against French interference have been involved in organising with the \u201cgilets noirs\u201d, a movement mobilising against the exploitation of the undocumented migrants on which the French economy depends. At the Pau summit, a collective associated with the gilets noirs, La Chapelle Debout, called a protest against the theatrics of Macron\u2019s summit: \u201cWe demand the departure of French troops,\u201d one member wrote. \u201cColonisation is over.\u201d The gilets noirs have been explicit about the connections between exploitation at home and French presence abroad. Seen through this optic, the instability in the Sahel is not a hermetic issue confined to the region. It is a part of a story of inequality across the international divisions of labour that western states and companies help produce. \u2022 Alexandra Reza is a junior research fellow in French at Trinity College, Oxford \u2022 This article was amended on 25 February 2020.

      "bodyText": "Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg\u2019s gun control group is planning to spend at least $8m in Texas to elect state and federal politicians who support what it calls \u201cgun sense\u201d laws, including requiring background checks before all gun sales. Last year, Everytown for Gun Safety poured at least $2.5m into state races in Virginia, backing candidates who supported tougher gun laws and helping to elect a Democratic state house majority for the first time in 26 years. Now, it is pledging to use the same tactics in Texas, one of the most gun-friendly states in the nation. Overall, Everytown, the nation\u2019s largest gun control group, has pledged to spend at least $60m on 2020 races across the country, as Bloomberg, the group\u2019s founder and major donor, pours hundreds of millions of dollars into his own presidential campaign. Even in the wake of multiple mass shootings, Texas\u2019s Republican-controlled state government has continued to pass pro-gun laws. The day after a mass shooting in Odessa last fall left seven people dead, multiple recently passed Texas gun laws went into effect \u2013 all of them loosening existing restrictions on guns. In 2016, state lawmakers approved a \u201ccampus carry\u201d bill that allows licensed gun owners over age 21 to carry concealed handguns in public university classrooms, as well as in dormitories and elsewhere across campus. Four of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern US history, going back to 1966, happened in Texas, including a domestic violence-linked shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs in 2017, and a white nationalist attack targeting Mexican American families at a Walmart in El Paso last summer. Gun rights supporters in Texas are already preparing for a political battle. \u201cThe Texas State Rifle Association will continue fighting to ensure that Bloomberg doesn\u2019t buy Texas the way he\u2019s trying to buy the Democratic nomination for president,\u201d said Mike Cox, the lobbyist and legislative director for the state affiliate of the National Rifle Association (NRA). Cox said he is also keeping a wary eye on Virginia, where the state\u2019s new Democratic majority has made passing stricter control laws at top legislative priority, sparking massive protests from pro-gun activists. Everytown has proudly touted being the largest outside spender in the Virginia election. The Texas gun rights group has already sent \u201cthe alarm and alert to all of our members on the risk we face from this narcissistic billionaire\u201d, and plans to work closely with other gun rights groups across the state, Cox said. But, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s real hard to compete with that much money.\u201d Everytown\u2019s announced goal for 2020 includes focusing on more than two dozen Texas state house races, most of them in the Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan areas, as well as boosting several Democratic members of Congress facing tough election or re-election campaigns, including Lizzie Fletcher and Colin Allred. It will need to flip nine seats in the state house of representatives to achieve what it calls a \u201cgun sense\u201d majority, the group said in a call with reporters on Wednesday. Everytown\u2019s own polling indicates that a majority of likely voters in Texas own guns, but that some gun owners support some additional gun control measures. \u201cThe state is becoming younger and increasingly diverse, and after years of failure by lawmakers to address gun violence, gun safety has become a top issue for voters, especially in the suburbs,\u201d said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a group that is part of Everytown for Gun Safety. Everytown does endorse and donate to Republican politicians who support gun control laws, but in practice, most candidates the group supports are Democrats. In Texas in the 2018 midterm elections, all of the candidates who earned the group\u2019s backing were Democrats, an Everytown spokesperson said. Alongside Everytown\u2019s political donations, Moms Demand Action volunteers will be doing grassroots campaign organizing across the state in 2020. Everytown, Moms Demand Action and Students Demand Action, a youth group, claim 400,000 supporters across Texas who have volunteered or signed up for an online group or email list. The way that Bloomberg\u2019s massive political and philanthropic donations have helped him maintain political support has become a major area of scrutiny as the former New York City mayor has risen in the polls within the Democratic primary race. \u201cWe\u2019re an independent organization, totally separate from Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s campaign,\u201d Watts said in a call with reporters on Wednesday. Bloomberg currently provides \u201cbetween one-quarter and one-third\u201d of Everytown\u2019s funding, depending on the cycle, and the group had more than 375,000 total donors last year, she said.",

This year\u2019s 260 trails will go ahead, however.</p> <p>A Cadbury spokesperson said: \u201cFor the last 13 years, Cadbury has enjoyed a wonderful partnership with the National Trust and the successful Easter egg trails. This year\u2019s Easter egg trails will go ahead as planned, but Cadbury and the National Trust have come to a mutual decision that this year the partnership will draw to a close.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to thank the National Trust for their partnership over this period, which has \u2026 encouraged millions of people to enjoy the outdoors.\u201d</p> <p>However the controversial tie-up has been criticised by children\u2019s health campaigners concerned about youngsters growing up in a marketing environment that constantly nudges them towards snacks and treats.</p> <p>Last year members of the National Trust <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/20/women-took-on-national-trust-over-cadbury-sponsorship-deal\">called for the ending of the partnership</a>, citing concerns about use of unsustainable palm oil in chocolate \u2013 claims strongly denied by Cadbury. Their motion did not pass at the time, but was supported by thousands of members.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the National Trust said: \u201cWhile this year\u2019s Easter with Cadbury will go ahead as planned, we have both agreed this will be our last with the company. Now is the time for change as we look to increase our emphasis on nature and the outdoors. To reflect that in our Easter activities, from next year we will be making chocolate less of a focus. For this reason, it is is the right time for us to end a partnership associated so uniquely with chocolate.\u201d</p> <p>Barbara Crowther, co-ordinator of <a href=\"https://www.sustainweb.org/news/feb20_ntcadbury/\">the Children\u2019s Food Campaign</a>, said: \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased to hear that the National Trust wants to make chocolate less of a focus for its Easter. We can imagine so many healthy, fun and active ways for children to explore National Trust properties at Easter that don\u2019t involve lots of sugary treats.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017 the National Trust was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/04/theresa-may-condemns-national-trust-for-axing-easter-from-egg-hunt\">strongly criticised when it dropped the word \u201cEaster\u201d</a> from its Cadbury-branded egg hunts, with Jeremy Corbyn saying \u201ccommercialism had gone too far\u201d, and then prime minister Theresa May branding it \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The National Trust and Cadbury have agreed to end their 13-year partnership involving the chocolate maker\u2019s sponsorship of the trust\u2019s annual Easter egg hunts, following increasing pressure from health and environmental campaigners. The high-profile \u00a37m deal led to Cadbury organising branded Easter egg hunts for children and families at the conservation charity\u2019s numerous heritage properties across the the UK, with the contract due for renewal next year. But the National Trust said in a statement it had decided to end \u201ca partnership associated so uniquely with chocolate\u201d as it seeks to increase its focus on nature and the outdoors, while Cadbury\u2019s decision was made as part of a strategic review into its marketing activities. This year\u2019s 260 trails will go ahead, however. A Cadbury spokesperson said: \u201cFor the last 13 years, Cadbury has enjoyed a wonderful partnership with the National Trust and the successful Easter egg trails. This year\u2019s Easter egg trails will go ahead as planned, but Cadbury and the National Trust have come to a mutual decision that this year the partnership will draw to a close. \u201cWe\u2019d like to thank the National Trust for their partnership over this period, which has \u2026 encouraged millions of people to enjoy the outdoors.\u201d However the controversial tie-up has been criticised by children\u2019s health campaigners concerned about youngsters growing up in a marketing environment that constantly nudges them towards snacks and treats. Last year members of the National Trust called for the ending of the partnership, citing concerns about use of unsustainable palm oil in chocolate \u2013 claims strongly denied by Cadbury. Their motion did not pass at the time, but was supported by thousands of members. A spokesperson for the National Trust said: \u201cWhile this year\u2019s Easter with Cadbury will go ahead as planned, we have both agreed this will be our last with the company. Now is the time for change as we look to increase our emphasis on nature and the outdoors. To reflect that in our Easter activities, from next year we will be making chocolate less of a focus. For this reason, it is is the right time for us to end a partnership associated so uniquely with chocolate.\u201d Barbara Crowther, co-ordinator of the Children\u2019s Food Campaign, said: \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased to hear that the National Trust wants to make chocolate less of a focus for its Easter. We can imagine so many healthy, fun and active ways for children to explore National Trust properties at Easter that don\u2019t involve lots of sugary treats.\u201d In 2017 the National Trust was strongly criticised when it dropped the word \u201cEaster\u201d from its Cadbury-branded egg hunts, with Jeremy Corbyn saying \u201ccommercialism had gone too far\u201d, and then prime minister Theresa May branding it \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d. The trust later reinstated the word in its branding.",

      "body": "<p>To stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis \u2013 already being felt in the form of extreme weather, fires and floods \u2013 we have only about a decade to cause greenhouse gas emissions to peak and then fall rapidly. That we know this is largely thanks to one global organisation, a loose collection of hundreds of academics around the world that has amassed our knowledge of the climate for more than 30 years.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/about/\" title=\"\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>, convened in 1988 by the UN and the World Meteorological Organization, is made up of the world\u2019s leading experts on climate science, who draw on thousands of academic papers to prepare comprehensive assessment reports about every five to seven years. Those reports are the gold standard, representing the summation of our knowledge of how the climate system works, and how we are affecting it.</p> <p>Rajendra Kumar Pachauri, who has died aged 79, served as the chairman of the IPCC from 2002 to 2015, a crucial period during which he oversaw its world-changing warnings and Nobel-winning acclaim, but which also brought humbling disaster for the organisation and for him personally.</p> <p>Few scientists were explicitly trained or practising in what was then an emerging discipline, and Pachauri was originally an engineer. Born in Nainital in India, he was educated at La Martini\u00e8re College, Lucknow, and the Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical Engineering, before beginning his career with Indian Railways. He took higher engineering degrees in the US, and embarked on a variety of academic, public policy and business-related positions in the US and India, including a visiting fellowship at the World Bank and advisory work for the UN Development Programme.</p> <p>But it was his election as chairman of the IPCC in 2002 that marked a turning point. Climate science was in difficulty, and the prospect of climate action seemed to have stalled, as the early impetus that gave rise to the IPCC, then the first global treaty on the climate, the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and eventually the 1997 Kyoto protocol, had run into powerful vested political and business interests. The US Congress had failed to ratify Kyoto, while the White House, under George W Bush, had taken climate off the agenda. Progress seemed far off.</p> <p>The task for Pachauri \u2013 known as Patchy \u2013 was to reinvigorate the IPCC\u2019s work, setting out the path to a comprehensive study that would become the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/02/greenpolitics.ipcc\" title=\"\">Fourth Assessment Report in 2007</a>. Its hard-hitting conclusions \u2013 that it was 90% certain that humanity was causing climate change, and that carbon emissions must start to fall within about 15 years to prevent catastrophic and irreversible effects \u2013 were instrumental in leading the UN to embark on a process that would eventually culminate in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\" title=\"\">Paris agreement of 2015</a>.</p> <p>In recognition of this work, the IPCC was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/12/climatechange.internationalnews\" title=\"\">awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2007</a>, jointly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/algore\" title=\"\">Al Gore</a>.</p> <p>Pachauri had the diplomatic skills, organisational experience and profile to bring the IPCC together: a tricky role, because the organisation had to retain its clear scientific and political independence while providing uncomfortable advice to policymakers. But what struck next appeared to blindside him utterly. Shortly before a crunch UN conference in Copenhagen in 2009, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/hacked-climate-science-emails\" title=\"\">hackers released a series of emails</a> among climate scientists that allegedly revealed them conspiring to give a misleading impression of some data. The scientists were embroiled in a damaging row, but worse was to come for the IPCC.</p> <p>In early 2010, a trickle of findings emerged of mistakes in the landmark Fourth Assessment Report. Most were minor, but the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/20/ipcc-himalayan-glaciers-mistake\" title=\"\">damaging claim</a> was one that Himalayan glaciers could melt away by 2035, later found to be wrong and poorly sourced. The IPCC responded slowly and, many felt, inadequately. At the time, the organisation had little in the way of a permanent administrative infrastructure, and seemed to have no institutional procedure to answer the charges.</p> <p>Eventually, Pachauri enabled changes in the IPCC\u2019s operations to tighten the review process, rule out some forms of data, and strengthen checks on all the material included. These changes were controversial too \u2013 some scientists regard the IPCC as too slow, because full assessment reports take nearly a decade to complete, and far too conservative, leaving out newer research and ignoring the potentially disastrous impacts of \u201ctipping points\u201d in the climate system.</p> <p>There were rumblings after the \u201cclimategate\u201d scandal that a new chairman was needed, someone fresh who could move on from the mistakes, but it was a personal issue that ended Pachauri\u2019s career. In 2015, a woman he worked with at the Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in New Delhi accused him of stalking, sexual harassment and intimidation, in text messages, emails and WhatsApp groups. He denied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/15/former-ipcc-chief-rajendra-pachauri-to-stand-trial-on-sexual-harassment-charges\" title=\"\">the charges</a>. Soon after, he resigned his IPCC role and from TERI, and largely retired from public life.</p> <p>Pachauri also helped to lead the emergence of India as a force in global scientific research. Independently of his IPCC role, he served as chairman and director general of TERI, having joined the organisation in 1982. Established in 1974 as a small research centre focusing on energy and natural resources by the industrialist JRD Tata, TERI has grown to more than 1,200 employees across India, with outposts in Africa, Japan, Europe and the US.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Saroj Puri, and by a son and two daughters.</p> <p>\u2022 Rajendra Kumar Pachauri, engineer and climate scientist, born 20 August 1940; died 13 February 2020</p>",

      "bodyText": "To stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis \u2013 already being felt in the form of extreme weather, fires and floods \u2013 we have only about a decade to cause greenhouse gas emissions to peak and then fall rapidly. That we know this is largely thanks to one global organisation, a loose collection of hundreds of academics around the world that has amassed our knowledge of the climate for more than 30 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, convened in 1988 by the UN and the World Meteorological Organization, is made up of the world\u2019s leading experts on climate science, who draw on thousands of academic papers to prepare comprehensive assessment reports about every five to seven years. Those reports are the gold standard, representing the summation of our knowledge of how the climate system works, and how we are affecting it. Rajendra Kumar Pachauri, who has died aged 79, served as the chairman of the IPCC from 2002 to 2015, a crucial period during which he oversaw its world-changing warnings and Nobel-winning acclaim, but which also brought humbling disaster for the organisation and for him personally. Few scientists were explicitly trained or practising in what was then an emerging discipline, and Pachauri was originally an engineer. Born in Nainital in India, he was educated at La Martini\u00e8re College, Lucknow, and the Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical Engineering, before beginning his career with Indian Railways. He took higher engineering degrees in the US, and embarked on a variety of academic, public policy and business-related positions in the US and India, including a visiting fellowship at the World Bank and advisory work for the UN Development Programme. But it was his election as chairman of the IPCC in 2002 that marked a turning point. Climate science was in difficulty, and the prospect of climate action seemed to have stalled, as the early impetus that gave rise to the IPCC, then the first global treaty on the climate, the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and eventually the 1997 Kyoto protocol, had run into powerful vested political and business interests. The US Congress had failed to ratify Kyoto, while the White House, under George W Bush, had taken climate off the agenda. Progress seemed far off. The task for Pachauri \u2013 known as Patchy \u2013 was to reinvigorate the IPCC\u2019s work, setting out the path to a comprehensive study that would become the Fourth Assessment Report in 2007. Its hard-hitting conclusions \u2013 that it was 90% certain that humanity was causing climate change, and that carbon emissions must start to fall within about 15 years to prevent catastrophic and irreversible effects \u2013 were instrumental in leading the UN to embark on a process that would eventually culminate in the Paris agreement of 2015. In recognition of this work, the IPCC was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2007, jointly with Al Gore. Pachauri had the diplomatic skills, organisational experience and profile to bring the IPCC together: a tricky role, because the organisation had to retain its clear scientific and political independence while providing uncomfortable advice to policymakers. But what struck next appeared to blindside him utterly. Shortly before a crunch UN conference in Copenhagen in 2009, hackers released a series of emails among climate scientists that allegedly revealed them conspiring to give a misleading impression of some data. The scientists were embroiled in a damaging row, but worse was to come for the IPCC. In early 2010, a trickle of findings emerged of mistakes in the landmark Fourth Assessment Report. Most were minor, but the most damaging claim was one that Himalayan glaciers could melt away by 2035, later found to be wrong and poorly sourced. The IPCC responded slowly and, many felt, inadequately. At the time, the organisation had little in the way of a permanent administrative infrastructure, and seemed to have no institutional procedure to answer the charges. Eventually, Pachauri enabled changes in the IPCC\u2019s operations to tighten the review process, rule out some forms of data, and strengthen checks on all the material included. These changes were controversial too \u2013 some scientists regard the IPCC as too slow, because full assessment reports take nearly a decade to complete, and far too conservative, leaving out newer research and ignoring the potentially disastrous impacts of \u201ctipping points\u201d in the climate system. There were rumblings after the \u201cclimategate\u201d scandal that a new chairman was needed, someone fresh who could move on from the mistakes, but it was a personal issue that ended Pachauri\u2019s career. In 2015, a woman he worked with at the Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in New Delhi accused him of stalking, sexual harassment and intimidation, in text messages, emails and WhatsApp groups. He denied the charges. Soon after, he resigned his IPCC role and from TERI, and largely retired from public life. Pachauri also helped to lead the emergence of India as a force in global scientific research. Independently of his IPCC role, he served as chairman and director general of TERI, having joined the organisation in 1982. Established in 1974 as a small research centre focusing on energy and natural resources by the industrialist JRD Tata, TERI has grown to more than 1,200 employees across India, with outposts in Africa, Japan, Europe and the US. He is survived by his wife, Saroj Puri, and by a son and two daughters. \u2022 Rajendra Kumar Pachauri, engineer and climate scientist, born 20 August 1940; died 13 February 2020",

Whoever buys its care business, if anyone, will have to attract private families and milk them to cover the loss-making state-paid customers. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that, we have no expertise in marketing to the private sector,\u201d says Long. What councils pay companies varies widely, between \u00a311 and \u00a322 an hour, mostly the lower end. Staff are not paid travelling time: \u201cRushing from job to job, paid by the minute. <a href=\"https://www.independentliving.co.uk/industry-news/end-15-minute-care-visits/\" title=\"\">Councils still commission 15-minute visits</a>, against Nice guidelines.

He\u2019s not surprised they have a 40% staff turnover: similar work in the NHS pays more. Working in supermarkets pays more, without the emotional stress. \u201cMy son is an A&amp;E doctor and he sees where these old people end up. That needn\u2019t happen if they were cared for at home by people paid a salary for a fixed eight-hour shift, dedicated and permanent.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s the shocking circularity in the government\u2019s position: caring will not qualify as sufficiently skilled to earn a visa, but all that brands this delicate work as \u201cunskilled\u201d is the appalling low pay. Rates for the job are only so low because the government, through local authorities, refuses to pay a fair or even a market rate for the job. The result is market failure, as the care sector collapses. In truth, however, it isn\u2019t a market at all. Care services were outsourced by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s to cut costs by allowing private companies to pay below public sector rates. But in the end, it was still the state paying for most of it: underpay, and people refuse to take the jobs.</p> <p>I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jan/15/bookextracts.socialexclusion\" title=\"\">worked in a care home</a> a few years ago, and it was by far the most skilled and difficult job I did in researching my book, Hard Work. Try looking after six frail, incontinent old people, feeding, washing, hoisting them in and out of baths, and above all talking to them as you are their only company. Six patients is lucky: staff vacancies often meant eight people to care for, backbreaking and heartbreaking. The care workers I worked with were run off their feet all day, and yet eager to be kind and patient. When I talk to staff now about working conditions, their first complaint is never for themselves, always it\u2019s their distress at not having time to care enough. What counts as a \u201cskill\u201d if not empathy?</p> <p>The quality of care is crumbling: last month I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/09/boris-johnson-tories-social-care-sajid-javid\" title=\"\">Garside House care home</a>, recently rated \u201cinadequate\u201d, plunged into special measures and under police investigation, right on Westminster\u2019s doorstep.

But how? The NHS is neat, with one employer, but social care has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/07/nhs-nurses-social-care\" title=\"\">18,500 separate employers</a> and companies, as well as the 75,000 disabled people paying independently for personal assistants. Will there be a national rate and quality standard for every council and every company? As for funding it, Anita Charlesworth, the research and economics director of the Health Foundation, says it would cost \u00a310bn to return social care just to the 2010 level of care. That should be a top priority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/20/conservatives-immigration-plan-ideology-economics-low-wages\">The Conservatives\u2019 immigration plan puts ideology before economics | Tom Kibasi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Johnson\u2019s even more expensive care promise was to stop anyone needing to sell their home to pay for care \u2013 too afraid of the accusations of a death tax that plagued Theresa May\u2019s plans from the 2017 Conservative manifesto which suggested that people may need to fund care by selling their homes after they\u2019ve died. A mooted cap of \u00a325,000 as the maximum anyone need pay, with the state picking up the bill thereafter, would cost another \u00a34bn. That wouldn\u2019t add a penny more for care, but just protect home-owning families\u2019 inheritances.</p> <p>The budget on 11 March will reveal Johnson\u2019s true political priorities. Where, if anywhere, does social care come in his pecking order? And which comes first \u2013 restoring the quality and quantity of care for all, or ensuring homeowners\u2019 families keep their inheritances?

      "bodyText": "Another one bites the dust. The fourth biggest provider of home care for the frail, the Mears Group, with 30 branches in the UK, is abandoning its domiciliary care services. \u201cWe\u2019re not the first and certainly won\u2019t be the last,\u201d says Alan Long, the executive director. Social care is collapsing because too few people are willing to work gruelling hours in disgraceful conditions for pitiful pay. The new points-based immigration system announced by the home secretary, Priti Patel, on Wednesday will see many more companies fleeing the sector for lack of staff. With 122,000 vacancies, this decade\u2019s 25% increase in people over 65 means another 580,000 staff will be needed to care for them over the next 15 years. In London, 40% of care staff are from overseas. Median average pay as of last March is a meagre \u00a38.10 an hour, with parts of their hours unpaid: a quarter of staff are on zero-hours contracts. Mears only takes public sector contracts from local authorities: it has no private clients. Whoever buys its care business, if anyone, will have to attract private families and milk them to cover the loss-making state-paid customers. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that, we have no expertise in marketing to the private sector,\u201d says Long. What councils pay companies varies widely, between \u00a311 and \u00a322 an hour, mostly the lower end. Staff are not paid travelling time: \u201cRushing from job to job, paid by the minute. Councils still commission 15-minute visits, against Nice guidelines. Staff stop in car parks to write up notes, unpaid for that.\u201d Long says they need 25% more just to cover travel time. Half of those who used to get care in 2010 no longer qualify, so staff only deal with \u201cthe gravest cases\u201d, says Long, who deserve far longer visits. He\u2019s not surprised they have a 40% staff turnover: similar work in the NHS pays more. Working in supermarkets pays more, without the emotional stress. \u201cMy son is an A&amp;E doctor and he sees where these old people end up. That needn\u2019t happen if they were cared for at home by people paid a salary for a fixed eight-hour shift, dedicated and permanent.\u201d Here\u2019s the shocking circularity in the government\u2019s position: caring will not qualify as sufficiently skilled to earn a visa, but all that brands this delicate work as \u201cunskilled\u201d is the appalling low pay. Rates for the job are only so low because the government, through local authorities, refuses to pay a fair or even a market rate for the job. The result is market failure, as the care sector collapses. In truth, however, it isn\u2019t a market at all. Care services were outsourced by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s to cut costs by allowing private companies to pay below public sector rates. But in the end, it was still the state paying for most of it: underpay, and people refuse to take the jobs. I worked in a care home a few years ago, and it was by far the most skilled and difficult job I did in researching my book, Hard Work. Try looking after six frail, incontinent old people, feeding, washing, hoisting them in and out of baths, and above all talking to them as you are their only company. Six patients is lucky: staff vacancies often meant eight people to care for, backbreaking and heartbreaking. The care workers I worked with were run off their feet all day, and yet eager to be kind and patient. When I talk to staff now about working conditions, their first complaint is never for themselves, always it\u2019s their distress at not having time to care enough. What counts as a \u201cskill\u201d if not empathy? The quality of care is crumbling: last month I wrote about Garside House care home, recently rated \u201cinadequate\u201d, plunged into special measures and under police investigation, right on Westminster\u2019s doorstep. Homes are closing every week, 101 shut in 2018. This week Derby City Council sold off three care homes, unable to raise the money for necessary improvements. No 10 claims to be beavering away on Boris Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201cfix social care once and for all\u201d. But how? The NHS is neat, with one employer, but social care has 18,500 separate employers and companies, as well as the 75,000 disabled people paying independently for personal assistants. Will there be a national rate and quality standard for every council and every company? As for funding it, Anita Charlesworth, the research and economics director of the Health Foundation, says it would cost \u00a310bn to return social care just to the 2010 level of care. That should be a top priority. But Johnson\u2019s even more expensive care promise was to stop anyone needing to sell their home to pay for care \u2013 too afraid of the accusations of a death tax that plagued Theresa May\u2019s plans from the 2017 Conservative manifesto which suggested that people may need to fund care by selling their homes after they\u2019ve died. A mooted cap of \u00a325,000 as the maximum anyone need pay, with the state picking up the bill thereafter, would cost another \u00a34bn. That wouldn\u2019t add a penny more for care, but just protect home-owning families\u2019 inheritances. The budget on 11 March will reveal Johnson\u2019s true political priorities. Where, if anywhere, does social care come in his pecking order? And which comes first \u2013 restoring the quality and quantity of care for all, or ensuring homeowners\u2019 families keep their inheritances? The auguries are not good, because one thing we know already: he has put the politics of immigration before the urgent need to employ more care workers for millions of the frail. If there is to be no more cheap foreign labour, he will need to raise pay steeply to attract enough British staff. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The gunman who killed nine people in the town of Hanau out of apparent hatred of minorities and turned his weapon on his own mother and then himself has been identified in German media as Tobias Rathjen, aged 43. Born in 1977 in the Hessian town of 100,000 east of Frankfurt, Rathjen attended a local school before training as a bank clerk in Frankfurt. He took a degree in business management at the University of Bayreuth, which he completed in the spring of 2007. There is currently no indication that Rathjen was acting as part of a wider organised network. The interior ministry of Hesse state said on Thursday that the gunman had not been on the radar of police or intelligence agencies for holding rightwing extremist views. On what seems to have been his personal website, taken offline in the hours since the attack, Rathjen had uploaded a 24-page text in which he tells his life story, claiming that his thoughts and actions have been controlled by mind-readers working for an unnamed \u201cintelligence agency\u201d. While the statement does not explicitly announce his intention to carry out an act of terror, there are lengthy passages in which Rathjen rails against ethnic minorities in Germany and announces that people of certain African, Asian and Middle Eastern origins have to be \u201ccompletely annihilated\u201d within the country. \u201cIf there was a button available that would make this become a reality, I would press it in a flash,\u201d he writes. Rathjen claims to have arrived at his belief from personal experiences at school and work, as well as reading newspaper reports of fights between Germans and \u201cforeigners\u201d. He also mentions an act of \u201cwar\u201d, which he says would be aimed as a \u201cdouble blow\u201d against the secret organisation he believes is watching over him and the \u201cdegeneration of the people\u201d. In his rambling statement, the Hanau attacker also claims to have invented the slogan \u201cAmerica First\u201d and predicted the plots of numerous Hollywood movies, as well as the career of Liverpool FC\u2019s coach, J\u00fcrgen Klopp. A few days before the attack Rathjen uploaded an English-language video to Youtube in which he tried to warn Americans that they were controlled by devil-worshipping \u201csecret societies\u201d. At about 3am in the early hours of Thursday special forces stormed Rathjen\u2019s apartment on Helmholtzstrasse in Hanau\u2019s western Kesselstadt district, after witnesses had spotted his getaway car parked in the street. Inside the apartment, police discovered the bodies of Rathjen and his 72-year-old mother. The father of the family was taken in by police. In the car they found ammunition and a gun holster. Citing police sources, German media reported that Rathjen had been in possession of a hunting licence. He had legally purchased the gun he used to carry out his attack, a Glock 17 9mm Luger, via an online portal, research network RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) reported on Thursday, citing security circles. The same type of weapon was used by the gunman behind the attack on Munich\u2019s Europa shopping centre in 2016. Both terror attacks had a rightwing extremist motive. While Germany has one of the strictest gun laws in Europe, the fact that Rathjen\u2019s license was renewed only last year, as RND reports, raises questions about the system of control.

There is some evidence that properties are being purchased for Airbnb lettings in areas and housing estates that have not previously appealed to the rental sector. These are homes that should be used as homes for local families, especially when we currently have over 3,000 families on the housing waiting list.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian cross-referenced a database of more than 250,000 Airbnb listings with government housing stock figures to calculate the \u201cpenetration rate\u201d of Airbnbs in 8,000 areas across England, Wales and Scotland.

      "bodyText": "Airbnb has become so prevalent in Great Britain that some parts of the country now have one listing for every four properties, prompting concern that the rapid expansion in short-term lets is \u201cout of control\u201d and depriving communities of much-needed homes. Exclusive analysis by the Guardian identified Airbnb hotspots in both rural areas and inner-city neighbourhoods, where the ratio of active Airbnb listings to homes was more than 20 times higher than the average across England, Scotland and Wales. The highest incidence of Airbnbs was in Edinburgh Old Town, where there were 29 active listings for every 100 properties. The north-west of Skye had the second-highest concentration, at 25 listings per 100 properties, including a seafront bothy (\u00a350 a night), a modern cottage clad in corrugated tin (\u00a3190) and an isolated cottage with ocean and mountain views (\u00a3160). In England, the area with the highest rate of Airbnb lets was Woolacombe, Georgeham and Croyde, in Devon, with 23 listings for every 100 properties. In one area of the Lake District: Windermere North, Ambleside and Langdales, there were 19 listings per 100 properties. Local MP Tim Farron described the growth of Airbnb in an area already dominated by second home owners as \u201ca really disturbing issue\u201d. Airbnb questioned the accuracy of the findings, emphasising that unusual listings such as caravans or large manor houses, used for events, may not affect the local housing stock. It said some listings may be booked for only a few nights a year. But others warned that the growth of Airbnb played to wider concerns about the effect of short-term lets. \u201cThe unchecked growth of online holiday lettings is depriving communities of much-needed homes,\u201d said Dan Wilson Craw, the director of housing pressure group Generation Rent. \u201cIn rural areas and cities alike, the story is the same: young adults can\u2019t afford to settle down in the areas they grew up in.\u201d In 2014 30% of homes in some parts of the Lake District national park were classed as second homes. In Chapel Stile, a picturesque village in the Langdales, research from the local school found 70% of houses were not regularly occupied. Six years on, a two-bed terrace in the village now sells for \u00a3325,000, way out of the reach of working locals, who earn on average just \u00a3345 a week. Such properties are now listed for \u00a3130 or more a night on Airbnb \u2013 much more during the peak tourism season. Cumbrian county councillor Jonathan Brook said he did not object to people renting out their homes on a short-term basis, when it could be argued they are \u201cactually contributing to the viability of a community, as the guests will use the local services at a time when the owners themselves are not\u201d. However, he added: \u201cIf properties are being bought and are being exclusively used for Airbnb lettings, they should be registered as a business. There is some evidence that properties are being purchased for Airbnb lettings in areas and housing estates that have not previously appealed to the rental sector. These are homes that should be used as homes for local families, especially when we currently have over 3,000 families on the housing waiting list.\u201d The Guardian cross-referenced a database of more than 250,000 Airbnb listings with government housing stock figures to calculate the \u201cpenetration rate\u201d of Airbnbs in 8,000 areas across England, Wales and Scotland. Across the whole of Great Britain, there were 0.8 Airbnb listings for every 100 homes. Listings data \u2013 covering the six months to January \u2013 was provided by Inside Airbnb, a non-commercial project that aims to highlight the impact of the service on residential housing markets. The dataset covers entire homes, private rooms and shared rooms, although two-thirds of active listings (67%) are for entire apartments. Private rooms \u2013 including a small number of conventional hotel rooms \u2013 made up about a third of listings while less than one in 300 ads (0.3%) was for a shared room. The analysis included active listings only. A listing was considered active if the host had updated its availability calendar in the last six months. Airbnb says the findings are based on \u201cunreliable scraped data and flawed methodology\u201d. \u201cAirbnb has long led the way on home-sharing rules and we are currently working with government and stakeholders across the UK on proposals for a host registration system to ensure that rules work for them too,\u201d a spokesman said. In the most touristic areas, hotels and conventional B&amp;Bs also now advertise on the site, as well as campsites offering mobile homes, camping pods or wigwams. But they make up a small minority of listings. Alistair Danter, the project manager of the Skye tourism management body SkyeConnect, says Airbnb listings on the island represent a variety of interests. \u201cThe trouble with any headline figures relating to Airbnb is that you don\u2019t know which categories they relate to: some of these listings will be established businesses \u2013 B&amp;Bs, self-catering hotels - that use the Airbnb platform listing when they have a gap, some will be listings for two or three pods on the same croft and others may well be new start-up businesses taking advantage of the opportunity that the Airbnb platform offers. Many of these options will not be housing stock from locals,\u201d he said. Danter describes the company as \u201cboth saint and sinner\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an effective platform that has given people an opportunity to start a viable business or earn some extra money in an area of the country where wages are low.

Scottish Green MSP Andy Wightman, whose campaigning work on short-term lets was prompted by stories of \u201cmental anguish\u201d from his Edinburgh constituents, welcomed the plans, but warned that there was still no clear picture of how many former homes had been given over to commercial uses. Wightman estimates that there may be as many as 5,000 in Edinburgh alone, and has recently launched an online tool which allows people to report short-term let properties operating in their community. \u201cThe growth in short-term lets is out of control in Edinburgh and of increasing concern across Scotland,\u201d Wightman said, emphasising that Airbnb was only part of the problem.

      "bodyText": "The World Health Organization is coordinating with the African Union to prepare the continent\u2019s countries for potential arrivals of people infected with coronavirus. Last week, the first case of coronavirus in Africa was confirmed when a case emerged in Egypt. The World Health Organization has issued a plea to a dozen manufacturers of personal protective equipment to help in a bid to protect health workers from the spread of coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019ve written to 12 chief executives of manufacturers of personal protective equipment to seek their cooperation to ensure supply to protect health workers,\u201d said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom. Over half of the coronavirus cases outside of China are onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, the World Health Organization\u2019s director general has said. Giving the WHO\u2019s daily update, Tedros Adhanom said there were now more than 1,000 cases outside mainland China, and seven deaths. Here\u2019s the latest country-by-country breakdown of the coronavirus outbreak, as the number of those infected worldwide hits nearly 75,000. According to Associated Press, the latest figures provided by each government\u2019s health authority as of Thursday are: Mainland China: 2,118 deaths among 74,576 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei Hong Kong: 65 cases, 2 deaths Macau: 10 Japan: 727 cases, including 634 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 3 deaths Singapore: 84 South Korea: 51, 1 death (the number of cases has since risen after reports of new cases at a \u2018cult\u2019 church have taken the total number to 82) Thailand: 35 Taiwan: 24 cases, 1 death Malaysia: 22 Vietnam: 16 Germany: 16 United States: 15 cases; separately, 1 US citizen died in China Australia: 14 France: 12 cases, 1 death United Kingdom: 9 United Arab Emirates: 9 Canada: 8 Iran: 5 cases, 2 deaths Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death India: 3 Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Egypt: 1 Here are the main things that have happened today: Two Japanese passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise liner have died after becoming infected onboard. Both were in their 80s. China\u2019s national death toll stands at 2,118, with 74,576 confirmed infections in total. New cases of the virus in China have dropped, partly because the way cases are counted was changed for the second time in a week. Scientists have signed an open letter in support of Chinese colleagues who have been targeted on social media with conspiracy theories about the origins of the coronavirus. UK passengers on the Diamond Princess are expected to be flown out from Tokyo on Friday. They will land at Boscombe Down airbase in Wiltshire. The Foreign Office is also helping Britons who were on the Westerdam cruise ship to come home from Cambodia. The South Korean city of Daegu is facing an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d, its mayor has said, after a cluster of cases at a church grew to account for nearly half of the nation\u2019s total cases. Iran has reported two deaths from the coronavirus, and an additional three cases in the city of Qom. Australia has extended its travel ban for arrivals from China into a fourth week. It will last until 29 February. Our health editor, Sarah Boseley, reports that 27 prominent public health scientists from nine countries have signed a joint statement of support for Chinese colleagues who are being criticised on social media, and even threatened with violence as false rumours circulate about the origins of the coronavirus. \u201cWe work very closely with the Chinese scientists. We have had incredible openness with the labs in China for the last 15 years, since Sars,\u201d said Dr Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance in the United States. \u201cWe collaborate on what are dangerous viruses and get incredible information that helps public health around the world. That is all under threat right now.\u201d There is a worry that the open and transparent relationship between the Chinese scientists and their western counterparts will come to an abrupt end, impeding the sharing of data and the hunt for treatments and vaccines against Covid-19. The scientists cite conspiracy theories circulating on social media which claim that the coronavirus was artificially manufactured in a lab conducting bioweapons research. They are \u201ccrackpot theories that need to be addressed, but in the age of social media it is just impossible\u201d, Daszak said. UK companies have begun to flag up the economic impact of the coronavirus. Aveva, which is one of Britain\u2019s biggest tech groups and earns 5% of its revenues from China, said Chinese sales had been knocked by the disruption. Shares in the FTSE 100-listed firm dropped 4% after its update. Shares in the kitchen and bathroom supplier Norcros plummeted 13% when it alerted over profits because of the impact of the disease on Chinese-based suppliers. And the recruitment group Hays says its business in China has slowed. Its chief executive, Alistair Cox, told PA Media that recruitment in China had been \u201cvery subdued\u201d. \u201cEveryone has been concerned about their own health and safety and that of their families \u2013 it has to be everyone\u2019s priority.\u201d US military forces in South Korea have just issued a statement about their response to the situation in Daegu. The measures are intended to restrict unnecessary travel, and schools and children\u2019s centres used by military staff have been closed. Daegu, which is two hours south of the capital, Seoul, accounts for nearly half the confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country. Infections have centred on a controversial \u201ccult\u201d church. A 61-year-old woman who worships there has been linked to the 37 other members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus who have been confirmed as infected. Daegu\u2019s mayor, Kwon Young-jin, has said the city faces \u201can unprecedented crisis\u201d. While, naturally, people\u2019s health is the primary concern with the coronavirus outbreak, it is also undoubtedly having a global economic impact as well. Air France-KLM, Qantas, and the global container shipping giant Maersk have become the latest businesses to warn about the financial impact from the continued spread of the coronavirus. My colleague Joanna Partridge has the full story. There is some more detail from Iran of the coronavirus cases there. Three cases have been confirmed today, in addition to the two people who were known to have died from it. The cases have all been in Qom, which is around 140km (86 miles) south of the capital, Tehran. According to the official IRNA news agency all schools and universities, including religious Shia seminaries, were shut down in the city. Mohammad Mahdi Gouya, Iran\u2019s deputy health minister, said the three people with the coronavirus did not appear to have had any contact with Chinese nationals. Authorities were now investigating the origin of the disease, and its possible link with religious pilgrims from Pakistan or other countries. British Airways have announced a further round of flight cancellations. A spokesperson for the airline said: \u201cIn line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\u2019s continued advice against all but essential travel to mainland China, we are cancelling flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai until April 17 2020. We continue to fly to and from Hong Kong. We will keep the situation under review.\u201d The company said it would be contacting customers on cancelled flights to discuss their travel options, which includes the possibility of rebooking on to other carriers, refunds, or flying on a later date. Here\u2019s a summary of the main events so far today. Two Japanese passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise liner have died after becoming infected onboard. Both were in their 80s. China\u2019s national death toll stands at 2,118, with 74,576 confirmed infections in total. New cases of the virus in China have dropped, partly because the way cases are counted was changed for the second time in a week. UK passengers on the Diamond Princess are expected to be flown out from Tokyo on Friday. They will land at Boscombe Down airbase in Wiltshire. The Foreign Office is also helping Britons who were on the Westerdam cruise ship come home from Cambodia. The South Korean city of Daegu is facing an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d, its mayor has said, after a cluster of cases at a church grew to account for nearly half of the nation\u2019s total virus cases. Iran has reported two deaths from the coronavirus. Australia has extended its travel ban for arrivals from China into a fourth week. It will last until 29 February. PA is reporting that the plane carrying British passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship will land at the MoD base Boscombe Down in Wiltshire. Around 70 Britons will be on the repatriation flight, which is expected to leave Tokyo late tomorrow night. Sources have told the PA news agency that the Britons in Cambodia who left the Westerdam cruise ship are being assisted by the Foreign Office to make their way home. They are being quite coy about it though \u2013 refusing to disclose how many Britons are involved, or indeed whether they may have already arrived back in the country. The group, who have all tested negative for coronavirus while in Cambodia, are receiving health advice and being helped with commercial flight bookings. Public Health England said airport health teams would meet the flights and speak to Westerdam passengers about any symptoms, and they would be asked to self-isolate at home for 14 days. Hong Kong\u2019s Information Services Department has issued some photos of passengers arriving at Hong Kong international airport on a flight from Tokyo. A total of 106 Hong Kong residents, who were quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Yokohama, were permitted to leave Japan and have flown back to Hong Kong. Upon arrival they were taken straight to a designated quarantine site. Australia may have extended its ban on foreign travellers from China for another week until 29 February, but Melbourne is trying to do something to make the Chinese population currently there feel more welcome. The Victoria state government has decided to light up a series of landmarks including the Arts Centre, the National Gallery Victoria and Melbourne town hall in red and gold as a show of solidarity with China over the coronavirus outbreak. Perhaps more practically, it has proposed that as soon as it is safe to visit China again, the city will send a 100-strong trade delegation. The premier, Daniel Andrews, has also urged people to support Chinese businesses. \u201cGo and visit a Chinese restaurant, go to a precinct which is dominated by Asian businesses, go and show your support for them, because a lot of them are having it very, very tough at the moment as people stay away.\u201d A British couple who published video diaries from a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan have confirmed that they have the coronvirus as they posted Facebook updates from hospital. Sally and David Abel, who were among thousands of passengers on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, said that Japanese doctors had told them that vaccinations which they had in the past for the flu had stopped the virus from spreading further. The were not displaying any symptoms and were in good spirits, their son Steve added in a live post on Facebook as they awoke on Thursday morning to see photos of his smiling parents in two beds in the same hospital room. David Abel posted: \u201cOutside the hospital I came over a bit weird and nearly passed out. Every pore on my body opened and i was wheelchaired to our room.\u201d \u201cFull health inspection and now we know what\u2019s going on. We both contracted a cold (unaware of) and it has not yet turned into pneumonia. (we do have corona virus). \u201cTomorrow the big tests commence. chest x-rays, ECG, chest scan, urine + more.\u201d Three Iranian patients have tested positive for the new coronavirus disease, according to the state\u2019s semi-official ISNA news agency. The latest development in Iran comes after its health ministry said on Wednesday that two people had died after preliminary tests came back as positive for Covid-19. ISNA reports that five hospitals have been designated for the treatment of cases. A Japanese government official has described coronavirus as the biggest risk to the economy in a country which has already been heavily criticised by others, including US authorities for its handling of quarantined cruise ship passengers. His comments came monthly report said that the Japanese labour market remained solid, but warned about risks to the outlook from the coronavirus epidemic. Japan\u2019s financial watchdog has begun conducting an emergency survey on domestic financial institutions with business operations in China to gauge how the coronavirus outbreak could affect credit costs. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ)is continuing to cover the crisis in China after the state expelled three of its reporters from the country, a move which the news outlet criticised in an editorial on Wednesday night. The WSJ\u2019s latest report (paywall) reports that overburdened hospitals are struggling to provide care to other patients in Hubei, the province at the centre of the outbreak, with some facilities turning away pregnant women with complications. The editorial said: \u201cThe truth is that Beijing\u2019s rulers are punishing our reporters so they can change the subject from the Chinese public\u2019s anger about the government\u2019s management of the coronavirus scourge.\u201d Two more Russians aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan have been diagnosed with the virus, the Russian Embassy in Japan has said. The two will be transferred to a hospital in Japan for treatment, according to the embassy statement published on Facebook. The Diamond Princess has been docked in the Yokohama port near Tokyo since Feb. 4, when 10 people on board tested positive for the virus. So far 621 cases of the virus, which has been named COVID-19, have been confirmed among the the Diamond Princess\u2019s original 3,711 people on board. An evacuation flight for Britons stuck on a cruise ship docked off the coast of Japan over coronavirus fears will leave Tokyo on Friday, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab said information had been provided to those registered for the flight, but he urged other British nationals still seeking to leave to contact the Foreign Office. He added: \u201cWe will continue to support British nationals who wish to stay in Japan.\u201d Those repatriated from the Diamond Princess will be quarantined at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral on their return, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said. There were 78 British passengers on the cruise liner when cases of the coronavirus strain known as Covid-19 started to emerge. Four British cases have since been confirmed by the Foreign Office. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog now in London Here\u2019s a summary of events so far on Thursday on the coronavirus. Two Japanese passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise liner have died after becoming infected onboard. Both were in their 80s. The South Korean city of Daegu is facing an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d, its mayor has said, after a cluster of cases at a church grew to account for nearly half of the nation\u2019s total virus cases. New cases of the virus in China have dropped, partly because the way cases are counted was changed for the second time in a week. China\u2019s national death toll stands at 2,118, with 74,576 confirmed infections. Iran reported two deaths from the coronavirus. Australia has extended its travel ban for arrivals from China into a fourth week. UK passengers on the Diamond Princess are expected to be flown out on Friday. The mayor of a South Korean city of Daegu has ordered the shutdown of all kindergartens and public libraries, as a surge in confirmed Covid-19 cases linked to a local church raised the prospect of wider transmission. Reuters reported that malls in Daegu, the country\u2019s fourth largest city (population of 2.5 million), were largely empty. \u201cWe are in an unprecedented crisis,\u201d the city\u2019s mayor, Kwon Young-jin, said. Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 31 new cases of the virus on Thursday, following 20 a day earlier, taking the total across the country to 82. Of that national tally, 49 patients are from Daegu or nearby and have been traced to an infected person who attended a local church, a scenario that KCDC described as a \u201csuper-spreading event\u201d. You can read our full story here. The Global Times is reporting that Beijing has postponed some student exams that were due to be held in March. China\u2019s state-run media says small- and medium-sized enterprises may lay off 30% of staff because of the coronavirus. An evacuation flight for Britons stuck on the Diamond Princess will leave Tokyo on Friday, according to the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. There were 78 British passengers on the cruise liner when cases of the coronavirus strain known as Covid-19 started to emerge. Four British cases have since been confirmed. It is understood that only healthy passengers with no symptoms of the virus will be able to travel on the evacuation flight, with all to spend 14 days at quarantined in the UK. Anyone who develops symptoms during the flight will be taken to hospital, Press Association reports, while it is understood any pre-existing cases will be treated in Japan. Meanwhile, the European Commission has announced the EU will be financing the repatriation of citizens from any of the EU27 still stuck on the Diamond Princess. Indonesia has announced it will evacuate 74 of its nationals from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise liner. Passengers are continuing to disembark from the ship docked at Yokohama, south of Tokyo. As of Wednesday, a total of 621 passengers and crew had tested positive for the new coronavirus. Indonesia currently has no reported cases of coronavirus, but the idyllic holiday island of Bali has been hit by the ripple effect of the crisis, with tourism plummeting. At least one expert says Bali \u201cdoes not have the capacity\u201d to treat patients if they become sick. You can read our full story on it below. The director of disaster response who has been out at the facility housing the new arrivals near Darwin said she is awaiting final number of arrivals but believes it\u2019s 170. Six New Zealanders also arrived on the flight carrying Australians from Japan and were transferred to New Zealand. We are just seeing a press conference from Australia, where passengers from the Diamond Cruise ship recently arrived to carry out 14 days of quarantine. The Northern Territory\u2019s deputy chief health minister, Dianne Stephens, said some arrivals had minor cold symptoms and will be tested for Covid-19. There were six people off that plane identified as having minor sniffles and sore throat that we have separated completely, and they will be swabbed this afternoon, and those people have gone straight into an isolation area of the HowardSprings facility, in the same way that we have done that for the work and cohort, people who have had sniffles and colds. If somebody does test positive for COVID-19, we are fully prepared to manage that situation out at Howard Springs, or in the Royal Darwin Hospital and the jurisdictions are ready to come and retrieve patients who require that. Deaths in China in the past 24 hours were recorded as 114, of which 108 were in Hubei province. This compares to 136 recorded the previous day. The new total for people who have died from Covid-19 in China is now 2,118. Let\u2019s take a look at today\u2019s national figures from China on infections due to the virus. The national health commission said that in the 24 hours to midnight on Wednesday, there were 394 new cases, taking confirmed cases across the country to 74,576. This new cases figure is a significant drop from the 1,749 reported the previous day. It seems to be largely due to another change in the way Hubei province reports cases. According to the Hubei health commission, \u201csuspected cases\u201d and \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d have been separated out again ... which I will try to explain below. You may recall that Hubei changed its reporting criteria last week to include \u201cclinically diagnosed\u201d cases as confirmed cases. That meant cases diagnosed by a doctor (i.e by using scans and assessing symptoms) were included in \u201cnew cases\u201d along with patients who had tested positive using the nucleic acid test. At the time, Chinese authorities said this change was to ensure patients who had symptoms but hadn\u2019t yet had the tests, could access treatment immediately. There was also the suggestion the change was a way of mitigating anger over insufficient numbers of testing kits. Last week\u2019s change saw the number of cases shoot up by approximately 15,000 on one day, but in reality it reflected the counting change. From my reading, the new system as of today has removed some of those people who were clinically diagnosed if they subsequently tested negative using the nucleic acid test. \u201cBased on comprehensive analysis, cases with negative nucleic acid test results were subtracted from the confirmed cases, and a total of 279 cases were corrected,\u201d the health commission\u2019s report said. South Korea has recorded 31 news cases today, taking its total to 82. The country\u2019s disease control centre said 30 of the new cases were in the city of Daegu and surrounding Gyeongbuk province south of Seoul. Of those, 23 are linked with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, The Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, where the a 61-year-old woman believed to be at the centre of the cluster was a worshipper. The woman is known as Patient 31 because sher was the 31st person recorded with the virus in South Korea. It is now believed that 37 out of the 82 cases are members of the church\u2019s congregation. Of the remaining eight cases announced today, one is in Seoul, two are in hospital in Cheongdo Daenam hospital in Gyeongbuk. The remaning five are being investigated. The two Diamond Princess passengers who died on Thursday were both Japanese, NHK reported - an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman. Both victims reportedly had pre-existing medical conditions, the broadcaster said, adding that the man had been hospitalised on 11 February and the woman the following day. On Wednesday, a video by Prof Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital, was circulated widely on social media. In it he criticised quarantine measures on the cruise liner, including that there were no designated \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cred\u201d zones on the ship that indicated areas that were clear of the virus, or ones where it was present. He subsequently took the clip down, saying he was informed conditions on the ship had improved. But on Wednesday he had told BBC radio: I felt much safer when I was in Africa [during the Ebola crisis] because you know where the virus exists and you know where the patient is. But inside the Diamond Princess you have no idea where the virus is. Over the past few days there has been increasing criticism of the Japanese authorities\u2019 handling of the infection on the cruise line, as infections continued to mount, despite infection control measures being in place. Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, on Thursday defended Japan\u2019s response to the outbreak in parliament, telling lawmakers that officials had taken expert advice and responded to issues on a daily basis. In a move to reassure the public, the health ministry also issued a statement in both English and Japanese that said all passengers had been required to stay in their cabins since 5 February to contain the virus. The Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, reports that Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University hospital, said he was not surprised to hear reports that two passengers on the Diamond Princess had died. \u201cCruise ships have a lot of elderly passengers, many of whom have chronic diseases and are on medication, so I am not surprised to hear that people have died,\u201d Iwata told reporters by video conference from Yokohama on Thursday. \u201cThey are high risk, and we don\u2019t have a specific treatment for the virus.\u201d Some news just breaking that two elderly passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, have died. They are believed to be a man and a woman in their 80s, according to Japanese broadcasters Kyodo and NHK. Both outlets are citing government sources. We\u2019ll bring you more on this story as soon as we have it. More than 620 of the passengers on the Diamond Princess liner have been infected on the ship, which has been quarantined since 3 February, initially with about 3,700 people on board. Nationals from Australia, the US, Canada and Hong Kong who have been quarantined on the ship have been airlifted home. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Here\u2019s an update of what we know so far. Two people infected with Covid-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise liner, have died, reports say. Hong Kong citizens evacuated from the Diamond princess have begun arriving home. New cases in China have fallen to 394 according to the daily national update, taking cases across the country to 74,576. Total deaths have risen by 114 to 2,118. Figures across China for new cases have dropped significantly after Hubei province changed the way it counted cases again, to remove the clinically diagnosed cases who have since tested negative to the virus on the test kit.

      "body": "<p>Reports that Boris Johnson and the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are preparing tax rises in the budget on 11 March have raised concerns within the Conservative party. Several proposals have been aired in the media, including two that would have been anathema under previous Tory administrations: a fuel duty rise and the imposition of a mansion tax.</p> <h2><strong>Mansion tax</strong></h2> <p><strong>What is the proposal?<br></strong>The Conservative party has not formally outlined <a href=\"https://www.theweek.co.uk/105596/tories-plan-shock-mansion-tax\">plans for a mansion tax</a> but reports have floated the possibility of one being introduced. Under a Labour party policy for the 2015 election, it took the form of an annual levy on homes worth more than \u00a32m. </p> <p>At the time, Labour\u2019s plan was widely derided by the Tories before the 2015 election when Johnson attacked the idea of a levy on homes worth \u00a32m, calling it a \u201ctax on London\u201d when he was the mayor.</p> <p><strong>How much would it raise?<br></strong>Announcing the Labour policy in 2014, then shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the charge would raise \u00a31.2bn a year. This implied an average annual levy of at least \u00a311,000 per affected property, based 110,000 homes being affected, though paying the tax could be deferred until death.</p> <p><strong>Why is it a problem with some Conservatives?<br></strong>The idea does not sit well with a party that is strongly associated with wealth creation and private asset ownership. In 2012, Tory ministers fought their Liberal Democrat coalition partners, who favoured the idea of a mansion levy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/07/tory-funds-mansion-tax\">describing it as a homes tax that \u201cwould not happen on our watch\u201d</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Revaluation of homes (council tax)</strong></h2> <p><strong>What is the proposal?<br></strong>Mooted at the same time as the mansion tax, No 10 is reportedly considering a UK-wide home revaluation to squeeze more out of the council tax. Council tax bands in England and Scotland are based on a 1991 valuation of housing stock. The council tax is a regressive levy that falls mostly on people with modest homes. Those people in more expensive homes only pay marginally more than those on the lowest bands.</p> <p>Successive governments have floated the idea of a fresh valuation \u2013 and the Johnson administration\u2019s is the latest proposal. The last Labour government planned to revalue council tax bands in England in 2007 but postponed the decision until after the 2010 general election, which it lost.</p> <p><strong>How much will it raise?<br></strong>Council tax receipts are expected to total \u00a336.3bn in 2019-20, equivalent to \u00a31,300 per household. It is not known how much would be raised because it depends where the new bands are drawn. It could be designed to be revenue neutral, forcing people in more expensive homes to pay more.</p> <p><strong>Why is it a problem with some Conservatives?<br></strong>Property values in Wales and Northern Ireland were reassessed in 2005. In Wales about a third of all homes were placed in a higher band. Such an outcome in England would probably cause uproar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35c4adcfa2590fc641303ecfc8d40493873e1baf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35c4adcfa2590fc641303ecfc8d40493873e1baf/0_207_3613_2168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The budget will be the first for Rishi Sunak, the new chancellor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barcroft Media/Barcroft Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fuel </strong><strong>tax</strong></h2> <p><strong>What is the proposal?<br></strong>Britain\u2019s 37 million drivers could face the first fuel duty rise in a decade next month. The budget could add 2p to the cost of a litre of petrol and diesel, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10999972/fuel-duty-hike-budget/\">government sources </a><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10999972/fuel-duty-hike-budget/\"> told the Sun</a>.</p> <p><strong>How much would it raise?<br></strong>Over five years it could raise as much as \u00a34bn, said No 10.</p> <p><strong>Why is it a problem with some Conservatives?</strong><br>Motorists are a key constituency for the party. <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/economy/taxation/news/107027/boris-johnsons-plan-slash-fuel-duty-would-cost-treasury-%C2%A31bn\">Johnson told the Sun</a><a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/economy/taxation/news/107027/boris-johnsons-plan-slash-fuel-duty-would-cost-treasury-%C2%A31bn\"> last October</a> he heard vehicle owners\u2019 concerns about taxation \u201cloud and clear\u201d after hinting broader tax cuts were on the way in the next budget.</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank said the Treasury had already lost out on a potential \u00a35.5bn since the Tories came to power in 2010 by freezing the duty, rather than raising it in line with inflation.</p> <p>A 2p cut would leave the Treasury with \u00a31bn less to spend each year, the IFS said.</p> <h2><strong>Pension tax relief</strong></h2> <p><strong>What is the proposal?<br></strong>The Treasury has drawn up plans to cut the rate of relief for higher earners from 40% to 20%. At present, people can put up to \u00a340,000 into their pension per year and do not pay tax on that contribution.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/10/pensions-tax-relief-set-to-cost-government-almost-40bn\"> It costs up to \u00a340bn to promote retirement savings via tax relief</a>.</p> <p>The pension tax relief policy would level down rather than level up. However, it is considered a priority before the budget after sources close to No 10 made it known Johnson believed it was perverse to hand higher-rate taxpayers more generous pension tax relief than standard-rate taxpayers. For this reason it is considered to be in a different category to the mansion tax and revaluation of homes.</p> <p><strong>How much would it raise?<br></strong>Estimates vary but No 10 sources say it would raise \u00a310bn a year.</p> <p><strong>Why is it a problem with some Conservatives?<br></strong>One the one hand, it is a tax break enjoyed by an elite. Higher-rate taxpayers total 3.85 million people, equivalent to one in seven. On the other it is a broad benefit to the many. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that at any given point in their lives as many as one in four workers, or eight million people, become higher-rate taxpayers.</p> <p>Tory sympathies tend to be with the aspirational worker who will one day enjoy higher incomes and an accompanying higher pension tax relief.</p> <p>Lobbying against any changes will also come from employers with defined benefit occupational pension schemes. These depend on higher rate relief to subsidise employee contributions and close their yawning funding deficits. A cut in relief would mean deficits increase.</p> <h2><strong>Expanding inheritance tax to cover business assets and shares</strong></h2> <p><strong>What is the idea</strong><br>Inheritance tax forces estates to pay 40% tax on assets worth more than the \u00a3325,000 threshold or \u00a3475,000 if the asset is a home that is left to children or grandchildren. A spouse or civil partner can inherit the tax break, doubling the threshold to up to \u00a3950,000.</p> <p>Many business assets, including farmland, can be excluded from the calculation of taxable wealth, lowering the charge even further for many wealthy households. No 10 is reportedly considering including those assets in the inheritance tax remit.</p> <p><strong>How much will it raise?<br></strong>Inheritance tax receipts hit a <a href=\"https://www.ftadviser.com/property/2019/04/24/iht-receipts-increase-44-per-cent-in-a-month/\">record \u00a35.4bn in 2018</a><a href=\"https://www.ftadviser.com/property/2019/04/24/iht-receipts-increase-44-per-cent-in-a-month/\">-19</a>, up from \u00a35.2bn the previous tax year. A study by the insurer Canada Life calculated deaths within the baby boomer generation over the next decade will raise receipts to \u00a310bn by 2030. Denying families tax breaks, especially those with businesses to hand on to their children, would increase that figure further, possibly by several billions of pounds depending on how draconian the measures turn out to be.</p> <p><strong>Why is it a problem with some Conservatives?<br></strong>The idea has the backing of Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, who is sympathetic to ideas for different forms of wealth taxes. But a decade on from a budget that was dominated by George Osborne\u2019s gifts to older people in the form of extra tax breaks, tightening the tax net around more of the UK\u2019s wealthy families would probably spark a backlash from core Tory constituencies.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a> or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Reports that Boris Johnson and the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are preparing tax rises in the budget on 11 March have raised concerns within the Conservative party. Several proposals have been aired in the media, including two that would have been anathema under previous Tory administrations: a fuel duty rise and the imposition of a mansion tax. Mansion tax What is the proposal? The Conservative party has not formally outlined plans for a mansion tax but reports have floated the possibility of one being introduced. Under a Labour party policy for the 2015 election, it took the form of an annual levy on homes worth more than \u00a32m. At the time, Labour\u2019s plan was widely derided by the Tories before the 2015 election when Johnson attacked the idea of a levy on homes worth \u00a32m, calling it a \u201ctax on London\u201d when he was the mayor. How much would it raise? Announcing the Labour policy in 2014, then shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the charge would raise \u00a31.2bn a year. This implied an average annual levy of at least \u00a311,000 per affected property, based 110,000 homes being affected, though paying the tax could be deferred until death. Why is it a problem with some Conservatives? The idea does not sit well with a party that is strongly associated with wealth creation and private asset ownership. In 2012, Tory ministers fought their Liberal Democrat coalition partners, who favoured the idea of a mansion levy, describing it as a homes tax that \u201cwould not happen on our watch\u201d. Revaluation of homes (council tax) What is the proposal? Mooted at the same time as the mansion tax, No 10 is reportedly considering a UK-wide home revaluation to squeeze more out of the council tax. Council tax bands in England and Scotland are based on a 1991 valuation of housing stock. The council tax is a regressive levy that falls mostly on people with modest homes. Those people in more expensive homes only pay marginally more than those on the lowest bands. Successive governments have floated the idea of a fresh valuation \u2013 and the Johnson administration\u2019s is the latest proposal. The last Labour government planned to revalue council tax bands in England in 2007 but postponed the decision until after the 2010 general election, which it lost. How much will it raise? Council tax receipts are expected to total \u00a336.3bn in 2019-20, equivalent to \u00a31,300 per household. It is not known how much would be raised because it depends where the new bands are drawn. It could be designed to be revenue neutral, forcing people in more expensive homes to pay more. Why is it a problem with some Conservatives? Property values in Wales and Northern Ireland were reassessed in 2005. In Wales about a third of all homes were placed in a higher band. Such an outcome in England would probably cause uproar. Fuel tax What is the proposal? Britain\u2019s 37 million drivers could face the first fuel duty rise in a decade next month. The budget could add 2p to the cost of a litre of petrol and diesel, government sources told the Sun. How much would it raise? Over five years it could raise as much as \u00a34bn, said No 10. Why is it a problem with some Conservatives? Motorists are a key constituency for the party. Johnson told the Sun last October he heard vehicle owners\u2019 concerns about taxation \u201cloud and clear\u201d after hinting broader tax cuts were on the way in the next budget. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank said the Treasury had already lost out on a potential \u00a35.5bn since the Tories came to power in 2010 by freezing the duty, rather than raising it in line with inflation. A 2p cut would leave the Treasury with \u00a31bn less to spend each year, the IFS said. Pension tax relief What is the proposal? The Treasury has drawn up plans to cut the rate of relief for higher earners from 40% to 20%. At present, people can put up to \u00a340,000 into their pension per year and do not pay tax on that contribution. It costs up to \u00a340bn to promote retirement savings via tax relief. The pension tax relief policy would level down rather than level up. However, it is considered a priority before the budget after sources close to No 10 made it known Johnson believed it was perverse to hand higher-rate taxpayers more generous pension tax relief than standard-rate taxpayers. For this reason it is considered to be in a different category to the mansion tax and revaluation of homes. How much would it raise? Estimates vary but No 10 sources say it would raise \u00a310bn a year. Why is it a problem with some Conservatives? One the one hand, it is a tax break enjoyed by an elite. Higher-rate taxpayers total 3.85 million people, equivalent to one in seven. On the other it is a broad benefit to the many. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that at any given point in their lives as many as one in four workers, or eight million people, become higher-rate taxpayers. Tory sympathies tend to be with the aspirational worker who will one day enjoy higher incomes and an accompanying higher pension tax relief. Lobbying against any changes will also come from employers with defined benefit occupational pension schemes. These depend on higher rate relief to subsidise employee contributions and close their yawning funding deficits. A cut in relief would mean deficits increase. Expanding inheritance tax to cover business assets and shares What is the idea Inheritance tax forces estates to pay 40% tax on assets worth more than the \u00a3325,000 threshold or \u00a3475,000 if the asset is a home that is left to children or grandchildren. A spouse or civil partner can inherit the tax break, doubling the threshold to up to \u00a3950,000. Many business assets, including farmland, can be excluded from the calculation of taxable wealth, lowering the charge even further for many wealthy households. No 10 is reportedly considering including those assets in the inheritance tax remit. How much will it raise? Inheritance tax receipts hit a record \u00a35.4bn in 2018-19, up from \u00a35.2bn the previous tax year. A study by the insurer Canada Life calculated deaths within the baby boomer generation over the next decade will raise receipts to \u00a310bn by 2030. Denying families tax breaks, especially those with businesses to hand on to their children, would increase that figure further, possibly by several billions of pounds depending on how draconian the measures turn out to be. Why is it a problem with some Conservatives? The idea has the backing of Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, who is sympathetic to ideas for different forms of wealth taxes. But a decade on from a budget that was dominated by George Osborne\u2019s gifts to older people in the form of extra tax breaks, tightening the tax net around more of the UK\u2019s wealthy families would probably spark a backlash from core Tory constituencies. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk",

Whatever happened to Prince Charles\u2019s much vaunted plan for a slimmed-down royal family?</p> <p>Over the past fortnight, there has been extensive coverage of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51459492\" title=\"\">divorce of Peter Phillips</a>, an event that perhaps mildly explains the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7909309/As-Harry-flies-Canada-earn-millions-Peter-Phillips-advertising-milk-TV.html\" title=\"\">trashy milk adverts</a> Princess Anne\u2019s son filmed for the Chinese market. One of these showed him as a shill for a state-owned dairy in the grounds of a palace-like stately home, gulping down milk as if his dignity depended on it, adorned by the slogan \u201cBritish Royal Family Member Peter Phillips\u201d. This generated a content frenzy, including such hilarities as the headline \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2020012183493/peter-phillips-milk-advert/\" title=\"\">PRINCESS DIANA\u2019S CHEF SPOTS MAJOR ERROR IN PETER PHILLIPS\u2019 MILK ADVERT</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Then, barely a week after the Phillips divorce news, we were \u201crocked\u201d on behalf of the Queen by news of \u201cyet more family heartache\u201d, with <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/02/david-serena-armstrong-jones-snowdon-divorce\" title=\"\">the divorce of her nephew Viscount Linley and his wife Serena</a>, a pair with the sort of general name recognition you might enjoy in one of the better witness protection programmes.</p> <p>At first glance, it might seem that these hugely arcane tours through the court and social outliers are just an easy way to get more Meghan into the SEO terms. But the sheer churn of it all suggests that interest in the royals is the highest it\u2019s been in years. Whether or not people care to admit it, they are most drawn to the Windsors when they are having unhappy dramas. The relationship of royal watchers to the watched is hugely dysfunctional.</p> <p>Take Prince Andrew\u2019s 60th birthday, which was yesterday. A year ago, this event would have got no coverage to speak of, though the party he\u2019d have thrown to celebrate might have provided some bog standard Range Rover arrival shots of people you didn\u2019t care about even in the 90s. But given The Unpleasantness, there have been <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/guests-arrive-prince-andrews-birthday-21532802\" title=\"\">acres of stuff</a> written about the very absence of celebration, all sufficiently lapped up for further acres of it to be produced to meet demand. There was the week of drama over whether or not councils should have to fly their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/feb/06/katy-perry-offers-no-respite-for-the-embattled-royals\" title=\"\">town hall flags</a> to mark it; the alleged \u201cfurore\u201d over Westminster Abbey\u2019s bells ringing for it; further slavering over how very little there was to slaver over. A personal favourite was Buckingham Palace\u2019s unnecessary decision to press release the duke\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2020/02/07/duke-york-defers-royal-navy-promotion-rank-admiral/\" title=\"\">own decision</a> NOT to become a full admiral, which you sense would have been a wrench for Andy. It\u2019s a much better 60th birthday present than whisky stones, an apron saying \u201cOld Fart\u201d, or a brain-training game.</p> <p>Over to the formal Buckingham Palace communiqu\u00e9 on the matter, which milked the upset for all it was worth: \u201cBy convention, the Duke of York would be in line for military promotion on his 60th birthday,\u201d it began ominously. \u201cFollowing the decision by His Royal Highness to step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, the Duke of York has asked the Ministry of Defence if this promotion might be deferred until such time that His Royal Highness returns to public duty.\u201d</p> <p>Could be the 12th of never; could be in his 90s, just in time to take advantage of the rising sea levels. Either way, you get the strong impression that the Windsors are still serving up exactly what people want. I\u2019m struggling to imagine how they could have leaned in to it all any further, bar throwing Andrew\u2019s 60th dinner at Pizza Express in Woking.</p> <p>Instead, Andrew\u2019s bijou 60th gathering was held at Royal Lodge, home of the duke and his destranged wife, Duchess Fergie. According to reports, the number of invitees who found they were unavailable on the date grew so large that a second batch of invitations was sent out by Fergie\u2019s assistant.</p> <p>The standout report into the matter was one in the Mail offering what its two authors called <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8017975/Prince-Andrews-sorrowful-60th-haunting-insight-Dukes-celebration.html\" title=\"\">\u201ca haunting insight\u201d</a> into the upcoming dinner. This opened with a throwback to the Queen\u2019s 60th bash. \u201cClick, click,\u201d wrote the reporters of that event, really putting you inside the action. \u201cTaking the pictures was her son, Andrew \u2026 He was 26. Friends recall him marvelling at his mother and wondering \u2018what I\u2019ll be like at 60\u2019.\u201d Well how very convenient for your article that they do. Or as the authors put it grimly: \u201cNow we know.\u201d</p> <p>Then again, the many \u201cfriends\u201d of the Duke have been on hand since the Epstein story broke, and for the past few weeks have been chiefly concerned with furnishing non-details of the non-event of his holing up at home. \u201cWe call it being in the bunker\u201d, confided one of these friends to the Mail this week, as though that were a terrifically abstruse term of art.</p> <p>So, yes, do expect much more news on all these developing stories in the months and years to come.

      "bodyText": "News that Prince Harry and Meghan will cease their royal duties at the end of next month is now in, yet offers no letup in the backbreaking schedule of Windsors-related toss-giving demanded of all UK humans. On the one hand, we are told that all this may turn out to be a mortal blow for the royal family, though my feeling is the mere fact of \u201cCharles III\u201d has the potential to be rather more seismic. On the other hand, we have never seemed to care more about these people. Whatever happened to Prince Charles\u2019s much vaunted plan for a slimmed-down royal family? Over the past fortnight, there has been extensive coverage of the divorce of Peter Phillips, an event that perhaps mildly explains the trashy milk adverts Princess Anne\u2019s son filmed for the Chinese market. One of these showed him as a shill for a state-owned dairy in the grounds of a palace-like stately home, gulping down milk as if his dignity depended on it, adorned by the slogan \u201cBritish Royal Family Member Peter Phillips\u201d. This generated a content frenzy, including such hilarities as the headline \u201cPRINCESS DIANA\u2019S CHEF SPOTS MAJOR ERROR IN PETER PHILLIPS\u2019 MILK ADVERT.\u201d Then, barely a week after the Phillips divorce news, we were \u201crocked\u201d on behalf of the Queen by news of \u201cyet more family heartache\u201d, with the divorce of her nephew Viscount Linley and his wife Serena, a pair with the sort of general name recognition you might enjoy in one of the better witness protection programmes. At first glance, it might seem that these hugely arcane tours through the court and social outliers are just an easy way to get more Meghan into the SEO terms. But the sheer churn of it all suggests that interest in the royals is the highest it\u2019s been in years. Whether or not people care to admit it, they are most drawn to the Windsors when they are having unhappy dramas. The relationship of royal watchers to the watched is hugely dysfunctional. Take Prince Andrew\u2019s 60th birthday, which was yesterday. A year ago, this event would have got no coverage to speak of, though the party he\u2019d have thrown to celebrate might have provided some bog standard Range Rover arrival shots of people you didn\u2019t care about even in the 90s. But given The Unpleasantness, there have been acres of stuff written about the very absence of celebration, all sufficiently lapped up for further acres of it to be produced to meet demand. There was the week of drama over whether or not councils should have to fly their town hall flags to mark it; the alleged \u201cfurore\u201d over Westminster Abbey\u2019s bells ringing for it; further slavering over how very little there was to slaver over. A personal favourite was Buckingham Palace\u2019s unnecessary decision to press release the duke\u2019s own decision NOT to become a full admiral, which you sense would have been a wrench for Andy. It\u2019s a much better 60th birthday present than whisky stones, an apron saying \u201cOld Fart\u201d, or a brain-training game. Over to the formal Buckingham Palace communiqu\u00e9 on the matter, which milked the upset for all it was worth: \u201cBy convention, the Duke of York would be in line for military promotion on his 60th birthday,\u201d it began ominously. \u201cFollowing the decision by His Royal Highness to step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, the Duke of York has asked the Ministry of Defence if this promotion might be deferred until such time that His Royal Highness returns to public duty.\u201d Could be the 12th of never; could be in his 90s, just in time to take advantage of the rising sea levels. Either way, you get the strong impression that the Windsors are still serving up exactly what people want. I\u2019m struggling to imagine how they could have leaned in to it all any further, bar throwing Andrew\u2019s 60th dinner at Pizza Express in Woking. Instead, Andrew\u2019s bijou 60th gathering was held at Royal Lodge, home of the duke and his destranged wife, Duchess Fergie. According to reports, the number of invitees who found they were unavailable on the date grew so large that a second batch of invitations was sent out by Fergie\u2019s assistant. The standout report into the matter was one in the Mail offering what its two authors called \u201ca haunting insight\u201d into the upcoming dinner. This opened with a throwback to the Queen\u2019s 60th bash. \u201cClick, click,\u201d wrote the reporters of that event, really putting you inside the action. \u201cTaking the pictures was her son, Andrew \u2026 He was 26. Friends recall him marvelling at his mother and wondering \u2018what I\u2019ll be like at 60\u2019.\u201d Well how very convenient for your article that they do. Or as the authors put it grimly: \u201cNow we know.\u201d Then again, the many \u201cfriends\u201d of the Duke have been on hand since the Epstein story broke, and for the past few weeks have been chiefly concerned with furnishing non-details of the non-event of his holing up at home. \u201cWe call it being in the bunker\u201d, confided one of these friends to the Mail this week, as though that were a terrifically abstruse term of art. So, yes, do expect much more news on all these developing stories in the months and years to come. For now, it is to be assumed that you are across the fact that Prince Andrew is hunkered down at home \u2013 what they call \u201cbeing in the bunker\u201d \u2013 with the weather \u201cso wet that he has hardly been able to expel his frustrations on the golf course\u201d. Perhaps that\u2019s for the best. Were HRH to play a round, I can only picture him tailed by a helpful friend, who would mark any unfortunate foray into a sanded course hazard by solemnly informing other golfers: \u201cWe call it being in the bunker.\u201d Al Pacino failed to say it with flowers Now to news \u2013 perhaps not entirely unexpected \u2013 of the romantic status of movie legend Al Pacino. When the 79-year-old star took a tumble on the Baftas red carpet a few weeks ago, I did think his girlfriend, 40, looked slightly more disdainfully appalled than solicitous.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWatch out, there\u2019s a bit of wet paint going on here,\u201d warns Can\u2019t Do Tomorrow\u2019s founder and co-curator, Kent Johnston, as he shows me around the warehouse. Artists on ladders are painting on the walls around us, as wires hang from the ceiling. A scissor lift is beeping in the background. Two weeks from when we meet, the space will be transformed: the event, which opens today, is a festival of street art stretching across three floors of a giant old building in Melbourne\u2019s inner-west suburb of Kensington. The scale is ambitious. More than 140 artists are involved, including headliner Shepard Fairey \u2013 the US artist behind Barack Obama\u2019s Hope poster \u2013 as well as Australian artist Callum Preston, French artist Lucy Lucy, and Badiucao, the Chinese-Australian political cartoonist who has been at the centre of several recent censorship spats. There\u2019s music events, a custom-built print store and a talks program curated by the Los Angeles screen director and curator Aaron Rose (Beautiful Losers). Even the transport authorities got involved: in collaboration with Southern Shorthaul Railroad, a freight train becomes what the organisers call \u201cone of the largest moving outdoor galleries in Australia\u201d, with artists including Merda, Sirum 1 and Kab 101 taking over the 22 carriages which will be roving through Victoria, with sporadic stops in the warehouse. Street art festivals require big spaces and walls that can be transformed \u2013 for the most part, they take place in buildings that are about to be demolished, or renovated: \u201cThey get one shot and they\u2019re out,\u201d Johnston says. But reprieved from immediate demolition by a negotiated lease with its property developers, Johnston and artistic director Zoe Paulsen have the Kensington place for four years. This 10-day festival is just their first venture, which aims, in Paulsen\u2019s words, to give street culture \u201cthe recognition it deserves\u201d. Paulsen\u2019s comprehensive program brings together some of the leading names in Australian street art across thousands of square metres of exhibition space. Once Preston saw the warehouse \u2013 \u201cjust how epic and big that space was\u201d \u2013 he seized the opportunity to wheel in his own ice-cream truck. \u201cI guess it\u2019s almost like an unintentional collaboration; I want to work with an existing object.\u201d He came across the 1976 Bedford Mr Whippy van while walking late at night with his wife and two friends. \u201cWe saw it in this big old shed and my friend said, \u2018I guess we\u2019re buying this, then!\u2019\u201d The truck oozes the kind of feel-good retro sentimentality that Preston, a prominent figure in the Melbourne street art scene, has become known for. The scene is often thought to be masculine, marked by more than its fair share of exclusion, but Can\u2019t Do Tomorrow has a pleasing amount of diversity on display, with large pieces from noted female artists including Georgia Rose and Lucy Lucy. Lucy Lucy\u2019s work in particular is a breath of fresh air in what can sometimes be a convention-bound genre. Her graceful work combines a feminist sensibility with the kind of crisp expressiveness that has made street art such a popular movement post-millennium. \u201cI wanted to paint something about the bushfires,\u201d she says. \u201cThe lady I painted, there are very graphic flames, very stylised lines, but she is celebrating or worshipping a little sprout \u2026 you gotta be positive, you know?\u201d Originally from Paris, Lucy Lucy has been in Melbourne for nearly a decade, drawn here by the internationally renowned street art scene. She says often, while she\u2019s out painting, people will stop to ask if she knows the names of other artists featured around them. \u201cIt\u2019s quite incredible \u2026 people take ownership, it\u2019s their streets as well.\u201d Lucy name checks Georgia Rose and ELLE \u2013 \u201cshe\u2019s pretty big in America\u201d \u2013 as leading practitioners of a burgeoning female scene in Melbourne. \u201cThere is a group of women street artists who are painting so many amazing things and are really pushing it,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cWe are really doing something big and interesting and bold and making space for ourselves.\u201d Can\u2019t Do Tomorrow is also a celebration of street art\u2019s political roots \u2013 not just in capitalist streetscapes where property rights are considered sacrosanct, but in more repressive societies. Badiucao is one of the most active artists working in that long tradition. After his last exhibition in Hong Kong was banned by authorities there, Badiucao is bringing Made in Hong Kong, Banned in China to Melbourne for its first proper showing. The installation pulls no punches. Overtly political, it features graphic representations of torture apparatus, including the notorious \u201ctorture chair\u201d favoured by Chinese authorities. \u201cI do believe there is a social responsibility for artists,\u201d Badiucao says over a phone call which he requested be encrypted for his security. \u201cAs an artist, we have certain powers. Our work will influence people\u2019s emotions. We have platforms like galleries, festivals, art critique. When people and artists do not shine a light on the most urgent issues, I feel it\u2019s a waste of time, I feel it\u2019s too selfish. \u201cWhen some artists will insist that, you know, \u2018art is for the sake of art\u2019 \u2013 I feel this is bullshit. This is simply denying the very responsibility of being an artist.\u201d \u2022 Can\u2019t Do Tomorrow runs until 29 February at The Facility, 2R Chelmsford Street, Kensington, Melbourne",

      "bodyText": "Monday I have my first appointment of 2020 with my life coach. Apart from suggesting I take up the xylophone as a relaxing hobby, we look at how I might break my four-hour-a-day phone habit. My life coach agrees that I could get fit AND write my novel, if I stopped scrolling, checking, texting, listening to podcasts, Instagramming, tweeting and reading news all day. His phone is mostly inactive. He just turns it on twice a day to check his messages and speak to clients. The rest of the time it just sits in a drawer on aeroplane mode. \u201cExperiment perhaps with going for a walk without it,\u201d he says. I shudder involuntarily. At home, I Google where to buy a xylophone and find I have just lost an hour mindlessly scrolling. Hate self! Why so addicted to small powerful computer? Leave it in a drawer as I have to get enough sleep because tomorrow I\u2019m going on TV and I want to look HOT and RESTED. Tuesday South Yarra, 10am Today I am on TV! I\u2019m hardly ever on TV. But the people at Studio 10 want to interview me about detoxes and since I did an extreme one in 2014 I\u2019m an expert. In the city I get my hair blow-dried and makeup done. \u201cGive me a helmet!\u201d I tell the stylist. \u201cI am going on TV.\u201d Hairdresser says nothing, so I say it again in case she didn\u2019t hear. \u201cLots of spray please \u2013 it must be firm for TV!\u201d Others are excited about TV. My parents, sister-in-law and three-year-old niece are gathering at my parents\u2019 house to watch me at 10:30am. Windswept day in Melbourne. Hope helmet stays in place. Get cab to Channel Ten. They promised Cabcharges. Cab is expensive. Spent all money on hair. Run up to reception on level 4 to collect Cabcharges. Leave my laptop in cab as security to reassure driver I won\u2019t do a runner. Cabbie is going to loiter on Toorak Road. I need to be quick. Rain! Laptop! Hair! Reception doesn\u2019t have Cabcharges. Reception rings various people. Sends me to security. Security doesn\u2019t have my name on the list. Who am I? What am I doing here? Why do I want Cabcharges? Reception rings someone called Matt. Matt takes his time (three minutes) to come to reception. Feel sick about driver being towed with my laptop. What if I never see laptop again? Matt has Cabcharges but looks confused.Who am I? What am I doing here? Have I got the wrong week? No! I don\u2019t! Oh maybe I do? \u201cYou are not on television today,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have made a mistake.\u201d Matt says he\u2019ll come to cab with me to sort out driver. Outside it\u2019s raining. Hair is destroyed \u2013 but who cares. I am not on television any more. Must tell excited family or else they will watch Studio 10 all morning, confused, looking for daughter. Where is cab? It has my laptop in it. See cab \u2013 it is parked. Then it is \u2026 moving. I\u2019m waving frantically \u2013 I start to run. I am running along Toorak Road \u2013 on the actual road \u2013 in the rain with flat hair (not good hair) and Matt is also running and the cab is driving and we catch it and Matt pays for the cab and goes back up to Channel Ten and I sit in a coffee shop across the road from the TV station and text my family (\u201cwrong day, I\u2019m not on telly\u201d) and sit staring at the Channel Ten logo and try not to get upset about the 15 minutes I had good hair and only three people saw it.

      "bodyText": "The commander-in-chief of Myanmar\u2019s defence forces \u2013 recommended by the UN for investigation and prosecution for war crimes and genocide \u2013 has met with Australia\u2019s ambassador and says he wants to train more of his officers in Australia. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing is the supreme commander of Myanmar\u2019s military, known as the Tatmadaw, which has been accused of genocide in its systematic persecution of the ethnic and religious minority Rohingya. In \u201cclearance operations\u201d begun in August 2017, thousands of Rohingya were murdered, women and girls were gang raped, while pregnant women were targeted for torture and murder. Other people were burned alive in their homes, and more than 700,000 Rohingya fled over the border to Bangladesh. Australia\u2019s ambassador, Andrea Faulkner, met Min Aung Hlaing on 29 January at the Bayintnaung Villa in the capital, Naypyidaw. The pair exchanged gifts and posed for photos. Human Rights Watch has said Australia\u2019s decision to take the meeting risked giving legitimacy and credibility to a military accused of mass atrocities. Min Aung Hlaing, widely regarded as the most powerful person in Myanmar, said he and Faulkner discussed \u201cimproved relations between Myanmar and Australia which have been on friendly terms since ancient times\u201d as well as \u201cdefence cooperation between the two armed forces of the two countries, sending of more trainees [and] the Indo-Pacific region\u2019s geographical politics\u201d. They also discussed Myanmar\u2019s inquiry into the \u201cclearance operation\u201d campaign against the Rohingya, the provisional measures ordered by the international court of justice and Australian assistance in anti-narcotic operations. Australia is one of the few western countries that maintains a policy of \u201cengagement\u201d with the Myanmar military, but only in non-combat areas, providing $400,000 of training annually in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, English language classes and peacekeeping. Other militaries, such as that of the European Union, Britain, the US, France and Canada, cut all assistance to the Tatmadaw following the 2017 violence against the Rohingya. It is not the first time Faulkner and previous Australian ambassadors have met Min Aung Hlaing. The UN has identified Min Aung Hlaing as someone who should face investigation and prosecution for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. He has also been individually sanctioned by the US under its Global Magnitsky Act. He cannot travel to America or do business with any US citizen. Any assets he might have in the US are frozen. The US treasury department said military forces under his direct command had committed \u201cserious human rights abuses\u201d. \u201cDuring this time, members of ethnic minority groups were killed or injured by gunshot, often while fleeing, or by soldiers using large-bladed weapons; others were burned to death in their own houses.\u201d Min Aung Hlaing has described the Rohingya as \u201cillegal immigrants, terrorists and extremists\u201d and said the \u201cclearance operations\u201d to exterminate or forcibly drive the Rohingya out of Myanmar was \u201can unfinished job\u201d the government was trying to solve. Australia has imposed autonomous sanctions on five senior members of the Myanmar military, including some direct subordinates of Min Aung Hlaing, but not on the supreme commander himself. Elaine Pearson, Australia Director with Human Rights Watch, said Australia should avoid dealings with Myanmar that play down its military\u2019s egregious rights abuses. \u201cAustralia should be sanctioning Min Aung Hlaing, not taking photos and exchanging gifts with someone who should be investigated for mass atrocities. \u201cIn its meetings with Myanmar officials, Australia should never give the impression that it\u2019s business-as-usual with no repercussions for Myanmar\u2019s ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya.\u201d Pearson has written to Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, arguing Min Aung Hlaing had used the meeting to bolster his international image and legitimise the military he leads. \u201cMin Aung Hlaing quickly instrumentalised this meeting to bolster his public image, publishing a photograph of himself with Ambassador Faulkner on this website.\u201d The UN withdrew the last Myanmar soldiers serving as peacekeepers in a United Nations mission last year. \u201cIf the UN isn\u2019t accepting Myanmar soldiers as peacekeepers due to human rights concerns, Australia shouldn\u2019t be training them to be peacekeepers,\u201d Pearson told the Guardian. \u201cInstead of cosying up to Myanmar\u2019s leaders, Australia should be suspending assistance to Myanmar\u2019s military until there is genuine progress on rights protection and accountability.\u201d The foreign affairs department did not respond to questions about the ambassador\u2019s meeting with Min Aung Hlaing and Australia\u2019s relationship with the Myanmar military. The Australian parliament is currently examining the merits of passing its own global Magnitsky Act, to unilaterally impose targeted sanctions on individuals accused of gross human rights abuses.",

      "bodyText": "It is one of Australia\u2019s most famous pools, a pool that 55 years ago symbolised a deeply segregated country, where Aboriginal people were banned from its waters. In February 1965, the Freedom Ride led by the Arrernte man Charlie Perkins travelled through western New South Wales to the town of Moree to draw attention to the open racism Aboriginal people faced. Confined to missions and reserves under laws which governed where they lived and worked and who they could marry, Aboriginal people endured enforced segregation in public places such as cinemas, shops, buses and schools. In Moree, the Freedom Riders overcame an angry crowd to force the council to rescind its bylaw and allow Aboriginal people to swim in the pool. But today, according to the local Aboriginal community, segregation still exists at the pool in the form of an entry price so steep few can afford to go there. Data analysis shows the Moree artesian aquatic centre (MAAC) is one of the two most expensive public swimming pools in NSW. Guardian Australia collated the entry fees charged by council-operated swimming pools in each of the state\u2019s 129 local government areas. MAAC\u2019s entry fee per adult of $9 is higher than every other council-owned or operated swimming centre except Fairfield in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs. Fairfield council\u2019s entry fee at its three aquatic centres is $9.50, which includes access to indoor and outdoor pools, a sauna and steam room. \u201cConsidering we\u2019re in a drought, considering we are in western NSW, considering we are in an area with high unemployment, that\u2019s a lot.

Police had to escort the students though an angry mob and out of town. \u201cI was literally covered in spit,\u201d Charlie Perkins wrote in his 1975 memoir, A Bastard Like Me. Mary Swan remembers life in those days. \u201cIt was scary back then. \u201cWe had to leave school to go cleaning houses around here for the whitefellas, cook and do all their ironing, babysit for them, clean houses for \u00a33 a week. \u201cWe had to get permission to leave the mission to go up to town. The manager\u2019s wife used to come around every day and check the beds, cupboards and fridge to see if we had food, to make sure we had sheets on the bed and our house was clean. \u201cAnd the welfare used to come. The mothers and fathers would see the car coming, they\u2019d sing out \u2018Mr Randall\u2019s coming!\u2019 and all the kids would run and hide. They were that terrified of the welfare.\u201d The first and only time Swan went through the gates of the pool was in 2012, when she was invited to the opening of the $8m MAAC refurbishment. She walked in, spent five minutes and walked out again. \u201cWe were never allowed in there, so why go now?\u201d she says. Those who go these days, Duncan says, can feel like they are under surveillance. \u201cA lot of our kids have been in trouble at that pool. They seem to watch the Murri kids there all the time.\u201d Binge says there is a list of kids who\u2019ve been banned from the pool, some for up to a year. While the council did not confirm MAAC held a list of banned patrons, it did outline what might lead to exclusion. \u201cBy way of example only, during the school holidays, an exclusion was put in place to address a patron spitting on an employee. \u201cThe safety of patrons of the MAAC is also of paramount importance. Exclusions have been implemented for patron failures in this respect. This covers a range of behaviours including running on concourses, patrons repeatedly interfering with swimming lessons and jumping in lanes in front of small children learning to swim laps. \u201cExclusion might range from an overnight exclusion to more lengthy exclusion \u2026 depending on the nature of the behaviour. Longer periods of exclusion require a conference between the offender and the CEO to agree the terms of re-entry.\u201d Council is \u201cacutely aware of the events of the past\u201d, Humphries says. \u201cWe, together with many members of our community, have worked hard to ensure that our commitment to recognition, respect and inclusion is demonstrated by our actions.\u201d Humphries says the council received $10,000 from the NSW government\u2019s drought stimulus package \u201cto subsidise summer holiday pool activities. The funding was targeted at young people and activities for young people.\u201d Council also offered a free pool event late last month. In 2015, Humphries says, council commemorations of the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Ride, \u201cfunded by the Moree Plains shire ratepayers\u201d, included a smoking ceremony \u201cto cleanse the facility, with the aim of ensuring that all members of the Moree Plains community felt the MAAC was a place where everyone is welcome\u201d. The pool was given national heritage status in 2013 because of its \u201coutstanding value to the nation\u201d as the place where student protests in 1965 highlighted the legalised segregation and racism experienced by Aboriginal people.\u201d",

As revealed by Guardian Australia, the Labor leader will use a speech to a progressive thinktank on Friday to commit the ALP to adopting a net-zero target by 2050 if it wins the next federal election, without the use of carryover credits from the Kyoto period. While Scott Morrison is holding off from making a commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050, partly because of an internal brawl within the Coalition and partly because the prime minister says Australia should not sign up to targets in the absence of costings, Albanese will say on Friday that adopting net-zero \u201cshould be as non-controversial in Australia as it is in most nations\u201d.

Cormann accused Labor of committing to targets without setting out the cost, warning that Albanese is \u201cmaking the same mistake\u201d as former leader Bill Shorten. Earlier, Labor\u2019s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, told Radio National the opposition would set out a detailed policy about how to achieve targets and its cost \u201cwell before\u201d the next election. Butler argued that the cost of reducing emissions should not be divorced from the cost of inaction and noted Melbourne University research had found actions to reduce emissions have a benefit cost ratio of 20 to one. He also noted the CSIRO had found a net zero emissions path \u201cwill deliver higher wages and lower energy bills\u201d in modelling relied on by the New South Wales Berejiklian government when it set its target of zero emissions by 2050.

To do this, they fed the program information on the atomic and molecular features of nearly 2,500 drugs and natural compounds, and how well or not the substance blocked the growth of the bug E coli.</p> <p>Once the algorithm had learned what molecular features made for good antibiotics, the scientists set it working on a library of more than 6,000 compounds under investigation for treating various human diseases. Rather than looking for any potential antimicrobials, the algorithm focused on compounds that looked effective but unlike existing antibiotics. This boosted the chances that the drugs would work in radical new ways that bugs had yet to develop resistance to.</p> <p>Jonathan Stokes, the first author of the study, said it took a matter of hours for the algorithm to assess the compounds and come up with some promising antibiotics. One, which the researchers named \u201chalicin\u201d after Hal, the astronaut-bothering AI in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, looked particularly potent.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/\">Cell</a>, the researchers describe how they treated numerous drug-resistant infections with halicin, a compound that was originally developed to treat diabetes, but which fell by the wayside before it reached the clinic.</p> <p>Tests on bacteria collected from patients showed that halicin killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bug that causes TB, and strains of Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to carbapenems, a group of antibiotics that are considered the last resort for such infections. Halicin also cleared C difficile and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in mice.</p> <p>To hunt for more new drugs, the team next turned to a massive digital database of about 1.5bn compounds. They set the algorithm working on 107m of these. Three days later, the program returned a shortlist of 23 potential antibiotics, of which two appear to be particularly potent. The scientists now intend to search more of the database.</p> <p>Stokes said it would have been impossible to screen all 107m compounds by the conventional route of obtaining or making the substances and then testing them in the lab. \u201cBeing able to perform these experiments in the computer dramatically reduces the time and cost to look at these compounds,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Barzilay now wants to use the algorithm to find antibiotics that are more selective in the bacteria they kill. This would mean that taking the antibiotic kills only the bugs causing an infection, and not all the healthy bacteria that live in the gut. More ambitiously, the scientists aim to use the algorithm to design potent new antibiotics from scratch.</p> <p>\u201cThe work really is remarkable,\u201d said Jacob Durrant, who works on computer-aided drug design at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cTheir approach highlights the power of computer-aided drug discovery. It would be impossible to physically test over 100m compounds for antibiotic activity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGiven typical drug-development costs, in terms of both time and money, any method that can speed early-stage drug discovery has the potential to make a big impact,\u201d he added.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A powerful antibiotic that kills some of the most dangerous drug-resistant bacteria in the world has been discovered using artificial intelligence. The drug works in a different way to existing antibacterials and is the first of its kind to be found by setting AI loose on vast digital libraries of pharmaceutical compounds. Tests showed that the drug wiped out a range of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, including Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae, two of the three high-priority pathogens that the World Health Organization ranks as \u201ccritical\u201d for new antibiotics to target. \u201cIn terms of antibiotic discovery, this is absolutely a first,\u201d said Regina Barzilay, a senior researcher on the project and specialist in machine learning at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). \u201cI think this is one of the more powerful antibiotics that has been discovered to date,\u201d added James Collins, a bioengineer on the team at MIT. \u201cIt has remarkable activity against a broad range of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.\u201d Antibiotic resistance arises when bacteria mutate and evolve to sidestep the mechanisms that antimicrobial drugs use to kill them. Without new antibiotics to tackle resistance, 10 million lives around the world could be at risk each year from infections by 2050, the Cameron government\u2019s O\u2019Neill report warned. To find new antibiotics, the researchers first trained a \u201cdeep learning\u201d algorithm to identify the sorts of molecules that kill bacteria. To do this, they fed the program information on the atomic and molecular features of nearly 2,500 drugs and natural compounds, and how well or not the substance blocked the growth of the bug E coli. Once the algorithm had learned what molecular features made for good antibiotics, the scientists set it working on a library of more than 6,000 compounds under investigation for treating various human diseases. Rather than looking for any potential antimicrobials, the algorithm focused on compounds that looked effective but unlike existing antibiotics. This boosted the chances that the drugs would work in radical new ways that bugs had yet to develop resistance to. Jonathan Stokes, the first author of the study, said it took a matter of hours for the algorithm to assess the compounds and come up with some promising antibiotics. One, which the researchers named \u201chalicin\u201d after Hal, the astronaut-bothering AI in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, looked particularly potent. Writing in the journal Cell, the researchers describe how they treated numerous drug-resistant infections with halicin, a compound that was originally developed to treat diabetes, but which fell by the wayside before it reached the clinic. Tests on bacteria collected from patients showed that halicin killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bug that causes TB, and strains of Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to carbapenems, a group of antibiotics that are considered the last resort for such infections. Halicin also cleared C difficile and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in mice. To hunt for more new drugs, the team next turned to a massive digital database of about 1.5bn compounds. They set the algorithm working on 107m of these. Three days later, the program returned a shortlist of 23 potential antibiotics, of which two appear to be particularly potent. The scientists now intend to search more of the database. Stokes said it would have been impossible to screen all 107m compounds by the conventional route of obtaining or making the substances and then testing them in the lab. \u201cBeing able to perform these experiments in the computer dramatically reduces the time and cost to look at these compounds,\u201d he said. Barzilay now wants to use the algorithm to find antibiotics that are more selective in the bacteria they kill. This would mean that taking the antibiotic kills only the bugs causing an infection, and not all the healthy bacteria that live in the gut. More ambitiously, the scientists aim to use the algorithm to design potent new antibiotics from scratch. \u201cThe work really is remarkable,\u201d said Jacob Durrant, who works on computer-aided drug design at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cTheir approach highlights the power of computer-aided drug discovery. It would be impossible to physically test over 100m compounds for antibiotic activity.\u201d \u201cGiven typical drug-development costs, in terms of both time and money, any method that can speed early-stage drug discovery has the potential to make a big impact,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Bulldozers have begun tearing down one of the four sail-shaped tower blocks in the Scampia housing estate in Naples, one of the biggest drug-dealing centres in Europe and the setting for the Italian TV drama Gomorrah. For decades these run-down apartment blocks have been the scene of bloody wars between Camorra clans. Local authorities have described the demolition as a historic moment for the city. A special claw crane, 50 metres tall and weighing 130 tonnes, is being employed to raze three of the buildings, which were a symbol not only of criminality but also of the failures of Italy\u2019s postwar dream of social housing. TV crews from every part of the world descended on Scampia to film the \u201cfall of Gomorrah\u201d. Meanwhile, former inhabitants observed the destruction of their homes in silence. For 30 years the residents were forced into silence by the criminal clans, looked upon with indifference by the press and hounded by the police. Despite acknowledging the need to raze an uninhabitable area of the city, some residents could not hide their sadness as they witnessed the buildings\u2019 demise. \u201cIt is as if they were demolishing a piece of my life,\u201d said Anna De Martino, 53. \u201cMy daughter and my grandchild, who is only three years old, were born in this vela (sail). He is still too small to understand, but this morning he asked me to take the house we had here and bring it to the temporary house where we live today.\u201d Some inhabitants of the so-called green vela that was bulldozed on Thursday have been transferred to new apartments and others have been temporarily transferred to the only one of the four buildings that will remain standing. That building will be renovated. \u201cI was born and I got married on this vela,\u201d said Rosa Amato, 25. \u201cDespite the TV series and the films, people lived here \u2013 real people, with real stories. Here today, a piece of my history dies.\u201d Built between 1965 and 1980 by the architect Francesco di Salvo, le Vele (the Sails) were designed to replace the slums and squalor of the medieval city centre of Naples. Seven apartment blocks were built; three were demolished between 1998 and 2003). The idea was to recreate housing complexes in the outskirts of Naples that would evoke the narrow alleyways of the \u201cold city\u201d to encourage community relations, and create infrastructure and green spaces for the poor. Di Salvo\u2019s dreams were quickly dashed as funds were siphoned into private pockets. Many of the blocks were left unfinished and the alleyways that di Salvo hoped to create were soon transformed into a warren for dealing heroin and evading the police. Scampia became Gomorrah and the Vele its fortress. In 2006, Roberto Saviano wrote a book that would change the history of the Camorra and that of Scampia. His revelations of the brutality and business deals of the Neapolitan clans shone an international light on the local mafia. The book was titled Gomorrah, a pun on the Camorra and the sinful Biblical city. The degradation of the Vele continued to make news around the world when in 2008 Saviano\u2019s book became the subject of a film directed by Matteo Garrone, and then in 2014 a crime drama TV series. The Vele would become the backdrop for the power struggles of Genny Savastano, Ciro Di Marzio and Don Patrizia, fictional characters inspired by real criminals. In time, the residents of Scampia began to grow tired of the degradation that was synonymous with poverty and organised crime and started campaigning for new apartments to be built. \u201cI lived in one of these buildings in Scampia for 20 years and, believe me, we had enough of all the people who slandered us, saying we were the inhabitants of Gomorrah,\u201d said Lorenzo Liparulo, one of the leaders of the residents\u2019 association. \u201cThere are people here who lived with dignity, despite everything.\u201d Last year the authorities announced the demolition plans. The work was held up when workers found tonnes of asbestos. \u201cIt is a beautiful day for all of our city and Italy,\u201d said the mayor of Naples, Luigi de Magistris, at a press conference before the demolition began. Time will soon be up for the Vele but in order to destroy the real Gomorrah much more time will be needed. For years a banner hanging from one of the buildings read: \u201cWhen the winds of oppression cease, the sails will be unfurled toward happiness.\u201d A new banner hanging from the vela that began to be demolished on Thursday read: \u201cThis is only the beginning.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Although she became one of the most loved and reliable of character actors on stage and television, Frances Cuka, who has died aged 83, seemed destined for stardom when her career took off like a rocket in the late 1950s with Joan Littlewood at Stratford East and George Devine at the Royal Court. For Littlewood, she originated the role of the pregnant teenager Jo in Shelagh Delaney\u2019s A Taste of Honey (1958), acclaimed by Kenneth Tynan for acting \u201cwith a shock-haired, careless passion that suggests an embryonic Anna Magnani. She was, he felt, an actor with a lot of love to give. When invited to so deliver, she invariably did. On joining Devine\u2019s Royal Court she appeared in John Arden\u2019s Live Like Pigs (1958) \u2013 a remarkable study of working-class factions on a northern council estate \u2013 and in Samuel Beckett\u2019s Endgame with Devine and Jack MacGowran, before hitting the West End in A Taste of Honey and, in 1961, succeeding Joan Plowright as Jo on Broadway. In between, she was a notable firebrand in Peter Hall\u2019s famous 1960 season at Stratford-upon-Avon which heralded the birth of the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing with Peter O\u2019Toole, Diana Rigg, Dorothy Tutin, Eric Porter and Ian Richardson. She was Jessica in The Merchant of Venice (O\u2019Toole as Shylock) and Maria, one of her signature roles, in Twelfth Night (Tutin played Viola). Small, energetic and red-haired, she was always a powerful and sympathetic presence, especially good in comedy. But, unluckily, she missed out on the film of A Taste of Honey (Rita Tushingham was an overnight sensation as Jo) just as, years later, having been cast as Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders, the role was reassigned to Jo Warne (for only 10 episodes) before Barbara Windsor stepped in and relaunched her career so spectacularly. Cuka\u2019s career seemed to settle into a pattern of welcome familiarity, but occasionally she would come into sharper focus and assert her true pedigree \u2013 most memorably, perhaps, when starring opposite Michael Crawford in Bernard Slade\u2019s Same Time, Next Year (1976) at the Prince of Wales, in which a one-night stand between a couple married to other people is replayed once a year with many a poignantly comic reverberation. The discreet sexiness of this role suited Cuka, who was encouraged to unbutton more extravagantly on television as Doll Tearsheet in Henry IV, Part Two in the BBC Shakespeare series, or as homeless Mrs Bassey in Casualty, suffering a grisly death from burns in an explosion in a shopping mall. Her last television appearance came in Channel 4\u2019s sitcom Friday Night Dinner (from 2011 to 2017) as Nelly Buller, the mother of Jackie Goodman (Tamsin Greig), another vibrantly awkward elderly customer. Cuka \u2013 pronounced Chewka \u2013 was born in London, the only child of Joseph Cuka, a process engraver of Czech antecedence, and his wife Letitia (nee Francis), a tailor. She was educated at Tollington prep school in Fortis Green, north London, and, when her parents moved to the south coast, Brighton and Hove high school.

Two years in repertory around the country took her to Littlewood\u2019s Theatre Workshop, with whom she toured to the Zurich festival and the Moscow Art theatre in 1957. In the heady next few years she played (and sang) Becky Sharp in a musical of Vanity Fair (1962) by Robin Miller and Julian Slade that flopped at the Queen\u2019s theatre after two months. She was back at the Royal Court, London, for the 1965-66 season playing Mary Godwin in Ann Jellicoe\u2019s Shelley, Annie in Jane Howell\u2019s revival of Arden\u2019s Serjeant Musgrave\u2019s Dance and Mrs Allwit in William Gaskill\u2019s stylish revival of Thomas Middleton\u2019s Jacobean city comedy, A Chaste Maid in Cheapside. Her association with the RSC continued at the Aldwych in the late 60s in Marguerite Duras\u2019s Days in the Trees with Peggy Ashcroft, the Pinter double bill of Landscape and Silence and Se\u00e1n O\u2019Casey\u2019s The Silver Tassie with Ben Kingsley, Helen Mirren and Patrick Stewart.

A limited but eclectic roster of films included The Watcher in the Woods (1980), a supernatural thriller with Bette Davis and Carroll Baker; Bob Rafelson\u2019s Mountains of the Moon (1990); a Gothic horror twist on Snow White (1997) with Sigourney Weaver as the wicked stepmother; Roman Polanski\u2019s Oliver Twist (2005) with Kingsley as Fagin; and Closer to the Moon (2014) a bizarre Romanian heist comedy starring Mark Strong.

      "body": "<h2>\u2018ON A JOB?\u2019</h2> \n<p>While contemplating the nature of the afterlife in the hit 2008 movie In Bruges, it occurred to Ray, the guilt-ridden Irish hitman, that hell might be \u201cthe entire rest of eternity\u201d spent in the eponymous picture-perfect Flemish city in north-west Belgium. Despite his low opinion of his surroundings, the city remains such a magnet for curious, camera-toting visitors enjoying mini-breaks that the mayor felt compelled last year to crack down on tourist numbers to avoid his manor becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/16/bruges-crackdown-tourist-numbers\">\u201ca complete Disneyland\u201d</a>. Now, however, the city is welcoming day-trippers of a different kind, the travelling supporters of Manchester United having converged on the city to see their team take on Club Brugge in Big Vase. On paper, it is hardly a fixture to get the heart racing, although the prospect of an afternoon spent swilling fine Belgian beers in one of the continent\u2019s more picturesque squares should make for one of European football\u2019s most pleasantly genteel experiences.</p> \n<p>In stark contrast, a cold, wet Thursday night in Wolverhampton might not be as appealing for the discerning tourist, but try telling that to supporters of Espanyol. Enjoying their first taste of European football for 13 years, they take on Wolves, for whom this season\u2019s adventures on the continent are also a novelty to be savoured. \u201cYes, the fans are enjoying the trip with us and we want more of this atmosphere at Molineux,\u201d said Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, as a gaggle of excitable Spaniards wandered past on their way to explore the myriad delights of the Wulfrun Shopping Centre.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/mikel-arteta-sounds-warning-as-arsenal-prepare-for-challenge-of-olympiakos\">Mikel Arteta sounds warning as Arsenal prepare for challenge of Olympiakos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Meanwhile in Glasgow, Nando\u2019s on Sauciehall Street is currently a hive of activity, what with visiting Braga fans seeking out a taste of home before their last-32 first leg against the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers.

In Denmark, Queen\u2019s Celtic fans currently enjoying the many herbal stimulants available for purchase on Pusher Street in the laid-back, autonomous freetown of Christiana may need reminding that their game against FC Copenhagen is among the early kick-offs. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult and we\u2019ll have to think our way through it,\u201d said Neil Lennon, failing to specify if he was talking about his players or those who have travelled to support them.</p> \n<p>And finally, in other European mini-break news, it\u2019s deja vu all over again for Gooners wandering around the Parthenon before Arsenal\u2019s fifth trip <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/mikel-arteta-sounds-warning-as-arsenal-prepare-for-challenge-of-olympiakos\">to take on Olympiakos</a> in 10 years.

      "bodyText": "\u2018ON A JOB?\u2019 While contemplating the nature of the afterlife in the hit 2008 movie In Bruges, it occurred to Ray, the guilt-ridden Irish hitman, that hell might be \u201cthe entire rest of eternity\u201d spent in the eponymous picture-perfect Flemish city in north-west Belgium. Despite his low opinion of his surroundings, the city remains such a magnet for curious, camera-toting visitors enjoying mini-breaks that the mayor felt compelled last year to crack down on tourist numbers to avoid his manor becoming \u201ca complete Disneyland\u201d. Now, however, the city is welcoming day-trippers of a different kind, the travelling supporters of Manchester United having converged on the city to see their team take on Club Brugge in Big Vase. On paper, it is hardly a fixture to get the heart racing, although the prospect of an afternoon spent swilling fine Belgian beers in one of the continent\u2019s more picturesque squares should make for one of European football\u2019s most pleasantly genteel experiences. In stark contrast, a cold, wet Thursday night in Wolverhampton might not be as appealing for the discerning tourist, but try telling that to supporters of Espanyol. Enjoying their first taste of European football for 13 years, they take on Wolves, for whom this season\u2019s adventures on the continent are also a novelty to be savoured. \u201cYes, the fans are enjoying the trip with us and we want more of this atmosphere at Molineux,\u201d said Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, as a gaggle of excitable Spaniards wandered past on their way to explore the myriad delights of the Wulfrun Shopping Centre. Meanwhile in Glasgow, Nando\u2019s on Sauciehall Street is currently a hive of activity, what with visiting Braga fans seeking out a taste of home before their last-32 first leg against the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers. With VAR being used for the first time in this season\u2019s competition, $tevie Mbe has warned his players not to do anything stupid. \u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure \u2013 we\u2019re going to have to be careful, and make sure we behave,\u201d he tooted, his perma-furrowed brow furrowing just that little bit more as he stared forlornly in the direction of Alfredo Morelos. In Denmark, Queen\u2019s Celtic fans currently enjoying the many herbal stimulants available for purchase on Pusher Street in the laid-back, autonomous freetown of Christiana may need reminding that their game against FC Copenhagen is among the early kick-offs. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult and we\u2019ll have to think our way through it,\u201d said Neil Lennon, failing to specify if he was talking about his players or those who have travelled to support them. And finally, in other European mini-break news, it\u2019s deja vu all over again for Gooners wandering around the Parthenon before Arsenal\u2019s fifth trip to take on Olympiakos in 10 years. Like the famous temple, both clubs have seen better days, as all four of their previous European ties have been in Big Cup. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Tumaini Carayol from 5.55pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Club Brugge 2-1 Manchester United, while John Brewin and Daniel Harris will be clockwatching the rest of Big Vase. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThis decision has cost our player the chance to play in a national cup final, not something that comes along every week, to the detriment of the player, his teammates, the club and our fans. We believe it also damages the credibility of our governing body and brings the game into disrepute The decision is plainly wrong and the dogs in the street know this.

      "body": "<p>One thing successful musicians have to do a lot of is travel, and when you travel with an instrument, you increase its chances of getting damaged. Early this month, the Malian musician Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko\u2019s kora <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/06/malian-musician-kora-ballake-sissoko-dismantled-tsa-us-customs\" title=\"\">was taken apart by US border agents</a> when he left New York, something Sissoko only discovered when he picked it up in Paris. A few days later, Louis Levitt discovered <a href=\"https://www.thestrad.com/news/double-bass-cracked-after-united-airlines-flight/10198.article\" title=\"\">a four-inch crack in his $100,000 double bass</a> after it had been unpacked for security screening at Newark airport, and a few days after that, specialist instrument movers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/11/virtuoso-mourns-beloved-150000-piano-smashed-by-movers\" title=\"\">dropped Angela Hewitt\u2019s \u00a3150,000 F278 Fazioli piano</a> while removing it from a studio after a recording session, rendering it \u201cunsalvageable\u201d.</p> <p>The loss of an instrument, though, is about more than inconvenience or financial cost. It\u2019s about the loss of something that can feel like an integral part of a musician\u2019s being \u2013 it\u2019s their means of self-expression. And after years of playing one instrument, simply swapping to another isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds \u2013 musicians and their instruments have relationships and losing one can be as hard as losing a lover. Here, five musicians talk about the instruments they play, and what those instruments mean to them.</p> <h2><strong>Brittany Howard, Alabama Shakes<br>Gibson SG Custom in Inverness Green</strong></h2> <p>A special instrument feels like an extra limb. Once you find that one instrument, a replacement is really hard to come by, and you have to introduce yourself to a whole new limb and get used to it all over again.</p> <p>This SG is one I was instantly comfortable with, and it just stuck. If I break a string halfway through the set and they pass me a different guitar, it just plays different. It\u2019s hard to describe if you\u2019re not a guitar player \u2013 it fits perfectly in your hand, and your hands know what you\u2019re doing, because you\u2019ve worked with the instrument for so long. That way, you are comfortable expressing yourself, and of course the easier an instrument it is to play, the easier it is to express yourself.</p> <p>My number one thing for my guitar techs is: do not clean the pickups. I like the sound of pickups that are worn down and kind of degraded \u2013 it\u2019s just more interesting sounding. That is why my SG is so unique, because of how the pickups were wound, and how long it has been since they were cleaned up. </p> <p>I think this one is from the early 80s. It has cigarette burns on it, because other people had it before me. It had some cracked paint in the back. The white of the trim has faded into the yellow colour, and all those things hold the history of the instrument. And truthfully, I\u2019ve never checked it in with an airline, because I don\u2019t trust them. It comes with me on the flight, or it\u2019s shipped to meet me in a protective case. That\u2019s my right. Everyone else gets to bring their laptops and their work; I can bring my guitar.</p> <h2><strong>Paul Hartnoll, Orbital<br>Roland Jupiter 6 synthesiser</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"231385d45a65757cd152628356b1d9bd09eb5398\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/231385d45a65757cd152628356b1d9bd09eb5398/0_335_5610_3365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Everyone\u2019s Roland 909 feels different\u2019 \u2026 Paul Hartnoll with his synthesiser and brother Phil.

Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I went into Sevenoaks Guitars, a secondhand shop, one day in 1991 or 1992, and they had this big old analogue synth blunderbluss for \u00a3200. It was my first proper analogue poly synth, and the thing I learned on; it was so integral to the music of the first three or four albums that I can\u2019t do without it. I\u2019ve tried to replace it, but nothing else will do. About a year ago it started playing up and I got another one that cost something like \u00a34,200, but it\u2019s not the same. So I\u2019m going back to my old one, which has been serviced and repaired. Old synthesisers are like old cars \u2013 they work best if you use them all the time, so even if I\u2019m not using them, I\u2019ll tweak a few knobs to keep them happy.</p> <p>Every instrument feels different. Even drum machines \u2013 everyone\u2019s Roland 909 feels different. I\u2019ll be saying, \u201cOh, this one\u2019s got tribal tom-toms,\u201d and everyone else will be saying, \u201cWhat are you talking about? They all sound exactly the same.\u201d I think the differences between synths are more pronounced on the big, old analogue models, though. That\u2019s partly because of the devil-may-care way they were made by hand, and partly age. As they grow older, the lines grow deeper and they diverge from each other, depending on what they\u2019ve been through: a well-toured Jupiter sounds different from one that has sat in a studio. Classical musicians say instruments mellow with age, and it\u2019s the same with synthesisers.

And over the years I have put a lot of love and care and tending to it, and now everyone who touches it is in awe at its beauty and tone.</p> <p>Familiarity builds a unique relationship with an instrument, because you\u2019re investing your time and your care. There\u2019s something about getting acclimated to all of the quirks and resonances, but it also gets acclimated to your touch and hand. It\u2019s a deep familiarity. There is less translation time between what your ear wants to create and what your body can facilitate. For me, and anyone in the improvisational world, that\u2019s so important. You want to know you can immediately respond to what you perceive.</p> <p>Sometimes the relationship with an instrument is never really consummated, and that\u2019s a cue, too. With the bass I have now, for many years I struggled with it. It was very difficult to play, but I loved the sound. Now, after 15 years, it feels like home. It will keep accumulating with me, and that relationship will deepen. It\u2019s a constant.</p> <p>There is also something about the intention the instrument was made with. In a way, the luthiers are mystics, too, because they are creating these vessels for divine vibrations to enter the world through. When you are using an instrument that\u2019s been made for a particular player, through a particular cultural lineage, the instrument itself is charged with so much spirit that it has to be treated with reverence. They are like sacred objects. That\u2019s why it was so painful to hear about Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko\u2019s kora.</p> <h2><strong>Theon Cross, Sons of Kemet and solo player<br>Besson Sovereign 982 and Yamaha Neo Maestro 632 double E-flat tubas</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a050b89f6014f60a511d54060a30de7d064e09b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a050b89f6014f60a511d54060a30de7d064e09b7/0_191_5472_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If something happens to it, I can\u2019t work\u2019 \u2026 Theon Cross and his tuba.

      "bodyText": "One thing successful musicians have to do a lot of is travel, and when you travel with an instrument, you increase its chances of getting damaged. Early this month, the Malian musician Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko\u2019s kora was taken apart by US border agents when he left New York, something Sissoko only discovered when he picked it up in Paris. A few days later, Louis Levitt discovered a four-inch crack in his $100,000 double bass after it had been unpacked for security screening at Newark airport, and a few days after that, specialist instrument movers dropped Angela Hewitt\u2019s \u00a3150,000 F278 Fazioli piano while removing it from a studio after a recording session, rendering it \u201cunsalvageable\u201d. The loss of an instrument, though, is about more than inconvenience or financial cost. It\u2019s about the loss of something that can feel like an integral part of a musician\u2019s being \u2013 it\u2019s their means of self-expression. And after years of playing one instrument, simply swapping to another isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds \u2013 musicians and their instruments have relationships and losing one can be as hard as losing a lover. Here, five musicians talk about the instruments they play, and what those instruments mean to them. Brittany Howard, Alabama Shakes Gibson SG Custom in Inverness Green A special instrument feels like an extra limb. Once you find that one instrument, a replacement is really hard to come by, and you have to introduce yourself to a whole new limb and get used to it all over again. This SG is one I was instantly comfortable with, and it just stuck. If I break a string halfway through the set and they pass me a different guitar, it just plays different. It\u2019s hard to describe if you\u2019re not a guitar player \u2013 it fits perfectly in your hand, and your hands know what you\u2019re doing, because you\u2019ve worked with the instrument for so long. That way, you are comfortable expressing yourself, and of course the easier an instrument it is to play, the easier it is to express yourself. My number one thing for my guitar techs is: do not clean the pickups. I like the sound of pickups that are worn down and kind of degraded \u2013 it\u2019s just more interesting sounding. That is why my SG is so unique, because of how the pickups were wound, and how long it has been since they were cleaned up. I think this one is from the early 80s. It has cigarette burns on it, because other people had it before me. It had some cracked paint in the back. The white of the trim has faded into the yellow colour, and all those things hold the history of the instrument. And truthfully, I\u2019ve never checked it in with an airline, because I don\u2019t trust them. It comes with me on the flight, or it\u2019s shipped to meet me in a protective case. That\u2019s my right. Everyone else gets to bring their laptops and their work; I can bring my guitar. Paul Hartnoll, Orbital Roland Jupiter 6 synthesiser I went into Sevenoaks Guitars, a secondhand shop, one day in 1991 or 1992, and they had this big old analogue synth blunderbluss for \u00a3200. It was my first proper analogue poly synth, and the thing I learned on; it was so integral to the music of the first three or four albums that I can\u2019t do without it. I\u2019ve tried to replace it, but nothing else will do. About a year ago it started playing up and I got another one that cost something like \u00a34,200, but it\u2019s not the same. So I\u2019m going back to my old one, which has been serviced and repaired. Old synthesisers are like old cars \u2013 they work best if you use them all the time, so even if I\u2019m not using them, I\u2019ll tweak a few knobs to keep them happy. Every instrument feels different. Even drum machines \u2013 everyone\u2019s Roland 909 feels different. I\u2019ll be saying, \u201cOh, this one\u2019s got tribal tom-toms,\u201d and everyone else will be saying, \u201cWhat are you talking about? They all sound exactly the same.\u201d I think the differences between synths are more pronounced on the big, old analogue models, though. That\u2019s partly because of the devil-may-care way they were made by hand, and partly age. As they grow older, the lines grow deeper and they diverge from each other, depending on what they\u2019ve been through: a well-toured Jupiter sounds different from one that has sat in a studio. Classical musicians say instruments mellow with age, and it\u2019s the same with synthesisers. When people say, \u201cWhy can\u2019t new synths sound the same as vintage ones?\u201d the answer is because they haven\u2019t aged. I know my Jupiter 6 inside out. I am fluent in it. I can have an idea and I know what it will do with that idea. I know how many millimetres to move my fingers on its controls without even needing to look. I find myself playing with eyes closed, like a prog rock guitarist. Esperanza Spalding 5/8 upright bass, Czech-made, c1900 I don\u2019t travel with this bass. I\u2019ve had basses rolled over by luggage trucks; all sorts of horrible things have happened, so I learned my lesson quickly.

Serco, which runs Yarl\u2019s Wood detention centre in Bedfordshire, would take over Brook House and Tinsley House immigration removal centres near Gatwick airport from May 2020 for eight years, the Home Office said. As recently as last week, Yarl\u2019s Wood was caught up in controversy after a Nigerian woman told a court hearing she was thrown to the floor \u201clike a bag of cement\u201d in an incident involving 11 Serco guards. Serco was severely criticised for its mass eviction of asylum seekers in Glasgow last year, although the courts ultimately deemed the move was lawful. In 2015, a dossier of a decade of complaints about sexual abuse and mistreatment at Yarl\u2019s Wood was handed to MPs. The FTSE 250 company holds contracts to monitor and run detention facilities in Australia, including the controversial Christmas Island detention centre in the Indian Ocean that has been fiercely criticised by campaigners over harsh treatment of asylum seekers. The immigration minister, Kevin Foster, said: \u201cDetention plays a key but limited role in the wider immigration system and ensures we can remove foreign national offenders and those with no legal right to be in the UK. \u201cThis contract is a major step forward in our programme of immigration detention reform. It will significantly improve the day-to-day lives of detainees and the staff who support them.\u201d Serco is taking over operations at Brook House and Tinsley House from another outsourcing multinational, G4S, which announced in September it was to stop operating at the centres. In September 2017, the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme broadcast undercover footage showing alleged assaults, humiliation and verbal abuse of detainees by officers at Brook House. Fourteen members of G4S staff were dismissed or resigned after the broadcast and the Home Office asked the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman to carry out an investigation. The inquiry was delayed pending legal action. Last year, inspectors found there was \u201cno culture of abuse\u201d among current staff at Brook House, but a raft of improvements needed to be made. As part of the new contract, Serco must increase staff numbers, give detainees access to educational and skills-based activities, increase the number of welfare staff and provide new safeguarding and vulnerability training for staff. Rupert Soames, the Serco Group chief executive, said: \u201cSerco has a great deal of experience of caring for people in the immigration system both in the UK and internationally, and we understand the sensitivity and complexity of this role. \u201cWe know that staff and managers at Gatwick IRC have worked hard to achieve improvements in recent years and we look forward to working with them to build upon this further. \u201cThe Home Office has made significant investment in the design and resourcing of the new contract, and we are committed to ensuring that there is a healthy, decent environment in the centres for all residents and employees.\u201d",

The setting seems appropriate given several crucial scenes in the movie take place on terraces or balconies. In one, the reunited lovers, Ocho (Juan Barberini) and Javi (Ram\u00f3n Pujol), share a post-coital meal of wine and cheese with Barcelona spread out beneath them in the dusk. It is from here that the action flashes back to the same city two decades earlier, when the lives of both men, then in their 20s, were markedly different.</p> <p>What doesn\u2019t change is their appearance.

Ocho seems physically looser as a younger man and far quicker to smile, while Javi in his 20s has a perkiness that has hardened by his 40s into something more sceptical, even wary. When I call Pujol, at home in Barcelona, he says: \u201cIf you think about how you were 20 years ago, it\u2019s not as if you imagine yourself younger. You just see yourself as this unchanging fact. What I did was to consider how Javi related to Ocho now compared to when they first met. He still likes him and there\u2019s the nostalgia, which is new, but it\u2019s not the same kind of fascination he had before.

Since the position was established in the wake of the 9/11 attacks to coordinate the 17 intelligence agencies, the office of the director of national intelligence has been viewed as non-partisan, and generally occupied by career professionals.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has appointed the US ambassador to Germany, a combative loyalist, to his administration\u2019s most senior intelligence post, in his continuing effort to wield personal control over the spy agencies, according to multiple US reports. By making Richard Grenell acting director of national intelligence (DNI), rather than nominating him for the permanent position, Trump has sidestepped the need for Senate confirmation, a loophole the president has increasingly exploited as he has moved to replace career officials with those chosen for their personal loyalty. The move marks a radical break from past practice. Since the position was established in the wake of the 9/11 attacks to coordinate the 17 intelligence agencies, the office of the director of national intelligence has been viewed as non-partisan, and generally occupied by career professionals. The current acting DNI, Joseph Maguire, is a retired vice-admiral and former head of the National Counterterrorism Center. Grenell does not have a background in intelligence or the armed services, but the White House statement confirming the appointment claimed Grenell had \u201cyears of experience\u201d working with the intelligence community in other jobs, as special envoy to Serbia and Kosovo peace talks (a job he was given in October) and while he was spokesman at the US mission to the UN from 2001 to 2008. \u201cHe is committed to a non-political, non-partisan approach as head of the intelligence community, on which our safety and security depend,\u201d the statement said. Until now Grenell has been best known as a Twitter warrior, lashing out at critics of the Trump administration with a ferocity that captured the president\u2019s attention. Grenell has also been an outspoken advocate of LGBT rights, and has made the issue part of his brief as ambassador. According to some reports, he will remain ambassador to Berlin and special envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations while overseeing the US intelligence agencies. Neither the state department nor the White House would comment on those reports on Thursday. The president has been a bitter critic of the intelligence agencies, particularly when their assessments were at odds with his own \u2013 about Iran and North Korea, for example. He once derided agency chiefs as \u201cpassive and naive\u201d. His denunciations became so acerbic that the agency chiefs have stopped giving public briefings to Congress over national security threats. \u201cThe president has selected an individual without any intelligence experience to serve as the leader of the nation\u2019s intelligence community in an acting capacity,\u201d Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said, noting that Grenell was the second acting director in the post since the resignation of the last Senate-confirmed DNI, Dan Coats, last summer. Warner said that the acting appointments were an apparent \u201ceffort to sidestep the Senate\u2019s constitutional authority to advise and consent on such critical national security positions, and flouting the clear intent of Congress when it established the office of the director of national intelligence in 2004\u201d. \u201cThis should frighten you,\u201d the former National Security Agency lawyer Susan Hennessey said on Twitter. \u201cNot just brazen politicization of intelligence, but also someone who is utterly incompetent in an important security role.

      "bodyText": "Manchester City have built an incredible image around the world over the past few years. The City group controls clubs in North and South America, in Asia, Australia and beyond, and Manchester has been the centre of this global empire, a kind of footballing utopia. They have the best manager in the world and they have been winning trophies every year \u2013 even their training ground is incredible. It has been an extremely attractive proposition for any footballer and now, suddenly, questions arise. There will be some players in the squad who are not that bothered about the loss of European football, who will use Uefa\u2019s suspension to build a siege mentality, an opportunity to show togetherness and collective spirit. But for others the Champions League dream may be over if they do not make a change. It is just over a year since Erling Braut Haaland moved from Molde to Red Bull Salzburg and now he is breaking records in the Champions League for Borussia Dortmund. He is an example of how quickly players can establish themselves, going in a matter of months from obscurity in Norway to playing at the highest level for a major club in a top-five league and breaking into his national side. Time passes quickly in football and in two years reputations can be built or destroyed. Players now at their peak will probably find themselves in the twilight of their careers in two years. Sergio Ag\u00fcero will be 32 in the summer and if he does not win the Champions League by 2022, it is unlikely to happen. Kyle Walker will be 30 this summer; Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Kevin De Bruyne 29. I share a birthday with Riyad Mahrez, who is 29 on Friday. Which of these players will want to waste perhaps the last great years of their career when they could quite easily leave and go to another club where they can pursue fresh targets?

The tax filing, which discloses the coaches\u2019 salaries for the 2018 calendar year, showed Berhalter made $313,109 in the one month he was on the job after his 1 December appointment. Meanwhile, in 12 months of work, Ellis earned $418,645.</p> <p>Furthermore, Berhalter\u2019s base compensation for his first month of work \u2013 around $100,000 in salary, plus a $200,000 signing bonus \u2013 shows that his annual salary is at least $1.2m, more than double Ellis\u2019s salary. This is despite Ellis having been at the federation four years longer, and Berhalter having none of the proven success of Ellis, who had won one World Cup at that point. (She later went on to win another World Cup in 2019.)</p> <p>If Ellis had not stepped down from her post in October 2019 and stayed on to coach the USWNT through the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, she would have been entitled to an option on her contract that would\u2019ve bumped her pay up to $525,000, sources have told the Guardian. Since she ended up winning the World Cup again, maybe she could have negotiated a better pay raise \u2013 but then again, maybe not.</p> <p>After all, from US Soccer\u2019s standpoint, there has been little incentive to pay Ellis more \u2013 before she stepped down, she was already believed to be the highest-paid coach of a women\u2019s team anywhere in the world. Whereas Berhalter could earn competitive salaries at many clubs around the world, the risk that Ellis would have been lured elsewhere by more money was almost nil.</p> <p>The federation did give her a large raise midway through 2018, bumping her base pay up from around $300,000 to $500,000, sources have told the Guardian, which is why her actual compensation for 2018 is reported as $419,000. But it appears that decision was driven more by optics rather than an effort to retain her services.</p> <p>In the tax filing released this week, Ellis was listed as earning much less than several coaches on the men\u2019s side, including the under-20 men\u2019s coach. She was also paid less than three coaches who didn\u2019t even work for a full year and helped the USMNT miss the 2018 World Cup: J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, his assistant Andreas Herzog, and Bruce Arena.</p> <p>In fact, despite being fired in 2016, Klinsmann has continued to earn huge payouts from US Soccer. The tax filing released on Wednesday shows Klinsmann was the highest-paid employee in the entire federation in 2018, earning nearly $1.5m. Indeed, Klinsmann has been the best-paid coach US Soccer has ever had, and yet his compensation pales in comparison to the sums managers can command at super clubs around the world in men\u2019s football.</p> <p>That is at the heart of the big question for US Soccer: is adhering to market rates around the world a good enough excuse when it comes to paying the successful coach of a women\u2019s team much less than the coach of a mediocre men\u2019s team? Or is it incumbent on US Soccer to change market realities if it can?</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly difficult to look at anything Berhalter or Klinsmann have done and say their outsized compensation is deserved compared to Ellis. The Klinsmann contract was negotiated by a version of US Soccer that is slowly being dismantled \u2013 president Sunil Gulati, CEO Dan Flynn, and CCO Jay Berhalter have all stepped down \u2013 but Berhalter\u2019s salary was set by the new guard. (The man who hired Berhalter, US Soccer\u2019s first general manager Earnie Stewart, earned $305,778 for his first six months of work in 2018, according to the tax filings. His base salary was also higher than Ellis\u2019s.)</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s just a matter of expectations. Ellis steered the USWNT through a flawless campaign to qualify for the 2019 World Cup, and she did not even earn a bonus for doing so, according to the tax document.

      "bodyText": "Morgan Stanley is to buy the online brokerage E-Trade Financial for $13bn in the largest banking deal since the 2008 financial crisis. The takeover confirms a shift for Wall Street banks away from an old model of wealth management with brokers charging commissions on trades for a relatively limited pool of high net worth individuals and corporate clients and toward a model based on the needs of millions of individual investors. E-Trade, with 5.2 million client accounts and over $360bn of retail client assets, will be adding to Morgan Stanley\u2019s 3 million client accounts and $2.7tn of client assets, a press release said. The investment bank will pay $58.74 a share in stock for E-Trade in a deal that will combine to a total of close to $3.1tn in client assets. The Wall Street Journal, which broke news of the sale, said it would \u201ccombine a Wall Street firm in the late innings of a decade-long turnaround with a discount broker built on the backs of dot-com day traders.\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s CEO, James Gorman, told the paper: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about legacy-building; it\u2019s about getting Morgan Stanley ready for prime time.\u201d Last year, Charles Schwab made a $26bn purchase of TD Ameritrade, signalling consolidation in the discount brokerage industry that is facing pressure from zero commission trading. For Morgan Stanley, which was founded by John Pierpoint Morgan, an icon of the Gilded Age often credited with saving the US economy from collapse during the Panic of 1907, the purchase adds about $56bn in yearly E-Trade customer deposits that will provide \u201csignificant funding benefits\u201d the bank said. \u201cThere\u2019s a longer-term strategic play here around the digital opportunity and acquiring new corporate service customers and getting a higher percentage of their wallet over time,\u201d Devin Ryan, JMP Securities managing director of equity research, said \u201cE-trade has nearly 2 million corporate stock plan customers and so this strategically widens the potential opportunity for Morgan Stanley to convert those customers,\u201d Ryan added.

      "bodyText": "Closing summary The FTSE 100 is the major holdout across global stock indices thus far on Thursday, up by 0.2%, with Wall Street indices weakening and European stocks retreating from record highs. A couple of notable deals have given Wall Street investors something on which they can focus, with Victoria\u2019s Secret being sold into private hands and Morgan Stanley pushing further into investment management with the $13bn purchase of E-Trade. But as so often this month the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak has set the tone, with Air France-KLM, Qantas, shipping company Maersk and iPhone manufacturer Foxconn all warning of financial damage. Investors seeking safe havens appear to have rushed to the US dollar, forcing down the Japanese yen and the pound. Thank you as ever for joining us for live coverage of the worlds of business, economics and the markets \u2013 and come back tomorrow for more of the same. JJ Another big Wall Street deal announced today: Morgan Stanley is buying online stockbroking platform E-Trade for about $13bn. The combination will have $3.1tn in client assets and 8.2m retail client relationships and accounts \u2013 with E-Trade shifting the balance towards less wealthy customers and a more direct, lower-cost approach. The Associated Press calls it \u201cone of the biggest deals on Wall Street since the financial crisis\u201d and \u201cthe latest chapter in Morgan Stanley\u2019s transformation from the scrappy, deal-doing, stock-trading investment bank to a more well-rounded financial firm now more reliant on its asset and wealth management businesses\u201d. The combined wealth and investment management businesses will account for about 57% of the firm\u2019s pre-tax profits, compared to only approximately 26% in 2010. Stocks have dipped at the open on Wall Street. The Nasdaq, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 have all fallen by 0.2%. US stock market futures suggest that Wall Street is going to drop at the opening bell, following the lead of European markets. The FTSE 100 is the only major index that is not in the red \u2013 and it has only edged up by less than 0.1% (possibly thanks to the dollar surge, which makes US earnings relatively more valuable for companies that report in sterling). The Euro Stoxx 600 index has lost 0.5%, while France\u2019s Cac 40 and Germany\u2019s Dax have both lost 0.3%. The owner of Victoria\u2019s Secret will sell a majority stake in the controversial underwear brand at a $1.1bn ($850m) valuation, in a deal that will also see its chief executive resign. Private equity firm Sycamore Partners will buy 55% of the company for $525m, with L Brands retaining 45% minority stake. L Brands will use the money to reduce its debt pile and focus on its larger Bath and Body Works business, which is much larger than the underwear brand. Leslie Wexner will step down as chief executive of L Brands after 57 years as boss. L Brands bought Victoria\u2019s Secret in 1982. He will remain on the board as \u201cchairman emeritus\u201d. Victoria\u2019s Secret has struggled with falling profits and a change in attitudes from buyers. In November it cancelled its annual \u201cfashion show\u201d with falling viewer numbers. In August, Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s chief marketing officer Ed Razek stepped down. In a much-criticised interview with Vogue in 2018, Razek said the brand would not cast transgender or plus-sized models \u201cbecause the show is a fantasy\u201d. The company was reportedly founded to allow men to feel comfortable buying lingerie for their wives, and it has been hit by a series of controversies about its treatment of models and attitudes towards women that have been criticised as outdated. Some background reading: Foxconn, the biggest maker of Apple\u2019s iPhone, has warned that its revenues will be hit by the coronavirus, but it did not say exactly how big the impact might be. Apple had already warned this week that it faced a supply shortage because of the virus, so the hit to a major supplier does not come as a surprise. Foxconn, which is formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, added that it is restarting some production at Chinese plants, after extended closure. Reutes also reported that Foxconn said its plants in countries such as Vietnam, India and Mexico continue to operate at full capacity with expansion plans under way as it seeks to minimise the impact of the virus. The European Central Bank\u2019s top officials thought that easing trade tensions had reduced risks to the eurozone economy, according to minutes from its latest monetary policy meeting \u2013 although the meeting took place before the extent of the coronavirus epidemic became clear. The meeting of the central bank\u2019s governing council ended on 23 January, shortly before Covid-19 was acknowledged as an emergency that could damage the global economy. Slowly building inflationary pressures and the improved trade outlook added a note of positivity to the minutes. They said: The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remained tilted to the downside, but had become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade had receded. It was felt to be important to acknowledge these positive signs and care should be taken to avoid being too slow to change the risk assessment. However, some bankers did say they should not be \u201ctoo optimistic\u201d, given the continued contraction in the manufacturing economy and particularly the struggles of carmakers. Who knew that the \u00a320 was the most popular bank note in the UK? Anyway, there\u2019s a new one out today. The Bank of England has begun the mammoth operation to replace it, with at least 2bn printed, reports the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Collinson. The Bank expects half of the country\u2019s cash machines to have switched over within the next fortnight. The note will feature Turner\u2019s portrait in front of The Fighting Temeraire, his tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in Nelson\u2019s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. (The painting also symbolises the changing of the guard \u2013 as Carney prepares to leave the Bank in less than a month). British manufacturers reported an increase in orders this month, according to the the Confederation of British Industry\u2019s (CBI) monthly gauge. The balance of manufacturers seeing increased orders rose to a reading of -18, from -22 in January, slightly above the consensus forecast of -19 from economists. Expectations for the next three months reached their highest since February 2019. However, the reading remained below the survey\u2019s long-run average of -13 \u2013 and the sector saw actual output volumes (as opposed to orders for the future) falling for a fifth rolling quarter in a row. Alpesh Paleja, the CBI\u2019s lead economist, said: It is encouraging to see manufacturers reporting some early signs of a turnaround in activity, but it\u2019s probably still too early to say whether we\u2019ve seen the end of the slowdown in the sector. Notwithstanding improving optimism, the sector is still grappling with longer-term uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. The US dollar is on something of a tear at the moment: the trade-weighted basket of currencies measured against it has hit its strongest level since May 2017. The Japanese yen has fallen \u2013 even though it is usually considered something of a safe haven \u2013 amid fears of recession in the world\u2019s third-largest economy. It may have also been affected by its proximity to China, the centre of the coronavirus epidemic. \u201cDollar tramples yen and everything else in its path\u201d is the apt headline on a Reuters report. Rabobank senior currency strategist Jane Foley said: I think this has really brought into focus the role the dollar is playing as a safe haven. The yen has lost 2% to the dollar since Tuesday to its lowest since April 2019. However, UBS\u2019s wealth management arm said it thinks the dollar surge against the yen is \u201cunsustainable\u201d. Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said: Broadly, we attribute the yen move to a combination of risk-on trade in equity markets, rising headwinds for Japan\u2019s economy, and continued US dollar strength. The move may have been exacerbated by other factors, from rising Covid-19 infections in Japan to GPIF [Government Pension Investment Fund] outflows. Some more reaction on the British retail sales rebound. It appears that experts aren\u2019t quite convinced that the post-election bounce means the sector is out of the woods. Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg, an investment bank, said: One month does not make a trend. Retail sales are typically quite volatile. However, they do provide an early indicator of the much bigger category of household spending \u2013 which makes up about 70% of GDP. So far, the data just show a rebound from the fourth quarter and not yet evidence of a strong gains to come throughout 2020. However, the uptick in spending along with the sharp improvement in household survey data at the start of the year suits our call that real household consumption is on track to recover solidly in the first quarter (+0.6% quarter-on-quarter) after the disappointing 0.1% gain in the fourth quarter of 2019. Karen Johnson, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said: Have UK consumers chosen \u2018buy more big ticket items\u2019 as their New Year\u2019s resolution? Though UK retailers will certainly hope so, this will have required a real growth in consumer confidence. Last year was characterised by nervousness in the market, which led to muted spending and frustration for many businesses. January\u2019s ONS figures offer a glimmer of hope that this pent up consumer demand could now slowly be being released, but the jury is still out on this at the moment. Joe Morris, retail partner at law firm Gowling WLG, said: While promising, there is a need to remember the backdrop of this improvement, which has seen failures and insolvencies in the areas with the highest sales \u2013 both in terms of physical store footfall and a failure to successfully unify on and offline efforts into one seamless experience. The need to meet these core customer needs will continue to challenge the sector, with global supply chain efficiencies also playing a key part. Survival of the fittest has never applied more, but as ever, retailers with strong brands and reactive and widely available lines will continue to do well. A just after mid-morning update on markets: the FTSE 100 has given up almost all of its gains to trade flat for the day. The Euro Stoxx 600 index is down by 0.14%, with Italy\u2019s Milan-based FTSE MIB index down by 0.45% amid political uncertainty. The pound has dropped by 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.2890, its lowest in 10 days, despite the rebound in UK retail sales. Here\u2019s the full report on Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s profits hit \u2013 and some bad news for its chief executive: he is no longer Britain\u2019s best paid banking boss, as we earlier reported. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio has seen his pay packet fall to a mere \u00a34.7m, a 28% cut. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive, is now the second-highest paid UK bank boss, behind Barclays\u2019 chief executive, Jes Staley. Staley was paid \u00a35.9m for 2019 despite UK regulators launching an investigation over his links to the sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein in December. Horta Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s pay peaked at \u00a311.5m in 2014. Between 2011 and 2019 he has been paid \u00a356m by the bank. This year\u2019s pay packet includes a \u00a312,000 \u201ccar or car allowance\u201d and a \u00a337,606 \u201ctransportation\u201d. That\u2019s \u00a349,606 for various forms of transport alone \u2013 about 1.7 times the average UK salary, which is roughly \u00a328,300 based on the Office for National Statistics\u2019 weekly earnings figures. Full story here: The end of election uncertainty in December may be driving the improvements in the data, economists suggest. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: January\u2019s official retail sales figures confirm that the decisive general election has released the handbrake of political uncertainty on consumers\u2019 spending. The headline number has been depressed by a huge 5.7% month-to-month drop in fuel store sales \u2013 the biggest since March 2015 \u2013 driven by a rise in fuel prices and bad weather. The overall picture on retail sales is still pretty weak, cautioned Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon \u2013 although the outlook is moderately more positive as household finances improve this year. Textile, clothing and footwear stores recorded the strongest increase among the retail sectors, with volumes up by 3.9% compared to the previous month, the ONS found. Food sales rose by 1.7% month-on-month, counterbalancing a 5.7% fall in fuel sales as prices increased. British retail sales rose by 0.9% in January compared to the previous month, the best performance since March, according to the Office for National Statistics. The numbers were mainly boosted by \u201cmoderate growth\u201d in both food and other stores, despite rising fuel prices dampening volume, the ONS said. The figures offered some hope for the sector, which has endured a torrid few years. The British Retail Consortium\u2019s separate figures had previously found that 2019 was the worst year on record for the sector, with sales falling for the first time in 24 years. Gold prices have held near seven-year highs this morning \u2013 after breaking the mark late on Thursday night as the coronavirus outbreak compounded concerns about slowing global growth. The spot price of a troy ounce of the yellow metal rose above $1,612 late last night \u2013 the highest point since March 2013. This morning gold was trading at $1,609. A note from Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said: We continue to see value from an insurance and diversification angle, but would caution that absolute returns may be limited if coronavirus-related disruptions are largely limited to the first quarter. An interesting story from the Belfast Telegraph this morning on the maker of the \u201cBoris bus\u201d: Northern Ireland\u2019s Audit Office is to probe a \u00a32.5m loan made by Invest NI to Wrightbus just months before the company went into administration. Wrightbus was once hailed as one of Northern Ireland\u2019s most successful manufacturers, but it fell into administration last year after sales slumped. The company and its family owners also faced questions over multimillion-pound donations made by the company to a church run by Jeff Wright. The collapse was politically awkward for the government, given prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s personal association with the company after he ordered new Routemaster double deckers during his time as London\u2019s mayor. NI\u2019s public spending watchdog issued the statement after an MLA raised the issue with the economy committee at Stormont yesterday. From the BelTel\u2019s report: Sinn Fein\u2019s Caoimhe Archibald, chair of the committee, made the call after a number of concerns about the firm\u2019s financial affairs were raised by experts in a BBC Spotlight investigation Wrightbus, based in Ballymena, collapsed into administration in September 2019. About five months earlier, Cornerstone \u2013 the firm\u2019s parent company \u2013 spent \u00a31m buying back the shares held by Wright family member Dr Lorraine Rock, the programme broadcast on Tuesday revealed. [...] Wright has branded any claims money was wrongly donated untrue and \u201cextremely hurtful\u201d and \u201cdamaging\u201d. The top riser on the FTSE 100 this morning is Smith &amp; Nephew, the maker of medical products such as dressings and surgical devices, after it beat expectations. Smith &amp; Nephew forecasted another year of revenue growth after topping annual sales expectations for 2019, helped by higher demand from emerging markets and growth in its sports medicine unit. The company\u2019s revenues topped $5bn for the first time, and slightly outperformed consensus estimates \u2013 shares rose by 8%. NMC Health is the second top performer, up 4%, although given that it is still worth less than a third of its valuation in mid-December the term dead cat bounce springs to mind. The Middle Eastern private hospitals group has been in turmoil since it revealed that its ownership details had been incorrectly reported and short seller Muddy Waters targeted it. Maersk handles one in every five containers shipped by sea across the world, so it is on the front line of impacts from the outbreak. It has issued a warning on the impacts \u2013 but perhaps most strikingly there is no number put on the cost. The Danish company cited \u201cfear of the virus and the efforts to prevent its spread\u201d as denting demand, hampering deliveries at ports and preventing some upgrades to its ships. The outlook for 2020 is impacted by the current outbreak of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) in China, which has significantly lowered visibility on what to expect in 2020. As factories in China are closed for longer than usual in connection with the Chinese New Year and as a result of the Covid-19 we expect a weak start to the year. It is still early days to measure the overall impact[. H]owever, the weekly container vessel calls at key Chinese ports were significantly down compared [to] last year during the last weeks of January and the first weeks of February. Freight rates are expected to decrease due to dropping demand for containerised goods transport. However, Maersk said it still expected global container demand to grow by 1% to 3% this year, compared to 1.4% last year and 3.8% the year before. European markets have lost some ground in early trading \u2013 aside from in the UK, where the pound is slightly lower. London\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 is up by 0.2% to about 7,469 points, while the FTSE 250 has gained 0.4%. France\u2019s Cac 40 and Germany\u2019s Dax both lost about 0.1% in early trades, dragging down the Euro Stoxx 600 index down by the same amount. Britain\u2019s best-paid banking boss, Antonio Horta-Osorio, has taken a 28% cut in his \u00a36.5m pay package, as Lloyds Banking Group reported a sharp fall in profits last year, writes the Guardian\u2019s Kalyeena Makortoff. The group was hit by an additional \u00a32.5bn bill for payment protection insurance, sending pre-tax profit down by more than a quarter to \u00a34.4bn for 2019. That compared to \u00a36bn a year earlier, but was ahead of the \u00a33bn expected by analysts. Lloyds has slashed the total pay package for its chief executive to \u00a34.7m, and has also cut the group bonus pool for the first time in four years, with payouts down 33% to a total of \u00a3310m. More details to come on this one. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of the world economy, the eurozone, financial markets and business. Few industries have been hit by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak harder than airlines. Air France-KLM and Qantas both reported costly hits to profits on Thursday. Air France-KLM said that, based on a suspension of China operations from February to March, the outbreak would cost it between \u20ac150m (\u00a3125m) and \u20ac200m. Qantas, Australia\u2019s flagship carrier, said it expected a A$150m (\u00a377m) hit to its profits for the year and a 15% cut in the number of flights to Asia until at least the end of May. The airline will also put employees on leave as it cuts its capacity, and it has suspended its only route to mainland China, direct to Shanghai. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said: Coronavirus resulted in the suspension of our flights to mainland China and we\u2019re now seeing some secondary impacts with weaker demand on Hong Kong, Singapore and to a lesser extent, Japan. Other key routes, like the US and UK, haven\u2019t been impacted. The latest World Health Organisation data say there were 75,204 confirmed cases worldwide on Wednesday, with 2,009 deaths. The vast majority of those have come in China. The Chinese government on Thursday pushed further stimulus measures as it seeks to support its ailing economy. With large industrial centres still under quarantine conditions, growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy is expected to stutter. China\u2019s central bank cut its benchmark lending rate earlier on Thursday, as anticipated, adding measures to try to keep money moving in the economy. The stimulus measure helped Chinese stock market indices to strong gains: the Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index rose by 1.84%, while the CSI 300 benchmark which also incorporates Shenzhen stocks gained 2.3%. However, the increases did not spread uniformly across Asia, indicating that global investors may have already priced in stimulus. Stocks in Hong Kong edged down, while Korea\u2019s Kospi 200 index lost 0.56% amid increased numbers of infected people.

      "body": "<p>Shoulder pads in the 80s were synonymous with adulthood. That\u2019s how we imagined our selves-of-the-future; standing in a flat with big windows and a martini, maybe with some job (lawyer?), wearing shoulder pads. Oh, and a big telly. The shoulder pad, if you cross-ref it with the rest of the image, was more than womanhood: it was professionalism, modernity, hedonism and power. In their 2020 reboot, some \u2013 Balenciaga\u2019s \u2013 are more nostalgic than others \u2013 Balmain\u2019s. A giant trench in a zingy spring green is pure 1983, whereas a sequinned cloak is a bit more robotic and dystopian. But for anyone of a certain age, they\u2019re what you\u2019d wear if a magic trick made you swap bodies with your mother, \u00e0 la Freaky Friday, even though your actual mother never wore them because she wasn\u2019t a Sloane, and nor would she have worn giant earrings.</p> <p>The 80s didn\u2019t own shoulder pads. In the 30s, they existed purely to make your waist look smaller. This, being much less extreme than wearing a corset or removing a rib, was a pretty tame look, which took a surprising turn in the 40s, when the shoulders merged with military chic and everyone\u2019s silhouette became gigantic and a bit scary, in sartorial homage to the tanks everyone was rolling all over each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"183e62a0d85c316e1cb9dc67b45d869fad53bbb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/183e62a0d85c316e1cb9dc67b45d869fad53bbb8/0_0_4800_6000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Shoulder pads in 1938.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoulder pads in 1938.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Rawlings/Conde Nast via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This historical diversion is relevant, by the way, to my week in shoulder pads. In a jacket, a T-shirt, a structured shirt, any which way, the most eye-catching thing about me was how gigantic I was. It\u2019s like beards (note to hipsters, I\u2019m right on this): they were invented for men with weak chins, so when a man with a strong chin grows one, he looks like Desperate Dan. People whose shoulders are already substantial look as if they\u2019re in fancy dress. I split up with someone once because he said I had a powerful back, in one of those annoying relationship moments where the straw that breaks your (powerful) back is a remark that is perfectly fair. One incarnation I tried was a brown vintage Pietro Luna jacket, in which I looked like a henchman. \u201cI like your power blazer,\u201d someone said in the office and, truly, I was power dressing, if by that you mean I could have smuggled an Uzi on to a tube train. And on the subject of public transport: I took up so much room, it looked as if I was trying to keep everyone out of my body buffer zone, in case they had nits. I did not like being this person.</p> <p>I always looked from 30% to 100% too formal for any given occasion. Monday night, I went to a vegan restaurant with a dozen disappointeds of the left. It is fine to wear shoulder pads and eat vegan food now, of course, because it is fashion, and so is veganism. In the 80s, you would no more have combined the two than you would have driven a 4x4 to a march against nuclear war. And the left didn\u2019t notice, because politics people don\u2019t have a clue. (I was at a Labour party conference once and someone asked me where my dress was from, and I said, \u201cVionnet.\u201d She gave me a look, an unambiguous how-could-anyone-do-that: \u201cYou stole it from the V&amp;A?\u201d) But the rest of the restaurant noticed because of all the normal stuff they couldn\u2019t do, like get past me to go to the toilet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9909bc3a42bca05be56795edcfe97891d8963fc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9909bc3a42bca05be56795edcfe97891d8963fc8/0_348_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zoe Williams wearing shoulder pads in a pub in Kings Cross.

Perhaps it made me sit up a bit straighter, or perhaps it is just intimidating to be shaped like a box or a computer, rather than like a hill or a pile of washing. Dress for the job you want, they say; but what job would that actually be? One where you made 20 decisions an hour, had a staccato delivery and never went to Pret, because you\u2019re a machine, and machines don\u2019t need crayfish. I\u2019m guessing, here.</p> <p>Having broad shoulders is, of course, a metaphor for taking responsibility. Can you transmit that trait visually? If so, this is a very easy way to get promoted to a high-pressure job where no one talks to you. No, wait, someone did talk to me. He said I looked like a backing singer in a Talking Heads video. I liked this better than what my Mr said, that I looked like a hot Sue Ellen, and I said, \u201cHow can there be a hot Sue Ellen when Sue Ellen was already hot?\u201d and then, after intense questioning, it transpired that he prefixed \u201chot\u201d to any likeness for fear of my obsessive offence-taking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3da55d2092e0105f212524bad388e568e1a0f6ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3da55d2092e0105f212524bad388e568e1a0f6ab/0_0_2598_3898/666.jpg\" alt=\"Balenciaga\u2019s broad shoulders for SS20\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Balenciaga\u2019s broad shoulders for SS20.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estrop/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most devastating remark came, predictably and also quite repeatedly, from assorted children, all of them my own. \u201cWhy are you wearing that?\u201d And, later, \u201cNo, really, why are you wearing that?\u201d And by Friday, \u201cWhy are you still wearing that?\u201d It isn\u2019t even a question, really, because it doesn\u2019t wait for or hear the answer, and it conveys so much more \u2013 this deep underlying bafflement that a parent would devote so much horsepower and sheer inventiveness to bringing shame upon the family. \u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d was the subtext.</p> <p>The final iteration I tried was a shoulder-padded T-shirt, a garment that unites assertive structure with gleeful unstructure and makes no sense from any angle, especially in the teeth of an athleisure bonanza that won\u2019t die. Am I supposed to look as though I could lounge? Can one lounge, with one\u2019s shoulders sticking out? Yet perhaps because it was built to confuse, this was the thing that the outside world accepted most readily: ah, I see your game, missus. You\u2019re doing this on purpose. You aren\u2019t trying to reprise a lost decade on your own, or shoving your not-so-subtle business strategy down my throat. You\u2019re just a dedicated shoulderer of fashion.</p>",

This, being much less extreme than wearing a corset or removing a rib, was a pretty tame look, which took a surprising turn in the 40s, when the shoulders merged with military chic and everyone\u2019s silhouette became gigantic and a bit scary, in sartorial homage to the tanks everyone was rolling all over each other. This historical diversion is relevant, by the way, to my week in shoulder pads. In a jacket, a T-shirt, a structured shirt, any which way, the most eye-catching thing about me was how gigantic I was. It\u2019s like beards (note to hipsters, I\u2019m right on this): they were invented for men with weak chins, so when a man with a strong chin grows one, he looks like Desperate Dan. People whose shoulders are already substantial look as if they\u2019re in fancy dress. I split up with someone once because he said I had a powerful back, in one of those annoying relationship moments where the straw that breaks your (powerful) back is a remark that is perfectly fair. One incarnation I tried was a brown vintage Pietro Luna jacket, in which I looked like a henchman. \u201cI like your power blazer,\u201d someone said in the office and, truly, I was power dressing, if by that you mean I could have smuggled an Uzi on to a tube train. And on the subject of public transport: I took up so much room, it looked as if I was trying to keep everyone out of my body buffer zone, in case they had nits. I did not like being this person. I always looked from 30% to 100% too formal for any given occasion. Monday night, I went to a vegan restaurant with a dozen disappointeds of the left. It is fine to wear shoulder pads and eat vegan food now, of course, because it is fashion, and so is veganism. In the 80s, you would no more have combined the two than you would have driven a 4x4 to a march against nuclear war. And the left didn\u2019t notice, because politics people don\u2019t have a clue. (I was at a Labour party conference once and someone asked me where my dress was from, and I said, \u201cVionnet.\u201d She gave me a look, an unambiguous how-could-anyone-do-that: \u201cYou stole it from the V&amp;A?\u201d) But the rest of the restaurant noticed because of all the normal stuff they couldn\u2019t do, like get past me to go to the toilet. Behind a desk, in a shirt so structured you could have balanced a plate of hot food on each shoulder, I came closer to being appropriately dressed. Perhaps it made me sit up a bit straighter, or perhaps it is just intimidating to be shaped like a box or a computer, rather than like a hill or a pile of washing. Dress for the job you want, they say; but what job would that actually be? One where you made 20 decisions an hour, had a staccato delivery and never went to Pret, because you\u2019re a machine, and machines don\u2019t need crayfish. I\u2019m guessing, here. Having broad shoulders is, of course, a metaphor for taking responsibility. Can you transmit that trait visually? If so, this is a very easy way to get promoted to a high-pressure job where no one talks to you. No, wait, someone did talk to me. He said I looked like a backing singer in a Talking Heads video. I liked this better than what my Mr said, that I looked like a hot Sue Ellen, and I said, \u201cHow can there be a hot Sue Ellen when Sue Ellen was already hot?\u201d and then, after intense questioning, it transpired that he prefixed \u201chot\u201d to any likeness for fear of my obsessive offence-taking. The most devastating remark came, predictably and also quite repeatedly, from assorted children, all of them my own. \u201cWhy are you wearing that?\u201d And, later, \u201cNo, really, why are you wearing that?\u201d And by Friday, \u201cWhy are you still wearing that?\u201d It isn\u2019t even a question, really, because it doesn\u2019t wait for or hear the answer, and it conveys so much more \u2013 this deep underlying bafflement that a parent would devote so much horsepower and sheer inventiveness to bringing shame upon the family. \u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d was the subtext. The final iteration I tried was a shoulder-padded T-shirt, a garment that unites assertive structure with gleeful unstructure and makes no sense from any angle, especially in the teeth of an athleisure bonanza that won\u2019t die. Am I supposed to look as though I could lounge? Can one lounge, with one\u2019s shoulders sticking out? Yet perhaps because it was built to confuse, this was the thing that the outside world accepted most readily: ah, I see your game, missus. You\u2019re doing this on purpose. You aren\u2019t trying to reprise a lost decade on your own, or shoving your not-so-subtle business strategy down my throat. You\u2019re just a dedicated shoulderer of fashion.",

      "body": "<p>Tills are ringing merrily in the high streets and it is all down to Boris Johnson. Thanks to the prime minister the dark clouds of uncertainty are scudding away and a grateful nation feels free to start spending again.</p> <p>Really? Sure, there was a chunky rise in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/20/uk-retail-sales-rebound-shoppers-snap-up-clothing-footwear\">retail sales </a>in January but in the latest three months \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend \u2013 they were up by only 0.8% on the same period a year earlier. This is the weakest annual growth since 2013.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/11/british-retailers-yet-to-benefit-from-boris-bounce-says-brc\">\u201cBoris bounce\u201d theory</a> rests on the highly questionable assumption that consumer behaviour is affected by political events rather than by other factors, such as whether they are better off than they were before and whether prices are going up or down.</p> <p>January is the time consumers traditionally seek out bargains in the sales and, after two dismal months for retailers, there were plenty on offer this year. People had more money in their pockets because earnings are rising faster than prices. Put the two together and there\u2019s a plausible reason for the rebound in spending, albeit without such a grabby headline.</p> <p>Of course, there might be one or two individuals who said to themselves: \u201cI am glad the Conservatives won the election by such a thumping majority and I am now going out and celebrate by buying a new sofa.\u201d Equally, though, there were plenty of voters who wanted to hide under the duvet when they heard the result.</p> <p>A more likely place for a Boris bounce to show up would be industry, since companies tend to be more sensitive to the political climate. There is ample evidence from the official figures of a mothballing of capital spending as a result of Brexit.</p> <p>But the latest snapshot of manufacturing from the CBI paints a relatively downbeat picture. Output fell in the three months to February at an only slightly slower pace than in the quarter ending in January. While the employers\u2019 organisation detected signs of a pickup, it made clear the rebound was tentative and fragile.</p> <p>What\u2019s true of manufacturing is true of the economy as a whole. The government would have us believe Britain is booming and the prime minister is responsible. Neither is remotely true.</p> <h2>Behind the Lloyds profits plunge</h2> <p>Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio will have to scrape by on a mere \u00a34.7 million after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/20/lloyds-bank-profits-hit-25bn-ppi-charge-antonio-horta-osorio\">pay was cut </a>from \u00a36.5m as a result of the profits fall at Lloyds Banking Group. Those LBG employees struggling to make ends meet \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/09/one-third-of-lloyds-bank-staff-are-struggling-financially-survey-reveals\">a third of them according to a union survey</a> \u2013 are unlikely to lose much sleep over that.</p> <p>Yet, while the focus was on the impact on profits of the continued high payments for payment protection insurance (PPI), the bank\u2019s results also highlight the ferocious competition among mortgage providers to sell home loans. Dig deep into the latest results from LBG and the reason the UK\u2019s housing market is on the turn becomes apparent.</p> <p>Banks make their money from the spread between the interest rates they pay to savers and the higher rates that apply to borrowers. In the low-interest-rate environment of the past decade, this spread narrows.</p> <p>The squeeze has intensified in the past couple of years because the housing market has been dormant at a time when banks have been awash with cash. Potential homebuyers have been deterred by sky-high property prices, so lenders have responded by offering ever-more attractive mortgage packages.</p> <p>LBG, the UK\u2019s biggest residential property lender, has sought to offset some of this enforced largesse by stiffing those taking out unsecured loans, but expects its net interest rate margin to fall in 2020. That\u2019s because banks can either accept lower profitability or see their customers walk away. It\u2019s not really much of a choice.</p> <h2>Social interaction, and trust, take a dip</h2> <p>Twenty years ago, the US political scientist Robert Putnam publisheda book called Bowling Alone, which chronicled the decline of civic engagement, the erosion of social capital and the growing mistrust of the government in the US.</p> <p>Bowling alone has arrived in Britain.

      "bodyText": "Tills are ringing merrily in the high streets and it is all down to Boris Johnson. Thanks to the prime minister the dark clouds of uncertainty are scudding away and a grateful nation feels free to start spending again. Really? Sure, there was a chunky rise in retail sales in January but in the latest three months \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend \u2013 they were up by only 0.8% on the same period a year earlier. This is the weakest annual growth since 2013. The \u201cBoris bounce\u201d theory rests on the highly questionable assumption that consumer behaviour is affected by political events rather than by other factors, such as whether they are better off than they were before and whether prices are going up or down. January is the time consumers traditionally seek out bargains in the sales and, after two dismal months for retailers, there were plenty on offer this year. People had more money in their pockets because earnings are rising faster than prices. Put the two together and there\u2019s a plausible reason for the rebound in spending, albeit without such a grabby headline. Of course, there might be one or two individuals who said to themselves: \u201cI am glad the Conservatives won the election by such a thumping majority and I am now going out and celebrate by buying a new sofa.\u201d Equally, though, there were plenty of voters who wanted to hide under the duvet when they heard the result. A more likely place for a Boris bounce to show up would be industry, since companies tend to be more sensitive to the political climate. There is ample evidence from the official figures of a mothballing of capital spending as a result of Brexit. But the latest snapshot of manufacturing from the CBI paints a relatively downbeat picture. Output fell in the three months to February at an only slightly slower pace than in the quarter ending in January. While the employers\u2019 organisation detected signs of a pickup, it made clear the rebound was tentative and fragile. What\u2019s true of manufacturing is true of the economy as a whole. The government would have us believe Britain is booming and the prime minister is responsible. Neither is remotely true. Behind the Lloyds profits plunge Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio will have to scrape by on a mere \u00a34.7 million after his pay was cut from \u00a36.5m as a result of the profits fall at Lloyds Banking Group. Those LBG employees struggling to make ends meet \u2013 a third of them according to a union survey \u2013 are unlikely to lose much sleep over that. Yet, while the focus was on the impact on profits of the continued high payments for payment protection insurance (PPI), the bank\u2019s results also highlight the ferocious competition among mortgage providers to sell home loans. Dig deep into the latest results from LBG and the reason the UK\u2019s housing market is on the turn becomes apparent. Banks make their money from the spread between the interest rates they pay to savers and the higher rates that apply to borrowers. In the low-interest-rate environment of the past decade, this spread narrows. The squeeze has intensified in the past couple of years because the housing market has been dormant at a time when banks have been awash with cash. Potential homebuyers have been deterred by sky-high property prices, so lenders have responded by offering ever-more attractive mortgage packages. LBG, the UK\u2019s biggest residential property lender, has sought to offset some of this enforced largesse by stiffing those taking out unsecured loans, but expects its net interest rate margin to fall in 2020. That\u2019s because banks can either accept lower profitability or see their customers walk away. It\u2019s not really much of a choice. Social interaction, and trust, take a dip Twenty years ago, the US political scientist Robert Putnam publisheda book called Bowling Alone, which chronicled the decline of civic engagement, the erosion of social capital and the growing mistrust of the government in the US. Bowling alone has arrived in Britain. The latest official data for social capital shows that the simplest engagement with our neighbours \u2013 stopping to talk \u2013 has fallen by four percentage points between 2011-12 and 2017-18, while membership of political, voluntary, professional or recreational organisations dropped by five points over the same period. As for trust in the government, that was down 11 points in the past year. These are truly worrying trends. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk",

Ashley, who started printing her trademark floral fabrics on her kitchen table, took the high street by storm in the 70s, but the appeal of her frilly world peaked in the 80s, when Princess Diana was among its famous fans. More recently, the company that still bears the designer\u2019s name has made its living selling sofas, cushions and curtains rather than floaty dresses. But sales of expensive home furnishings have collapsed as the uncertainty created by Brexit weighed on consumer confidence and put the brakes on the housing market. The company narrowly avoided collapse this week after agreeing an emergency deal with its main lender, the US bank Wells Fargo. On Thursday, its first female chief executive, Katharine Poulter \u2013 who joined the company last month from discount chain Wilko \u2013 insisted that Laura Ashley had a bright future despite losing \u00a34m in the first six months of its current financial year. \u201cWe are listening to our customers and bringing Laura back,\u201d she said of the revival plan. Poulter said the company had been a trailblazer when it moved into home furnishings in the 80s, bringing French chic such as chandeliers and armoires to middle-class homes. To get back on track, the company would raid its extensive archive to develop products that were recognisable as \u201ciconic, exclusive Laura Ashley designs and prints but desirable today\u201d, it said.

Analysts also point to a lack of investment in the business, which has also spawned branded hotels and tearooms. More recently, though, the company\u2019s situation has been aggravated by grim high-street trading conditions. The listed retailer, which has a market capitalisation of just \u00a315m, has blamed Brexit for deterring shoppers from making big-ticket purchases or starting big DIY projects. At the same time, the housing market has slowed, and house moves are key to the health of specialist home retailers. In the second half of last year, like-for-like sales of decorating products such as paint, curtains and wallpaper were down 21% at Laura Ashley, while demand for soft furnishings like cushions and bed linen fell by 14%. Furniture sales were down 6%. The overall financial picture was also grim, with pre-tax losses more than doubling to \u00a34m in the six months to 31 December on sales of \u00a3110m. Sales at stores open for more than one year slumped 10%. Poulter\u2019s turnaround is expected to result in more store closures in the UK, where it has already scaled back to 147 outlets. Maureen Hinton, analyst at retail consultancy GlobalData, said the company was out of step with current interior design trends. \u201cLaura Ashley doesn\u2019t seem to have any relevance today \u2013 it\u2019s an also-ran,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about clean lines, and when you get into pattern, it is not the country look of flowers and things [that\u2019s in vogue]. It looks like it\u2019s selling to a pensioner\u2019s bungalow.\u201d Laura Ashley clothing arm \u2013 which accounts for about a fifth of its \u00a3232m annual sales \u2013 is holding up better, with sales level with a year ago as women embrace the trend for demure, 1970s-style dresses. The retailer has also been collaborating with other fashion brands including Barbour and Urban Outfitters. Laura Ashley\u2019s chairman, Andrew Khoo, said that talks between the company\u2019s main shareholder \u2013 the Malaysian investment firm MUI Asia \u2013 and Wells Fargo about the terms of a \u00a320m loan facility had now been concluded successfully. \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst these results are disappointing, we believe that with the right focus and support, Laura Ashley has a strong future and can be successful again.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk",

Critics questioned an audit that failed to check out the entire supply chain. \u201cNobody is going to buy the animals if they don\u2019t know where they are from, or if they are healthy,\u201d said Prem Sikka, a professor of accounting and finance at the University of Sheffield. \u201cIf there is a trail, that makes the auditors\u2019 omission even more damning.\u201d DNV.GL has been doing audits for Marfrig since 2011 and for JBS since 2018. \u201cOur role is to assess adherence to the \u2018minimum criteria for transactions with cattle and beef products on an industrial scale in the amazon biome\u2019,\u201d a spokesperson said in an email, referring to the terms of the deal with Greenpeace signed in 2009 \u2013 but crucially, not the promise to start monitoring indirect suppliers within two years, by 2011. \u201cIndirect suppliers\u2019 information was requested, however the companies do not have this information,\u201d DNV.GL said. \u201cIn both cases a non-conformity was raised.\u201d \u201cIn the case of indirect suppliers, JBS has not yet been successful in implementing traceability processes,\u201d the audit\u2019s \u201cnon-conformity\u201d entry read. Since 2013, Marfrig has used a self-declaratory mechanism called a request form of information (RFI) in which the farm delivering the cattle is required to supply the name of its supplier, including tax number and the name of the farm. A spokesperson said last year that 30% of its cattle supply from the Amazon came with the form, which it is working with the World Wildlife Fund and other non-profit groups to improve. \u201cFor me, RFI is a good tool even though it is voluntary,\u201d said Mauro Armelin, executive director of Friends of the Earth Brazil. \u201cIt has a good chance of success.\u201d Armelin said monitoring systems could also make use of state and federal government information on cattle movements, produced for sanitary controls. But last year, the Brazilian government restricted access to sanitary control documents that had previously been accessible. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that this data stays available,\u201d Gibbs from the University of Wisconsin said. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging to monitor indirect suppliers.\u201d DNV.GL stated that the government documents \u201care not public\u201d and that JBS and other companies have been trying to get access to them from the ministry without success. But other researchers have succeeded in accessing them in the past.Using these documents and information from Brazilian government registers and databases, University of Wisconsin researchers and the US National Wildlife Federation developed their own monitoring system: Visipec; a free cloud-based tool that can be plugged into cattle companies\u2019 current monitoring systems. \u201cIncreasingly, they\u2019re open and there\u2019s a lot of discussions happening,\u201d Gibbs said of the meat companies. But so far, she said, not one of them has taken it up. It was announced on Thursday that JBS is buying American meat-packing company Empire Packing Company for $238m (\u00a3185m).",

There was this aching gap where there was nothing about the woman, so I pretty much walked into a publishing deal.\u201d</p> <p>Blackledge and her publishers compromised on the title and called it The Story of V. Published in 2003, the book explores the vagina from a scientific and historical perspective, looking at everything from the tradition of <em>anasyrma</em>, the centuries-old gesture of lifting one\u2019s skirt to display female genitalia and ward off evil, to the active role the vagina takes in reproduction.</p> <p>It became a bestseller and, almost 20 years later, is being reissued. A lot has changed. First off, the main problem with calling a book Vagina in 2020 is distinguishing it from the crop of books published since: Natalie Angier\u2019s Woman: An Intimate Geography, Naomi Wolf\u2019s Vagina: A New Biography, Emma LE Rees\u2019s The Vagina and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/08/jennifer-gunter-gynaecologist-womens-health-bodies-myths-and-medicine\">Jennifer Gunter</a>\u2019s The Vagina Bible.</p> <p>So Blackledge has gone for Raising the Skirt: The Unsung Power of the Vagina \u2013 not least, she says, because since she wrote about <em>anasyrma</em> it has become widely adopted as a political gesture. Polish artist Dr Iwona Demko led a group of women lifting their skirts high at anti-abortion demonstrations in Poland in 2016. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/amandasageart/posts/the-ana-suromai-derived-from-the-greek-word-meaning-to-lift-the-skirt-is-known-t/10154848558933949/\">Ana Suromai</a>, a painting by artist Amanda Sage of a woman lifting her skirt and screaming, appeared on banners at the Los Angeles Women\u2019s March in 2017. (\u201cI lift my skirt to oppression and dishonesty, to lies and deceit,\u201d Sage has said.) And that same year in Italy, <em>anasyrma</em> demonstrations protested against gender discrimination and male violence against women.</p> <p>Demko calls the Polish edition of Blackledge\u2019s book, Wagina, her \u201cbible\u201d. Having organised 11 <em>anasyrma</em> protests since 2014, Demko told Blackledge she and her fellow protesters did this \u201cto stop being ashamed. To recall the lost meaning of women and femininity. To restore the value of power resulting from the ability to give birth to a new life. To emphasise our importance \u2026 It was a perfect act to give us courage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things I feel very proud of is that even 20 years ago, nobody knew about the idea of raising the skirt,\u201d Blackledge says. \u201cNow you have women using it within activism, raising the skirts to show female power.\u201d</p> <p>Blackledge has also come to terms with the fact she may have had a more personal reason for writing the book: a few days before her 21st birthday, she had been told that she was likely to be infertile. \u201cI just stuffed [the information] away at the time. But I think that my book really came from that dark space, which was, that if I have genitalia that don\u2019t work properly, you know, I couldn\u2019t help but feel less of a woman. I think my book is in large part an exploration of what it means to be a woman, knowing that I\u2019m damaged in some way or an imperfect woman.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We knew the real structure of the clitoris in 1672 but we\u2019re still concealing this information from girls</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, after, as she writes in a new introduction, \u201cmiscarriages, after a myriad women and men in white coats peering up my vagina, after multiple surgeries, after a vaginal pilgrimage to fertility icons across Europe, after spirit-shattering emotional distress, after unsuccessful rounds of IVF, after tens of thousands spent, after fertility astrology\u201d, she has a daughter. And she\u2019s made sure her child knows about the power of the vagina.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s there\u2019s a moment that every person born with a vagina shares, and that is when you realise that you are treated differently to people who have a penis, that you are not treated with the same level of respect,\u201d she says. \u201cI do think women were all wounded in some way. We feel negative about our genitalia, because it seems to be the source of why we are treated differently.\u201d</p> <p>She is \u201cdeeply\u201d angered by the lack of change in children\u2019s sex education books. Reading one with her daughter recently, she was \u201chorrified\u201d to see the clitoris described as small and pea-shaped. \u201cIt\u2019s not. This is such out-of-date information,\u201d she says. \u201cWe routinely downgrade female power, whether it\u2019s sexual, creative or protective. All these textbooks should describe the clitoris as a wishbone-shaped structure, consisting of a crown, the piece of flesh that you can feel, a body and two legs which root deep inside and lie either side of the vagina. We knew the wishbone-shaped structure of the clitoris in 1672 but we\u2019re still concealing this information from girls.\u201d</p> <p>Blackledge, who works for a fertility charity, writes about how parents perpetuate the stigma around vaginas by refusing to use the correct language. \u201cMost parents in the UK choose to use vaginal euphemisms such as flower, tuppence, fairy, bits or front bottom,\u201d she writes. \u201cVagina and vulva are not the wrong words, or rude words, or too anatomical words, they are simply the correct words and it is only an adult\u2019s own hang-ups that colours them otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>She believes parents should just say vagina and vulva, but suggests that \u201cif the UK wants a new non-anatomical word, my vote is for verenda. It\u2019s an old word for the vagina and means \u2018the parts that inspire awe or respect\u2019. Grace, gravitas and a great provenance combined.\u201d</p> <p>She also believes girls should be aware of the ancient stories about the power of female genitalia. \u201cImagine a world where as girls we\u2019re told these incredible stories - in mythology about the goddesses raising their skirts, and in doing so making the world fertile again, or they raise their skirts and they can defeat armies,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all know about Bellerophon and Pegasus the winged horse, but we don\u2019t know about the women who raised their skirts to the hero and the winged horse and vanquished them. I tell my daughter all these things because I feel like it will make a difference.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/12/what-can-we-learn-from-london-vagina-museum\">What can we learn from a vagina museum?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Publishers might be happy to print the word vagina on covers these days, and women might be raising their skirts, but reproductive rights are increasingly being challenged around the world, something Blackledge argues is rooted in men who feel unnerved by the advances of feminism. \u201cThere are plenty of good men who are happy to see a shift to equal power bases, but there are plenty of others who are deeply threatened by that shrinking power base,\u201d she says, \u201cI think that\u2019s where problems can come. Patriarchy is really rooted in controlling female reproduction.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a long way to go, she admits. \u201cBut I think you have to start somewhere. And women and girls are definitely not made to feel good about having a vagina if we don\u2019t use the right words, if we don\u2019t tell them these stories \u2026 It would make such a difference to female psychology if we talked about things differently.\u201d</p> <p>She gives the example of ova, which are 80,000 times bigger than sperm. \u201cWe have this idea of the sperm going on this valiant and action-packed journey to the egg. But we know now that the game is always played on her turf. She controls the action, she pulls the sperm to her and she engulfs it. The language that we use in so many things is always about male active, female passive. When that changes, I think it will be a dramatic shift. We\u2019re stuck in the old language at the moment.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.weidenfeldandnicolson.co.uk/titles/catherine-blackledge-3/raising-the-skirt/9781474615839/\">Raising the Skirt by Catherine Blackledge</a> is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (\u00a39.99)</em>.</p>",

Published in 2003, the book explores the vagina from a scientific and historical perspective, looking at everything from the tradition of anasyrma, the centuries-old gesture of lifting one\u2019s skirt to display female genitalia and ward off evil, to the active role the vagina takes in reproduction. It became a bestseller and, almost 20 years later, is being reissued. A lot has changed. First off, the main problem with calling a book Vagina in 2020 is distinguishing it from the crop of books published since: Natalie Angier\u2019s Woman: An Intimate Geography, Naomi Wolf\u2019s Vagina: A New Biography, Emma LE Rees\u2019s The Vagina and Jennifer Gunter\u2019s The Vagina Bible. So Blackledge has gone for Raising the Skirt: The Unsung Power of the Vagina \u2013 not least, she says, because since she wrote about anasyrma it has become widely adopted as a political gesture. Polish artist Dr Iwona Demko led a group of women lifting their skirts high at anti-abortion demonstrations in Poland in 2016. Ana Suromai, a painting by artist Amanda Sage of a woman lifting her skirt and screaming, appeared on banners at the Los Angeles Women\u2019s March in 2017. (\u201cI lift my skirt to oppression and dishonesty, to lies and deceit,\u201d Sage has said.) And that same year in Italy, anasyrma demonstrations protested against gender discrimination and male violence against women. Demko calls the Polish edition of Blackledge\u2019s book, Wagina, her \u201cbible\u201d. Having organised 11 anasyrma protests since 2014, Demko told Blackledge she and her fellow protesters did this \u201cto stop being ashamed. To recall the lost meaning of women and femininity. To restore the value of power resulting from the ability to give birth to a new life. To emphasise our importance \u2026 It was a perfect act to give us courage.\u201d \u201cOne of the things I feel very proud of is that even 20 years ago, nobody knew about the idea of raising the skirt,\u201d Blackledge says. \u201cNow you have women using it within activism, raising the skirts to show female power.\u201d Blackledge has also come to terms with the fact she may have had a more personal reason for writing the book: a few days before her 21st birthday, she had been told that she was likely to be infertile. \u201cI just stuffed [the information] away at the time. But I think that my book really came from that dark space, which was, that if I have genitalia that don\u2019t work properly, you know, I couldn\u2019t help but feel less of a woman. I think my book is in large part an exploration of what it means to be a woman, knowing that I\u2019m damaged in some way or an imperfect woman.\u201d Now, after, as she writes in a new introduction, \u201cmiscarriages, after a myriad women and men in white coats peering up my vagina, after multiple surgeries, after a vaginal pilgrimage to fertility icons across Europe, after spirit-shattering emotional distress, after unsuccessful rounds of IVF, after tens of thousands spent, after fertility astrology\u201d, she has a daughter. And she\u2019s made sure her child knows about the power of the vagina. \u201cI think there\u2019s there\u2019s a moment that every person born with a vagina shares, and that is when you realise that you are treated differently to people who have a penis, that you are not treated with the same level of respect,\u201d she says. \u201cI do think women were all wounded in some way. We feel negative about our genitalia, because it seems to be the source of why we are treated differently.\u201d She is \u201cdeeply\u201d angered by the lack of change in children\u2019s sex education books. Reading one with her daughter recently, she was \u201chorrified\u201d to see the clitoris described as small and pea-shaped. \u201cIt\u2019s not. This is such out-of-date information,\u201d she says. \u201cWe routinely downgrade female power, whether it\u2019s sexual, creative or protective. All these textbooks should describe the clitoris as a wishbone-shaped structure, consisting of a crown, the piece of flesh that you can feel, a body and two legs which root deep inside and lie either side of the vagina. We knew the wishbone-shaped structure of the clitoris in 1672 but we\u2019re still concealing this information from girls.\u201d Blackledge, who works for a fertility charity, writes about how parents perpetuate the stigma around vaginas by refusing to use the correct language. \u201cMost parents in the UK choose to use vaginal euphemisms such as flower, tuppence, fairy, bits or front bottom,\u201d she writes. \u201cVagina and vulva are not the wrong words, or rude words, or too anatomical words, they are simply the correct words and it is only an adult\u2019s own hang-ups that colours them otherwise.\u201d She believes parents should just say vagina and vulva, but suggests that \u201cif the UK wants a new non-anatomical word, my vote is for verenda. It\u2019s an old word for the vagina and means \u2018the parts that inspire awe or respect\u2019. Grace, gravitas and a great provenance combined.\u201d She also believes girls should be aware of the ancient stories about the power of female genitalia. \u201cImagine a world where as girls we\u2019re told these incredible stories - in mythology about the goddesses raising their skirts, and in doing so making the world fertile again, or they raise their skirts and they can defeat armies,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all know about Bellerophon and Pegasus the winged horse, but we don\u2019t know about the women who raised their skirts to the hero and the winged horse and vanquished them. I tell my daughter all these things because I feel like it will make a difference.\u201d Publishers might be happy to print the word vagina on covers these days, and women might be raising their skirts, but reproductive rights are increasingly being challenged around the world, something Blackledge argues is rooted in men who feel unnerved by the advances of feminism. \u201cThere are plenty of good men who are happy to see a shift to equal power bases, but there are plenty of others who are deeply threatened by that shrinking power base,\u201d she says, \u201cI think that\u2019s where problems can come. Patriarchy is really rooted in controlling female reproduction.\u201d There\u2019s a long way to go, she admits. \u201cBut I think you have to start somewhere. And women and girls are definitely not made to feel good about having a vagina if we don\u2019t use the right words, if we don\u2019t tell them these stories \u2026 It would make such a difference to female psychology if we talked about things differently.\u201d She gives the example of ova, which are 80,000 times bigger than sperm. \u201cWe have this idea of the sperm going on this valiant and action-packed journey to the egg. But we know now that the game is always played on her turf. She controls the action, she pulls the sperm to her and she engulfs it. The language that we use in so many things is always about male active, female passive. When that changes, I think it will be a dramatic shift. We\u2019re stuck in the old language at the moment.\u201d \u2022 Raising the Skirt by Catherine Blackledge is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (\u00a39.99).",

The motives behind the Berlin attack have remained unclear.</p> \n<p>Witnesses to the Hanau attack described how the gunman randomly fired shots into the bars. One witness, Kenan Kocak, said he was waiting to hear whether his uncle, who had been in the bar, had survived. \u201cI do not know whether he has pulled through,\u201d he told the TV station NTV. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad in particular that young people \u2013 a young lad, and a young girl about 20, 25 years old \u2013 have died.

He told me he was in an ambulance. He had a bullet in his shoulder.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another witness who knew some of the victims said: \u201cThese are people we have known for years. It\u2019s like in a film. That it\u2019s happened is unimaginable. That there are people out there who are so heartless, shooting others who have done nothing wrong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other witnesses spoke of finding empty bullet casings strewn on the ground outside one of the cafes.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The map on this article was amended on 27 February 2020. The suspect\u2019s home was in Helmholtzstrasse and not in \u201cHeim holtzstrasse\u201d as an earlier version had said. This has been corrected.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A gunman killed nine people in two apparently racially motivated shootings at shisha bars in the German town of Hanau, police said. The suspect then killed himself, according to officers, after also killing his mother at his home. Investigators believed a racist motive was behind the attack, said Peter Beuth, the interior minister for the state of Hessen. Angela Merkel said the circumstances of the attack needed to be fully investigated, and the shootings had exposed the \u201cpoison\u201d of racism in German society. She pledged to stand up against those who sought to divide the country. Nine people died in the attacks on the two bars on Wednesday night. Five others had life-threatening injuries, police said. Some of those killed were of Turkish origin, a spokesman for the Turkish presidency said. \u201cWe expect German authorities to show maximum effort to enlighten this case. Racism is a collective cancer,\u201d \u0130brahim Kal\u0131n tweeted. The killer was named by police as 43-year-old Tobias R. His surname was not given, in line with German practice. German media named him as Tobias Rathjen. He shot himself and his 72-year-old mother at home, police said. They also confirmed he possessed a hunting licence. The Bild newspaper said the gunman had expressed extreme rightwing views in a letter of confession he left behind. A video in which he explained his motives is believed to be part of the investigation. The Guardian could not confirm the details of his confession. The video was taken down from social media sites on Thursday morning, police said. After the murders, a huge hunt was launched for the perpetrator involving dozens of armed police and a helicopter hovering above the commuter town 15 miles (25km) east of Frankfurt. Police tweeted at about 5am local time that special police force officers had stormed the home of the alleged suspect and found him dead along with another body. \u201cThere are currently no indications of other perpetrators,\u201d police said in a statement. Officers sealed off and searched the terrace house in Hanau\u2019s Kesselstadt district, near the scene of one of the shootings, after following up witness statements on a getaway car. According to local media, eight or nine shots were fired at the Midnight shisha bar on Heumarkt in the centre of the town at about 10pm. A dark vehicle was seen leaving the scene. Soon afterwards, shots were fired at a second shisha bar \u2013 the Arena Bar and Caf\u00e9 in Kurt-Schumacher-Platz in the western Kesselstadt district. Police denied initial reports of a third incident in the district of Lamboy. They urged any witnesses with mobile phone footage to upload it to a police website, and appealed to them not to post the evidence on social media. Michael Malkmus,a spokesman for Hessen police force, said local people helped the police track down the alleged perpetrator after seeing his car parked on the street. \u201cWe came to the building after calls from people who had seen a vehicle. We ID\u2019d his number plate and matched it to his home. We sealed the area and then entered the home.\u201d Neighbours reported hearing a huge bang as police used explosives to break down the door at 3am. Federal prosecutors said on Thursday they were taking charge of investigating the shooting amid reports that the suspect may have had a far-right motive. Merkel pledged that \u201ceverything will be done to investigate the circumstances of these terrible murders\u201d. She added: \u201cRacism is a poison. Hatred is a poison. This hatred exists in our society and its is responsible for far too many crimes.\u201d Hanau\u2019s federal MP, Katja Leikert, called the attack a \u201chorrific scenario\u201d in a tweet in which she offered her \u201cheartfelt condolences\u201d to the victims. The mayor of the town, Claus Kaminsky, said it was the \u201cworst evening imaginable\u201d. Hanau has a population of about 100,000. Last Friday one person was shot dead and four were injured outside a Berlin music venue. The shooting occurred near the Tempodrome, which was hosting a Turkish comedy show. The motives behind the Berlin attack have remained unclear. Witnesses to the Hanau attack described how the gunman randomly fired shots into the bars. One witness, Kenan Kocak, said he was waiting to hear whether his uncle, who had been in the bar, had survived. \u201cI do not know whether he has pulled through,\u201d he told the TV station NTV. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad in particular that young people \u2013 a young lad, and a young girl about 20, 25 years old \u2013 have died. I was there with them yesterday. Someone who worked there was also taken to hospital. It looks very bad.\u201d One man in his early 30s said he received a call from a friend who had been in one of the bars. \u201cHe left a message to tell me he had been hit,\u201d the man, who was not identified, told NTV. \u201cI called him back immediately. He told me he was in an ambulance. He had a bullet in his shoulder.\u201d Another witness who knew some of the victims said: \u201cThese are people we have known for years. It\u2019s like in a film. That it\u2019s happened is unimaginable. That there are people out there who are so heartless, shooting others who have done nothing wrong.\u201d Other witnesses spoke of finding empty bullet casings strewn on the ground outside one of the cafes. \u2022 The map on this article was amended on 27 February 2020. The suspect\u2019s home was in Helmholtzstrasse and not in \u201cHeim holtzstrasse\u201d as an earlier version had said. This has been corrected.",

Overall, though, this story of loving, losing and finding your way again is moving and hopeful. It has clarity, immediacy and mainstream appeal, and there\u2019s no denying that the songs are great. Most importantly, it has an infectious, pressing energy that boils over the edge of the stage. It should be a big hit.",

      "body": "<h2>30. Rap God (2013)<br></h2> <p>Eminem illustrates all the cadences he has mastered over the years, channelling flows from influences such as Tech N9ne and Big Pun like an exorcist summoning spirits, and moving through an impressive 1,560 words in just six minutes. Some critics have dismissed this as empty \u201crappity rap\u201d, but the fact a 41-year-old still cared this much about his craft deserves our respect.</p> <h2>29. Same Song &amp; Dance (2009)<br></h2> <p>Although Marshall Mathers has repeatedly trashed 2009\u2019s Relapse in interviews, the record, which is a nightmarish ode to horrorcore rap, has aged well \u2013 particularly this dread-inducing tale of a stalker who lynches Lindsay Lohan. Critics hated the creepy accent, which sounds like the bastard child of Borat and the Simpsons\u2019 Groundskeeper Willie, but by embodying such a ludicrous pastiche of a serial killer, Em enjoyed a much-needed dose of escapism at a time where his private life was starting to unravel.</p> <h2>28. The Ringer (2018)<br></h2> <p>Just like Jay-Z\u2019s similarly misguided DOA (Death of Autotune), The Ringer is a track from a veteran unhappy with the direction rap is headed. Mocking the supposed cliches of mumble rap, Em is essentially an angry old man shouting at a (Sound)cloud. But after years of disappointing albums plagued with turgid stadium pop, it was just exciting to hear Eminem sound so fired up again \u2013 he makes for a very convincing Victor Meldrew.</p> <h2>27. Don\u2019t Front (2013)<br></h2> <p>On this overlooked B-side, Eminem tears through the thunderous boom-bap of Black Moon\u2019s classic street-corner drama, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3H2N5nUqsk\" title=\"\">I Got Cha Opin</a>. This is that rare museum exhibit that doesn\u2019t bore you to tears, with Em giving his fans a nostalgic serotonin boost after a duo of truly awful albums: Recovery, and The Marshall Mathers LP 2.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlUGX1sNlbg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SlUGX1sNlbg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>26. It\u2019s OK (1996)<br></h2> <p>Much of Eminem\u2019s forgotten 1996 debut, Infinite, is spent trying to imitate the multi-syllabic flow of Kool G Rap over beats that sound like cheap rip-offs from Nas\u2019s Illmatic. But the playful nocturnal funk of It\u2019s OK, which is littered with enthusiastic ad-libs from best friend Proof, results in the record\u2019s most inspired rapping, as an introspective Em uncharacteristically discusses finding God. </p> <h2>25. Till I Collapse (2002)<br></h2> <p>This shot of cathartic rage is still wildly inspiring, even if its appearance on every video game trailer sponsored by Mountain Dew might have diluted its impact a little. It was also fun to hear Nate Dogg sounding so emo and getting a chance to croon about something other than being a horny stoner.</p> <h2>24. Stay Wide Awake (2009)<br></h2> <p>With synths that appear to scream out in pain, this is one of Dr Dre\u2019s weirdest concoctions. The songwriting may be the byproduct of a recluse spending his days writing raps amid Jeffrey Dahmer YouTube documentary binges, but Eminem mostly succeeds in trying to replicate the unhinged tone of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and that\u2019s impressive. Tyler, the Creator said this had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/134002859091042304?lang=en\" title=\"\">\u201cthe best flow ever\u201d.</a></p> <h2>23. Drug Ballad (2000)<br></h2> <p>On Drug Ballad, Eminem is high as a kite, resiliently throwing jabs from beyond the clouds and refusing to come back down. The funky thrusts of bass replicate the energy of a horny, if incredibly tacky, spring-break party in the nu-metal era. It\u2019s a window into a simpler, trashier time, where sniffing glue while playing with a Rubik\u2019s Cube was somehow considered an attractive personality trait.</p> <h2>22. Brain Damage (1999)<br></h2> <p>Turning his childhood traumas into whimsical entertainment, Eminem transitions from being bullied into being the bully, and his nutty turn of phrase and dark recollections of a Detroit high school where even the principal joins in with the beatings are frequently hilarious. Few artists can find light in such a dark setting and this song, released just a few months before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/14/mother-supposed-know-son-columbine-sue-klebold\" title=\"\">Columbine massacre</a>, presciently hints at American schools dangerously abandoning their outcasts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0ee8762a2c9c974392221aa3e0c6683529a55306\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ee8762a2c9c974392221aa3e0c6683529a55306/0_0_2272_3489/651.jpg\" alt=\"Eminem in concert in 2001.\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eminem in concert in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicky J Sims/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>21. Role Model (1999)<br></h2> <p>With jokes about the alleged OJ murders and Lauryn Hill\u2019s mythical hatred of white men, this is Eminem starting to realise his power as a cultural provocateur. The fact he bluntly erases his predecessor (\u201cI saw Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads\u201d) also feels significant, with the Detroit native reshaping the idea of the ascendant white rapper.</p> <h2>20. Without Me (2002)<br></h2> <p>With a mischievous beat that sounds as if it was crafted by Dr Dre rhythmically squeezing a bunch of clowns\u2019 noses, this is a continuation of the silly pop theatrics of The Real Slim Shady and My Name Is. When Eminem claimed rap would be empty without him around, it was hard to disagree.</p> <h2>19. Cleanin\u2019 Out My Closet (2002)<br></h2> <p>A bit like watching a white trash family drama unravel on the Jerry Springer show, this intensely autobiographical song works because Eminem isn\u2019t afraid to operate from a place of weakness. Em also shares his mission statement as an artist, rapping: \u201cGive \u2019em hell for as long as I\u2019m breathing\u201d.</p> <h2>18. Scary Movies (1999)<br></h2> <p>Eminem has always made an artform out of killing people and his absurdist pledge to \u201cThrow you down a flight of stairs / Then I\u2019ll throw you back up them\u201d is undeniably hilarious. Scary Movies is a reminder of a time when Em wasn\u2019t just a great rapper, but a great comedian, too.</p> <h2>17. The Way I Am (2000)<br></h2> <p>As good as The Slim Shady LP was, it was a bit too heavy on dick jokes, and this highlight from its follow-up showcases clearer artistic growth. A haunting meditation on fame, it\u2019s a paranoid, inward-looking tale of being so famous that you get followed to the bathroom.</p> <h2>16. Hellbound (2000)<br></h2> <p>Rapping over regal music from beat-\u2019em-up game Soulcalibur, Em\u2019s promise to \u201cfuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis\u201d projects a larger-than-life confidence. Eminem slashes through the beat like a katana sword, writing the hyper-animated blueprint that Kendrick Lamar and Nicki Minaj would later follow.</p> <h2>15. Jay-Z \u2013 Renegade (feat Eminem) (2001)<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_O_-URLgIM\" title=\"\">Originally</a> an Eminem collaboration with frenemy Royce Da 5\u20199\u201d, Em\u2019s potent critique of middle America proves he was one step ahead of his broadsheet critics. He is operating at the height of his powers, with verses so vivid that Nas even taunted Jay-Z with the barb: \u201cAnd Eminem murdered you on your own shit.\u201d</p> <h2>14. If I Had (1999)<br></h2> <p>Em has rarely sounded this dejected, with the artist wondering what he must sacrifice in order to make a million dollars. When he would rap about his personal life later on in his career there was too much syrupy sentimentality and self-pity, but here (where he recalls earning $5.55 an hour) Eminem has never sounded so relatable.</p> <h2>13. Superman (2002)<br></h2> <p>The kind of song that might get an artist cancelled today, Superman is a twisted take on the love bops Nelly and Ja Rule were routinely pumping out. Endlessly catchy, it\u2019s the closest Em has come to a club banger, and his problematic Lothario dazzles rather than disgusts because he dares you to take him seriously.</p> <h2>12. I\u2019m Back (2000)<br></h2> <p>Not all of Dre\u2019s beats on the Marshall Mathers LP have aged that well, but I\u2019m Back remains truly compelling theme music for a comic-book villain. Eminem fans the flames by threatening to murder Columbine bullies; at this point, he genuinely felt like pop culture\u2019s most provocative son.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbw_BxDwdjk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xbw_BxDwdjk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>11. Guilty Conscience (1999)<br></h2> <p>Playing into media claims that rap music was leading young people astray, rarely has a mainstream rap single been so conceptual, as Em and Dre play the two conflicting sides of the male conscience. Em tells Dre \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.factmag.com/2017/07/12/dr-dre-addresses-dee-barnes-assault-the-defiant-ones-hbo/\" title=\"\">who assaulted TV host Dee Barnes in 1991</a> \u2013 he\u2019s in no position to lecture someone else on how to treat a woman. It\u2019s still bold.</p> <h2>10. Deja Vu (2009)<br></h2> <p>This is a three-dimensional account of what it\u2019s like to be a person with the kind of privilege that might fuel a drug addiction. Em recounts being in an ambulance after an overdose, but the fact he does so while joking about his fears of suffering a cliched death like Elvis makes for an endearing listen.</p> <h2>9. White America (2002)<br></h2> <p>Aware that he was every parent\u2019s worst nightmare, Eminem dissects his cultural influence with real precision. Screaming his vocals from the very back of his throat, he also grapples with his white privilege, acknowledging: \u201cIf I was black, I would\u2019ve sold half.\u201d White America showed rappers they could be rock stars, too \u2013 punk rappers such as Slowthai and Denzel Curry will have learned a lot from this.</p> <h2>8. Remember Me? (2000)<br></h2> <p>Designed to be blasted out of a car in a dingy alleyway at 1am, this abrasive shot of horrorcore is as raw as an exposed nerve ending. Each verse is more unhinged than the last, with Eminem fully embracing his growing mythology as rap\u2019s \u201cangry blonde\u201d.</p> <h2>7. My Name Is (1999)<br></h2> <p>You couldn\u2019t make these kind of jokes today, but back in 1999, this subversive doozy really felt like Slim Shady was breaking through MTV\u2019s glass ceiling. Em played the role of pop culture\u2019s Dennis the Menace ever so well, mocking the misguided idea that rappers should be considered role models over a catchy Labi Siffre sample.</p> <h2>6. Square Dance (2002)<br></h2> <p>Eminem is too self-aware to create truly transcendent moments, but this experimental banger is the closest he ever got to crafting one. Tapping into post-9/11 paranoia, Em plays the role of the demented ringmaster, bringing you into his garish circus with aplomb. It is basically the rap version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVWZy4QOy0\" title=\"\">Being For the Benefit of Mr Kite!</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd13b5815ffa06482c3c4044fc47af72a0fdbae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd13b5815ffa06482c3c4044fc47af72a0fdbae5/0_0_3300_2174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eminem in 8 Mile, the film featuring Lose Yourself.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eminem in 8 Mile, the film featuring Lose Yourself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. Lose Yourself (2002)<br></h2> <p>This is the Rocky theme song reimagined for millennials, with Eminem at his most inspirational while forcing you to empathise with the plight of the working class. It\u2019s rare that a whole generation knows the lyrics to a rap song, but Lose Yourself is more than worthy of that honour (even if Marty <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ9gcOoH9R8\" title=\"\">disagrees</a>).</p> <h2>4. Kim (2000)<br></h2> <p>Arguably the darkest song to ever appear on a diamond-selling album, the murderous chaos of Kim powerfully reflects a misguided lovesick rage. Em switches between male and female voices with an unsettling schizophrenic power, with the bittersweet chorus also strangely enchanting. This broke new ground for storytelling rap, and made your mum lock away your copy of The Marshall Mathers LP in a safe, for ever.</p> <h2>3. Dr Dre \u2013 Forgot About Dre (feat Eminem) (1999)<br></h2> <p>This track perfected the juxtaposition between Dr Dre as the world-weary OG and Eminem as his deranged apprentice. Rapping like a cartoon rottweiler, Em chomps his way through the beat in a way that is linguistically dizzying. As far as perfect producer and rapper dynamics go, this remains the one to beat.</p> <h2>2. The Real Slim Shady (2000)<br></h2> <p>If MTV had become a little safe and too draped in shiny suits by 2000, this was Eminem attempting to liberate it from its excesses and give pop culture\u2019s trashier icons (Will Smith, Fred Durst) a much-needed spanking. This was a single so big that it opened up hip-hop to the suburbs and made millions of white teenagers dye their hair blond.</p> <h2>1.

This shifted the pop paradigm completely and gave a face (and name) to the kind of toxic fan culture that would later multiply with the explosion of social media. As far as rap storytelling goes, it is unlikely Stan will ever be bettered. This is Eminem\u2019s Stairway to Heaven, and the fact he could even make Dido sound bearable is testament to just how good he used to be.</p>",

      "bodyText": "30. Rap God (2013) Eminem illustrates all the cadences he has mastered over the years, channelling flows from influences such as Tech N9ne and Big Pun like an exorcist summoning spirits, and moving through an impressive 1,560 words in just six minutes. Some critics have dismissed this as empty \u201crappity rap\u201d, but the fact a 41-year-old still cared this much about his craft deserves our respect. 29. Same Song &amp; Dance (2009) Although Marshall Mathers has repeatedly trashed 2009\u2019s Relapse in interviews, the record, which is a nightmarish ode to horrorcore rap, has aged well \u2013 particularly this dread-inducing tale of a stalker who lynches Lindsay Lohan. Critics hated the creepy accent, which sounds like the bastard child of Borat and the Simpsons\u2019 Groundskeeper Willie, but by embodying such a ludicrous pastiche of a serial killer, Em enjoyed a much-needed dose of escapism at a time where his private life was starting to unravel. 28. The Ringer (2018) Just like Jay-Z\u2019s similarly misguided DOA (Death of Autotune), The Ringer is a track from a veteran unhappy with the direction rap is headed. Mocking the supposed cliches of mumble rap, Em is essentially an angry old man shouting at a (Sound)cloud. But after years of disappointing albums plagued with turgid stadium pop, it was just exciting to hear Eminem sound so fired up again \u2013 he makes for a very convincing Victor Meldrew. 27. Don\u2019t Front (2013) On this overlooked B-side, Eminem tears through the thunderous boom-bap of Black Moon\u2019s classic street-corner drama, I Got Cha Opin. This is that rare museum exhibit that doesn\u2019t bore you to tears, with Em giving his fans a nostalgic serotonin boost after a duo of truly awful albums: Recovery, and The Marshall Mathers LP 2. 26. It\u2019s OK (1996) Much of Eminem\u2019s forgotten 1996 debut, Infinite, is spent trying to imitate the multi-syllabic flow of Kool G Rap over beats that sound like cheap rip-offs from Nas\u2019s Illmatic. But the playful nocturnal funk of It\u2019s OK, which is littered with enthusiastic ad-libs from best friend Proof, results in the record\u2019s most inspired rapping, as an introspective Em uncharacteristically discusses finding God. 25. Till I Collapse (2002) This shot of cathartic rage is still wildly inspiring, even if its appearance on every video game trailer sponsored by Mountain Dew might have diluted its impact a little. It was also fun to hear Nate Dogg sounding so emo and getting a chance to croon about something other than being a horny stoner. 24. Stay Wide Awake (2009) With synths that appear to scream out in pain, this is one of Dr Dre\u2019s weirdest concoctions. The songwriting may be the byproduct of a recluse spending his days writing raps amid Jeffrey Dahmer YouTube documentary binges, but Eminem mostly succeeds in trying to replicate the unhinged tone of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and that\u2019s impressive. Tyler, the Creator said this had \u201cthe best flow ever\u201d. 23. Drug Ballad (2000) On Drug Ballad, Eminem is high as a kite, resiliently throwing jabs from beyond the clouds and refusing to come back down. The funky thrusts of bass replicate the energy of a horny, if incredibly tacky, spring-break party in the nu-metal era. It\u2019s a window into a simpler, trashier time, where sniffing glue while playing with a Rubik\u2019s Cube was somehow considered an attractive personality trait. 22. Brain Damage (1999) Turning his childhood traumas into whimsical entertainment, Eminem transitions from being bullied into being the bully, and his nutty turn of phrase and dark recollections of a Detroit high school where even the principal joins in with the beatings are frequently hilarious. Few artists can find light in such a dark setting and this song, released just a few months before the Columbine massacre, presciently hints at American schools dangerously abandoning their outcasts. 21. Role Model (1999) With jokes about the alleged OJ murders and Lauryn Hill\u2019s mythical hatred of white men, this is Eminem starting to realise his power as a cultural provocateur. The fact he bluntly erases his predecessor (\u201cI saw Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads\u201d) also feels significant, with the Detroit native reshaping the idea of the ascendant white rapper. 20. Without Me (2002) With a mischievous beat that sounds as if it was crafted by Dr Dre rhythmically squeezing a bunch of clowns\u2019 noses, this is a continuation of the silly pop theatrics of The Real Slim Shady and My Name Is. When Eminem claimed rap would be empty without him around, it was hard to disagree. 19. Cleanin\u2019 Out My Closet (2002) A bit like watching a white trash family drama unravel on the Jerry Springer show, this intensely autobiographical song works because Eminem isn\u2019t afraid to operate from a place of weakness. Em also shares his mission statement as an artist, rapping: \u201cGive \u2019em hell for as long as I\u2019m breathing\u201d. 18. Scary Movies (1999) Eminem has always made an artform out of killing people and his absurdist pledge to \u201cThrow you down a flight of stairs / Then I\u2019ll throw you back up them\u201d is undeniably hilarious. Scary Movies is a reminder of a time when Em wasn\u2019t just a great rapper, but a great comedian, too. 17. The Way I Am (2000) As good as The Slim Shady LP was, it was a bit too heavy on dick jokes, and this highlight from its follow-up showcases clearer artistic growth. A haunting meditation on fame, it\u2019s a paranoid, inward-looking tale of being so famous that you get followed to the bathroom. 16. Hellbound (2000) Rapping over regal music from beat-\u2019em-up game Soulcalibur, Em\u2019s promise to \u201cfuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis\u201d projects a larger-than-life confidence. Eminem slashes through the beat like a katana sword, writing the hyper-animated blueprint that Kendrick Lamar and Nicki Minaj would later follow. 15. Jay-Z \u2013 Renegade (feat Eminem) (2001) Originally an Eminem collaboration with frenemy Royce Da 5\u20199\u201d, Em\u2019s potent critique of middle America proves he was one step ahead of his broadsheet critics. He is operating at the height of his powers, with verses so vivid that Nas even taunted Jay-Z with the barb: \u201cAnd Eminem murdered you on your own shit.\u201d 14. If I Had (1999) Em has rarely sounded this dejected, with the artist wondering what he must sacrifice in order to make a million dollars. When he would rap about his personal life later on in his career there was too much syrupy sentimentality and self-pity, but here (where he recalls earning $5.55 an hour) Eminem has never sounded so relatable. 13. Superman (2002) The kind of song that might get an artist cancelled today, Superman is a twisted take on the love bops Nelly and Ja Rule were routinely pumping out. Endlessly catchy, it\u2019s the closest Em has come to a club banger, and his problematic Lothario dazzles rather than disgusts because he dares you to take him seriously. 12. I\u2019m Back (2000) Not all of Dre\u2019s beats on the Marshall Mathers LP have aged that well, but I\u2019m Back remains truly compelling theme music for a comic-book villain. Eminem fans the flames by threatening to murder Columbine bullies; at this point, he genuinely felt like pop culture\u2019s most provocative son. 11. Guilty Conscience (1999) Playing into media claims that rap music was leading young people astray, rarely has a mainstream rap single been so conceptual, as Em and Dre play the two conflicting sides of the male conscience.

      "body": "<p>Stronger penalties for misuse of the whip appear to be a certainty by the autumn, following the initial report of the new Horse Welfare Board, published on Thursday. While the board had much to say on other topics, including racing\u2019s responsibilities to its horses and the need for a code of practice on euthanasia, it reserved its most urgent comments for the subject of the whip.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe overall number of offences (over 500 in 2018) remains unnecessarily high and the current penalties do not provide an adequate deterrent effect,\u201d the board concluded.</p> \n<p>The HWB does not have power to require action from the British Horseracing Authority on regulatory matters but the BHA immediately signalled it would begin a three-month consultation with racing insiders and the public on changes to the whip rules, with a view to deciding on and implementing changes by the end of October.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/20/talking-horses-willie-mullins-says-new-national-is-just-grand-horse-racing-tips\">Talking Horses: Willie Mullins says new-look National is just grand</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The number of whip offences fell to an all-time low of 410 last year, less than half the number from 2011. However, the board pointed to concern on the subject from the public and politicians before insisting racing show \u201ca proactive, positive direction of travel in relation to the whip, taking steps to eliminate misuse and leading any discussions around the future removal of the whip for encouragement\u201d.</p> \n<p>The HWB urged that the consultation should include questions about whether a horse should be disqualified when its rider breaks the whip rules and also whether the whip should be banned as a means of encouraging horses in races. It adopted a neutral tone on those issues, insisting only on the need to increase penalties.</p> \n<p>Taking questions on their report, board members signalled there could be room for more creative ways forward, such as extending punishments for whip misuse to the trainer and owner who had employed the jockey found in breach. They noted with particular concern an increase since 2016 in the number of offences of the whip being used above shoulder height.</p> \n<p>Barry Johnson, a former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons who chairs the HWB, said: \u201cThis is a matter of public trust. We\u2019d like people, especially those unfamiliar with horses, to understand and accept what\u2019s necessary for our jockeys to race safely in a fair sporting competition.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about taking away the whip. Anyone who\u2019s ridden a half-ton horse knows you need to be able to exercise control for the safety of horse and rider.

      "bodyText": "Stronger penalties for misuse of the whip appear to be a certainty by the autumn, following the initial report of the new Horse Welfare Board, published on Thursday. While the board had much to say on other topics, including racing\u2019s responsibilities to its horses and the need for a code of practice on euthanasia, it reserved its most urgent comments for the subject of the whip. \u201cThe overall number of offences (over 500 in 2018) remains unnecessarily high and the current penalties do not provide an adequate deterrent effect,\u201d the board concluded. The HWB does not have power to require action from the British Horseracing Authority on regulatory matters but the BHA immediately signalled it would begin a three-month consultation with racing insiders and the public on changes to the whip rules, with a view to deciding on and implementing changes by the end of October. The number of whip offences fell to an all-time low of 410 last year, less than half the number from 2011. However, the board pointed to concern on the subject from the public and politicians before insisting racing show \u201ca proactive, positive direction of travel in relation to the whip, taking steps to eliminate misuse and leading any discussions around the future removal of the whip for encouragement\u201d. The HWB urged that the consultation should include questions about whether a horse should be disqualified when its rider breaks the whip rules and also whether the whip should be banned as a means of encouraging horses in races. It adopted a neutral tone on those issues, insisting only on the need to increase penalties. Taking questions on their report, board members signalled there could be room for more creative ways forward, such as extending punishments for whip misuse to the trainer and owner who had employed the jockey found in breach. They noted with particular concern an increase since 2016 in the number of offences of the whip being used above shoulder height. Barry Johnson, a former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons who chairs the HWB, said: \u201cThis is a matter of public trust. We\u2019d like people, especially those unfamiliar with horses, to understand and accept what\u2019s necessary for our jockeys to race safely in a fair sporting competition. \u201cIt\u2019s not about taking away the whip. Anyone who\u2019s ridden a half-ton horse knows you need to be able to exercise control for the safety of horse and rider. This is about what should be allowable under our rules and how we penalise misuse to keep breaches to a minimum.\u201d Notably, the board\u2019s report insists racing as a whole should assume a \u201ccollective lifetime responsibility\u201d for its horses and added: \u201cThis is an area in which a step change is needed. Responsibilities must be clarified, particularly the responsibilities of owners in relation to horses at the end of their racing careers.\u201d Provocatively, it suggested there was \u201cfrequently a lack of awareness of the extent of individual responsibilities towards the horse. This sometimes includes a lack of moral responsibility.\u201d It called for training and education of owners before they invest in a horse, to explain their duties towards it, and added the responsibilities of sales houses, slaughterhouses, pre-training yards and rehoming centres should also be clarified. Nick Rust, the chief executive of the BHA, responded enthusiastically to the HWB report. \u201cI am proud of the work already done by the sport, including our own team of vets and officials, to give our horses the best possible quality of life,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I saw the scale of the Welfare board\u2019s ambition, I was even more proud. \u201cRacing people want the very best for our horses.

      "bodyText": "Air France-KLM, Qantas, and the global container shipping company Maersk have become the latest businesses to warn about the financial impact from the spread of coronavirus. The airlines have cancelled flights to and from China and are experiencing weaker demand for travel in Asia. If flights remain suspended until April, the Franco-Dutch group Air France-KLM expects the Covid-19 outbreak to wipe between \u20ac150-200m (\u00a3130-170m) off its earnings. Qantas, which predicts annual profits will be A$150m (\u00a377m) lower, plans to reduce flights to Asia by 15% until at least the end of May. While its planes remain grounded, Australia\u2019s flag carrier will put employees on leave and freeze recruitment. Alan Joyce, the chief executive of Qantas, said there was a similar drop in demand for flights during the Sars outbreak in 2003, which affected the airline for six to eight months. Qantas believes it can manage for at least six months without cutting jobs. \u201cWe are keeping the capability to have the rebound, keeping the aircraft, keeping the people, because we think it will happen eventually,\u201d Joyce said. Maritime transport is also counting the cost of the outbreak. The Danish firm Maersk, which handles one in five containers shipped by sea, forecasts a weak start to 2020. It has not predicted the cost of lower demand and difficulties delivering to some ports. \u201cIt is still early days to measure the overall impact,\u201d Maersk said. \u201cHowever, the weekly container vessel calls at key Chinese ports were significantly down compared [with] last year during the last weeks of January and the first weeks of February. Freight rates are expected to decrease due to dropping demand for containerised goods transport.\u201d The Chinese government has announced new stimulus measures to support the economy. Factories remain closed for longer than usual after the lunar new year holiday in January, and some large industrial centres are under quarantine conditions. The central bank cut its benchmark lending rate and added measures to keep the economy afloat, a move that bolstered Chinese stock markets. In a quarterly report, the central bank said it expected limited economic impact from the outbreak but had offered to extend credit and provide favourable terms to firms with a role in controlling the virus. According to reports from the mainland on Wednesday, there have been 2,004 deaths and 74,185 confirmed infections. New cases have fallen to fewer than 2,000 per day but officials have warned of a potential increase as people return to work. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk",

His knockout record is phenomenal. Wilder had fought 43 times, won 42 times and won by knockout 41 times. Tyson Fury is the only fighter who he hasn't beaten. , 2:C - While Rahman was training for their fight in South Africa, Lewis was in Las Vegas shooting the film. His former promoter, Panos Eliades, said at the time: \"It was crazy thinking about being in a film so soon before a fight. Does he think that Julia Roberts will want to know him now that he\u2019s an ex-champion?\u201d Apparently Lewis was paid \u201cnext to nothing\u201d for the role, but was keen to take part regardless. He won the rematch easily \u2013 and never lost again., 3:B - Dauthuille never fought for a world title again., 4:B - After the fight, Tyson claimed he was retaliating after Holyfield had headbutted him, not a theory that was given much credence by referee Mills Lane. \u201cBullshit,\u201d said Lane. \u201cThe butt was an accidental butt. How many times do you want him to get bit? There\u2019s a goddamn limit to everything, including bites.\u201d, 5:D - Frazier beat Ali in the Fight of the Century, but then lost his belts to George Foreman in his next fight , 6:C - Joshua put on a professional performance and won on points in quite a drab encounter., 7:B - Bruno never fought again., 8:D - In the closing seconds of the eighth round, Dur\u00e1n quit the fight and apparently said the words \u201cno m\u00e1s\u201d (\u201cno more\u201d) to the referee. Dur\u00e1n disputes this version of events and claims he quit because of stomach cramps., 9:D - James \u201cFan Man\u201d Miller crashed into the ring and was pulled from the ropes into the crowd by security. He was knocked unconscious by a member of Bowe\u2019s security team and had to go to hospital. The incident was named Event of the Year by Ring magazine.

A front window of the house was reportedly smashed. The attack and subsequent security alert in the Glenties Drive area came after Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s vice-president, Michelle O\u2019Neill, and party colleague Gerry Kelly said police had warned them that dissident republicans were planning attacks on party leaders.

The group said it was \u201cabsolutely sickened that a bomb has been thrown at the home of one of our founding members\u201d. Pat Finucane, 39, a Belfast lawyer who represented a number of high-profile republicans, was shot dead in front of his family by loyalist gunmen at his home in 1989. At the time of the murder, up to 29 members of the Ulster Defence Association units involved in the killing were working as agents for one or more branches of the security forces. There have been long-standing allegations that members of the security forces colluded with the solicitor\u2019s loyalist killers. The Pat Finucane Centre said it was shocked about the attack on one of its board members. Political allies of two armed dissident republican groups have issued statements saying that neither the Continuity IRA nor the New IRA were targeting Sinn F\u00e9in. Saoradh, which is politically aligned to the New IRA, rejected claims that there was a dissident republican campaign targeting Sinn F\u00e9in members or supporters.

Judging how \u201celectable\u201d each candidate is will surely be high on every Labour party member\u2019s list, as the movement contemplates five more years of Tory rule.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/18/labour-candidates-left-leadership-race-members\">All the Labour candidates have tacked to the left, but do they really mean it? | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back in 2015, there was a lack of curiosity from much of the media about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s success; it was easier to cry \u201ccult\u201d than investigate why an objectively average candidate could inspire such passion and devotion. Corbyn\u2019s election as leader largely came from two points: his willingness to stand up for the party\u2019s principles, and the intellectual deficit shown by his opponents as they failed to offer any solutions to the problems of the post-financial crash era. In a party that had triangulated itself beyond recognition by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/21/labour-disarray-welfare-48-mps-defy-whips\" title=\"\">abstaining on a welfare bill</a> that would push disabled and working-class people into destitution, a leader willing to stand up for Labour\u2019s traditional values of compassion and solidarity was a lightning bolt for the members.</p> <p>And yet we now face a fresh task. While Corbyn\u2019s victory came after just five years in opposition, by the next general election, Labour will have been out of office for 14 years. The path to power is also steeper: the party now needs to recover from its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/election-2019-50768605/general-election-2019-worst-night-for-labour-since-1935\" title=\"\">worst result since the 1930s</a>. There\u2019s no avoiding that, nor is it inspiring to attempt to. Genuine hope does not emerge from empty words or denial, but comes from acknowledging reality and collectively building a plan to fight back.</p> <p>Rebecca Long-Bailey \u2013 who alarmed many with her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/rebecca-long-bailey-defends-corbyns-legacy-as-she-launches-labour-leadership-bid\" title=\"\">perfect score of Corbyn</a> after his landslide defeat \u2013 has notably honed her message, giving a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/14/rebecca-long-bailey-sets-out-plan-to-rebuild-labour-party?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\" title=\"\">keynote speech last week on how to win power</a>, while urging members not to give up on an ambitious policy agenda. Lisa Nandy has been particularly vocal on the scale of the party\u2019s task. Keir Starmer, pitched by his team as the \u201cunity\u201d candidate, has been focused on proving his leftwing credentials. It\u2019s the difficult position candidates in a leadership contest following a mass defeat find themselves in: they must simultaneously show loyalty to their predecessor in order to court members, while displaying an awareness of inescapable truths about Labour\u2019s failings.</p> <p>Electoral victory is the ultimate prize and evidence suggests that Labour members \u2013 deeply unsettled by December\u2019s result \u2013 are taking this truth to heart. One <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yougov/status/1219624000017633280?s=21\" title=\"\">YouGov poll</a> found that only 14% of Labour party members wouldn\u2019t compromise their values \u201cat all\u201d in order to gain power.</p> <p>Electability is said to be a dirty word for parts of the left. This is largely nonsense: in an era of Conservative-driven poverty, broken public services and threats to workers rights, few groups are more desperate to gain power. But electability has become a somewhat loaded term. On the one hand, it has become a description for candidates who are willing to conform to the status quo, while those pushing for societal change are dubbed \u201cunelectable\u201d. To see this in practice, look to the US. where Joe Biden has been cast as the \u201csafe option\u201d while an altogether stronger candidate, Bernie Sanders, is said to be the risk. On the other hand, candidates who profess concern for electability are accused of \u201cselling out\u201d: they\u2019re painted as the suit-wearing yes-man who will pivot from their ethics if it seems electorally pragmatic.</p> <p>This fear is understandable. Labour has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/29/diane-abbott-labour-immigration-controls-mugs-shameful\" title=\"\">chipped immigration mugs</a> to remind us. But neither interpretation is quite fair. Indeed, the framing of the YouGov question betrays part of the problem: when we talk of electability, we are working from the assumption that taking office inevitably means a choice between principles and power.</p> <p>In reality, electability is considerably more complex. Research suggests our interpretation of electability is typically a mix of media influence, self-fulfilling polls and psychological biases <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/4/16/18308141/democrats-electability-2020-presidential-nomination\" title=\"\">based on gender and race</a>. That\u2019s not to say certain politicians aren\u2019t more likely to be popular with voters, or that we can\u2019t make personal judgments when picking the leader of the Labour party. We can look at a candidate\u2019s baggage or personality and calculate if it will be advantageous or insurmountable. We can learn from the voting trends in recent years and infer what characteristics will appeal to former Labour voters We can look at what\u2019s happening in other democracies across the world. But it\u2019s not a science, and it\u2019s ever-fluctuating.

      "bodyText": "It may feel as if the Labour leadership contest is never-ending, but with three candidates now on the ballot, buckle your seatbelts for the final stretch. Judging how \u201celectable\u201d each candidate is will surely be high on every Labour party member\u2019s list, as the movement contemplates five more years of Tory rule. Back in 2015, there was a lack of curiosity from much of the media about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s success; it was easier to cry \u201ccult\u201d than investigate why an objectively average candidate could inspire such passion and devotion. Corbyn\u2019s election as leader largely came from two points: his willingness to stand up for the party\u2019s principles, and the intellectual deficit shown by his opponents as they failed to offer any solutions to the problems of the post-financial crash era. In a party that had triangulated itself beyond recognition by abstaining on a welfare bill that would push disabled and working-class people into destitution, a leader willing to stand up for Labour\u2019s traditional values of compassion and solidarity was a lightning bolt for the members. And yet we now face a fresh task. While Corbyn\u2019s victory came after just five years in opposition, by the next general election, Labour will have been out of office for 14 years. The path to power is also steeper: the party now needs to recover from its worst result since the 1930s. There\u2019s no avoiding that, nor is it inspiring to attempt to. Genuine hope does not emerge from empty words or denial, but comes from acknowledging reality and collectively building a plan to fight back. Rebecca Long-Bailey \u2013 who alarmed many with her perfect score of Corbyn after his landslide defeat \u2013 has notably honed her message, giving a keynote speech last week on how to win power, while urging members not to give up on an ambitious policy agenda. Lisa Nandy has been particularly vocal on the scale of the party\u2019s task. Keir Starmer, pitched by his team as the \u201cunity\u201d candidate, has been focused on proving his leftwing credentials. It\u2019s the difficult position candidates in a leadership contest following a mass defeat find themselves in: they must simultaneously show loyalty to their predecessor in order to court members, while displaying an awareness of inescapable truths about Labour\u2019s failings. Electoral victory is the ultimate prize and evidence suggests that Labour members \u2013 deeply unsettled by December\u2019s result \u2013 are taking this truth to heart. One YouGov poll found that only 14% of Labour party members wouldn\u2019t compromise their values \u201cat all\u201d in order to gain power. Electability is said to be a dirty word for parts of the left. This is largely nonsense: in an era of Conservative-driven poverty, broken public services and threats to workers rights, few groups are more desperate to gain power. But electability has become a somewhat loaded term. On the one hand, it has become a description for candidates who are willing to conform to the status quo, while those pushing for societal change are dubbed \u201cunelectable\u201d. To see this in practice, look to the US. where Joe Biden has been cast as the \u201csafe option\u201d while an altogether stronger candidate, Bernie Sanders, is said to be the risk. On the other hand, candidates who profess concern for electability are accused of \u201cselling out\u201d: they\u2019re painted as the suit-wearing yes-man who will pivot from their ethics if it seems electorally pragmatic. This fear is understandable. Labour has the chipped immigration mugs to remind us. But neither interpretation is quite fair. Indeed, the framing of the YouGov question betrays part of the problem: when we talk of electability, we are working from the assumption that taking office inevitably means a choice between principles and power. In reality, electability is considerably more complex. Research suggests our interpretation of electability is typically a mix of media influence, self-fulfilling polls and psychological biases based on gender and race. That\u2019s not to say certain politicians aren\u2019t more likely to be popular with voters, or that we can\u2019t make personal judgments when picking the leader of the Labour party. We can look at a candidate\u2019s baggage or personality and calculate if it will be advantageous or insurmountable. We can learn from the voting trends in recent years and infer what characteristics will appeal to former Labour voters We can look at what\u2019s happening in other democracies across the world. But it\u2019s not a science, and it\u2019s ever-fluctuating. As one researcher in the US put it: \u201cWe don\u2019t know who is electable until someone is elected.\u201d Only in questioning the notion of electability can the Labour party come close to being elected. This will not mean watering down policies but offering effective leadership and a coherent message that resonates with lost voters. Above all, it means putting aside assumptions and being open about what to do next. The tightrope is not an easy one to tread. To simultaneously listen and to lead. To doggedly defend principles while showing humility and taking constructive criticism about what hasn\u2019t worked. To inspire the committed while prioritising the unconverted. But it\u2019s a tightrope any Labour leader hoping to win over both the membership and the electorate will have to master. To be electable twice-over is the real challenge. \u2022 Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist",

It was 5 February 1961. Bancroft was rehearsing and it was love at first sight for Brooks. Unable to control himself, he shouted out, \u201cAnne Bancroft, I love you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she replied, peering out into the dark.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Mel Brooks!\u201d he shouted back.</p> <p>\u201cI got your record!\u201d she replied.</p> <p>So it was the 2000 Year Old man that got him a date with Anne Bancroft? \u201cYeah, pretty much. We started hanging out every day and every night \u2013 we couldn\u2019t be without each other. We were made for each other,\u201d Brooks says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was stuck at home after Anne died.  I was afraid to go out. But then I pushed forward as that's what you have to do</p> <footer> <cite>Mel Brooks</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jun/12/features.review\" title=\"b\">Bancroft</a> died from cancer in 2005. It has been hard for Brooks, learning to live without her. There was a period, after a hernia operation, when he stopped going out. \u201cI was stuck at home \u2013 emotionally, I mean. I was afraid to go out. But then I pushed forward because that\u2019s what you have to do, and I went out,\u201d he says. Naturally, one of the first places he went was Reiner\u2019s house: \u201cEating with this guy? You can\u2019t beat it.\u201d</p> <p>Reiner\u2019s home is smart but in no way showy, the way some Beverly Hills homes are. Instead of gilt and marble, the main decorating accents are family photos: every surface is covered with pictures of the Reiners, and the most prominently featured is Reiner\u2019s late wife, Estelle.</p> <p>\u201cThat painting there? She did that. My wife was a very fine artist,\u201d says Reiner, pointing to a strikingly beautiful painting on the wall.</p> <p>\u201cAnd she was a terrific jazz singer. She taught Anne how to play the ukulele,\u201d says Brooks.</p> <p>\u201cThen Anne put her in her movie Fatso. It started a career for her,\u201d says Reiner. She later made appearances in The Man With Two Brains (directed by her husband) and To Be Or Not to Be (directed by Brooks.) But Estelle Reiner\u2019s film career peaked in 1989, thanks not to her friends or husband, but to her son. Rob Reiner cast her in When Harry Met Sally to say the immortal line, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNEX0fbGePg\" title=\"I\">I\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having</a>.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, she was special,\u201d agrees Reiner. Estelle died in 2008. The two had been married for 64 years.</p> <p>Despite eating in most nights, Brooks and Reiner maintain a social life busier than most people a third of their age: my date with them had to be changed once when they realised they had double booked me with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/11/nathan-lane-i-have-played-a-lot-of-morally-questionable-people-not-sure-why\" title=\"n\">Nathan Lane</a>, and tonight I am being squeezed in just after a visit from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/14/alan-alda-its-amazing-that-most-of-us-live-as-if-were-not-gonna-die\" title=\"a\">Alan Alda</a>. But when you\u2019re in your 90s, your friendship group depletes suddenly. Just weeks before our meeting, the screenwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/12/buck-henry-obituary\" title=\"b\">Buck Henry</a> died at the age of 89. As well as creating with Brooks the 1960s satirical detective TV show, Get Smart, he wrote The Graduate, which, of course, starred Bancroft.</p> <p>\u201cHe could break you up with just a funny face \u2013 and so bright, too. Also Tom Meehan [who died in 2017]. He helped me write Young Frankenstein and The Producers. He was a joy, and he wasn\u2019t even Jewish,\u201d marvels Brooks.</p> <p>This sets Brooks to thinking about other friends who have passed away: Gene Wilder, of course, Zero Mostel long ago. But also the lesser-known Ronny Graham, who died almost 20 years ago and appeared in many of Brooks\u2019 films.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to write a musical about Napoleon, but we only ever wrote one song,\u201d says Brooks.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great song. Give her the lyrics!\u201d says Reiner, but Brooks needs no prompting to perform.</p> <p>\u201cRetreat, retreat! Drop your sword and run / The foe is near, we\u2019re outta here \u2013 run! / Run away! / You run away, you live to fight another day! Retreat!\u201d he sings, hitting some properly impressive high notes.</p> <p>\u201cSuch verve!\u201d marvels Reiner.</p> <p>\u201cBut I think there\u2019s no question the people we miss most are our wives,\u201d says Brooks, solemn again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7986f95ab518ea008e9d5e565eba4426e27704f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7986f95ab518ea008e9d5e565eba4426e27704f/0_88_2774_1664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brooks and Reiner in 1974.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brooks and Reiner in 1974.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In one of the running jokes in 2000 Year Old Man, Brooks explains his longevity, for which he credits, variously, avoiding fried foods and airplanes. Brooks and Reiner haven\u2019t made it to 2000, but combined their ages almost add up to 200, so what is their secret?</p> <p>\u201cEating the food here,\u201d Brooks replies immediately.</p> <p>\u201cBeing blessed with wonderful children and grandchildren. Have you ever met his son, Max?\u201d asks Reiner, referring to Brooks and Bancroft\u2019s only child, now an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/23/world-war-z-review\" title=\"m\">acclaimed writer</a>.</p> <p>I say I have not.</p> <p>\u201cYou must! The word genius is thrown around, but this boy is a true genius. And he learned how to do so much himself!\u201d says Reiner, marvelling at 47-year-old Max Brooks\u2019 precocity.</p> <p>I tell Reiner I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/19/i-want-everyone-to-be-happy-how-rob-reiner-became-a-great-director-and-a-political-hero\" title=\"i\">interviewed his son, Rob</a>, two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d he asks, having drifted off a little.</p> <p>\u201cRob Reiner, your son,\u201d Brooks mock shouts into Reiner\u2019s ear.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Rob! He should have been president, but he says he can\u2019t get 60% of the votes in his own house,\u201d says Reiner.</p> <p>But really, Reiner thinks the secret to a long life is \u201chaving something to do in the morning\u201d, and these two men are proof of this maxim. Brooks has been busy recently with the screening of an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPLRwguizZY\" title=\"h\">HBO special </a>about his life.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have the DVDs?\u201d he asks, and I assume he is referring to the special. But it turns out he means a box set he has just put out of Bancroft\u2019s movies, determined her legacy is not forgotten. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get them,\u201d he promises.</p> <p>Reiner, meanwhile, has just published his 19th and 20th books. Known as his \u201cscrunch\u201d books, they feature pictures of, in one, celebrities and, in the other, famous works of art, but scrunched up, and you have to guess who or what they are. Reiner himself is in it, and his name is given as \u201cEstelle\u2019s husband, Carl.\u201d I thought the books were a bit mad when I saw them, but back at my hotel, I can\u2019t stop playing Reiner\u2019s scrunch game. Never doubt the entertainment nous of a man with nine Emmys (for Caesar\u2019s Hour, The Dick Van Dyke Show and Mad About You) and a Grammy (for The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000) for comedy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4dd37a0e46d9571b31a289ea9e4c1cae772a2d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4dd37a0e46d9571b31a289ea9e4c1cae772a2d9/0_87_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a better friend than Carl,\u2019 says Brooks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a better friend than Carl,\u2019 says Brooks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damon Casarez/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reiner and Brooks\u2019 evening routine never changes: they sit and talk \u201cabout everything\u201d, then have dinner in front of Reiner\u2019s massive TV while they watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/04/jeopardy-emma-boettcher-beat-james-holzhauer\" title=\"j\">Jeopardy!</a>.

There, the two comedy icons do what they like to do most these days: chat, eat dinner together and watch the long-running quiz show Jeopardy! \u201cThis is a great place because I got friendship, love and free food. Free eats are very important, you know,\u201d says Brooks, as we wait for Reiner in his den. His voice is a little raspier than it once was, but that signature puckishness is fully intact.

The 2000 Year Old Man is the revered comedy sketch Reiner and Brooks coined in the 1950s, in which Reiner \u2013 always playing the straight man \u2013 would interview Brooks, the titular old man, about his life.

When Reiner asked what the plague was like, Brooks improvised back, \u201cToo many rats, not enough cats.\u201d Reiner and Brooks made five 2000 Year Old Man albums, winning a Grammy in 1998, and Brooks used to joke, when his films occasionally tanked, that he was living off his and Reiner\u2019s comedy records. But the two friends started the routine as a private joke, something to amuse one another while they were sitting in this living room, and they still do it there today, to make one another laugh. Given that Brooks made Blazing Saddles, The Producers and Young Frankenstein, and Reiner directed The Jerk, Dead Men Don\u2019t Wear Plaid and The Man With Two Brains, while little Robbie Reiner on the staircase grew up to make This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally, it\u2019s pretty easy to argue that much of the best mid to late 20th-century American comedy emerged from the people currently and formerly in this house. Reiner now appears, notably frailer than Brooks, and walks in slowly with some assistance. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201d he asks uncertainly. \u201cIt\u2019s the Guardian!

The two \u201cgot a kick out of one another right away\u201d, Brooks says. \u201cAlso, our wives liked each other, which was lucky because we love one another.\u201d \u201cThe best thing Mel ever did was marry a girl named Anne Bancroft,\u201d says Reiner. \u201cYeah, I did,\u201d says Brooks, with a happy smile but sad eyes. \u201cFrom the first time he saw her, every place she went, he made sure he was there,\u201d chuckles Reiner. \u201cYeah, I did,\u201d Brooks repeats a little more quietly. Brooks\u2019 first marriage had just ended when he happened to stop by a studio to watch the taping of a Perry Como TV special. It was 5 February 1961. Bancroft was rehearsing and it was love at first sight for Brooks. Unable to control himself, he shouted out, \u201cAnne Bancroft, I love you!\u201d \u201cWho are you?\u201d she replied, peering out into the dark. \u201cI\u2019m Mel Brooks!\u201d he shouted back. \u201cI got your record!\u201d she replied. So it was the 2000 Year Old man that got him a date with Anne Bancroft? \u201cYeah, pretty much. We started hanging out every day and every night \u2013 we couldn\u2019t be without each other. We were made for each other,\u201d Brooks says. Bancroft died from cancer in 2005. It has been hard for Brooks, learning to live without her. There was a period, after a hernia operation, when he stopped going out. \u201cI was stuck at home \u2013 emotionally, I mean. I was afraid to go out. But then I pushed forward because that\u2019s what you have to do, and I went out,\u201d he says. Naturally, one of the first places he went was Reiner\u2019s house: \u201cEating with this guy? You can\u2019t beat it.\u201d Reiner\u2019s home is smart but in no way showy, the way some Beverly Hills homes are. Instead of gilt and marble, the main decorating accents are family photos: every surface is covered with pictures of the Reiners, and the most prominently featured is Reiner\u2019s late wife, Estelle. \u201cThat painting there? She did that. My wife was a very fine artist,\u201d says Reiner, pointing to a strikingly beautiful painting on the wall. \u201cAnd she was a terrific jazz singer. She taught Anne how to play the ukulele,\u201d says Brooks. \u201cThen Anne put her in her movie Fatso. It started a career for her,\u201d says Reiner. She later made appearances in The Man With Two Brains (directed by her husband) and To Be Or Not to Be (directed by Brooks.) But Estelle Reiner\u2019s film career peaked in 1989, thanks not to her friends or husband, but to her son. Rob Reiner cast her in When Harry Met Sally to say the immortal line, \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having.\u201d \u201cYes, she was special,\u201d agrees Reiner. Estelle died in 2008. The two had been married for 64 years. Despite eating in most nights, Brooks and Reiner maintain a social life busier than most people a third of their age: my date with them had to be changed once when they realised they had double booked me with Nathan Lane, and tonight I am being squeezed in just after a visit from Alan Alda. But when you\u2019re in your 90s, your friendship group depletes suddenly. Just weeks before our meeting, the screenwriter Buck Henry died at the age of 89. As well as creating with Brooks the 1960s satirical detective TV show, Get Smart, he wrote The Graduate, which, of course, starred Bancroft. \u201cHe could break you up with just a funny face \u2013 and so bright, too. Also Tom Meehan [who died in 2017]. He helped me write Young Frankenstein and The Producers. He was a joy, and he wasn\u2019t even Jewish,\u201d marvels Brooks. This sets Brooks to thinking about other friends who have passed away: Gene Wilder, of course, Zero Mostel long ago. But also the lesser-known Ronny Graham, who died almost 20 years ago and appeared in many of Brooks\u2019 films. \u201cWe wanted to write a musical about Napoleon, but we only ever wrote one song,\u201d says Brooks. \u201cIt\u2019s a great song. Give her the lyrics!\u201d says Reiner, but Brooks needs no prompting to perform. \u201cRetreat, retreat! Drop your sword and run / The foe is near, we\u2019re outta here \u2013 run! / Run away! / You run away, you live to fight another day! Retreat!\u201d he sings, hitting some properly impressive high notes. \u201cSuch verve!\u201d marvels Reiner. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s no question the people we miss most are our wives,\u201d says Brooks, solemn again. In one of the running jokes in 2000 Year Old Man, Brooks explains his longevity, for which he credits, variously, avoiding fried foods and airplanes. Brooks and Reiner haven\u2019t made it to 2000, but combined their ages almost add up to 200, so what is their secret? \u201cEating the food here,\u201d Brooks replies immediately. \u201cBeing blessed with wonderful children and grandchildren. Have you ever met his son, Max?\u201d asks Reiner, referring to Brooks and Bancroft\u2019s only child, now an acclaimed writer. I say I have not. \u201cYou must! The word genius is thrown around, but this boy is a true genius. And he learned how to do so much himself!\u201d says Reiner, marvelling at 47-year-old Max Brooks\u2019 precocity. I tell Reiner I interviewed his son, Rob, two years ago. \u201cWho?\u201d he asks, having drifted off a little. \u201cRob Reiner, your son,\u201d Brooks mock shouts into Reiner\u2019s ear. \u201cOh, Rob! He should have been president, but he says he can\u2019t get 60% of the votes in his own house,\u201d says Reiner. But really, Reiner thinks the secret to a long life is \u201chaving something to do in the morning\u201d, and these two men are proof of this maxim. Brooks has been busy recently with the screening of an HBO special about his life. \u201cDo you have the DVDs?\u201d he asks, and I assume he is referring to the special. But it turns out he means a box set he has just put out of Bancroft\u2019s movies, determined her legacy is not forgotten. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get them,\u201d he promises. Reiner, meanwhile, has just published his 19th and 20th books. Known as his \u201cscrunch\u201d books, they feature pictures of, in one, celebrities and, in the other, famous works of art, but scrunched up, and you have to guess who or what they are. Reiner himself is in it, and his name is given as \u201cEstelle\u2019s husband, Carl.\u201d I thought the books were a bit mad when I saw them, but back at my hotel, I can\u2019t stop playing Reiner\u2019s scrunch game. Never doubt the entertainment nous of a man with nine Emmys (for Caesar\u2019s Hour, The Dick Van Dyke Show and Mad About You) and a Grammy (for The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000) for comedy. Reiner and Brooks\u2019 evening routine never changes: they sit and talk \u201cabout everything\u201d, then have dinner in front of Reiner\u2019s massive TV while they watch Jeopardy!. It seems like a pretty great life, and it is. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a better friend than Carl,\u201d says Brooks. \u201cMy God, the thought of being without him \u2013 the world would be too bleak!\u201d says Reiner, and Brooks\u2019 face falls a little, as if he is envisaging all too clearly a world without Reiner. \u201cNow, come on, Carl, let her ask some questions,\u201d he says. I tell them I just like listening to them talk to one another. \u201cBut you might want to ask about something specific, and Carl will be ready, willing and able to answer anything,\u201d says Brooks, buoying them both along. Reiner puts his hand on top of Brooks\u2019. \u201cAlways,\u201d he says.",

      "body": "<p>Every migrant, as Salman Rushdie has observed, is a fantasist. But so is every novelist. Both pursue dreams of another world, inside books or across borders \u2013 an affinity that has become central to the novel in our globalised era. If, in the 19th century with its nascent metropolises, the novelist\u2019s preferred proxy was the fl\u00e2neur loitering in arcades and observing urban fleshpots, today\u2019s novelists, from Zadie Smith to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/25/teju-cole-blind-spot-my-camera-is-like-an-invisibility-cloak-interview\" title=\"\">Teju Cole</a>, cannot resist identifying with the migrant, who sees the world through similarly fresh eyes.</p> <p>The Indian writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/25/aravind-adiga-books-interview-selection-day-the-white-tiger\" title=\"\">Aravind Adiga</a>\u2019s new novel is firmly in this tradition. Set in Australia, where Adiga himself spent a few years finishing up high school (he remains a citizen), <em>Amnesty</em> tells the story of Danny, a Sri Lankan who has become an \u201cillegal alien\u201d after dropping out of his \u201cripoff\u201d college. He is surprisingly content cleaning apartments in suburban Sydney when one of his clients is murdered by another. Over the next 24 hours, Danny contends with the dilemma of whether to risk deportation by informing the police.</p> <p>His ambiguous status is of the moment, when so-called migrants are often really refugees and those we think of as refugees may simply be in search of a livelihood. Illegals might have arrived legally, while legitimate asylum seekers must enter illegally. Leaving behind his war-scarred, tsunami-ravaged Tamil homeland, Danny might himself be a refugee. But his asylum application was rejected, absurdly, because he had not been smuggled in. He came, instead, on a student visa, and overstays, for work and for love. Such are the complex motives and bureaucratic caprices that now characterise migration.</p> <p><em>Amnesty</em> lays bare Australia\u2019s hypocrisies and contradictions. Immigration props up the economy yet is subject to the most draconian restrictions in the west \u2013 a region the country claims membership of against all geographic evidence. Society is so leerily insular that crowds cheer on sea patrols as they arrest incoming refugees. But in spite or maybe because of laws hellbent on preserving homogeneity, people are \u201cfamished\u201d for the \u201cbelligerently weird \u2026 like a Tamil man with gold highlights in his hair\u201d. Despite all efforts to the contrary, Australia is a melting pot, its allure felt in the ostentatiously multicultural epithets (\u201cJapanese-Brazilian\u201d, \u201cvegan Vietnamese\u201d) that Danny relishes.</p> <p>Ever since his Booker-winning debut <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/16/booker-prize\" title=\"\">The White Tiger</a></em> dovetailed the story of a homicidal businessman in India with a state visit by the Chinese premier, Adiga has often returned to his favourite motifs: enterprising <em>desis </em>(people from the Indian subcontinent), murder, the distorting effects of Chinese capital \u2013 all of which appear in <em>Amnesty</em>. The strength of his novels lies in their spirit of political inquiry, born of his years as Time\u2019s Asia correspondent, uncovering hierarchies lost on the more typical literary novelist.</p> <p>For example, Adiga understands the neoimperial divide-and-conquer relied on by Australian immigration enforcement. \u201cEasiest thing in the world, becoming invisible to white people,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut the hardest thing is becoming invisible to brown people.\u201d He knows that nationality has no more zealous guardians than naturalised immigrants, eager to set themselves apart from their paperless peers. The plot turns on the threat of being \u201cdobbed in\u201d by an Indian with a coveted Australian passport.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There are acute sociological insights, but Adiga is a little lacking in psychological intuition or stylistic craft</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Amnesty</em> is a migrant\u2019s-eye view of Australia, and Adiga conveys how migrants learn to read the signs of their strange new world and devise meaningful taxonomies for it. Suburban Sydney, for Danny, comprises two social classes: \u201cthick bum\u201d and \u201cthin bum\u201d, the obese poor who don\u2019t hire cleaners and the salad-eating joggers who do. (This schema may sound familiar: in <em>The White Tiger</em>, the caste system was similarly bifurcated into \u201cMen with Big Bellies, and Men with Small Bellies\u201d.)</p> <p>These are acute sociological insights, but in terms of a novelist\u2019s more traditional skillset, Adiga is a little lacking in psychological intuition or stylistic craft. One of the few metaphors in <em>Amnesty</em> does, however, capture something of the migrant\u2019s pulsing paranoia, when zebra crossings converge in Danny\u2019s mind to make the cityscape resemble the \u201ctattooed war body of [a] hunter\u201d. Danny isn\u2019t the murderer, but will always be a fugitive.</p> <p>Adiga unwisely burdens himself with a 24-hour structure, which is stymied by life\u2019s inevitable mundanity. In Joyce\u2019s <em>Ulysses</em> \u2013 progenitor of this form \u2013 or in recent works by others who have risen to the challenge, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/07/odysseus-abroad-amit-chaudhuri-review-audaciously-redraws-modernist-map\" title=\"\">such as Amit Chaudhuri</a>, the banal is burnished with an aesthetic charge. <em>Amnesty</em> strains for significance in its hourly accounting of Danny\u2019s day, edging into the perfunctory or worse, the inane.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/15/american-dirt-by-jeanine-cummins-review\">American Dirt by Jeanine Cummins review \u2013 a desperate Odyssey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Novelists like to court praise for their naked powers of invention, but Adiga cites his sources in the acknowledgments, perhaps mindful of previous criticisms that he, an elite, Oxford-educated south Indian, had misrepresented north India\u2019s rustbelt poor.

      "bodyText": "Every migrant, as Salman Rushdie has observed, is a fantasist. But so is every novelist. Both pursue dreams of another world, inside books or across borders \u2013 an affinity that has become central to the novel in our globalised era. If, in the 19th century with its nascent metropolises, the novelist\u2019s preferred proxy was the fl\u00e2neur loitering in arcades and observing urban fleshpots, today\u2019s novelists, from Zadie Smith to Teju Cole, cannot resist identifying with the migrant, who sees the world through similarly fresh eyes. The Indian writer Aravind Adiga\u2019s new novel is firmly in this tradition. Set in Australia, where Adiga himself spent a few years finishing up high school (he remains a citizen), Amnesty tells the story of Danny, a Sri Lankan who has become an \u201cillegal alien\u201d after dropping out of his \u201cripoff\u201d college. He is surprisingly content cleaning apartments in suburban Sydney when one of his clients is murdered by another. Over the next 24 hours, Danny contends with the dilemma of whether to risk deportation by informing the police. His ambiguous status is of the moment, when so-called migrants are often really refugees and those we think of as refugees may simply be in search of a livelihood. Illegals might have arrived legally, while legitimate asylum seekers must enter illegally. Leaving behind his war-scarred, tsunami-ravaged Tamil homeland, Danny might himself be a refugee. But his asylum application was rejected, absurdly, because he had not been smuggled in. He came, instead, on a student visa, and overstays, for work and for love. Such are the complex motives and bureaucratic caprices that now characterise migration. Amnesty lays bare Australia\u2019s hypocrisies and contradictions. Immigration props up the economy yet is subject to the most draconian restrictions in the west \u2013 a region the country claims membership of against all geographic evidence. Society is so leerily insular that crowds cheer on sea patrols as they arrest incoming refugees. But in spite or maybe because of laws hellbent on preserving homogeneity, people are \u201cfamished\u201d for the \u201cbelligerently weird \u2026 like a Tamil man with gold highlights in his hair\u201d. Despite all efforts to the contrary, Australia is a melting pot, its allure felt in the ostentatiously multicultural epithets (\u201cJapanese-Brazilian\u201d, \u201cvegan Vietnamese\u201d) that Danny relishes. Ever since his Booker-winning debut The White Tiger dovetailed the story of a homicidal businessman in India with a state visit by the Chinese premier, Adiga has often returned to his favourite motifs: enterprising desis (people from the Indian subcontinent), murder, the distorting effects of Chinese capital \u2013 all of which appear in Amnesty. The strength of his novels lies in their spirit of political inquiry, born of his years as Time\u2019s Asia correspondent, uncovering hierarchies lost on the more typical literary novelist. For example, Adiga understands the neoimperial divide-and-conquer relied on by Australian immigration enforcement. \u201cEasiest thing in the world, becoming invisible to white people,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut the hardest thing is becoming invisible to brown people.\u201d He knows that nationality has no more zealous guardians than naturalised immigrants, eager to set themselves apart from their paperless peers. The plot turns on the threat of being \u201cdobbed in\u201d by an Indian with a coveted Australian passport. Amnesty is a migrant\u2019s-eye view of Australia, and Adiga conveys how migrants learn to read the signs of their strange new world and devise meaningful taxonomies for it. Suburban Sydney, for Danny, comprises two social classes: \u201cthick bum\u201d and \u201cthin bum\u201d, the obese poor who don\u2019t hire cleaners and the salad-eating joggers who do. (This schema may sound familiar: in The White Tiger, the caste system was similarly bifurcated into \u201cMen with Big Bellies, and Men with Small Bellies\u201d.) These are acute sociological insights, but in terms of a novelist\u2019s more traditional skillset, Adiga is a little lacking in psychological intuition or stylistic craft. One of the few metaphors in Amnesty does, however, capture something of the migrant\u2019s pulsing paranoia, when zebra crossings converge in Danny\u2019s mind to make the cityscape resemble the \u201ctattooed war body of [a] hunter\u201d. Danny isn\u2019t the murderer, but will always be a fugitive. Adiga unwisely burdens himself with a 24-hour structure, which is stymied by life\u2019s inevitable mundanity. In Joyce\u2019s Ulysses \u2013 progenitor of this form \u2013 or in recent works by others who have risen to the challenge, such as Amit Chaudhuri, the banal is burnished with an aesthetic charge. Amnesty strains for significance in its hourly accounting of Danny\u2019s day, edging into the perfunctory or worse, the inane. Novelists like to court praise for their naked powers of invention, but Adiga cites his sources in the acknowledgments, perhaps mindful of previous criticisms that he, an elite, Oxford-educated south Indian, had misrepresented north India\u2019s rustbelt poor. The life of an illegal migrant is even more perilous terrain, as we saw with Jeanine Cummins\u2019s widely condemned novel American Dirt. Some critics now insist writers should \u201cstay in their lane\u201d. But I\u2019d prefer an amnesty \u2013 something Danny dreams of \u2013 for any artist who crosses the borders of expectation. Even Adiga\u2019s flawed creation reminds us of the pleasure and understanding that can ensue when writers migrate out of their own experience. \u2022 Amnesty by Aravind Adiga is published by Picador (RRP \u00a316.99).

The former prime minister, who also raised the idea of a possible alliance with the Liberal Democrats as a way to regain power, said the Conservatives would emerge victorious from any battles over contentious cultural issues. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to distinguish between the advocacy of certain things that are right, whether it\u2019s about gay rights, transgender rights, whatever it is,\u201d he said in a Q&amp;A session after a speech to mark the 120th anniversary of the founding of the party. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to distinguish between that and launching yourself politically into a kind of culture war with the right. If you go, \u2018Transgender rights is our big thing\u2019, and the right goes, \u2018Immigration control is our big thing\u2019, you\u2019re going to lose that war.\u201d Transgender rights has become an increasingly significant issue in the leadership contest, with Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy both signing a controversial 12-point pledge that includes the promise to expel \u201ctransphobic\u201d members. Blair said he would not have signed the pledge, arguing there were \u201call sorts of difficult issues\u201d that had to be resolved first. In his speech opening the event, Blair said Labour should examine trying to \u201ccorrect the defect from our birth\u201d that separated Liberal and Labour traditions on the left. \u201cHow this is done, institutionally, is a matter for debate. But intellectually and philosophically it is absolutely essential that these two traditions are reunited,\u201d he said. However, he added that the Lib Dems would first need to \u201cshow the same clarity of purpose\u201d in being serious about trying to get into government. Elsewhere in the speech Blair, who led Labour from 1994 to 2007, said \u201cnothing less than born again head-to-toe renewal will do\u201d for the party, and that it needed to have the \u201cmentality of government\u201d. Members are to vote on who will shape the future of the party, with Keir Starmer, Long-Bailey and Nandy battling to take over from Jeremy Corbyn as leader. The result of the contest will be announced on 4 April. Blair said Labour had always won when it had broadened British politics, secured the centre ground and looked to the future. \u201cAnd yet despite this obviously being true, we have exhibited an extraordinary attachment to retreating into a narrow part of the left which has always ended in defeat,\u201d he added. He said: \u201c[W]hat Labour has stood for in terms of values has been magnificent; its achievements in government huge, but as a political competitor, it has too often been a failure.\u201d In the Q&amp;A Blair said a major issue for Labour was an attachment to a form of state power that he did not think people believed in any more. Asked whether he believed the party genuinely wanted to win an election, he said: \u201cI think it does want to win. The question is, does it want to win enough so that it\u2019s prepared, one, to understand why it lost and be prepared to make the changes so it doesn\u2019t lose again.\u201d He criticised the 2019 Labour manifesto, saying: \u201cThe more you read it the less convinced you became.\u201d Blair continued: \u201cOn every page you could see, someone had come and knocked on the door and said, \u2018Here\u2019s a 10-point plan on this and I want \u00a31bn.\u2019 Any politician can say yes, it\u2019s pretty easy. It\u2019s when you say no, particularly to your own people.\u201d His speech came shortly after Nandy missed out Blair when asked to list the party\u2019s best leaders on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. Nandy said the New Labour years were \u201cgame-changing\u201d but Blair did get \u201cthings wrong\u201d during his decade in Downing Street.",

Like many other companies and schools, he has been asked to register for online classes. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a mess, as one would expect from something as terrifying as an unknown virus,\u201d said Bruwer, 34. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying my time at home in South Africa with family and friends but do feel worried about my colleagues and students trapped in limbo in China. \u201cAt least I am able to enjoy the summer weather here \u2013 but they are currently holed up inside their homes, living a very surreal life.\u201d Holidaymakers who booked trips to China from April have yet to receive a refund. Many have been told to wait to see if the travel advice changes. Laurent Damm\u00e9, a 30 year-old doctor who lives in Luxembourg, had booked a trip to take part in the Great Wall Marathon. However, the race was cancelled on Wednesday. Though he was reimbursed for the fees he paid to participate, he is yet to receive information on his British Airways flight. \u201cI was disappointed when I heard the marathon was cancelled. As I was there to participate in the marathon, I\u2019d want to be reimbursed for my flight as well, but right now British Airways don\u2019t have any updates about their flights for April and May. I talked to them yesterday but I didn\u2019t get any new information,\u201d he said. \u201cI will have to wait to see what happens.\u201d Adam Wilkins, 50, is in a similar predicament. The service engineer from Gloucestershire had booked a trip to visit China in April with his wife. Wilkins, who was due to travel on 4 April, said: \u201cWe\u2019re in limbo because we\u2019ve booked time off work and we\u2019d like to go but we can\u2019t book anywhere else until we know we\u2019re not going.\u201d He paid the deposit for the trip last year and had to settle the outstanding balance two weeks ago, despite the Foreign Office advising British nationals not to go. \u201cIt was a choice between paying the balance or losing our deposit,\u201d he said. Wilkins said while the issue could seem like \u201ca first-world problem\u201d \u2013 he was aware many people were in a worse situation \u2013 he had booked the holiday to give him and his wife something to look forward to after the death of her father last year.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s accounting watchdog has launched a major review into whether companies and their auditors are adequately reflecting the financial risks of the climate crisis in their accounts. The Financial Reporting Council, which sets reporting standards for all listed companies in the UK, plans to use the review to make sure companies are being clear with investors about their exposure to climate risks. The review could lead to tougher disclosure rules for UK listed companies and more scrutiny on the work of accounting firms \u2013 including KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC \u2013 in helping investors to identify climate risks. Sir Jon Thompson, the FRC\u2019s chief executive, said company reports and accounts were \u201cessential to understanding how the corporate world is responding to the challenge of climate change\u201d. \u201cNot only do boards of UK companies have a responsibility to report their impact on the environment and the risks of climate change to their business, but investors expect them to operate sustainably,\u201d he said. \u201cAuditors have a responsibility to properly challenge management to assess and report the impact of climate change on their business.\u201d The FRC will also examine whether companies have adopted the recommendations put forward by the the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which was set up to highlight the financial exposure of companies to the risk of climate chaos. Mark Carney, the outgoing Bank of England governor, warned companies late last year to use their next two annual financial reports to road-test how they represent climate risks in their accounts. He said that while many of the largest banks and energy companies had made progress in how they report their climate risks, this progress is \u201cuneven across sectors\u201d. Investors are calling for better climate disclosure standards as they face increasing pressure to prove they are investing responsibly. Under a new voluntary City code, which came into effect this year, pension funds and asset managers must publish annual reports showing they have taken environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into account when investing. The FRC, which governs the code, said it would help \u201calign the approach of the whole investment community\u201d. The FRC plans to select a sample of company financial reports from across different industries to assess to what extent they comply with reporting requirements in relation to the climate emergency. It will investigate whether auditors have assigned enough resources to analysing climate risks and whether the impact of a climate crisis has been appropriately reflected in company reports and accounts. The first set of accounts to face the FRC\u2019s scrutiny under its new investigation will be taken from this year, which will be published from early 2021.",

The Office for National Statistics said sales increased on average across the high street and online by 0.9%, reversing a 0.6% decline during December. Drawing a line under the worst year on record for retail sales in 2019, the value of goods bought also increased after the amount spent rose by 1.2%. Analysts said the increase was even more impressive as the figure included a 5.7% month-to-month drop in petrol and diesel sales \u2013 the biggest since March 2015 \u2013 which was driven by higher fuel prices and bad weather. The latest official barometer of high street and online sales is expected to persuade any wavering members of the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate-setting committee against voting for a cut in the cost of borrowing. Two members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee voted for an interest rate cut in January to boost the economy but are not expected to repeat their demand at the next meeting in March. The January increase in retail sales failed to reverse steep declines at the end of last year. The ONS said a measure of sales volumes during the three months to January was down 0.8% compared with the three months to the end of October last year. The amount spent in retail fell during the period to January by 0.5% when compared with the previous three months.

The return of consumer spending contrasted with the ongoing difficulties of the manufacturing sector, where output fell in the three months to February at a slightly slower pace than in the quarter ending in January, according to a survey of the sector released on Thursday by business lobby group the CBI. The CBI said that while there was a more buoyant outlook after orders hit a six-month high in February, the reading remained well below the survey\u2019s long-run average. The monthly manufacturing orders balance, which offsets the number of companies saying orders have risen against those that say they fell, rose to -18 in February from -22 in January.

      "bodyText": "Wednesday brought more news of President Trump\u2019s determination to use the powers of the presidency as inducements for people to do his bidding. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is fighting extradition from England to the United States, claims that he was offered a presidential pardon if he publicly denied that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign. Assange\u2019s claim, along with Tuesday\u2019s grants of clemency by Trump, helps to explain the president\u2019s special love of this unique presidential prerogative. Of all of his powers, clemency comes closest to fulfilling his view that as president he can do whatever he wants and, at the same time, to revealing the primitive and instinctive component of Trump\u2019s personality, what Sigmund Freud called \u201cid\u201d. The president has proudly proclaimed that \u201call agree the US president has the complete power to pardon.\u201d Trump\u2019s ability to use this power in this way contrasts with his openly expressed frustration that \u201cbecause I\u2019m the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department \u2026 I\u2019m not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing.\u201d But the president is not alone in taking an expansive view of executive clemency. According to an 1866 decision of the US supreme court, that power is \u201cunlimited\u201d, extending to \u201cevery offense known to the law\u201d. Other courts have been even more explicit about the vastness of the clemency power, saying: \u201cAn executive may grant a pardon, for good reasons or bad, or for any reason at all, and his act is final and irrevocable. Even for the grossest abuse of this discretionary power, the law affords no remedy.\u201d No wonder Trump calls the clemency power a \u201cbeautiful thing\u201d. In spite of his appreciation of this beautiful thing, Trump has been relatively parsimonious in using it. In his three years in office he has pardoned or commuted the sentences of only 35 people. Contrast this with, President Obama who issued just under 2,000 clemencies during his eight years in office. But, as in other arenas, when the president has used the clemency power he has circumvented the norms and procedures that in the past have governed it. He has bypassed the office of the pardon attorney in the justice department which for more than a century has played a key gatekeeping role for people seeking clemency. He has ignored offenders who have followed that department\u2019s procedures, while granting pardons and commutations to a rogues\u2019 gallery of the notorious and the well-connected or to people whose cases seem to have struck his fancy. In addition, the people to whom Trump has been merciful are overwhelmingly male and white. Only two of Trump\u2019s best-known acts of clemency have gone to African Americans. One went to Alice Marie Johnson, who served 21 years of a life sentence for a non-violent drug conviction. The other went, posthumously, to Jack Johnson. The famous boxer was sentenced in 1920 for violating the Mann Act, when he traveled with a white woman he was in a relationship with across state lines. In his use of the clemency power, Trump has shown special solicitude to people whose actions violate the public trust and subvert the system of justice itself. This has been true since his first use of that power, in August 2017, when he pardoned former sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio had been jailed for his defiance of a court order directing him to stop engaging in racial profiling. It was also revealed in his April 2018 pardon of Scooter Libby, an aide to former vice-president Dick Cheney who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice, and in the pardon of the Rudy Giuliani associate Bernard Kerik, who pleaded guilty to federal charges of tax fraud and lying to investigators in 2009. And, in commuting the sentence of the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, Trump was granting clemency to his own alter ego. Blagojevich, a Democrat, was impeached and removed from office in 2009 for corruption, and was later indicted on multiple corruption charges. Like Trump\u2019s infamous effort to impose a quid pro quo on the Ukrainians, Blagojevich was accused of trying to solicit personal favors and sell Barack Obama\u2019s vacant US Senate seat when he won the presidency. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. During his trial, a taped phone conversation revealed Blagojevich saying: \u201cI\u2019ve got this thing, and it\u2019s fucking golden. I\u2019m just not giving it up for fucking nothing.\u201d Signaling his identification with Blagojevich the president said: \u201cI would think that there have been many politicians \u2013 I\u2019m not one of them by the way \u2013 that have said a lot worse over the phone.\u201d Trump dismissed the governor\u2019s comments from his phone call as \u201cbraggadocio\u201d and insufficient for a conviction. Writing in 1833 about the president\u2019s clemency power, the chief justice of the United States, John Marshall, said that it would always entail \u201can act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws\u201d. This grace, he conceded, is beyond the reach of legal compulsion or regulation. It is left to the president\u2019s unfettered discretion, and its wise use depends on the judgment and propriety of those who wield it. Clemency, in the words of the English legal theorist, William Blackstone, is \u201ca court of equity in [the president\u2019s] own breast\u201d. Assange\u2019s claim, along with Trump\u2019s recent pardons and commutations, raises doubts yet again about the judgment and propriety of the current president. Americans should recognize those things for what they are, namely more signals of the president\u2019s disdain for the rule of law. Because there is no legal avenue to challenge Trump\u2019s use of clemency, it is left to the American people to decide whether to continue to entrust Donald Trump with the unfettered power to grant pardons and reprieves.

It is about time someone with a genuine appreciation of the game stepped in to prevent VAR\u2019s remote officials tying themselves in unnecessary knots over something as straightforward as the offside rule. What Wenger is suggesting, in his capacity as Fifa\u2019s head of global development, is a slight variation on the concept of daylight between an attacking player and the last defender. The former Arsenal manager believes that if any part of a player\u2019s body that can score a goal is level or onside \u2013 ie anything except hand or arm \u2013 he should not be ruled offside and we can stop chalking off perfectly good goals because an armpit or a big toe was millimetres ahead of the last defender. That sounds sensible, and should work, although you just know that the people at Stockley Park are not going to give up their imaginary lines across the pitch without a fight. What we will probably see next season, should Wenger\u2019s amendment be accepted, is a series of microscopically measured arguments to decide whether a player\u2019s heel or backside was actually onside or not.

This would usually be followed by some sort of reassurance that he had no interest in divorce. Of course, the key piece I was overlooking is that people don\u2019t necessarily schedule leaving their marriages \u2013 not years in advance, anyway \u2013 and so my husband didn\u2019t leave until he was good and ready. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t good and ready until I was 46 years old. That\u2019s when I read the article about the plankton generation. \u201cIt says single women aged 45 and older are barely visible and at the bottom of the food chain for dating and relationships,\u201d I sniveled into the phone to a close friend, reading aloud from the blog I had found. \u201cI\u2019m plankton,\u201d I cried, envisioning a massive sea of sad, ageing lady-plankton, swept along almost imperceptibly by a fickle tide, headed straight toward a washed-up fate. There are few things that will jolt anyone out of their comfort zone more violently than the abrupt end of a long marriage. For divorced older women, what makes this harder is the rude awakening that we have depreciated in value since we were last on the market. We have not only lost what we had (marriage, financial stability), we have arguably lost the tools needed to replace it (youth, beauty). It\u2019s kind of like that saying about giving a man a fish versus teaching him to fish; we have lost our original fish, and also have become really terrible at fishing. (Of course, that might be because we\u2019re plankton.) In the world of online dating, a man\u2019s \u201cdesirability\u201d apparently peaks at age 50, while a woman\u2019s tops out at 18. And in a recent study, researchers sent out fictitious r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for job applicants categorized as young (29-31), middle-aged (49-51), and older (64-66). For both genders, the callback rates were lower for older applicants, but the researchers found robust proof that older women were less likely to be hired.

The anonymous author of the plankton blog, which describes the travails of looking for love after 45, knew these problems well. \u201cI may live until I am 90,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut a sort of death has already come.\u201d Ouch.

      "body": "<p>There seem to be two essential prisms through which to view the celebrity star suffering in the spotlight. The first is the cynical tabloid editor\u2019s perspective, picked up from decades of watching famous faces prostitute themselves in the name of publicity: the idea here is that those who place themselves in the public eye, who want the attention that comes with fame, are not really entitled to compassion.</p> <p>The second view, with which it is hard not to sympathise when reading about Ben Affleck\u2019s struggles with alcoholism and his time as Batman <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/movies/ben-affleck.html\">in the New York Times</a>, is that no matter how rich and privileged a well-known figure might be, they are flawed human beings like the rest of us who are worthy of our empathy when they find themselves in dark places. Affleck was a terrible Batman, entirely the wrong choice to play Bruce Wayne in Warner Bros\u2019 ill-conceived extended universe of DC comic book movies, but it remains sad to witness how the actor\u2019s struggles with the role fed into his private life.</p> <p>We should not forget that this was always something of a poisoned chalice. <a href=\"https://collider.com/was-ben-affleck-a-good-batman/\">Affleck\u2019s Batman</a> was hard to like from the beginning: a knuckle-headed bruiser who tried to kill Superman \u2013 basically the Jesus of the DC universe \u2013 because he blamed him for the destruction of Metropolis caused by General Zod in DC\u2019s first entry, 2013\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/13/man-of-steel-review\">Man of Steel</a>. Warner Brothers needed this setup, because it allowed them to title the next episode <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/27/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-observer-review\">Batman vs Superman</a>, and Affleck ended up being the patsy. That 2016 movie\u2019s subtitle, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/25/review-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice\">Dawn of Justice</a>, was always something of a shonky afterthought that essentially gave away the movie\u2019s ending before we had seen the film\u2019s opening frame. Like Zack Snyder\u2019s movie itself, the whole thing smacked of a film-making machine where the marketing men held sway over everything. In the wake of the film\u2019s subsequent derisive reviews, it soon became clear that the movie\u2019s star was deeply unhappy with life behind the cowl <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtfoRESVir0\">and we saw all those \u201cSad Affleck\u201d memes</a>.</p> <p>It got even worse by the time of 2016\u2019s Justice League, by which time Batman had been hamfistedly reconfigured as a heroic figure, with Affleck forced into an apologetic performance that seemed to mirror his real-life struggles. It seems that he has been apologising ever since, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/ben-affleck-apologises-for-groping-hilarie-burton-in-2003\">reasonably so in some cases</a>.</p> <p>Affleck isn\u2019t the first denizen of Gotham City to suffer for his art. Heath Ledger won a posthumous best supporting actor Oscar in February 2009 for his startling, spiky turn as The Joker in Christopher Nolan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/25/actionandadventure1\">The Dark Knight</a>, having died from an overdose of prescription drugs just over a year earlier. At the time the newspapers were filled with reports that the Australian actor had been taking prescription drugs to help himself sleep when he accidentally overdosed in his Manhattan apartment \u2013 Ledger had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/07/australia.usa\">admitted in a New York Times interview</a> that he had been struggling to switch off after taking on the role of Gotham\u2019s clown prince of crime, as well as a part in another film, the Bob Dylan biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/21/drama\">I\u2019m Not There</a>. \u201cLast week I probably slept an average of two hours a night,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking. My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going.\u201d</p> <p>Is there something particularly dark and intense about the world of Batman that feeds into a kind of existential malaise for actors who find themselves trying to embody its main players on screen? This is a reasonable argument to pursue in the case of Ledger, whose Joker was a poisonous whirlwind of vicious, sadistic nihilism \u2013 a venus flytrap for the dedicated method actor. But Affleck\u2019s caped crusader, certainly by the time of his final turn in Justice League, seemed to have morphed into more of a cynical, wisecracking type than the tortured soul of Christian Bale-era Batman. It ought to have been something of a fun role to play, with stand-in director and screenwriter Joss Whedon throwing in trademark japes from the sidelines, yet it never seems to have been enjoyable.</p> <p>Affleck never really got the chance to pursue his own vision for the character, having ultimately opted out of directing and starring in the forthcoming The Batman in the interests of his own mental health. This week we got to see how the new man behind the mask, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHVq0_kF6jY\">Robert Pattinson, is likely to look in Matt Reeves\u2019 film</a>. This is a fledgling, punky Batman, one who might be just starting out on his battles to save Gotham City and who looks all the more intriguing for it. It\u2019s hard not to think that Affleck might be best off away from the role, and the film series better off in a place where it can make a fresh start.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHVq0_kF6jY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AHVq0_kF6jY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The peculiar thing about Batman is that Bruce Wayne has every gift given to him by life, yet prefers to suffer behind a mask than live out a life of luxury and indolence. Perhaps Affleck, and others who have struggled for their art in the name of Gotham City, would understand that essential paradox.</p>",

The second view, with which it is hard not to sympathise when reading about Ben Affleck\u2019s struggles with alcoholism and his time as Batman in the New York Times, is that no matter how rich and privileged a well-known figure might be, they are flawed human beings like the rest of us who are worthy of our empathy when they find themselves in dark places. Affleck was a terrible Batman, entirely the wrong choice to play Bruce Wayne in Warner Bros\u2019 ill-conceived extended universe of DC comic book movies, but it remains sad to witness how the actor\u2019s struggles with the role fed into his private life. We should not forget that this was always something of a poisoned chalice. Affleck\u2019s Batman was hard to like from the beginning: a knuckle-headed bruiser who tried to kill Superman \u2013 basically the Jesus of the DC universe \u2013 because he blamed him for the destruction of Metropolis caused by General Zod in DC\u2019s first entry, 2013\u2019s Man of Steel. Warner Brothers needed this setup, because it allowed them to title the next episode Batman vs Superman, and Affleck ended up being the patsy. That 2016 movie\u2019s subtitle, Dawn of Justice, was always something of a shonky afterthought that essentially gave away the movie\u2019s ending before we had seen the film\u2019s opening frame. Like Zack Snyder\u2019s movie itself, the whole thing smacked of a film-making machine where the marketing men held sway over everything. In the wake of the film\u2019s subsequent derisive reviews, it soon became clear that the movie\u2019s star was deeply unhappy with life behind the cowl and we saw all those \u201cSad Affleck\u201d memes. It got even worse by the time of 2016\u2019s Justice League, by which time Batman had been hamfistedly reconfigured as a heroic figure, with Affleck forced into an apologetic performance that seemed to mirror his real-life struggles. It seems that he has been apologising ever since, reasonably so in some cases. Affleck isn\u2019t the first denizen of Gotham City to suffer for his art. Heath Ledger won a posthumous best supporting actor Oscar in February 2009 for his startling, spiky turn as The Joker in Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight, having died from an overdose of prescription drugs just over a year earlier. At the time the newspapers were filled with reports that the Australian actor had been taking prescription drugs to help himself sleep when he accidentally overdosed in his Manhattan apartment \u2013 Ledger had admitted in a New York Times interview that he had been struggling to switch off after taking on the role of Gotham\u2019s clown prince of crime, as well as a part in another film, the Bob Dylan biopic I\u2019m Not There. \u201cLast week I probably slept an average of two hours a night,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking. My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going.\u201d Is there something particularly dark and intense about the world of Batman that feeds into a kind of existential malaise for actors who find themselves trying to embody its main players on screen? This is a reasonable argument to pursue in the case of Ledger, whose Joker was a poisonous whirlwind of vicious, sadistic nihilism \u2013 a venus flytrap for the dedicated method actor. But Affleck\u2019s caped crusader, certainly by the time of his final turn in Justice League, seemed to have morphed into more of a cynical, wisecracking type than the tortured soul of Christian Bale-era Batman. It ought to have been something of a fun role to play, with stand-in director and screenwriter Joss Whedon throwing in trademark japes from the sidelines, yet it never seems to have been enjoyable. Affleck never really got the chance to pursue his own vision for the character, having ultimately opted out of directing and starring in the forthcoming The Batman in the interests of his own mental health. This week we got to see how the new man behind the mask, Robert Pattinson, is likely to look in Matt Reeves\u2019 film. This is a fledgling, punky Batman, one who might be just starting out on his battles to save Gotham City and who looks all the more intriguing for it. It\u2019s hard not to think that Affleck might be best off away from the role, and the film series better off in a place where it can make a fresh start. The peculiar thing about Batman is that Bruce Wayne has every gift given to him by life, yet prefers to suffer behind a mask than live out a life of luxury and indolence. Perhaps Affleck, and others who have struggled for their art in the name of Gotham City, would understand that essential paradox.",

Can there be, metaphorically speaking, a mature new Germany? Or am I going to keep banging my tin drum like a monstrous little terrorist? That\u2019s the key question. It\u2019s not just Oskar\u2019s coming of age story, but that of an entire country.\u201d</p> <p>What makes Matzerath an even more ambiguous character is that he is also an artist figure, and part self-portrait of his original creator. When Grass published his debut novel in 1959, aged 31, The Tin Drum was perceived as an assault on the German bourgeoisie.</p> <p>Its graphic content and critical depiction of the Wehrmacht enraged the country\u2019s churches and soldiers. Senators in the Bremen vetoed Grass from being awarded its literature prize; years later, in 1997, the US state of Oklahoma tried to ban the film version for depicting Matzerath performing oral sex on a teenage girl.</p> <p>In the novel\u2019s first half, its protagonist uses his artistic talent to sabotage the National Socialist war machine, at one point literally forcing the marchers at a Nazi rally to dance to the beat of his tin drum. The anarchic energy and tuneless protest of Grass\u2019s character found admirers across the globe, especially among other artists.</p> <p>American novelist John Irving, whose most famous creation Owen Meany carries the same initials as Grass\u2019s, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/books/review/Irving.html\">wrote</a> that the German novelist had taught him \u201cthat it was possible to be a living writer who wrote with Dickens\u2019s full range of emotion and relentless outpouring of language\u201d. Oskar Schell, the main character in Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview22\">Extremely Loud and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview22\">Incredibly Close</a> is another homage to Matzerath\u2019s trail-blazing influence.

      "bodyText": "Every audience loves a hero, but Oskar Matzerath, one of the most unsettling literary characters of the 20th century, doesn\u2019t make it easy for the spectator. By the end of Oliver Reese\u2019s stage version of G\u00fcnter Grass\u2019s novel The Tin Drum, of which Oskar is the sole protagonist, the realisation spreads through the auditorium that Oskar has played a key part in the deaths of all three people who make up his family. The man official records call his father, Alfred, has choked on the Nazi membership badge his son handed to him as the Russian Red Army descended on his house. Jan Bronski, his mother\u2019s lover, has been shot dead by the Nazis after being denounced by the boy who might be his biological son. His mother, meanwhile, has stuffed herself with herring and eel until succumbing to fish poisoning, horrified by the realisation she could be about to have another child. It\u2019s not exactly a list of achievements that makes you warm to young Oskar, a precocious child with a vivid imagination who refuses to grow up when he turns three, and underlines his unyielding will by banging a red and white tin drum and shattering glass with his high-pitched screams. \u201cHe\u2019s unbearable,\u201d says director Reese. \u201cHe\u2019d be a nightmare as a flatmate.\u201d In Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff\u2019s Academy Award-winning 1979 film adaption, Matzerath the younger was played by the 11-year-old Swiss child actor David Bennent, lending an innocent face to Grass\u2019s not-coming-of-age story. For the stage version, which has been packing out the main hall at the legendary Berliner Ensemble for the last three years and transfers to London\u2019s Coronet theatre for five nights next week, director Reese has fitted this ultimate unreliable narrator with a more grownup face. Thirty-six-year-old Nico Holonics is a gap-toothed force of nature in short trousers and a hoodie, blossoming on a bare stage decorated with only a pile of soil from juvenile pig-headedness into full-on megalomania, eventually picking fights with those in the audience who still dare to laugh at him. For Reese, who made his name with one-man shows based on letters and diaries of other such crowd-pleasers as Joseph Goebbels and the notorious German child murderer J\u00fcrgen Bartsch, Oskar Matzerath is a man whose conscience is on trial. \u201cI see The Tin Drum as a novel about German guilt,\u201d he says in his room on the River Spree at the Ensemble \u2013 he has been the theatre\u2019s artistic director since 2017. \u201cThe second book ends with Oskar Matzerath having effectively killed his three parents. All that coincides not just with the end of the Nazi regime, but also the end of Oskar\u2019s childhood, because he has just turned 21. \u201cThe crucial question of this character is: now that the issue of German guilt is dealt with, can I begin to grow up? Can there be, metaphorically speaking, a mature new Germany? Or am I going to keep banging my tin drum like a monstrous little terrorist? That\u2019s the key question. It\u2019s not just Oskar\u2019s coming of age story, but that of an entire country.\u201d What makes Matzerath an even more ambiguous character is that he is also an artist figure, and part self-portrait of his original creator. When Grass published his debut novel in 1959, aged 31, The Tin Drum was perceived as an assault on the German bourgeoisie. Its graphic content and critical depiction of the Wehrmacht enraged the country\u2019s churches and soldiers. Senators in the Bremen vetoed Grass from being awarded its literature prize; years later, in 1997, the US state of Oklahoma tried to ban the film version for depicting Matzerath performing oral sex on a teenage girl. In the novel\u2019s first half, its protagonist uses his artistic talent to sabotage the National Socialist war machine, at one point literally forcing the marchers at a Nazi rally to dance to the beat of his tin drum. The anarchic energy and tuneless protest of Grass\u2019s character found admirers across the globe, especially among other artists. American novelist John Irving, whose most famous creation Owen Meany carries the same initials as Grass\u2019s, wrote that the German novelist had taught him \u201cthat it was possible to be a living writer who wrote with Dickens\u2019s full range of emotion and relentless outpouring of language\u201d. Oskar Schell, the main character in Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is another homage to Matzerath\u2019s trail-blazing influence. Even British band Bronski Beat nodded to Grass\u2019s troubled small-town-boy drummer with their name, if Richard Coles\u2019s autobiography is to be believed. When Grass revealed in 2006 that at 17 he had been drafted into the Waffen-SS before the end of the war, it complicated his legacy, leading some to criticise his status as a conscience of the German nation and call on him to hand back the Nobel prize he was awarded in 1999. Yet in Reese\u2019s view, the moral conflict Grass and his creation carry inside them is precisely what makes his work endure. \u201cGrass worked his own enmeshment with the Nazi regime, which he only started talking about much later, into the fabric of this work. That\u2019s why this novel is such a work of genius \u2013 he answers with a work of art.\u201d Even in the original text, Reese points out, young Oskar is not just a saboteur but also a collaborator, who eventually agrees to perform singing tricks for Nazi troops in Paris. \u201cEven then, the story is held in a fine balance, because even though Oskar Matzerath is now a collaborator, it\u2019s also clear that he, \u2018the dwarf\u2019, would go straight to the gas chamber if the Nazis had their way. They don\u2019t consider his life worth living.\u201d The Tin Drum is at the Coronet, London, 24-29 February.",

The warning has been issued by 25 experts from around the world, who acknowledge that little is known about most of the estimated 5.5 million insect species. However, enough was understood to warrant immediate action, they said, because waiting for better data would risk irreversible damage. The researchers said solutions were available and must be implemented immediately. These range from bigger nature reserves and a crackdown on harmful pesticides to individual action such as not mowing the lawn and leaving dead wood in gardens. They also said invertebrates must no longer be neglected by conservation efforts, which tend to focus on mammals and birds. The alert has been published as two articles in the Biological Conservation journal. \u201cThe current [insect] extinction crisis is deeply worrisome. Yet, what we know is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d the scientists write. \u201cWe know enough to act immediately. Solutions are now available \u2013 we must act upon them.\u201d \u201cInsect declines lead to the loss of essential, irreplaceable services to humanity. Human activity is responsible for almost all current insect population declines and extinctions.\u201d Insect population collapses have been reported in Germany, Puerto Rico and elsewhere. The first global scientific review, published in February 2019, said widespread declines threatened to cause a \u201ccatastrophic collapse of nature\u2019s ecosystems\u201d. Insects pollinate three-quarters of crops, and another recent study showed widespread losses of such insects across Britain. The report notes that only about a fifth of the world\u2019s insect species have even been named, mostly from only single specimens. \u201cMany insect species are going extinct even before being described,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cIt is likely that insect extinctions since the industrial era are around 5-10%, ie 250,000 to 500,000 species.\u201d This estimate is based on the extinctions of land snails.

Part game design toolkit, part digital audio workstation, part animation studio and part social network, there\u2019s something here for every niche, every creative ambition. For me, it was \u201canimating\u201d a balloon in the background of a 3D platformer stage.

We\u2019re only talking about a balloon, but it felt like the finishing brush strokes on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/28/vincent-van-gogh-starry-night-hokusai-great-wave\">The Starry Night</a>. Give me a pencil, and I\u2019ll have trouble drawing you a balloon you could recognise. Within an hour of play, Dreams was letting me animate one.</p> <p>As delightful as Dreams is as a toolkit, what is perhaps just as important is how it teaches, and Dreams is everything a good teacher should be: generous, forgiving, thorough.

You don\u2019t just share levels or art pieces, but the individual elements that make up those creations. If you\u2019re great at music but find animation difficult, for example, you can upload your own music packs for others to benefit from, and search the \u201cdreamiverse\u201d for another\u2019s animations to complement your own work. Alongside this, there are templates for genres such as first-person shooters and platformers that provide a basic framework for addition and repetition.</p> <p>As well as creation and play mode \u2013 dream shaping and dream surfing respectively \u2013 Dreams comes packaged with a two- to three-hour story mode called Art\u2019s Dream that tells of a forlorn double bass player in the days after a split from his band. It\u2019s a melancholy, occasionally goofy and ultimately hopeful tribute to art and creation for its own sake. It\u2019s also somewhat of a mission statement for Dreams, urging players to ignore self-doubt and let their creativity bloom.</p> <p>Gameplay wise, it\u2019s a mashup of genre and visual styles, acting as a showcase for the platform. It does seem a bizarre choice on Media Molecule\u2019s part, then, not to allow players to remix this flagship story mode. When you create your own \u201cdreams\u201d and upload them for others to use, you can toggle the option to allow remixes, which gives players access to the framework and guts of your creation. This allows them to tweak your work and re-upload it, but it also provides an invaluable learning tool for those looking to discover how the more complicated elements are achieved. It seems like a missed opportunity, and perhaps a direct contradiction to Dreams\u2019 core philosophy, to not allow players to dissect and learn from the creation marketed as a high point of the possibilities the platform offers. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btj6Ziu_QpU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Btj6Ziu_QpU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Towards the end of Art\u2019s Dream, the titutar Art encounters an old friend working the booth at a cinema. As happens a few times over the course of the story, the pair get into a thinly veiled but still lovely and inspiring conversation about the philosophy of creativity, culminating in the cinema worker telling Art: \u201cNothing is a waste of time if you love doing it.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a great attitude. It\u2019s also a convenient one if you happen to be selling a locked platform. If you make something in Dreams, it stays in Dreams. Media Molecule has spoken about implementing ways for players to monetise their creations, but currently only Sony and the developers can profit. Every creation, for now, increases the value of a commercial product from which creators have no way to benefit. How you feel about this will be the deciding factor on whether the game is for you. Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/dec/11/the-11-best-games-on-playstation-vr\">PlayStation VR</a> and online multiplayer support are also promised but have not yet been implemented.</p> <p>Dreams nonetheless still offers a set of powerful, enjoyable tools at a low price and hours of fantastic tutorials. Adults may find the presentation a little too charmed by its own whimsy, especially in light of the tension between an art for art\u2019s sake message and a commercial walled garden. Yet it\u2019s likely to encourage many younger players to bring their own dreams to life.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

As well as creation and play mode \u2013 dream shaping and dream surfing respectively \u2013 Dreams comes packaged with a two- to three-hour story mode called Art\u2019s Dream that tells of a forlorn double bass player in the days after a split from his band. It\u2019s a melancholy, occasionally goofy and ultimately hopeful tribute to art and creation for its own sake. It\u2019s also somewhat of a mission statement for Dreams, urging players to ignore self-doubt and let their creativity bloom. Gameplay wise, it\u2019s a mashup of genre and visual styles, acting as a showcase for the platform. It does seem a bizarre choice on Media Molecule\u2019s part, then, not to allow players to remix this flagship story mode. When you create your own \u201cdreams\u201d and upload them for others to use, you can toggle the option to allow remixes, which gives players access to the framework and guts of your creation. This allows them to tweak your work and re-upload it, but it also provides an invaluable learning tool for those looking to discover how the more complicated elements are achieved. It seems like a missed opportunity, and perhaps a direct contradiction to Dreams\u2019 core philosophy, to not allow players to dissect and learn from the creation marketed as a high point of the possibilities the platform offers. Towards the end of Art\u2019s Dream, the titutar Art encounters an old friend working the booth at a cinema. As happens a few times over the course of the story, the pair get into a thinly veiled but still lovely and inspiring conversation about the philosophy of creativity, culminating in the cinema worker telling Art: \u201cNothing is a waste of time if you love doing it.\u201d It\u2019s a great attitude. It\u2019s also a convenient one if you happen to be selling a locked platform. If you make something in Dreams, it stays in Dreams. Media Molecule has spoken about implementing ways for players to monetise their creations, but currently only Sony and the developers can profit. Every creation, for now, increases the value of a commercial product from which creators have no way to benefit. How you feel about this will be the deciding factor on whether the game is for you. Elsewhere, PlayStation VR and online multiplayer support are also promised but have not yet been implemented. Dreams nonetheless still offers a set of powerful, enjoyable tools at a low price and hours of fantastic tutorials. Adults may find the presentation a little too charmed by its own whimsy, especially in light of the tension between an art for art\u2019s sake message and a commercial walled garden. Yet it\u2019s likely to encourage many younger players to bring their own dreams to life.",

Over the years there were further revelations: hearing her father sob by an old railway station on a trip to Czechoslovakia (\u201cThis is where we said goodbye\u201d); and finding his name among the 77,297 Nazi victims listed on a memorial in Prague (though with a question mark instead of the date of his death). There was even talk of him writing a memoir and of her helping with it. But it wasn\u2019t until after his death that she began to understand what he\u2019d been through during the war.

In Prague, though, time was running out: knowing he would soon be discovered, he cooked up a plan to join his friend Zden\u011bk in Berlin.

      "bodyText": "At first, 23-year-old Khadar Abdi Abdullahi\u2019s eyes began turning yellow. Then the palms of his hands did the same. Soon he was bleeding from his nose, and from his mouth, and his body was swelling all over. Eventually he collapsed with fever. He later died. A deadly sickness is spreading through villages near a Chinese natural gas project in Ethiopia\u2019s Somali region, according to locals and officials who spoke to the Guardian. Many of Khadar\u2019s neighbours have suffered the same symptoms. Like him, some died. It is not clear what is causing the sickness, and officials in the federal government in Addis Ababa firmly denied allegations both of a health and environmental crisis in the Somali region, or of any problems relating to large-scale energy projects there. Poly-GCL, a partly state-owned Chinese company, has been prospecting for oil and gas in the Ogaden Basin, as the vicinity is known, since 2014. Calub, roughly 500km south-east of Jigjiga and near neighbouring Somalia, is due to start commercial gas production soon. Khadar, like many from the area, is suspicious that the sickness is caused by hazardous chemical waste that has poisoned the water supply. \u201cIt is the toxins that flow in the rainfall from Calub [gas field] that are responsible for this epidemic,\u201d said Khadar, as he sat outdoors in the eastern Ethiopian city of Jigjiga. He had recently been discharged from hospital; doctors there said there was nothing more they could do for him. He was weak and thin and his eyes were sinking into their sockets. \u201cThere are new diseases that have never been seen before in this area,\u201d said an adviser to the Somali regional government, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cWithout any public health protection, it is very clear that Poly-GCL uses chemicals that are detrimental to human health.\u201d It is an allegation the Guardian heard repeatedly during a recent visit to the thinly populated scrubland that surrounds Calub gas field, though it was not able to independently verify its veracity. Poly-GCL did not respond to requests to comment. Ketsela Tadesse, director of licensing at the federal ministry of mines and petroleum, said the government was not aware of any reports of spillages, adding that in any case there were \u201cthere are no permanent settlers\u201d in the vicinity of the gas field. \u201cWe can emphatically state that all the gas wells at Calub and elsewhere in the Ogaden Basin, are sealed, safe and secured \u2026 according to international standards,\u201d Tadesse said. What is clear, however, is that the mysterious sickness has caused deaths. Ceeble Tuuba, a resident and prominent activist in the town of Haarcad, said her neighbour Cambaro Tawal was the first local to die from it, in 2014. \u201cThe widespread symptoms from which locals living around Calub die are different from all others,\u201d she said. Tuuba cited the example of her two year-old nephew, who was taken to the hospital in Jigjiga earlier this year. He stayed there for a month, receiving multiple blood transfusions to no effect. He died after being discharged from hospital. His symptoms were those common to all who have contracted this unidentified sickness, she said: swelling, fever, sleeplessness, yellowing eyes and palms, and lack of appetite. A doctor from the referral hospital in Jijiga, who surveyed the area but wished to remain anonymous, said most of the symptoms locals exhibited in the clinics he visited were life-threatening. Ceeble said \u201ccountless\u201d of her neighbours had died in this way in recent years. Hassan Ali, a doctor at a health clinic in Haarcad, claimed there is a direct correlation between the number of reported cases in each village and its proximity to the Calub wells. Xuseen Sheekh Siraad, the chairman of Dhoobaweyn district, estimated that there have been at least 2,000 deaths since 2014. But there is no official death toll and those who live around Calub are predominantly nomadic pastoralists, whose contact with the Ethiopian government is limited. Many bury their dead without informing local officials. Furthermore, Hassan explained, most do not come to the clinic, and even if they do it does not have the facilities to treat or even diagnose serious cases such as liver failure. Last year, Poly-GCL conducted the first ever crude oil extraction tests in the Ogaden Basin. It also signed a memorandum of understanding with neighboring Djibouti to invest $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) in building a 760km pipeline from Ogaden to the Djiboutian coast, which will enable Ethiopia to export as much as 6.3tn cubic feet of natural gas. At a groundbreaking ceremony in June 2018, Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia\u2019s Nobel prize-winning prime minister, said oil and gas would help alleviate the country\u2019s unemployment problem. \u201cOil production should never be a bane to us,\u201d he declared, adding that earnings at full capacity could be as much as $7bn a year. Exports, he said, would begin in 2021. But oil and gas exploration has a long and troubled history in the Ogaden. When the former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie first embarked on oil exploration in the Ogaden in 1945, mass demonstrations forced him to suspend the project. Between 1955 and 1991, 46 wells were drilled at sites in Calub and Hilala. None were successful. In 2007, rebels from the secessionist Ogaden National Liberation Front stormed another Chinese-run oilfield, killing 74 workers and destroying the facility. The Ethiopian government responded by launching a counter-insurgency campaign involving tactics so brutal that Human Rights Watch said they amounted to crimes against humanity. Whole villages around Calub were razed to the ground. The area remains heavily militarised, with police and soldiers patrolling the highway and the gas field\u2019s 40km restricted zone. Ismail Qamaan, 63, has lived his whole life in the Calub area and remembers the arrival of a German firm in the 1960s. He said a large truck recently drove across his neighbourhood, spilling a white substance. Deaths increased following this spillage according to Ismail. \u201cThey have destroyed everything that we had,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must account for what they did.\u201d But the most serious allegations came from two former employees of Poly-GCL. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an engineer who worked for the company in Calub for three years said that there were regular spillages of deadly drilling fluids including sulphuric acid. Exposure to such chemicals can lead to liver failure and stomach cancer. Ali Hassan Farah, another former employee, said that \u201cthose indigenous to the land die from raw toxins spilled out of sheer carelessness.

College stars will jump, run and lift weights in front of NFL scouts \u2013 and it will mean almost nothing.</p> <p>In an era in which every major college football game is aired on TV, scouting departments have swelled, analytics have become a bigger part of the evaluation equation, and players are tracked, measured and weighed from high school on up, you could be forgiven for wondering why the teams and prospects subject themselves to this annual sideshow.</p> <p>The league office is still all-in on the event, working with its broadcast partners to move the once untelevised event into a primetime slot. NFL Network will beam wall-to-wall coverage of every bench press, 40-yard dash and shuttle run. Want to watch a very fast man run slightly slower than another very fast man? Tune in at 3pm sharp with network heavyweight Rich Eisen.</p> <p>When the combine was first introduced, it was a way for teams to meet prospects, get accurate height and weight measurements and, often, to see players perform football drills for the very first time. Especially during a period when college footage was often grainy and awful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/the-nfls-new-evil-empire-who-will-replace-the-patriots-as-league-supervillains\">The NFL's new evil empire: who will replace the Patriots as league supervillains?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those days are gone. NFL franchises are multibillion dollar operations. Every decision requires extensive analysis. The players, in teams\u2019 eyes, are assets. They hire private investigation firms to run extensive background checks on potential picks these days. And spotting an a scout on a college campus has become just as standard as seeing a professor \u2013 the lines between college football as a standalone competition and as the NFL\u2019s minor league have never been so blurred.</p> <p>The combine is a chance for a team to grab a bunch of extra data points in quick fashion, they say. To gather the easy things \u2013 height, weight, speed \u2013 and the intangible stuff: the psychological evaluations, medical records, and football intelligence.

      "bodyText": "The underwear Olympics, otherwise known as the NFL combine, will roll into Indianapolis next week. College stars will jump, run and lift weights in front of NFL scouts \u2013 and it will mean almost nothing. In an era in which every major college football game is aired on TV, scouting departments have swelled, analytics have become a bigger part of the evaluation equation, and players are tracked, measured and weighed from high school on up, you could be forgiven for wondering why the teams and prospects subject themselves to this annual sideshow. The league office is still all-in on the event, working with its broadcast partners to move the once untelevised event into a primetime slot. NFL Network will beam wall-to-wall coverage of every bench press, 40-yard dash and shuttle run. Want to watch a very fast man run slightly slower than another very fast man? Tune in at 3pm sharp with network heavyweight Rich Eisen. When the combine was first introduced, it was a way for teams to meet prospects, get accurate height and weight measurements and, often, to see players perform football drills for the very first time. Especially during a period when college footage was often grainy and awful. Those days are gone. NFL franchises are multibillion dollar operations. Every decision requires extensive analysis. The players, in teams\u2019 eyes, are assets. They hire private investigation firms to run extensive background checks on potential picks these days. And spotting an a scout on a college campus has become just as standard as seeing a professor \u2013 the lines between college football as a standalone competition and as the NFL\u2019s minor league have never been so blurred. The combine is a chance for a team to grab a bunch of extra data points in quick fashion, they say. To gather the easy things \u2013 height, weight, speed \u2013 and the intangible stuff: the psychological evaluations, medical records, and football intelligence. It\u2019s a giant exercise in ass-covering junk science, in collecting reams of information that have little to no relevance in predicting football performance. Something feels murky about the whole enterprise. The combine is an invitation-only event, hosted by the league to let the players know their place in the hierarchy before they\u2019ve even earned a paycheck. The undertone of the whole thing: be grateful you\u2019re here, young man. It is worth noting here, though it has been covered in more depth by more qualified people, the racial overtones of the event: a largely white NFL staff evaluating a mostly African American player pool. Never is that contrast more apparent than during weigh-in night. Players in their underwear are paraded on stage in front of a room full of executives, scouts, and coaches, like some kind of pre-fight marketing venture.

      "body": "<p>On the eve of the Horse Welfare Board\u2019s first press conference, intended to introduce itself and its aims to the world, Willie Mullins gave his support to the idea that racing should move with the times and adjust to changing social mores. The hugely successful jumps trainer described himself as a traditionalist but admitted that, despite his scepticism, good had come of significant changes made to the Grand National in the past decade.</p> \n<p>Mullins made his comments at his stables on Wednesday, during a discussion of the National Hunt Chase, which became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/12/talking-horses-cieren-fallon-turns-to-cauthen-to-get-back-on-winning-trail\">a hot topic at last year\u2019s Festival </a>when turning into an attritional battle, just four of the 18 starters completing the course. As a result, the race has now been reduced in distance by two furlongs and a minimum rating introduced along with other conditions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/19/talking-horses-power-feels-lostintranslation-is-going-under-radar\">Talking Horses: Native River ruled out of Cheltenham Gold Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Naturally, Mullins feels affection for a race he won twice as a jockey, on horses trained by his father, and twice more as a trainer with his son in the saddle. He believes a decision to make the race the last on the Festival\u2019s opening day, and therefore on cut-up ground, had contributed to last year\u2019s problems.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought that where the race was last year, the last race on the Tuesday, with the ground, it was very unfair. It used to be the first race on the second day and to have fresh ground. I\u2019m a traditionalist, I\u2019d like to see it what it was. But maybe racing in general is going to have to adapt to the new way people think about horse welfare.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course I would be disappointed [about changes to the National Hunt Chase] but maybe racing, like every sport, has to move on and acclimatise to how people perceive the sport, perceive how it should be run. The welfare of horses and jockeys is paramount. It\u2019s just a thing we\u2019re going to have to get used to.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have agreed with what changes were done to the Grand National. However, now we have a \u00a31m Grand National with [TV] ratings at the roof and it\u2019s a huge spectacle. We lost maybe a lot of the spectacularism of it, the drops and the big jumps, but we have \u00a31m to aim for and a huge race. I\u2019m for change when it\u2019s going to bring the sport forward and welfare obviously has to be a main issue.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mullins threw in some words of praise for Annemarie Phelps, a former Olympic rower who became chair of the British Horseracing Authority last year. \u201cI think, having met her, she\u2019ll be very good for racing. She hasn\u2019t got an angle, she\u2019s not a breeder, an owner or a trainer, I think she\u2019s going to bring a real good, fresh approach to the way the BHA is run and racing in general. We wish her the best.\u201d</p> \n<p>While a couple of reports have made educated guesses at what the Horse Welfare Board will say at Thursday\u2019s press conference, it appears that its introductory report has not leaked. There is expected to be some commentary on whip use in racing, perhaps calling for stronger punishments for those who break the relevant rules, but not seeking to end its use by jockeys to encourage horses forward.</p> \n<p>Quietly, officials have sought to dampen down expectations of dramatic pronouncements from the HWB\u2019s first outing. Rather, it is expected to be a long-term project aimed at sustaining public confidence in racing\u2019s ability to care for its equine participants.</p> \n<h2>Cheltenham Festival stat of the day, by Paul Ferguson</h2> \n<p>The last 18 winners of the RSA Novice Chase had contested a Graded race en route to the Festival and this is a negative for both Minella Indo and Allaho, who lack chasing experience but are high in the betting for this year\u2019s contest. Despite boasting smart Grade 1 novice hurdle form, the pair have yet to race outside of beginners events in Ireland over fences. Only two horses in recent years \u2013 Florida Pearl and Don Poli \u2013 have won the RSA on the back of just two runs and both had won a Graded event last time out.

      "bodyText": "On the eve of the Horse Welfare Board\u2019s first press conference, intended to introduce itself and its aims to the world, Willie Mullins gave his support to the idea that racing should move with the times and adjust to changing social mores. The hugely successful jumps trainer described himself as a traditionalist but admitted that, despite his scepticism, good had come of significant changes made to the Grand National in the past decade. Mullins made his comments at his stables on Wednesday, during a discussion of the National Hunt Chase, which became a hot topic at last year\u2019s Festival when turning into an attritional battle, just four of the 18 starters completing the course. As a result, the race has now been reduced in distance by two furlongs and a minimum rating introduced along with other conditions. Naturally, Mullins feels affection for a race he won twice as a jockey, on horses trained by his father, and twice more as a trainer with his son in the saddle. He believes a decision to make the race the last on the Festival\u2019s opening day, and therefore on cut-up ground, had contributed to last year\u2019s problems. \u201cI thought that where the race was last year, the last race on the Tuesday, with the ground, it was very unfair. It used to be the first race on the second day and to have fresh ground. I\u2019m a traditionalist, I\u2019d like to see it what it was. But maybe racing in general is going to have to adapt to the new way people think about horse welfare. \u201cOf course I would be disappointed [about changes to the National Hunt Chase] but maybe racing, like every sport, has to move on and acclimatise to how people perceive the sport, perceive how it should be run. The welfare of horses and jockeys is paramount. It\u2019s just a thing we\u2019re going to have to get used to. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have agreed with what changes were done to the Grand National. However, now we have a \u00a31m Grand National with [TV] ratings at the roof and it\u2019s a huge spectacle. We lost maybe a lot of the spectacularism of it, the drops and the big jumps, but we have \u00a31m to aim for and a huge race. I\u2019m for change when it\u2019s going to bring the sport forward and welfare obviously has to be a main issue.\u201d Mullins threw in some words of praise for Annemarie Phelps, a former Olympic rower who became chair of the British Horseracing Authority last year. \u201cI think, having met her, she\u2019ll be very good for racing. She hasn\u2019t got an angle, she\u2019s not a breeder, an owner or a trainer, I think she\u2019s going to bring a real good, fresh approach to the way the BHA is run and racing in general. We wish her the best.\u201d While a couple of reports have made educated guesses at what the Horse Welfare Board will say at Thursday\u2019s press conference, it appears that its introductory report has not leaked. There is expected to be some commentary on whip use in racing, perhaps calling for stronger punishments for those who break the relevant rules, but not seeking to end its use by jockeys to encourage horses forward. Quietly, officials have sought to dampen down expectations of dramatic pronouncements from the HWB\u2019s first outing. Rather, it is expected to be a long-term project aimed at sustaining public confidence in racing\u2019s ability to care for its equine participants. Cheltenham Festival stat of the day, by Paul Ferguson The last 18 winners of the RSA Novice Chase had contested a Graded race en route to the Festival and this is a negative for both Minella Indo and Allaho, who lack chasing experience but are high in the betting for this year\u2019s contest. Despite boasting smart Grade 1 novice hurdle form, the pair have yet to race outside of beginners events in Ireland over fences. Only two horses in recent years \u2013 Florida Pearl and Don Poli \u2013 have won the RSA on the back of just two runs and both had won a Graded event last time out. Both were also unbeaten. The Weatherbys Cheltenham Festival Betting Guide 2020, written by Paul Ferguson, is published this week and available through this link for \u00a315.95. A Cheltenham Festival stat of the day will appear here from Monday to Friday for the next three weeks. Thursday\u2019s best bets We\u2019re on a run of three winning naps and responsibility for turning that into four rests with Mickey Buckman (2.11), a 7-4 shot at Huntingdon. He showed promise when third here in November in a novice hurdle that is working out pretty well. He again showed ability when a keeping-on fourth in a handicap under a 7lb claimer the next month but fell at Lingfield when last seen and needs to show that hasn\u2019t affected his confidence. If not, he has easily the best form on offer, though Fugitives Drift is just one of several unexposed rivals. Ibleo (4.41) ought to build on last month\u2019s winning chase debut, when he left his hurdles form behind, and 6-4 is fair. Hollie Doyle returns from a whip ban at Chelmsford and her best chance might be the 9-2 shot Original Choice (7.00), who ran well above his rating in a conditions race last time and is tried in blinkers rather than the familiar visor.",

For those who can justify the fees, personal branding and \u201creputation management\u201d companies do it for a living.</p> <p>At this point, all the information you need is online somewhere. The problem is that it takes a significant amount of work, which may or may not be worth it.</p> <p>In your case, I imagine that anybody likely to search for the name of a bright, young academic is not going to confuse you with a drug dealer almost twice your age. They already know that two or, usually, many more people have the same name. The people who could have real problems are the ones who share names and professions. Two journalists spring to mind: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Campbell_(journalist,_born_1944)\">Duncan Campbell</a>, a novelist and former Guardian crime reporter, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Campbell_(journalist)\">Duncan Campbell</a>, an investigative reporter and television producer formerly on the staff of the New Statesman. Neither is likely to be confused with <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/turner-prize-2014/turner-prize-2014-artists-duncan-campbell\">Duncan Campbell</a>, the artist who won the Turner prize in 2014, or the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/1PGYL1b3CZlDVSWBxq5XLbx/duncan-campbell\">Duncan Campbell</a> from the BBC\u2019s Antiques Roadshow, or numerous others.</p> <p>However, the general advice is correct. You need to displace your namesake by producing content that Google\u2019s search algorithms find more compelling than old newspaper crime reports. You could do this by becoming famous, which would generate vast numbers of links to your name. Failing that, you will have to generate as many links as you can through social media, and by writing popular articles, or blogging.</p> <h2><strong>Personal branding</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f8059cfa6c636a2e18e3e6310c59da6fa6a1ffb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f8059cfa6c636a2e18e3e6310c59da6fa6a1ffb/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sting, Cher, Madonna and others have successfully managed to cement themselves as mononymous household names.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BabiradPicture/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It helps to have a distinctive name, so you are off to a good start. People with common names can use various techniques to distinguish themselves. These include varying their first name (Edward, Ed, Eddy, Eddie, Ted, Teddy, Ned, Neddy etc), adding or dropping a middle initial, or expanding and hyphenating their surnames. Some people have become known by their initials, including the American poet EE Cummings and the English author JRR Tolkien. Entertainers can invent stage names, which can be mononymous. Examples include Cher and Sting.</p> <p>Under English law, you can change your surname to whatever you like, and for convenience, affirm it in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll\">deed poll</a>. This can make sense if your surname is problematic or you are anglicising a name. It would be extreme for your purposes.</p> <p>However, the key point is to decide on a fixed nomenclature, adopt it, and stick to it. This could include using the Dr to which your PhD entitles you, and abbreviating your first name. You already get the top hit on Google for this search, so tell people to use it.</p> <p>You should also write yourself an identifying statement. The younger Duncan Campbell, for example, uses \u201cinvestigative journalist &amp; computer forensics expert\u201d, and this appears in his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcampbell_iptv\">Twitter bio</a>.

      "bodyText": "It has been four months since Isabel Carrasco skipped her crumbling country, entrusting her daughters to a neighbour to join modern South America\u2019s largest ever exodus. Carrasco\u2019s destination was Guyana, although the woman now raising her children isn\u2019t sure which part. Her mission: to earn enough money to help her children back in Venezuela survive its economic collapse. \u201cThey always cry when they talk to their mum on the phone. They say: \u2018Mummy, come back \u2026 Mummy, we want to see you!\u2019 It breaks my soul,\u201d said Juana L\u00f3pez, 58, a longtime family friend, who Carrasco\u2019s daughters now call \u201cMami\u201d. Camila and Darianyelis, aged nine and seven, are among nearly one million \u201cleft-behind\u201d Venezuelan children whose parents have been forced to migrate, leaving their offspring in the care of grandparents, aunts, siblings, neighbours or sometimes even completely alone. L\u00f3pez now raises the two sisters at her home in Brisas del Sur, a shabby, hard-knock suburb of Ciudad Guayana, and is battling to provide a happy and stable childhood. Their bedroom\u2019s pink walls are plastered with Hello Kitty posters and Bible quotations. \u201cKeep me as the apple of your eye. Hide me in the shadow of your wings,\u201d reads one. In the backyard, Camila and Darianyelis have built a fantasy kitchen from scrap metal and cinder blocks, where they use disposable cutlery to feed eggshells to their dolls. But psychologists say the emotional scars run deep for Venezuela\u2019s left-behind children. \u201cWhen you peel back all the skin on the onion, you realize these children are wounded,\u201d said Jannia Orta, a psychologist from Cecodap, a Caracas-based NGO that offers them free support. Orta said such children often struggled to put their feelings into words. But their anguish was unmistakable in drawings where they depicted themselves as tiny, almost irrelevant figures on huge blank sheets of paper, or covered the page in angry scribbles. \u201cThere are children who interpret this migration as an abandonment. They feel alone. They feel they have nobody \u2013 and this has an undeniable impact on their self-esteem,\u201d Orta said. Ivonne Serrano Rodr\u00edguez, who runs a shelter for abandoned infants in Ciudad Guayana, said such children needed reassuring they were not being left behind for any fault of their own. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re being brought here \u2026 They ask: \u2018What did I do?\u2019 We tell them they aren\u2019t to blame for anything,\u201d said Serrano, whose adoptive daughter, Keren, was abandoned at birth by a mother apparently too impoverished to care for her. Not all left-behind children have parents outside the country. In the eastern state of Bol\u00edvar, many are joining a 21st-century gold rush that has helped Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s authoritarian regime survive collapsing oil revenues and US sanctions. \u201cMy mum\u2019s in the mines,\u201d said Elvis, a broken-toothed 12-year-old who sleeps on Ciudad Guayana\u2019s streets and said he had not attended school in two years. Elvis\u2019s 11-year-old friend, Richaldy \u2013 with whom he sleeps in a rubbish-strewn alley behind a fast-food restaurant \u2013 said it had been three months since his mother left. Richaldy believed she was near El Callao, a goldmining hub now considered one of Venezuela\u2019s most violent towns. But when might she return? Richaldy shook his head vaguely before returning to the streets to beg. Some children have been inadvertently robbed of their parents. When 29-year-old Ysabel Abad Rojas set off for the Colombian border last October she envisaged only a short trip. Penniless and desperate, she was recruited as a drug mule and tasked with smuggling a cargo of cocaine through Venezuela and on to northern Brazil. But Abad was arrested trying to re-enter her country and now faces a lengthy jail term in Colombia. \u201cShe called and said she was facing eight to 15 [years],\u201d said her mother, Damelis Del Valle Rojas Abad, who is now raising her daughter\u2019s three children, Santiago, Kamila and Yonnielys, ages 11, three and one. Who did Rojas blame for her family\u2019s disintegration? \u201cIt\u2019s survival. It\u2019s necessity. It\u2019s this president of ours,\u201d the 59-year-old replied as she showed off the small allotment she now relies on to feed her grandchildren. Everywhere in Rojas\u2019s gloomy shack were reminders of the difficulties that had pushed her daughter into the arms of drug smugglers, and jail. A disposable diaper \u2013 scrubbed clean for the umpeenth time \u2013 hung from a barbed-wire washing line in the porch. Nearby, a hand-written 2020 calendar had been taped to the wall. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford to buy one \u2013 so we invented one,\u201d Rojas said with a smile. For the already struggling families caring for Venezuela\u2019s left-behind youth, such improvisation is a constant theme. Juana L\u00f3pez said she scraped by thanks to the charity of a local priest and working the occasional shift in the kitchen of a local school \u2013 when the government provided food that could be cooked. For that she received 180,000 bol\u00edvares per fortnight (about $2.50), enough to buy little more than a single bag of rice. L\u00f3pez, the daughter of a coffee picker who started work at the age of 12, is no stranger to hardship. But even for her Venezuela\u2019s current crisis was of a different order. \u201cFor me this is the worst moment in my whole life,\u201d she admitted. On the day the Guardian visited, she, Camila and Darianyelis had eaten only one portion of arepa (corn flour cakes) with cassava. \u201cAsk me what we ate with it?\u201d L\u00f3pez chuckled darkly, before answering her own question: \u201cAbsolutely nothing!\u201d For all the privations, L\u00f3pez said sheltering her neighbour\u2019s daughters was her duty and her pleasure. \u201cI love her like she was my own daughter,\u201d she said of their absent mother whose return she could not predict. \u201cAnd I love these girls, too.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Great Barrier Reef could be heading for a third major coral bleaching outbreak in the space of five years if high ocean temperatures in the region do not drop in the next two weeks, scientists and conservationists have warned. Heat stress is already building across the world\u2019s biggest reef system, with reports of patchy bleaching already occurring. But a major widespread event is not currently taking place. \u201cWe are down to the wire,\u201d said Prof Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is closely monitoring conditions. Areas of heat stress are spreading, particularly across the central and southern areas that are popular with tourists. Sea surface temperatures (SST) are already more than 1.5C above average across large areas of the reef, with a month remaining until temperatures usually peak. Across about two thirds of the reef \u2013 from Port Douglas south \u2013 SST were between 2C and 3C above average. Coral bleaching is a stress reaction caused when corals spend long periods in warmer than average water. The algae that provides food and the coral\u2019s colour separates from the animal. Severe bleaching can kill some corals, and weaken others. As well as bleaching, corals can die from more immediate heat stress if temperatures become extreme. Rising ocean temperatures are caused by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Hughes told Guardian Australia: \u201cWe are worried about the level of heat that\u2019s out there now, with four weeks still to go until we get the peak of summer temperatures. That\u2019s usually around mid-March. \u201cSo with about a month to go, the pattern so far is following in the footsteps of 2016-17 and it\u2019s already hotter than it was in the interim years. \u201cIf it happens or not will depend on the vagaries of the weather for the next two weeks.\u201d He said if current sea surface temperatures remained, \u201cthen we are likely to get bleaching and, if they get hotter still, we will get severe bleaching.\u201d Northern sections of the reef are forecast to cool, but Bureau of Meteorology forecasts do not suggest temperatures will fall across much of the central and southern regions. Another major bleaching event would be a further blow to tourism in the reef region. Hughes said it was predicted to get cooler in the northern parts of the reef over the next week, but for the rest of the reef it was \u201cprobably 10 days too early to be sure\u201d of another widespread bleaching event. Hughes has carried out extensive aerial surveys during previous bleaching events to record the scale and severity of bleaching. \u201cI\u2019m on standby to do those aerial surveys if it\u2019s needed, but hopefully it won\u2019t be.\u201d About half the reef\u2019s corals died in back-to-back bleaching events in the summers of 2016 and 2017. In August 2019, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority downgraded the reef\u2019s longterm outlook from \u201cpoor\u201d to \u201cvery poor\u201d for the first time. In December 2019, the Queensland and federal governments sent a report to Unesco on the reef\u2019s status, admitting that climate change had already impacted the values that led to a world heritage listing in 1981. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said there were anecdotal reports of isolated bleaching but the \u201cforecast weather pattern remains concerning.\u201d She said she had spoken with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s chief scientist, Dr David Wachenfeld, about the concerns. In an update published on Thursday afternoon, Wachenfeld said the forecasts were \u201cnot good for bleaching conditions on the reef\u201d. Richard Leck, head of oceans at WWF-Australia, said: \u201cThe Great Barrier Reef is on a knife edge. We will know in the next couple of weeks whether we now have a mass coral bleaching event for the third time in only five years. \u201cSurely after this summer of bushfires, and this marine heatwave hitting the reef, we cannot keep burying our heads in the sand. We need a reef-safe climate policy that\u2019s consistent with a 1.5C global warming target, or less. No more excuses will be tolerated.\u201d Shani Tager, the Australian Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Great Barrier Reef campaigner, said: \u201cThe last thing our reef, and the coastal communities that it supports, needs right now is another summer of mass bleaching. \u201cUnfortunately we are a whisker away from bleaching disaster yet again because of global warming-driven marine heatwaves.\u201d The World Heritage Committee is scheduled to review the status of the Great Barrier Reef at a meeting in June in China, with the potential to place the reef on its \u201cin danger\u201d list.",

      "body": "<p><em>Antisocial</em> is, among other things, a tale of two Mikes. Mike Cernovich was a law student, nutrition blogger, self-help author and generic Twitter troll before hitting the jackpot as a tireless online booster for the man he had previously called \u201cDonald Chump\u201d. The similarly directionless Mike Peinovich, AKA Mike Enoch, took an even uglier path: he ended up calling for a white ethnostate and making Holocaust jokes on his podcast the Daily Shoah. One is effectively a neo-Nazi, the other just an agile hustler. Whether that distinction matters when you consider the damage both have done to political discourse is one of the urgent questions of this compelling book.</p> <p>There are many ways to tell the story of Donald Trump\u2019s rise to power. Andrew Marantz, who patrols the darker precincts of the internet for the New Yorker, sees the president as a \u201cready-made viral meme\u201d and \u201cthe world\u2019s most gifted media troll\u201d. Despite being a technologically ignorant sexagenarian who had spent his entire life among wealthy elites, candidate Trump spoke the same language as Reddit shitposters and YouTube provocateurs and was similarly adept at bamboozling the \u201cnormies\u201d who held fast to such old-fashioned concepts as telling the truth and having coherent beliefs. In Marantz\u2019s diagnosis, Trump operates like a clickbait website, AB testing new material and running with whatever gets the strongest reaction. The road to hell is paved with likes.</p> <p><em>Antisocial</em> scrutinises the online firestarters who see Trump as their avatar. Even if you don\u2019t know their names, members of the \u201calt-right\u201d (far right) and the less overtly racist \u201calt-light\u201d have influenced media narratives, popularised abusive buzzwords, confected news stories and helped create the cultural context for the Trump presidency. If you remember rumours about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health during the 2016 election, then Cernovich got to you. If you\u2019ve seen triple brackets around a Jewish journalist\u2019s name, that originated on Enoch\u2019s blog the Right Stuff. To write about politics in this era is to write about the media and the internet. A minor figure in <em>Antisocial</em> sums up the election as \u201cthe article versus the comments section\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is Marantz giving these narcissists too much attention? He errs on the side of\u00a0\u2018know your enemy\u2019 but sees he cannot win</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Representing the article in this equation is not just Clinton but Marantz\u2019s employer. He portrays his New Yorker colleagues as principled but naive gatekeepers who suddenly found themselves wondering if they\u2019d been paying attention to the wrong things. Yet to his interviewees, who tend to underestimate his wit and rigour, he is the smug, clueless old media incarnate. A former contrarian himself, Marantz resents them for making him feel \u201clike an establishment shill\u201d, while they self-identify as the insurgent counterculture. Trump cheerleader Cassandra Fairbanks was formerly a punk roadie, animal rights activist and Bernie Sanders supporter. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/19/not-just-a-provocateur-gavin-mcinnes-should-not-be-allowed-into-australia\" title=\"\">Gavin McInnes</a>, founder of the violent, far-right Proud Boys, boasts: \u201cI was an anarchist punk \u2026 I think in some ways I still am.\u201d The revelation that the New Yorker employs 18 full-time fact-checkers inspires hilarity in the men behind Trump-mad website the Gateway Pundit, who consider facts an archaic distraction. Their mission is, in former Trump strategist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/steve-bannon\" title=\"\">Steve Bannon</a>\u2019s memorable phrase, to \u201cflood the zone with shit\u201d.</p> <p>Marantz is knee-deep in the stuff. Obviously these people are awful but he takes pains to explain exactly what kind of awful, and why \u2013 like the Linnaeus of internet villainy. Rather him than me. He describes glumly waking his wife at midnight to tell her that their newborn baby is asleep and he has to go and \u201chave a burger with some Deplorables\u201d. That attempt to turn Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d into a badge of pride has fallen out of fashion but it remains a useful catch-all term for a diffuse and fractious group. The fragile coalition that Marantz describes in a bravura opening section covering the \u201cDeploraBall\u201d in January 2017 splintered seven months later, after the protester Heather Heyer was murdered at a Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The alt-light draw the line at unabashed white nationalism, or at least rely on plausible deniability. After Charlottesville, Cernovich dismissed the alt-right as \u201ca toxic brand\u201d, although that sounds more like a marketing critique than a moral position.</p> <p>What these not-quite-fascists stand for is unclear. Some of them joke about converting (or \u201cred-pilling\u201d) Marantz, but convert him to what, exactly? Too cynical and self-serving to commit to a coherent ideology, most just want to watch the world burn, with Trump their arsonist-in-chief. As needy and insubstantial as Instagram microcelebrities, they affect a callous swagger but are easily wounded; prate about rational debate but thrive on obnoxious memes. \u201cI do believe most of what I say,\u201d ventures Gateway Pundit\u2019s Lucian Wintrich. \u201cAbout 70%.\u201d I\u2019m reminded of a dark joke from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/the-big-lebowski-review-the-dude-jeff-bridges-coen-brothers\" title=\"\"><em>The Big Lebowski</em></a>: \u201cSay what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, dude, at least it\u2019s an ethos.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7ddeb54425768a354022a7421840fd989d0a25c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ddeb54425768a354022a7421840fd989d0a25c1/80_280_4631_2779/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lucian Wintrich\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I do believe most of what I say \u2013 about 70%.\u2019 \u2026 the Gateway pundit Lucian Wintrich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The danger is not (yet) regiments of Sieg Heiling fascists but the irreversible corruption of discourse on the internet, and therefore everywhere else. The aim is to scuff the lines between online and offline, irony and sincerity, the trivial and the significant, a bored young man triggering the \u201cwoke\u201d for kicks and a genuine neo-Nazi trying to desensitise and radicalise that bored young man. The idea, for example, that the OK hand gesture was code for white power began as a hoax on the 4chan message board until the media fell for it and the gesture was adopted by actual white nationalists. As John Updike said of celebrity, trolling is a mask that eats into the face.</p> <p>Reading <em>Antisocial</em> is likely to either make you glad you\u2019re not on social media, or wish you weren\u2019t. But the old advice \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t feed the trolls; ignore them and they\u2019ll go away\u201d \u2013 now seems like recklessly wishful thinking. When a dismissive colleague asks Marantz \u201cIs anyone surprised that there\u2019s awful stuff on the internet?\u201d, he replies: \u201cEverything is the internet now, and the awful stuff might be winning.\u201d Running like a mantra through the book is an aphorism inspired by the philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/11/richardrorty\" title=\"\">Richard Rorty</a>: \u201cTo change how we talk is to change who we are.\u201d</p> <p>Who changed the way we talk? <em>Antisocial</em> charts the death of the Silicon Valley dream of better living through communication.

Hannah Clarke, 31, died at the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s hospital on Wednesday night, less than 24 hours after Baxter poured petrol on his family in a domestic violence incident.

Bolton, speaking alongside Susan Rice at a lecture series at Vanderbilt University, was taken to task by his co-speaker, who served as national security adviser under Barack Obama. Rice criticized Bolton for refusing to testify before the House of Representatives during the impeachment hearings. It later emerged that Bolton has documented, in a forthcoming book, evidence regarding Trump and Ukraine that Democrats had sought him to provide on the record. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine withholding my testimony with or without a subpoena,\u201d Rice said at the Vanderbilt event, according to CNN reporter Jennifer Hansler. \u201cI would feel like I was shamefully violating the oath that I took to defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.\u201d Bolton refused to give testimony during the House impeachment hearings late last year.

According to the Hustler, Rice said of Bolton: \u201cI don\u2019t understanding using [White House] pre-clearance as a reason to not be forthcoming.\u201d Bolton, who left the White House in September, gave a series of teasers on Monday about what his forthcoming book might contain, in one instance referring an audience member to a specific chapter of the book. \u201cFor all the focus on Ukraine and the impeachment trial and all that, to me, there are portions of the manuscript that deal with Ukraine, I view that like the sprinkles on the ice cream sundae in terms of what\u2019s in the book,\u201d Bolton said, according to the New York Times. Bolton is said to have written that Trump spoke to him about withholding aid to Ukraine until they agreed to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. After being criticized for remaining coy over national security matters until publishing them in a commercially published book, Bolton seemed keen to tamp down his sales pitch on Wednesday. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to promote the book,\u201d Bolton told the Hustler in an interview published before his onstage appearance. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about the book in part because it\u2019s still in the pre-publication review process. And to avoid criticism that I\u2019m simply out talking [about] the book, which I am not.\u201d The New York Times has previously shared details from a draft of Bolton\u2019s book. In it, Bolton affirmed that Trump was intent on withholding military aid to Ukraine until it helped investigate Democrats and the Bidens, supporting Democrats\u2019 impeachment case against Trump. Bolton is also said to have written that Trump was granting favors to the leaders of Turkey and China, claims the justice department has denied. In January the White House, having received a copy of Bolton\u2019s book, said it \u201cappears to contain significant amounts of classified information\u201d, and said it could not be published until certain details are removed. Bolton\u2019s lawyers dispute that any information in the book could be considered classified.",

      "bodyText": "An iconic Western Australian eucalypt, known for the size of flowers, is among almost 150 eucalpyt species scientists have recommended be listed as threatened under national environment laws. The eucalyptus macrocarpa, commonly known as mottlecah, has the largest flowers of all eucalypt species. The bright red flowers can measure up to 10cm in diameter. It is one of 147 eucalypt species that a team of scientists has recommended be added to Australia\u2019s national threatened species list. Eucalypts in the wheat belt of Western Australia were identified as having the worst rate of decline, with about 60 species in this region identified by the researchers as qualifying for a listing as either vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered. Rod Fensham, an associate professor at the University of Queensland, led the research that used maps of eucalyptus distribution and maps of land use to measure which species were in decline. \u201cEucalypts are just fundamentally Australian. They define the continent, really,\u201d Fensham said. \u201cEverywhere you are in Australia there will be a gum tree, and the gum tree will tell you something about where you are.\u201d The scientists assessed all 822 eucalypt species found in Australia and determined 193 (23%) were threatened. Before the research, 89 eucalypts were listed as threatened under national laws. The paper suggests that 32 of these species could be removed from that list. Eucalypts are long-lived species and the scientists measured their trajectory over 10 generations. \u201cTen generations is quite a long time,\u201d Fensham said. \u201cBut there are many species, including ones that were recommended for listing, that are showing such a steep rate of decline through the course of European history that that\u2019s their trajectory, that they\u2019ll be extinct in 10 generations.\u201d Fensham said this included relatively common species that drivers would be used to seeing along highways on the east coast between Sydney and Melbourne. The greatest threat to eucalpyts by far was conversion of land by the agriculture industry for cropping or pasture. That was followed by urban development. Species such as the mottlecah in WA\u2019s wheat belt were under particular threat because intensive land use was occurring over a large area where there was also a high number of eucalypt species. \u201cThe No 1 conservation measure is stop land clearing, stop clearing habitat,\u201d Fensham said. \u201cIt always is and we still haven\u2019t managed to do it in Australia.\u201d Late last year, the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s updated Red List reached similar results, finding almost a quarter of the world\u2019s eucalypts were threatened with extinction.",

I\u2019ve never nailed it and I know a lot of very fabulous, cool, clever women and most of them haven\u2019t either. But 2020 might just be the year that is going to change. Because capsule dressing is no longer the sensible option, the one you know you should commit to, if only you didn\u2019t keep getting your head turned by newer, more daring, more exciting, more instantly desirable clothes. In 2020, capsule dressing is where the newest, most daring, most exciting, most instantly desirable fashion is happening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"55a69a5aa4dd8a487aa6ae47f8b3b6e7787d8b6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55a69a5aa4dd8a487aa6ae47f8b3b6e7787d8b6a/0_16_2672_3339/800.jpg\" alt=\"1954: Belgian-born actor Audrey Hepburn, wearing black Capri pants and a black sweater with flats, looks over her shoulder in a full-length promotional portrait for Billy Wilder\u2019s film \u2018Sabrina\u2019.

      "bodyText": "The capsule wardrobe has always been cool. The capsule wardrobe is Fran\u00e7oise Hardy and Sade. It is Audrey Hepburn and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. It is all the heady intoxication of fashion with no hangover of buyer\u2019s remorse. It is a magic pill to streamline your wardrobe, so no more tying yourself in knots figuring out what to wear. OK, so here\u2019s the thing: as we all agree a capsule wardrobe is such a great idea, why don\u2019t we actually dress like this? I\u2019ve never nailed it and I know a lot of very fabulous, cool, clever women and most of them haven\u2019t either. But 2020 might just be the year that is going to change. Because capsule dressing is no longer the sensible option, the one you know you should commit to, if only you didn\u2019t keep getting your head turned by newer, more daring, more exciting, more instantly desirable clothes. In 2020, capsule dressing is where the newest, most daring, most exciting, most instantly desirable fashion is happening. Sustainability is aspirational. Zoolanderish, yes, but also true. If sustainability means that we as a species get to continue living on this planet, then that seems to me to pretty much sum up our wishlist right now. A fabulous capsule wardrobe is the sustainable way \u2013 which is to say the modern way \u2013 to raise your fashion game. You can tell that sustainability has become glamorous because outfit repeating \u2013 which used to be something that normal people did all the time but fancy people wouldn\u2019t be seen dead doing, sort of like getting the bus \u2013 has now become a badge of honour. Meghan Markle rewears dresses, Joaquin Phoenix sticks with one Stella McCartney tux through red carpet season. The tagline of Wardrobe NYC, the front row\u2019s current favourite label, is \u201cluxury without excess\u201d. Founded by designer Josh Goot and fashion director Christine Centenera, Wardrobe NYC is \u201cthe ultimate wardrobe for those with shared values and aesthetic\u201d, which translates as pared-down urban minimalism designed in New York and made in Italy. The aesthetic is radically minimalist, but the price tag is seriously upscale, with \u00a31,500 buying you a four-piece wardrobe, delivered as a set of blazer, shirt, T-shirt and leggings \u2013 just choose from black or white, and click your size. (It\u2019s like a HelloFresh box, but with everything you need to look cool rather than to make dinner.) A four-piece, pared-back, day-to-night wardrobe commanding a price point usually ruled by the fancy party dress speaks volumes about the status of the capsule wardrobe right now. What should your capsule wardrobe look like? Does a blazer and leggings work for you, or is it two black dresses and a camel coat? Or a grey trouser suit and two white shirts? The answer is in your wardrobe, says designer Maria Grachvogel. Now 50, Grachvogel has run her own brand since she was 21. \u201cOpen your wardrobe, take a look \u2013 and be honest,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is probably a core 20% of what\u2019s in there that you return to time and time again.\u201d Whatever that 20% is \u2013 printed dresses, plain tailoring \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s your capsule wardrobe, right there. Those are your treasures. It\u2019s about what suits you \u2013 but it\u2019s also about who you are as a person and what kind of life you live.\u201d Before you buy anything new, Grachvogel says, \u201cask yourself: is this going in my 20%? Is it going to be one of my treasures? Because that\u2019s the only part of your wardrobe that matters.\u201d She attributes her loyal customer base to the fact that \u201cI have zero interest in selling women clothes that they won\u2019t wear\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re all so busy, no one has the time or the energy to spend hours standing in front of their wardrobe trying to figure out what to wear,\u201d says Clare Hornby, founder and creative director of British \u201caffordable luxury\u201d brand Me+Em. \u201cA capsule wardrobe means one you can rely on to make you look and feel good with minimal effort.\u201d Hornby is a self-confessed trouser obsessive, as proven by Me+Em\u2019s \u201ctransformer\u201d trousers (in wide or narrow styles, around \u00a3170), which can be extended from cropped to longer length with a button fastening \u2013 endless research went into fabric and construction which could hold a chic silhouette in both modes. \u201cThink about what\u2019s practical for you,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you work, then you need clothes that are smart enough for the office, comfortable enough for a long day, easily dressed up for after work.\u201d Grill successful modern capsule dressers, as I did for this article, and the blazer is a wardrobe building block that comes up time and again. \u201cI wear one most days,\u201d Hornby says. \u201cAt weekends I can wear joggers and a T-shirt, and a blazer pulls it together.\u201d A cross-body bag \u2013 try Coach or Kate Spade, or John Lewis &amp; Partners \u2013 is another piece that has become a seven-day staple. While no two capsule dressers are the same, a common thread is a balance of masculine and feminine elements. A blazer is paired with a dress, say, or sleek tailored trousers with a ruffle-trimmed silk blouse. A yin/yang of masculine and feminine adds interest without fuss, and allows you to tip the balance in either direction to suit your mood. Capsule wardrobes require team players. They work when your clothes can jigsaw together to solve your problems. Fancy, limelight-hogging showpieces are a distraction best avoided. Jazziness is good, but keep it subtle.

Cos make detachable hoods with dicky-style bib fronts which can be layered under a smart coat when rain is forecast, instantly streamlining your coatrack. Last year, Debenhams launched Kley, which aims to bring \u201cthe ultimate easy enviable wardrobe\u201d to the high street.

      "bodyText": "Young people across Africa are confident that the continent is heading for an era of success fuelled by technology and entrepreneurship, according to a new survey. The Africa Youth survey, which claims to be the largest of its kind, said there is growing belief in the concept of \u201cAfro-optimism\u201d, fighting persistently negative stereotypes of the continent. Though most people interviewed were dissatisfied with the state of their own country, almost half believed the continent as a whole was in a healthier state than previously, and two-thirds thought they were living through a transformative \u201cAfrican century\u201d. Ivor Ichikowitz, chairman of the Ichikowitz Family Foundation, which commissioned the survey, said the results \u201care a loud wake-up call to all the Afro-sceptics\u201d. \u201cWe have found a youth that refuses to shy away from the very real challenges of Africa, that is honest about what needs to be done and what their role has to be to achieve this \u2013 and they are overwhelmingly keen to make that difference.\u201d The survey covered 14 countries, and included 4,200 interviews with young people aged between 18 and 24. The average age in Africa is younger than 20, according to the UN, more than 10 years younger than any other continent. Those surveyed had strong opinions about the importance of technology and business, with 81% saying they believed technology could unlock the continent\u2019s potential. A similar amount believed access to wifi should be a fundamental human right. Three-quarters of young people said they planned to start their own business in the next five years, and many already had ideas they were ready to work on if given funding. Commenting on the report, Rosebell Kagumire, editor of the website African Feminism, said the internet had opened doors to opportunities beyond national borders and connected young people across the continent. \u201cTechnology has connected Africans in so many ways. Our grandparents were pan-Africanists and understood the struggle for Africa \u2026 but now, more than ever, you\u2019re able to read a story in realtime of what\u2019s happening in another country.\u201d While the report said there were strong suspicions about the influence of foreign powers, most supported pan-African institutions. The African Union was mostly looked upon favourably as a way of uniting countries across the continent. Kagumire said it was easy to be optimistic about the continent\u2019s future despite localised problems, because some nation states are still relatively new. \u201cWhen we see ourselves as African, as a people, and what we have achieved together and what we have survived together, that makes a better picture,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger picture. We are looking at African people, really thinking outside the colonial construct.\u201d She added, however, that the idea of Afro-optimism was often simplistic, painting a picture of \u201chappy Africans\u201d. \u201cIt assumes a certain lack of complexity. We are allowed to be complex. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s in a permanent state of optimism, and certainly not young Africans,\u201d she said. The biggest concerns were corruption, the creation of new jobs for the continent\u2019s booming young population, and peace and security. Kagumire pointed out that young people were often disaffected by politics, and women, in particular, felt discriminated against in the corporate world. \u201cEven when people are optimistic, it\u2019s pegged to the realities.\u201d Former South African president Kgalema Motlanthe, who contributed to the survey report, said: \u201cI am encouraged by the youth of Africa\u2019s common vision of a pan-African identity; of a love of their fellows that transcends colour, creed, class or nationality. \u201cI am immensely heartened too by their Afro-optimism, underscored by their belief in Afro-capability.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There is little to love about having a cold, damp vulva. Or so I discovered when I applied an \u201cactivated charcoal sheet mask\u201d to mine. The product in question, Blackout, is by a \u201cluxury vulva care\u201d brand called <a href=\"https://www.twolips.vip/\" title=\"\">Two L(i)ps</a>. The company\u2019s promotional material says it is \u201cready to disrupt and redefine the vulva space\u201d. Before disrupting my own, however, I had to navigate the packaging. After slipping it from its peach-coloured pouch, you have to pull away a sheet of white \u201clace\u201d to reveal its dark, sopping glory. \u201cDim the lights and relax as your skin is detoxified and clarified,\u201d say the instructions on the box, which tell you to leave the mask on for 15-20 minutes, then pat the \u201cremaining serum\u201d on to the skin. Lying on the sofa, mortified by my own company, I last no more than six. Of all the mistakes I\u2019ve made in my intimate life, looking down to see that sprawling blackness, its \u201clace\u201d film lying sadly by my thigh, is definitely up there, so to speak.</p> <p>I may be a cynic, but there is a hungry market for these products: Two L(i)ps boasts that 10,000 units of Blackout (\u00a315.50 for a single mask, \u00a366 for a set of five) were sold in the two and a half months after its launch. The brand has developed a range of \u201cluxury vulva care\u201d products including Pout, a \u201chydrating serum\u201d made of 95% pure hyaluronic acid (\u00a399 for 30ml), and Undercover (\u00a399 for 30ml), an \u201canti-blemish cream\u201d to \u201cstay spotless\u201d. The cream is made from the skin-whitening agent palmitoyl hexapeptide-36, and comes with the instruction to apply SPF30 sunscreen to the area the following day, no doubt with all that offering-our-naked-labia-to-the-sky sorcery us women get up to in mind.</p> <p>Ahead of the launch of this range, Two L(i)ps created a hashtag: #loveyourvulvamore. (In the name of empowerment, you understand.) But, while some women may make the informed choice to buy such products, choosing to treat their vulva like an extension of their face \u2013 a scrutable surface to be constantly preened and perfected \u2013 others will argue that the real power lies with the brand itself. More specifically, in the exchange of money.</p> <p>The most secret part of a woman\u2019s body is so often shrouded in conditioned shame and awkwardness from when we are very young. There is a tyranny of \u201cshoulds\u201d for how we ought to look, smell, use and enjoy what is ours. \u201cThe stigma around female genitalia is so ingrained,\u201d says the consultant gynaecologist and psychosexual counsellor Dr Leila Frodsham. \u201cI have been a gynaecologist for 25 years, and women have always apologised. So often, I hear the phrase: \u2018What an awful job you have.\u2019 It is quite heartbreaking.\u201d</p> <p>When this sense of shame is capitalised on by figures such as Gwyneth Paltrow and positioned as something that can be assuaged by treating our vaginas and vulvas with products her \u201cwellness and lifestyle company\u201d, Goop, has lovingly curated for us (because it, too, knows what it is like), it can be incredibly seductive; a shared mission, almost. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/13/why-is-gwyneth-paltrow-selling-a-candle-that-smells-like-her-vagina-goop\" title=\"\">Paltrow even created a candle that supposedly smells of her vagina</a>. The singer-songwriter Erykah Badu is <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/erykah-badus-incense-badus-pussy-948376/\" title=\"\">releasing a new incense</a> \u2013 Badu\u2019s Pussy \u2013 based on the smell of hers. \u201cThe people deserve it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Maybe we do deserve our homes to smell of celebrity vaginas, but the wider rise in \u201cluxury\u201d vulva care builds a new level in the game of female anxieties being sold as quick-fix products. If we are insecure about the colour of our vulva or its (gulp) lack of \u201cpout\u201d, a \u00a399 bottle of serum is not as drastic or as expensive as laser treatment, but it is doing something about it, under the guise of self-care.</p> <p>Another company, The Perfect V, sells cleansers, lotions, \u201cbeauty sheets\u201d, mists, serums and a \u201cluminiser\u201d, lest your vulva not shimmer like an aurora. The brand is \u201cinspired by Scandinavian women [who] feel comfortable, carefree and confident in their skin, strip in public whatever their age or shape and are at ease with themselves \u2013 a very alluring trait\u201d. But it, too, cannot deal with biological language, only referring to \u201cthe V\u201d. The website shouts about \u201cthe vanicure\u201d and a \u201cbeauty regimen for the V\u201d but only<strong> </strong>mentions the word vulva once on its homepage. A growing market for products that promise to make our vulvas more beautiful, with brands that cannot explicitly acknowledge the vulva itself? Fabulous.</p> <p>Frodsham aligns any growing popularity with the wider awareness and demand for cosmetic and surgical procedures \u2013 itself a product of the early and prevalent use of pornography, where perfectly pink, hairless vulvas are the norm. Boys seeing vulvas like this in porn grow into young men who expect it to be that way. \u201cTwenty-five years ago, every woman I saw had pubic hair,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I so rarely see it.\u201d It is particularly telling that almost every vulva beauty product is predicated on smooth skin or treating areas where hair has been removed. You cannot \u201cluminise\u201d skin that is covered in hair.</p> <p>About 15 years ago, Frodsham had an \u201cinflux of women\u201d requesting labiaplasty, the short surgical procedure that reduces the size or changes the shape of the labia minora and majora. \u201cWe had a 400% increase in requests, and it is still a prevalent conversation. This is not just women requesting \u2018tightening\u2019 post-childbirth, either; it is teenagers coming to see me with terrible feelings about their genitalia,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In light of this, 10 years ago, the NHS classified female genital cosmetic surgery (FGCS) as a low-priority procedure that should not be undertaken unless medically necessary. It is stressed that FGCS cannot ethically be offered to under-18s because of anatomical development during puberty. \u201cI had one awful case where a young girl wanted labiaplasty because girls at her school were being encouraged to take pictures of their vulvas to be scored by other pupils,\u201d says Frodsham. The growing popularity (440,000 followers and counting) of Instagram accounts such as the Vulva Gallery, and its gently explicit exploration of vulva diversity, offers a glimmer of hope that awareness may be shifting.</p> <p>Where the NHS rejects, the private sector \u2013 bound by less rigorous regulation and need for clinical evidence base \u2013 moves in. \u201cMore private clinics began offering genital cosmetic surgery straight away,\u201d says Frodsham. \u201cSomething like labiaplasty can take as little as 15 minutes, but costs up to \u00a35,000, so there is naturally going to be a market for quick-fix \u2018tightening\u2019 creams for women who can\u2019t afford the cost, but still feel there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Slap on a \u201cgynaecologically tested\u201d strapline (as Two L(i)ps does) and you feel as if you are investing in something credible and capable. But what do these terms mean? In the UK, General Medical Council registration guidelines prohibit doctors from endorsing commercial products. So it is unclear what these tests mean.</p> <p>As with so much of the language in the wellness and beauty industries, the language treads a fine line between being scientific-sounding and vague enough to avoid legal action. Every stage of a woman\u2019s reproductive life comes with a tangle of anxieties to navigate, almost always fuelled by new products claiming to fix them. \u201cThe narratives within our modern-day media and society regarding how women should and should not look, behave and feel can be very powerful,\u201d says the clinical psychologist Kelly Abraham-Smith, who specialises in women\u2019s health issues. \u201cDistress can come when there is a mismatch between these narratives and a woman\u2019s reality.\u201d</p> <p>CBD is a chemical that occurs in cannabis plants, and is now contained in a range of products, including oils, confectionery and drinks. The British brand The Tonic Tribe, which markets CBD products, has just released a product called <a href=\"https://www.thetonictribe.com/skin-muscle-joint-care-c9/the-tonic-cbd-clit-spritz-p70\" title=\"\">Clit Spritz</a> (\u00a329.99 for 30ml), a \u201c100% natural oil\u201d that, according to its press release, \u201cstimulates, lubricates and rejuvenates your lady parts using the cannabis plant \u2026 designed for women to give their bits a bit of a treat!\u201d An estimated 1.3 million UK consumers now spend \u00a3300m a year on CBD products; an intriguing phenomenon given how little robust evidence there is to support the wide-ranging health claims users make. CBD lube is already a bestseller, but it was only a matter of time before entrepreneurs saw an opening \u2013 so to speak \u2013 in \u201cvulva care\u201d.</p> <p>One of the most striking lines in Clit Spritz\u2019s press release is how the \u201cpotent terpenes [the compounds in plants that give them their aroma] radiate the most wonderful scents, with natural tones of fresh mint and zesty citrus. You\u2019ll feel fresh and fruity in all manner of ways!\u201d Because this is the wider message, isn\u2019t it? That a vulva cannot, and should not, just smell of a vulva; warm because it belongs to a human being, only needing to be washed in plain water.</p> <p>You would hope that the appeal of another person encountering the most intimate part of a woman\u2019s body, in a sexual context at least, lies in its animal nature and uniqueness; the fact that it is unlike anywhere else, hidden until she chooses to reveal it. The tacit suggestion that we are not loving ourselves enough unless we spend the money to try to give our vulvas the tone and luminosity of a cheekbone or a shoulder is, surely, a phenomenon worthy of great concern.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s biggest pesticide companies make billions of dollars a year from chemicals found by independent authorities to pose high hazards to human health or the environment, according to an analysis by campaigners. The research also found a higher proportion of these highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs) in the companies\u2019 sales in poorer nations than in rich ones. In India, 59% of sales were of HHPs in contrast to just 11% in the UK, according to the analysis. The data from Phillips McDougall, the leading agribusiness analysts, are from buyer surveys focused on the most popular products in the 43 nations that buy the most pesticides. It was obtained and analysed by Unearthed, a journalism group funded by Greenpeace UK, and the Swiss NGO Public Eye. The pesticides market is dominated by five companies \u2013 Bayer, BASF, Syngenta, FMC and Corteva (formerly Dow and DuPont). These companies sold $4.8bn of products containing HHPs in 2018, making up more than 36% of all their income, according to the analysis. Bayer said the analysis was \u201cmisleading\u201d but declined to provide its own figures. Some companies also disputed the list of HHPs used. Phillips McDougall said that it neither approved the public use of its data nor endorsed the findings of the analysis by Unearthed. The Unearthed and Public Eye analysis calculated that almost a quarter of sales by the big five were of products containing pesticides linked to human health effects, including known or presumed carcinogens, while 10% came from pesticides toxic to bees. Another 4% of sales were of chemicals that are acutely toxic to humans, the analysis found. About 200,000 suicides each year are attributed to pesticide poisoning, almost all in developing countries. In rich countries, the average proportion of sales that were HHPs was 27% compared with 45% in low and middle income countries, reaching as high as 65% in South Africa, according to the analysis. A global survey of pesticide management in 2018 by the World Health Organization and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) found \u201cvarious critical shortcomings\u201d, with countries needing to strengthen their rules and enforcement to \u201cminimise their harmful effects on humans and the environment\u201d. Baskut Tuncak, UN special rapporteur on hazardous substances and human rights, said: \u201cIt is inappropriate for companies to earn such significant income from HHPs in this day and age. The continued use of these products is unsustainable and is causing a multitude of human rights violations around the world.\u201d A report in 2017 co-authored by Tuncak accused pesticide companies of the \u201csystematic denial of harms\u201d, \u201caggressive, unethical marketing tactics\u201d and lobbying of governments, which has \u201cobstructed reforms and paralysed global pesticide restrictions\u201d. It also said the idea that pesticides were essential to feed a fast-growing global population was \u201ca myth\u201d. Unearthed used a list of 330 HHPs compiled by Pesticide Action Network International (PAN), based on judgments from authorities such as the US Environmental Protection Agency, European Union bodies, the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants and the WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The FAO and WHO classify some but not all of these pesticides as HHPs on their list and a spokesman for BASF said the PAN list was \u201cinflated\u201d. Keith Tyrell, director of PAN UK, said: \u201cEfforts to strengthen the UN\u2019s approach are consistently blocked by the pesticide industry.\u201d Croplife International, the pesticide industry\u2019s lobby group, has accepted that 15% of the chemicals its members sell are HHPs, but said many of these can be used safely in practice. \u201cOur members support the [voluntary] FAO International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management,\u201d said a CropLife International spokeswoman. \u201cWe support countries to identify, and if necessary, remove HHPs from their markets.\u201d Neither CropLife International nor the five companies responded to a request for an example of the voluntary removal of an HHP. \u201cPesticides identified on the PAN list are often classified based on the acute toxicity of the active ingredient rather than the formulated product, which is not consistent with practical use,\u201d said the CropLife International spokeswoman. Tyrell said: \u201cPesticide companies refuse to publish information on the ingredients contained in their products so the UN and others, including PAN, are forced to look solely at the toxicity of the active ingredient.\u201d Bayer also disputes PAN\u2019s list. For example, PAN includes Bayer\u2019s glyphosate on its list based on the 2015 conclusion of the IARC that it is \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d. But Bayer says glyphosate should not be on the list, based on the conclusions of other bodies, such as the European Chemical Agency in 2017. A spokesman for Bayer said the differing sales from nation to nation reflected the different needs of farmers: \u201cAgriculture is very different from region to region due to different climates, pests, diseases and crops.

The ban, which has been in force since 1 February and was initially scheduled for 14 days, will continue into a fourth week. Announcing the extension on Thursday, the government said in a statement that the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei province continued to grow, but was slowing elsewhere. \u201cWe will need to watch closely whether this positive trend continues as people return to work after the holidays,\u201d the statement said. The government\u2019s approach to preventing the spread of the disease in Australia continued to be successful, it said, with the number of cases remaining at 15. The Australian economy faces an estimated $8bn hit due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, which is expected to cost the global economy US$1.1tn. The ban has hit the higher education sector particularly hard, stranding an estimated 65,800 international visa-holding students in China, with universities reportedly preparing for a $1.2bn loss of income while scrambling to accommodate remote learning and to manage the effect on staff workloads, particularly casual staff. The National Tertiary Education Union has called on the federal government to create a support package for the sector. The union\u2019s president, Alison Barnes, said the consequences of the ban were becoming increasingly serious. \u201cMany of our casual members have not had paid work for months over the Christmas period and the prospect of losing hours as a result of the coronavirus is a material and pressing concern for them,\u201d Barnes said. Under the restrictions, foreign nationals who have travelled through mainland China are not allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left. Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family are exempt from the ban, but are required to self-isolate for 14 days \u2013 the incubation period of the virus \u2013 on their return to Australia if they have been in mainland China since 1 February.

The Massachusetts senator characterized Mike Bloomberg as a billionaire who harasses women, hides his tax returns and supports racist policies. \u201cDemocrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another,\u201d Warren said. The former New York City mayor never recovered. Soon after, a well-prepared Warren moved on to the non-disclosure agreements that several women who have brought lawsuits against Bloomberg and his company have signed, pressing the former mayor to let those women speak freely about allegations of discrimination: \u201cYou could release them from that immediately.\u201d The billionaire businessman, who has a documented history of making demeaning comments about women and has dismissed his remarks as jokes, said the women \u201cwanted to keep it quiet, and that\u2019s up to them\u201d. \u201cIf they wish now to speak out and tell their side of their story \u2026 that\u2019s now OK with you?\u201d Warren responded. \u201cYou\u2019re releasing them on television, tonight?\u201d Warren\u2019s sharp questions on the subject continued, and Bloomberg dug in further with each half-response. He wouldn\u2019t disclose the number of NDAs at his corporation. He declined to release women from the NDAs. Eventually some in the crowd booed. The exchange was one in a long list of blistering attacks on the mayor, who entered the race late last year and has spent more on TV and online ads than any political candidate in US political history. The tactic made Bloomberg omnipresent in voters\u2019 living rooms and won him a top spot in national polls, all while allowing him to avoid the harsh spotlight some of his rivals have faced \u2013 until Wednesday night at the Paris Theater in Las Vegas. In the ninth Democratic primary debate, his first appearance on the national debate stage, Bloomberg was confronted with attacks from all sides, appearing at times tired and irritated and wholly unprepared to fend off scrutiny that was inevitably coming. Within minutes of the debate\u2019s start, several candidates confronted him over racist policing practices while he was mayor of New York, including stop-and-frisk, the policy credited with devastating black and Latino neighborhoods through brutal harassment by law enforcement. Bloomberg said he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d about \u201chow it turned out\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve apologized, I\u2019ve asked for forgiveness.\u201d He then tried to take credit for moving to reduce the practice, when in reality, a judge had ruled stop-and-frisk was an unconstitutional form of racial profiling and forced the city to reform. Warren again earned applause when she told Bloomberg he ignored \u201cthe sounds of people telling you how your own policy was breaking their lives\u201d, adding, \u201cYou need a different apology.\u201d Bloomberg also faced questions about his immense personal wealth. One of the most pointed lines was delivered by the moderator Chuck Todd, who asked: \u201cMayor Bloomberg, should you exist?\u201d, a reference to the debate over the ethics of billionaires. \u201cShould you have earned that much money?\u201d Todd added. Multibillionaire Bloomberg, of course, responded \u201cyes\u201d, saying that he was \u201cgiving [money] away\u201d to make the country better. Contrasting himself with the progressive Sanders and Warren, who endorse much higher taxes on the ultra-rich, Bloomberg said the country did not need \u201ccommunism\u201d. His answer prompted a swift retort from the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been on the forefront of calling for the abolition of the billionaire class. The candidates moved on to Bloomberg\u2019s tax returns \u2013 which he hasn\u2019t yet released \u2013 drawing comparisons from the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar to that other wealthy New York businessman who made it to the presidential stage. Bloomberg argued it \u201ctakes us a long time, unfortunately\u201d, and, under pressure, eventually said he would release the returns \u201cin a few weeks\u201d. \u201cPay overtime, and get it done,\u201d Warren interrupted. Bloomberg\u2019s comments that \u201clots and lots of women have big responsibilities\u201d in his company drew immediate comparisons to the Republican senator Mitt Romney\u2019s infamous gaffe on the presidential debate stage (Romney said he had \u201cbinders full of women\u201d). Sanders retorted that Bloomberg\u2019s eliding of social democrats with communists was \u201ca cheap shot\u201d. Where Bloomberg stumbled, Warren shone. The senator, who posted disappointing results in the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, needed a standout performance and came well prepared. Her voice hoarse with a cold, Warren spoke the longest of any candidate on stage, jumping on every chance to call out her opponents\u2019 policies and contrast them with her own. Ripping through the other candidates\u2019 healthcare plans, Warren said what Buttigieg had was a \u201cPowerPoint\u201d. \u201cAmy\u2019s plan is even less; it\u2019s a Post-it note,\u201d she said in one of the most memorable lines of the night. In a statement, Bloomberg\u2019s campaign manager said the candidates wanted him \u201cto lose his cool. He didn\u2019t do it. He was the grownup in the room,\u201d adding: \u201cHe was just warming up tonight.\u201d But Warren\u2019s energetic performance seems to have paid off.

His campaign counts on a strong performance in Super Tuesday states on 3 March to propel his candidacy forward so he can emerge as the main moderate contender against Bernie Sanders. Bloomberg has steadily climbed in polls as he has poured his money into ads, and has he earned a string of endorsements from mayors and other elected officials across the country.

The city of 2.5 million people, which is two hours south of the capital Seoul, was turned into a ghost town after health officials said the bulk of country\u2019s 31 new cases announced on Thursday were linked to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. \u201cWe are in an unprecedented crisis,\u201d Daegu\u2019s mayor, Kwon Young-jin, told reporters. He ordered the shutdown of all kindergartens and public libraries, according to the news agency Yonhap. Schools in the city were considering postponing the beginning of the spring term scheduled for early March. Shopping malls and movie theatres were empty and the usually busy city centre streets were quiet. A concert featuring BTS and other K-pop stars that was set for Daegu Stadium on 8 March has been postponed. The defence ministry banned troops stationed in Daegu from leaving their barracks and receiving guests. The US military imposed similar restrictions on its army base in the city, which houses thousands of troops, family members and civilian employees, curbing travel and closing schools and child care centres. In what the Korean centre for disease control called a \u201csuper spreader\u201d event, almost half of the country\u2019s total of 82 infections have been linked to a 61-year-old woman who worships at the Daegu church, an entity often accused of being a cult. She first developed a fever on 10 February but reportedly twice refused to be tested for the coronavirus on the grounds that she had not recently travelled abroad. She attended at least four services before being diagnosed. So far, 37 other members of the church have been confirmed as infected. Shincheonji claims that its founder, Lee Man-hee, has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to Heaven, body and soul, on the Day of Judgement. Daegu\u2019s municipal government said there were 1,001 Shincheonji members in the city, all of whom had been asked to self-quarantine, with 90 of them currently showing symptoms. Those who have symptoms \u201cwill be tested as soon as possible\u201d, Kwon Young-jin said, urging stronger action from the government in Seoul and calling the national response \u201cinadequate\u201d. \u201cWe plan to test all believers of that church and have asked them to stay at home isolated from their families.\u201d The situation was \u201cvery grave\u201d, South Korean vice health minister Kim Kang-lip said at a separate briefing. Shincheonji said on Thursday that it had closed down all its facilities nationwide. \u201cWe are deeply sorry that because of one of our members, who thought of her condition as a cold because she had not travelled abroad, led to many in our church being infected and thereby caused concern to the local community,\u201d it said in a statement.

Nine people died in the attacks on the two bars at around 10pm on Wednesday, police said. A hunt was launched for the perpetrators and police said at around 5am local time that officers had stormed the home of the alleged suspect where they found him dead along with another body. Police said they had no confirmed information on the background of the two attacks and appealed for witnesses to come forward. Hanau\u2019s MP, Katja Leikert, called it a \u201chorrific scenario\u201d while the Hanau mayor, Claus Kaminsky, lamented the \u201cworst evening imaginable\u201d.

The census says 149 women were killed by 147 men in 2018, 10 more than the previous year and the highest number since the census began. Of the victims, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/20/over-half-of-uk-women-killed-by-men-die-hands-current-ex-partner\">91 (61%) were killed by a current or former partner</a>. There were also cases of women being killed by a son, stepson, son-in-law or former son-in-law. Only 6% were killed by a stranger. Karen Ingala Smith, from domestic violence charity Nia, said many died despite expressing their fear to police, other services, and friends and family, and that they had few options to find help due to under-resourcing of crisis services.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Mogul attacked over women, policing Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray with you after a dramatic night in the news. Michael Bloomberg has been fiercely attacked at his first Democratic debate appearance for being an architect of racist policing policies, indulging in sexist comments and silencing aggrieved female employees. Elizabeth Warren led the assault on a disastrous night for the former New York mayor and multi-billionaire. Bloomberg stumbled in his response to a series of questions about stop-and-frisk in New York, saying he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the racially charged tactic and had apologised. Warren also challenged Bloomberg to release women at his company from non-disclosure agreements they signed while settling lawsuits. Bloomberg defended his record on women: \u201cIn my company, lots and lots of women have big responsibilities.\u201d Warren countered: \u201cI hope you heard what his defence was: \u2018I\u2019ve been nice to some women.\u2019\u201d The debate at the Paris Theater in Las Vegas came one week after Sanders won the New Hampshire primary and ahead of a primary in Nevada in which Bloomberg is not competing. Here are five key takeaways as observed by our Guardian US team. * * * 10 die in Germany shootings \u2013 At least 10 people have been killed and several others seriously injured after shootings at two shisha bars in the German town of Hanau, 25km east of Frankfurt, according to local police. Nine people died in the attacks on the two bars at around 10pm on Wednesday, police said. A hunt was launched for the perpetrators and police said at around 5am local time that officers had stormed the home of the alleged suspect where they found him dead along with another body. Police said they had no confirmed information on the background of the two attacks and appealed for witnesses to come forward. Hanau\u2019s MP, Katja Leikert, called it a \u201chorrific scenario\u201d while the Hanau mayor, Claus Kaminsky, lamented the \u201cworst evening imaginable\u201d. It comes a few days after one person was shot dead and four more were injured outside a Berlin music venue that was hosting a Turkish comedy show. * * * Coronavirus cruise deaths \u2013 Two older Japanese passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship have died of the Covid-19 virus, according to reports. An evacuation flight of Britons from the ship is now expected to depart Japan on Friday. The death toll in China stands at more than 2,100. Experts worldwide have signed a statement of support for their Chinese colleagues who are being attacked on social media and threatened with violence as false rumours circulate about the origins of the virus. There are warnings that the haranguing could destroy cooperation between Chinese scientists and their western counterparts to find treatments and vaccines. You can follow all the latest developments on our live blog. * * * Men who kill women \u2013 More than half the women killed by men in the UK in 2018 died at the hands of a current or former partner, according to the fourth Femicide Census. In half of the cases, perpetrators had previous histories of violence against women, with three found to have killed before. The census says 149 women were killed by 147 men in 2018, 10 more than the previous year and the highest number since the census began. Of the victims, 91 (61%) were killed by a current or former partner. There were also cases of women being killed by a son, stepson, son-in-law or former son-in-law. Only 6% were killed by a stranger. Karen Ingala Smith, from domestic violence charity Nia, said many died despite expressing their fear to police, other services, and friends and family, and that they had few options to find help due to under-resourcing of crisis services. Julie Bindel writes today: \u201cAs a feminist campaigner, I am often asked why women are still targeted by male rage. Our successes have been significant \u2026 but why has this not led to fewer women dying?\u201d * * * \u2018High-risk\u2019 Huawei barred \u2013 Huawei has been excluded from participating in \u00a365m worth of pilot 5G projects for businesses and communities. They include a flood warning scheme in Yorkshire, a coastal search and rescue experiment in Dorset and an electric vehicle project involving Ford and Vodafone. \u201cNone of the winning projects, or future projects, will use equipment from high risk vendors,\u201d the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said. In January the government announced limits on the use of the Chinese supplier\u2019s equipment in the 5G networks being rolled out across the UK. * * * \u2018Prevent has got to go\u2019 \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey would commit Labour to scrapping the anti-extremism programme Prevent if elected party leader. The candidate said: \u201cThe Prevent programme has alienated the Muslim community, set back our freedoms and not made us safer. The evidence is clear: it\u2019s got to go.\u201d Long-Bailey said she would replace it with a government-funded system involving Muslim leaders. Labour members will be balloted in the party leadership contest from Friday. * * * Worthy of note \u2013 The new polymer \u00a320 note featuring the artist JMW Turner is to go into circulation as the Bank of England begins replacing the most popular banknote in the country. At least two billion notes have been printed and half of the country\u2019s cash machines should have switched over within the next fortnight. In Scotland, the Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale Bank will launch their polymer \u00a320 notes on 27 February, with the Royal Bank of Scotland following on 5 March.

Sport Jos\u00e9 Mourinho refused to write off Tottenham\u2019s hope of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals after their defeat by RB Leipzig, insisting that his team\u2019s spirit will give them a chance of overcoming their selection crisis in attack.

reported deaths in the country to 2,118.</p> <p>In South Korea, the city of Daegu was placed on high alert after the number of infections centred around the congregation of a \u201ccult\u201d church soared to 38. </p> <p>It is believed that a 61-year-old woman who worships at the controversial Shincheonji Church of Jesus has infected 37 others, a cluster that now accounts for almost half of the country\u2019s 82 cases.</p> <p>Daegu\u2019s mayor said the city was facing an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d and ordered the closure of public libraries and kindergartens, while soldiers at Korean and US military bases in the area were confined to barracks. </p> <p>News of the Diamond Princess deaths came as Japanese officials defended the decision to keep all 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship for more than two weeks in an attempt to contain the outbreak.</p> <p>More than 620 passengers on the Diamond Princess have tested positive since the ship went into lockdown in Yokohama on 5 February, two days after it was confirmed that a passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong late last month had tested positive.</p> <p>But the day before they were confined to their cabins, ship events continued, including dances, quizzes and an exercise class, even as passengers were undergoing health checks.</p> <p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Japan\u2019s efforts \u201cmay not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship.\u201d</p> <p>In response, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo released an analysis it said shows that a large portion of infections occurred before the quarantine began, and that secondary transmissions \u2013 those that occurred in the past 14 days \u2013 were confined mainly to crew members, government officials and health workers not subject to the same restrictions as the passengers.</p> <p>Most of the infected passengers developed symptoms between 6to 9 February, the institute said, while most crew members first showed symptoms from 10 February onwards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

      "bodyText": "Two passengers who were onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise liner have died after being diagnosed with Covid-19, Japan\u2019s health ministry said on Thursday. The victims \u2013 the first people connected to the ship to have died \u2013 were an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman, both of whom had pre-existing medical conditions, the public broadcaster NHK said, adding that the man had been hospitalised on 11 February and the woman the following day. On Thursday, China reported a steep drop in infections in Hubei province, after changing how it classifies confirmed cases. Hubei, the centre of the outbreak, reported 349 new infections, compared to 1,693 the day before, and the lowest increase since 25 January. There were 394 confirmed new infections across the country, marking the largest drop in almost a month.

      "body": "<p>The new polymer \u00a320 note featuring the artist JMW Turner is to go into circulation, as the Bank of England begins a mammoth operation to replace the most popular banknote in the country.</p> <p>At least 2bn have been printed, and the Bank expects half of the country\u2019s cash machines to have switched over within the next fortnight.</p> <p>In Scotland, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale will launch their polymer \u00a320 notes on 27 February, with Royal Bank of Scotland following on 5 March. Banks in Northern Ireland will also change over in 2020, but there is no specific date.</p> <p>Judging by the huge popularity of earlier polymer note issues, the Bank of England said it expected to see queues outside its Threadneedle Street head office when it opened its doors at 9am.</p> <p>Not all bank branches will be stocking the new \u00a320 immediately. For example, Santander said only 12 of its branches would have the new note from Thursday. They include branches in Birmingham, Cardiff and Leeds.</p> <p>The note will feature Turner\u2019s portrait in front of The Fighting Temeraire, his tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in Nelson\u2019s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. It will also be the first note to include the signature of Sarah John, the Bank of England\u2019s chief cashier since 2018.</p> <p>The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, chose Tate Britain, which is home to the most important Turner collection, to launch the new note. The Fighting Temeraire, which is currently in the National Gallery, will be on view at Tate Britain in the autumn for a major Turner exhibition.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI am delighted that the work of arguably the single most influential British artist of all time will now appear on another 2bn works of art \u2013 the new \u00a320 notes that people can start using today.\u201d</p> <p>The Bank said the banknote will be the single biggest switchover to polymer attempted anywhere in the world.

      "bodyText": "The new polymer \u00a320 note featuring the artist JMW Turner is to go into circulation, as the Bank of England begins a mammoth operation to replace the most popular banknote in the country. At least 2bn have been printed, and the Bank expects half of the country\u2019s cash machines to have switched over within the next fortnight. In Scotland, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale will launch their polymer \u00a320 notes on 27 February, with Royal Bank of Scotland following on 5 March. Banks in Northern Ireland will also change over in 2020, but there is no specific date. Judging by the huge popularity of earlier polymer note issues, the Bank of England said it expected to see queues outside its Threadneedle Street head office when it opened its doors at 9am. Not all bank branches will be stocking the new \u00a320 immediately. For example, Santander said only 12 of its branches would have the new note from Thursday. They include branches in Birmingham, Cardiff and Leeds. The note will feature Turner\u2019s portrait in front of The Fighting Temeraire, his tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in Nelson\u2019s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. It will also be the first note to include the signature of Sarah John, the Bank of England\u2019s chief cashier since 2018. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, chose Tate Britain, which is home to the most important Turner collection, to launch the new note. The Fighting Temeraire, which is currently in the National Gallery, will be on view at Tate Britain in the autumn for a major Turner exhibition. He said: \u201cI am delighted that the work of arguably the single most influential British artist of all time will now appear on another 2bn works of art \u2013 the new \u00a320 notes that people can start using today.\u201d The Bank said the banknote will be the single biggest switchover to polymer attempted anywhere in the world. While first adopted by Australia in 1988, US dollars and euros have so far resisted the switch to plastic. According to the Bank of England, if the new \u00a320 notes were laid end to end, they would stretch around the world almost seven times and weigh a total of 1,780 tonnes. The notes are manufactured in England by De La Rue. Unlike the launch of the polymer \u00a35 and \u00a310 notes, Britain\u2019s central bank has not set a date for when the older paper-cotton notes will stop being legal tender, so they can continue to be used in circulation. It said it will give at least six months\u2019 notice of any withdrawal date. The Bank is opting for polymer over traditional paper because it is cleaner, longer-lasting and harder to forge. Old notes removed from circulation are either turned into compost, or burned to generate electricity. Despite the fact that non-polymer \u00a35 and \u00a310 notes are no longer legal tender, \u00a31.5bn worth are still in existence. The Bank of England said as of July 2019, there were 118m old \u00a35 notes and 93.8m \u00a310 notes that had not been returned. But individuals have the right in perpetuity to bring old notes to the Bank of England and swap them for a new note of the same value. Unlike in the eurozone, where the \u20ac50 is the most common note in circulation, the British have traditionally preferred lower denominations. There are about 2bn paper \u00a320 notes in circulation, compared with 1.1bn \u00a310 notes, 400m \u00a35 notes and 350m \u00a350 notes. Despite the decline in the use of cash, the total value of notes in circulation has remained broadly static in recent years.

      "body": "<p>Soon after the violence began, on 5 January, Aamir was standing outside a residence hall in Jawaharlal Nehru University in south Delhi. Aamir, a PhD student, is Muslim, and he asked to be identified only by his first name. He had come to return a book to a classmate when he saw 50 or 60 people approaching the building. They carried metal rods, cricket bats and rocks. One swung a sledgehammer. They were yelling slogans: \u201cShoot the traitors to the nation!\u201d was a common one. Later, Aamir learned that they had spent the previous half-hour assaulting a gathering of teachers and students down the road. Their faces were masked, but some were still recognisable as members of a Hindu nationalist student group that has become increasingly powerful over the past few years.</p> \n<p>The group, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidya Parishad (ABVP), is the youth wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Founded 94 years ago by men who were besotted with Mussolini\u2019s fascists, the RSS is the holding company of Hindu supremacism: of Hindutva, as it\u2019s called. Given its role and its size, it is difficult to find an analogue for the RSS anywhere in the world. In nearly every faith, the source of conservative theology is its hierarchical, centrally organised clergy; that theology is recast into a project of religious statecraft elsewhere, by other parties. Hinduism, though, has no principal church, no single pontiff, nobody to ordain or rule. The RSS has appointed itself as both the arbiter of theological meaning and the architect of a Hindu nation-state. It has at least 4 million volunteers, who swear oaths of allegiance and take part in quasi-military drills.</p> \n<p>The word often used to describe the RSS is \u201cparamilitary\u201d. In its near-century of existence, it has been accused of plotting assassinations, stoking riots against minorities and acts of terrorism. (Mahatma Gandhi was shot dead in 1948 <a href=\"https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/historical-record-expose-lie-godse-left-rss\" title=\"\">by an RSS man</a>, although the RSS claims he had left the organisation by then.) The RSS doesn\u2019t, by itself, engage in electoral politics. But among its affiliated groups is the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the party that has governed India for the past six years, and that has, under the prime minister Narendra Modi, been remaking India into an authoritarian, Hindu nationalist state.</p> \n<p>It was nearly 7pm when Aamir saw the approaching mob. At that time in mid-winter, the campus of JNU, perhaps India\u2019s most influential state-run university, is unnervingly dark. It spreads over more than 400 hectares of wooded land, sealed off by a wall from the rest of south Delhi. Residence halls sit in groves of acacia and borage. To get anywhere from the gate requires a bicycle, an auto rickshaw or a long walk. The university\u2019s 8,000 students appear to occupy a remote world unto themselves. Since its founding in 1969, though, JNU has functioned as a microcosm of national politics. The ideologies of its students and faculty \u2013 exhibited in its hyperactive student politics \u2013 have traditionally been liberal, leftist and secular. Through its academics, JNU frequently moulded government policy; its graduates went into the media, major non-profits, the law or leftist parties. Over the years, JNU has stood for much of what the conservative, ethnocentric BJP has resented about the country it governs today. The university has been like a stone in the boot of the BJP, hobbling the party with every step.</p> \n<p>When he spotted the mob, Aamir ran into the dorms, up the stairs and into his friend\u2019s room. They locked the door, then hid on the balcony. They heard the attackers shattering panes of glass, barging into rooms and beating students. Aamir silenced his phone. \u201cI was sure they\u2019d break my arms and legs if they caught me,\u201d he said. The mob had come with clear intent, targeting students and faculty who had been critical of the BJP: a Muslim student from Kashmir, teachers with ties to the political left, members of groups that championed underprivileged castes. The president of the JNU student union, Aishe Ghosh, <a href=\"https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/aishe-ghosh-on-jnu-mob-attack\" title=\"\">received</a> a deep gash to her head and her arm was broken. The rooms of ABVP allies, though, were spared.</p> \n<p>Later, it emerged that the university\u2019s own cadre of ABVP had been bolstered by students from other universities \u2013 and <a href=\"https://liveupdates.hindustantimes.com/india/jnu-violence-protests-across-country-live-updates-21578277893284.html\" title=\"\">perhaps by people</a> who weren\u2019t students at all, people who were just RSS muscle. Rohit Azad, who has spent two decades at the university, first as a student and then a professor of economics, told me that although he had seen his share of violence between student groups, \u201cthis thing \u2013 this act of bringing in attackers from outside \u2013 that was unprecedented\u201d. It was as if the Young Republicans had invited some alt-right thugs to join them in running amok through Berkeley, beating up black and Hispanic students, Young Democrats and anyone who\u2019d expressed support for Bernie Sanders.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"96591e5f-6e62-4ff9-b50e-7abe9a155037\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VAPflS4tGqM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/06/students-injured-in-india-after-masked-attackers-raid-top-university\" title=\"\">Videos of the attacks</a> leaked out through social media in real time. The police were called, but they didn\u2019t move to stop the violence. Instead, a posse of policemen installed itself at JNU\u2019s gate, allowing no one in. Yogendra Yadav, a political activist, arrived at the gate at 9pm. Ninety minutes later, the attackers emerged, still masked and armed. Even then, the police detained no one. Instead, they were permitted to walk away as if nothing had happened. When Yadav\u2019s colleague took photos, Yadav was set upon by a knot of men, knocked down and kicked in the face. The police did nothing. Later, from a video, Yadav identified a local ABVP official among those who had hit him. In a statement, the ABVP blamed the attacks on \u201cleftist goons,\u201d but <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/abvp-volunteers-were-part-of-masked-mob-that-attacked-jnu-students-tv-sting/article30537640.ece\" title=\"\">on television</a> members <a href=\"https://scroll.in/latest/949945/jnu-violence-police-name-masked-woman-in-video-abvp-admits-she-is-its-member\" title=\"\">admitted</a> that the masked, armed men and women on campus were part of the ABVP. Still, the Delhi police pressed no charges. \u201cThe police gave the goons cover, gave them free rein on campus,\u201d Yadav said. A JNU professor went further, claiming that: \u201cThe police are complicit.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>The onslaught on JNU marked the middle of a season of nationwide protest, provoked by a new law. The Citizenship Amendment Act, passed by parliament on 11 December 2019, provides a fast track to citizenship for refugees fleeing into India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Refugees of every south Asian faith are eligible \u2013 every faith, that is, except Islam. It is a policy that fits neatly with the RSS and the BJP\u2019s demonisation of Muslims, India\u2019s largest religious minority. To votaries of Hindutva, the country is best served if it is expunged of Islam. The act was both a loud signal of that ambition and a handy tool to help achieve it.</p> \n<p>Since December, millions of Indians have turned out on to the streets to object to this vision of their country. The government has fought them by banning gatherings, shutting off mobile internet services, detaining people arbitrarily, or worse. After protests flared at Jamia Millia Islamia, an Islamic university in Delhi, cops fired <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/dozens-injured-india-police-storm-universities-191216033648272.html\" title=\"\">teargas</a> and <a href=\"https://thewire.in/rights/jamia-millia-islamia-caa-protest-police-firing\" title=\"\">live rounds</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/02/india-footage-appears-show-police-attack-jamia-students-200216053500418.html\" title=\"\">assaulted students</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Lxevq2iCw\" title=\"\">trashed the library</a>. As demonstrations spread across the state of Uttar Pradesh, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/world/asia/india-protests-police-muslims.html\" title=\"\">police raided</a> and <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bijnor-ground-report-muslim-families-flee-as-up-police-vandalise-homes-harass-women-after-clashes-over-caa-1631046-2019-12-24\" title=\"\">vandalised</a> <a href=\"https://scroll.in/latest/947926/caa-protests-muzaffarnagars-muslim-families-accuse-police-of-looting-cash-vandalising-houses\" title=\"\">Muslim homes</a> by way of reprisal. Detainees in custody were beaten; one man <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/caa-protests-detained-in-police-facility-i-heard-screams-all-night-it-was-horrific-6180163/\" title=\"\">reported</a> hearing screams in a police station all night long. (In various statements, the police claimed to be acting in self defence, or to prevent violence, or to root out conspiracy.) At least 20 protesters died of bullet wounds. Police officials denied firing at the crowds, even though the police carried the only visible guns at these rallies.</p> \n<p>Still, the protests have persisted well into February. At Shaheen Bagh, a neighbourhood in south-eastern Delhi, hundreds of thousands of people have turned up over nine weeks to take part in an indefinite sit-in. The BJP has taken a ruthless view of all this dissent. On one occasion, Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu cleric who is chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, said: \u201cIf they won\u2019t understand words, they\u2019ll understand bullets.\u201d One of Modi\u2019s ministers used \u201cShoot the traitors to the nation!\u201d as a call-and-response at a rally \u2013 the same slogan the ABVP had raised in JNU.</p> \n<p>In its 72 years as a free country, India has never faced a more serious crisis. Already its institutions \u2013 its courts, much of its media, its investigative agencies, its election commission \u2013 have been pressured to fall in line with Modi\u2019s policies. The political opposition is withered and infirm. More is in the offing: the idea of Hindutva, in its fullest expression, will ultimately involve undoing the constitution and unravelling the fabric of liberal democracy. It will have to; constitutional niceties aren\u2019t compatible with the BJP\u2019s blueprint for a country in which people are graded and assessed according to their faith. The ferment gripping India since the passage of the citizenship act \u2013 the fever of the protests, the brutality of the police, the viciousness of the politics \u2013 has only reflected how existentially high the stakes have become.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFRuKs7ZfEk\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UFRuKs7ZfEk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>The RSS and the BJP\u2019s success, over the past six years, is owed in part to its adept poisoning of the public discourse. Politicians, indoctrinated media outlets and squadrons of social media trolls lie, polarise and demonise all day long. Among their stratagems is the invention of categories of abuse for their opponents, to convey with a single label why such people should not be trusted to have India\u2019s interests at heart. \u201cPresstitute\u201d is one, applied to liberal journalists to accuse them of selling their coverage for money or influence. \u201cSickular\u201d is another, born of the RSS\u2019s opinion that Indian secularism is a demented version of minority appeasement.</p> \n<p>The term \u201cJNU type\u201d refers to leftists of every stripe \u2013 from Maoists yearning for the revolution, to moderates who abhor Hindutva. Traditionally, JNU has specialised in the humanities, so \u201cJNU types\u201d also came to be scorned for their soft humanism \u2013 for their opposition to capital punishment, to the army\u2019s human-rights abuses, or to the state\u2019s repressions in Kashmir. All while studying for years and years on the government\u2019s dime, the BJP\u2019s supporters complain. It\u2019s enough to slot JNU types into the mother category: \u201canti-national\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"28de2828a76ad47bddf456c088eccef4e1b62d04\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28de2828a76ad47bddf456c088eccef4e1b62d04/0_0_6997_4199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus in New Delhi, India.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus in New Delhi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In its earliest years, JNU soaked up the ideology of the man it was named after \u2013 Jawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first prime minister \u2013 and of his party, the Congress. It was still only a generation since independence, and Nehru and the Congress, having led the freedom struggle, exerted enormous moral authority. The university\u2019s ethos and its very curriculum were built on Nehru\u2019s values, says Rakesh Batabyal, the author of JNU: The Making of a University. It was secular in its worldview, left of centre in its economics and technocratic in its thinking on policy. \u201cStudents came from all over the country,\u201d Batabyal told me. \u201cThere was a pluralism to the university that Nehru wanted for India.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over the next few decades, the locus of power in student politics migrated further leftwards, into groups that allied themselves with national communist parties. The ABVP, which opposed all these -isms \u2013 secularism, pluralism, socialism, communism \u2013 remained on the margins, just like its counterparts in national politics. The Hindu right had done nothing of note during the freedom struggle; in fact, the RSS didn\u2019t take part in the mass movements that forced the British out of India. For almost half a century after independence, the political parties backed by the RSS remained in the political wilderness. \u201cThey used to say that, back in the 1980s, if you were a supporter at an ABVP event, you went to it with a blanket covering your face,\u201d Azad, the JNU professor, told me. \u201cThat was how embarrassing it was considered to be.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then a mosque was destroyed, and India changed. For years, the RSS had claimed that the Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque in the town of Ayodhya, stood on the very spot where the Hindu deity Ram was born. The location warranted a temple, the RSS declared, not a mosque built by an invading Muslim king. Late in 1990, a BJP leader toured India\u2019s heartland for two months, in an air-conditioned Toyota mocked up to resemble a chariot, to rouse Hindus to demand that a temple replace the mosque. (The man who sat in the Toyota\u2019s cabin, serving as the rally\u2019s logistician, was Narendra Modi.) In December 1992, a crowd of men from the RSS and BJP razed the mosque, watched but unhindered by the police. In the following weeks, religious riots erupted across India, particularly in Mumbai. Two thousand people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/28/ayodhya-mosque-india-guardian-report\" title=\"\">were killed</a>. The BJP\u2019s obsession with the Babri mosque was bloody and divisive, but it also earned them new political capital. In 1996, the BJP came to power for the first time.</p> \n<p>On the campus of JNU, in tidy parallel, the fortunes of the ABVP bloomed: it won its first seat in the student union in 1992, three key union posts in 1996, and in 2000, the presidency of the union itself. The man who won that plum post, Sandeep Mahapatra, entered JNU in 1997 \u2013 a time, he told me, when the ABVP\u2019s supporters were proud and vocal about their allegiances. No one wrapped blankets around their faces any more. Part of the reason for the ABVP\u2019s rise, Mahapatra said, was fatigue with leftist ideas. \u201cThe Soviet Union had disintegrated. Even there, the left had been defeated,\u201d Mahapatra, now a lawyer in Delhi, said. \u201cThe students thought there was some space for nationalist thought.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f5f91b8d199eb16bcd5526ba81b564739b8c11ec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f91b8d199eb16bcd5526ba81b564739b8c11ec/0_170_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The demolishing of the Babri Masjid mosque in 1992.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The demolishing of the Babri Masjid mosque in 1992.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IndiaPicture/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The 90s were a decade of disillusionment with socialism and communism, and so too in JNU. Mahapatra\u2019s opponents, he said, \u201cwere always talking about abstract things \u2013 what Mao had said, or what Marx had said\u201d. The ABVP, for its part, mined the same faultlines on campus that the BJP exploited in Indian society. \u201cWe talked about Kashmir, about the Ram temple, about the Hindu nation.\u201d These were all crucial items on the RSS wishlist: to take full possession of the disputed region of Kashmir, defeating Pakistan in the process; to build the temple in Ayodhya; to give Hindus primacy in India. Dust-ups and brawls between student parties, Mahapatra said, were common. Once, while speaking on a stage, he was injured by stones hurled at him by his opponents.</p> \n<p>In the 21st century, the tracks of India\u2019s politics and JNU\u2019s politics diverged somewhat. Across the country, the old communist parties fell out of favour. In West Bengal, a citadel of the left, the communists were voted out of the state government in 2011, having held it for 34 years. The Congress, run as a family shop by Nehru\u2019s dynasty, turned complacent and highly corrupt. In the 2014 parliamentary elections, it won just 44 seats \u2013 a historic low. The slide was swift and brutal. On campus, the leftist student groups splintered; new caste-based factions arose. But they all decided, Mahapatra said, to band together against the ABVP. Its numbers grew, but its electoral triumphs stalled. There hasn\u2019t been an ABVP union president since Mahapatra, but the group\u2019s power and authority have expanded in ways that tracked the havoc let loose by the Hindu right under Modi.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>When Modi won his first term as prime minister in 2014, it was difficult to know how to read the result. Were those who voted for the BJP frustrated with the alternatives, or did they believe Modi to be the economic miracle-worker he claimed to be?<strong> </strong>Had they simply chosen to disregard the fact that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/new-india-gujarat-massacre\" title=\"\">had allowed</a> mobs of Hindu fanatics to murder hundreds of Muslims in riots during his chief ministership of Gujarat in 2002, or did they actively approve of this overt anti-Muslim agenda?</p> \n<p>Only after Modi settled into power did many BJP voters begin to clearly voice their sympathies for Hindutva. These revelations felt sudden and shocking, to the point that you wondered if these voters had silently longed for a pure Hindu nation well before Modi. Relationships ruptured the way they did after Trump\u2019s election or the Brexit referendum. Families bickered on WhatsApp groups, and friends fell out. \u201cBefore 2014, you\u2019d have found a pro-ABVP student and a pro-left student who were friends with each other,\u201d Cheri Che, a PhD student in history, told me. \u201cAfter 2014, that was increasingly difficult.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\" no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At JNU, the ABVP\u2019s influence swelled. Che claimed that faculty and administration positions were filled with people who had RSS or ABVP connections. At one point, he said, the \u201cwardens\u201d \u2013 or supervisors \u2013 of nearly every residence hall were shunted out and replaced with ABVP sympathisers. Beyond the campus, Hindu nationalists felt so empowered that they formed gangs to lynch Muslims and lower-caste Hindus, on flimsy suspicions that their victims were smuggling cows or in possession of beef. (In Hinduism, the cow is revered as sacred.) Since 2014, at least <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/02/18/violent-cow-protection-india/vigilante-groups-attack-minorities\" title=\"\">44 people</a> have been murdered and 280 injured. The gangs acted with impunity, sometimes filming themselves, as if they\u2019d never be prosecuted \u2013 and they were proven correct. In one Uttar Pradesh town, a Muslim man, <a href=\"https://scroll.in/latest/883618/up-police-apologise-for-photo-of-personnel-escorting-people-dragging-a-lynching-victim-in-hapur\" title=\"\">beaten so badly</a> that he would eventually die, was dragged injured along the ground. A photo showed a policeman clearing a path through the crowd as the mob hauled the body behind him.</p> \n<p>On the JNU campus, Muslim students felt more and more anxious. On the day in 2017 when Yogi Adityanath, the Hindutva hardliner, was elected chief minister, a Kashmiri Muslim student was walking to a canteen. It was close to midnight. \u201cI saw a guy, a hardcore ABVP supporter,\u201d said the student, who asked not to be named. \u201cAs soon as he saw me, he said: \u2018Now that Yogi\u2019s here, we\u2019ll cut down and devour the Muslims.\u2019 He said it openly. There were a lot of people standing around. You wouldn\u2019t have heard anything like that earlier.\u201d</p> \n<p>In February 2016, Kanhaiya Kumar, a communist who was then the student union\u2019s president, was part of a campus protest against the hanging of a Kashmiri man dubiously convicted of terrorism. The ABVP called in news crews from pro-BJP channels. Over the next few days, these channels aired footage that seemed to show Kumar and others yelling slogans calling for the break-up of India. For viewers, the videos confirmed what they already suspected: that JNU was a hothouse of treason. A few weeks later, the videos were found to have <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/03/02/kanhaiya-video-court-irani_n_9356936.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS91cmw_cT1odHRwczovL3d3dy5odWZmaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5pbi8yMDE2LzAzLzAyL2thbmhhaXlhLXZpZGVvLWNvdXJ0LWlyYW5pX25fOTM1NjkzNi5odG1sJnNhPUQmc291cmNlPWhhbmdvdXRzJnVzdD0xNTgyMjE3NzQ1MDQxMDAwJnVzZz1BRlFqQ05HVmlPZHIyZXlXY1VKTS1RYmlIQjlBSnlKMWtn&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHwqd5ZfKqHSH5HuJACKi3MJkOUAEIDWKZRkEzxnCBSJO6vOiCHj99L8lSObz_rRN4SojDoPj9grfB1wlj6fZ5QcdsulGPmlnuUjo_3xnZ6gEXmv7ATC84xZQGlkpt2IkWEHrvQBWxkW3KikRy-vPgNPS6rs9FHHli1m87Jdem9K\" title=\"\">been doctored</a>.</p> \n<p>Regardless, the BJP\u2019s leaders kept referring to JNU\u2019s students \u2013 and to anyone who supported them \u2013 as \u201canti-nationals\u201d and traitors. The Delhi police arrested Kumar and charged him under a century-old sedition law. When the police took him to the courthouse for his hearing, they encountered a mob of dozens of lawyers and at least one BJP legislator hollering slogans. \u201cShoot him!\u201d they shouted. Then, inside the courthouse, while the police stood by, the mob beat Kumar up. Afterwards, a news report said, one of the attackers <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/jnu-student-kanhaiya-kumar-dragged-kicked-by-lawyers-at-delhi-court-1278385\" title=\"\">claimed</a> with satisfaction: \u201cOur job is done.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68b57b207148077d675c39455080b5b1e41dca4d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68b57b207148077d675c39455080b5b1e41dca4d/0_178_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students protesting against the arrest of union president Kanhaiya Kumar at the JNU campus in February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students protesting against the arrest of union president Kanhaiya Kumar at the JNU campus in February 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After the February 2016 protest, the Kashmiri JNU student learned that police had visited his home in Srinagar, in Kashmir, and taken down a host of details about him and his family. He hadn\u2019t even been at the protest, he said. Then he discovered that every Kashmiri student he knew in JNU had a similar story to tell. It shook him. \u201cWe decided \u2013 a group of us \u2013 that we\u2019d just stay out of things having to do with politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re vulnerable here.\u201d A little over a year ago, when he was going to the campus library one morning, he saw a big truck filled with people shouting slogans about the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Out of a set of loudspeakers on the truck, music from the Hindutva songbook poured out. Accompanying the truck, he said, were \u201cpeople on bikes, people on foot \u2013 and they were outsiders, not students,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought: \u2018The goons have come inside.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2016, Modi\u2019s government installed at the head of JNU an engineering professor named M Jagadesh Kumar. The students and the press described Kumar as an RSS loyalist \u2013 part of the government\u2019s wider campaign to seed universities and cultural institutions with RSS appointees. Kumar denied any links with the RSS.</p> \n<p>On the evening of 5 January, as the attacks on campus escalated, Kumar messaged the police via WhatsApp, according to a police enquiry <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/as-masked-men-ran-riot-on-jnu-campus-v-c-told-police-be-stationed-at-gates-of-jnu-6207129/\" title=\"\">report</a>. Instead of requesting help in curbing the mob, though, he asked for police to be stationed outside the gate. (Later, to a reporter, he said that he\u2019d wanted campus security to tackle the assaults, which he called \u201cunfortunate.\u201d) Only at 7.45pm did a JNU official ask the police into the campus to intervene, but by then the violence had ended. The attackers were still on the premises hours later, but the university and the police let them leave, as if they\u2019d dropped by for a visit and were now hurrying to catch the last bus home.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Even before the ABVP attacks, JNU had been seething. For weeks, the student union had been aggressively opposing a fee hike, boycotting registrations and forcing classes to be suspended. When the nationwide demonstrations against the citizenship act began, that was folded into the mobilisations on campus. To many students, the JNU administration, the RSS and the BJP were part of the same machine.</p> \n<p>By itself, the new law defies India\u2019s constitution, which is a long document steeped in the resolve to treat castes and religions with scrupulous equality. Written between 1946 and 1949, it was an exercise in nation-making \u2013 in gluing together a giant modern state from fragmented communities living across the land. To effect this, one of its chief promises was that citizenship would bear no connection to religion. The citizenship act\u2019s exclusion of Muslims violates that promise.</p> \n<p>But the act is most menacing when read in tandem with other recent government measures, which in totality aim to redefine who does and does not belong on Indian soil. These measures can be perplexing, even for Indians. For one, some of their functions seem to overlap. For another, they\u2019re constantly referred to by the kind of abbreviations that are unavoidable in Indian life. The Citizenship Amendment Act is the CAA; the National Register of Citizens is the NRC; the National Population Register is the NPR. On Twitter, hashtags about the #CAA-NPR-NRC issue devolve into a thick alphabet soup.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5348694937475fcdf52912c5857a0e3fb6fb96a5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5348694937475fcdf52912c5857a0e3fb6fb96a5/0_131_3609_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BJP supporters at a rally in New Delhi in December 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BJP supporters at a rally in New Delhi in December 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prakash Singh/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The government started to create a register of citizens five years ago, in the north-eastern state of Assam. The riverine deltas and paddy fields of Assam lie across a porous border with Bangladesh, and migrants have crossed in both directions for decades. The arrival of Bangladeshis \u2013 many of them Muslims \u2013 became a heated political issue in Assam through the 70s and 80s. The migrants were blamed for taking jobs, usurping land and signing up for welfare benefits despite being ineligible for them.</p> \n<p>Previous governments, as well as India\u2019s supreme court, had agreed that a citizens\u2019 register was necessary to distinguish migrants from locals. Citizenship isn\u2019t always simple to prove in India; in a country of more than 1 billion people, fewer than 100 million hold passports, while other documents, issued at local levels by corrupt or inefficient officers, can be unreliable. For the BJP, the idea of a citizen\u2019s register served as both a profitable electoral tactic and a religious wedge. In a stump speech in 2014, Modi told an audience in Assam that while Hindu migrants would be accommodated, other \u201cinfiltrators\u201d would be sent back to Bangladesh. In April 2019, Amit Shah, now Modi\u2019s home minister, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-politics-shah-quotes-factbox/factbox-indias-new-home-affairs-minister-amit-shah-in-his-own-words-idUSKCN1T10U7?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Reuters%2FworldNews+%28Reuters+World+News%29\" title=\"\">said that</a> Bangladeshi immigrants were \u201ceating the grain that should go to the poor\u201d. They were \u201ctermites\u201d, Shah added. The BJP would pick them up, one by one, and \u201cthrow them into the Bay of Bengal\u201d.</p> \n<p>To get into the register, people had to prove first that an ancestor lived in Assam before 1971 and then that they were related to that ancestor. In a country of spotty electoral rolls and property deeds, of inconsistent name spellings and patchy documentation, this was always going to be difficult. When the registration of citizens began in 2015, Assam scrambled for its papers. Poor families, worried about being rendered stateless, spent their money on lawyers and documents. Some committed suicide. The so-called foreigners\u2019 tribunals, set up to hear appeals, were incentivised to strike people off the register; the more foreigners you identified, the better your chances of staying on the tribunal.</p> \n<p>In 2019, a Vice News <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/3k33qy/worse-than-a-death-sentence-inside-indias-sham-trials-that-could-strip-millions-of-citizenship\" title=\"\">examination</a> of five of these tribunals found that nine out of 10 cases involved Muslims. Of the Muslims who appealed, 90% were declared illegal immigrants; for Hindus, the figure was 40%. The government plans to round up all these \u201cforeigners\u201d and transport them to fill nearly a dozen internment camps in the state. (One is already being built: a 28,000 sq metre, double-walled complex for 3,000 people, not far from the border with Bhutan. The centre has six watchtowers and a 100-metre-high light tower.) The BJP is so pleased with this process that it wants to compile a pan-Indian register of citizens, extending the exclusionary power of the process across a population of 1.3 billion.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"de700604d2bd8e36627ab376e0a94202eb263f8c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de700604d2bd8e36627ab376e0a94202eb263f8c/0_412_4274_2564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"India\u2019s Narendra Modi addressing the BJP campaign rally ahead of Delhi state elections in New Delhi earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">India\u2019s Narendra Modi addressing the BJP campaign rally ahead of Delhi state elections in New Delhi earlier this year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manish Swarup/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Assam\u2019s register was made public last August, and 1.9 million people, finding themselves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/31/india-almost-2m-people-left-off-assam-register-of-citizens\" title=\"\">omitted</a>, had to hurry to file appeals. Four months later, the government passed the citizenship act. In this grand mechanism to determine \u201cIndianness\u201d, there will be one further component: a population register, hoovering up demographic data on the \u201cusual residents\u201d of India. But even this seemingly passive count of the population can transmute into yet another sieve for citizenship. After the population register is updated in September, lists of residents will be posted in each locality. Then anyone in the locality \u2013 officials, neighbours, vigilantes, RSS informers \u2013 can lodge an objection to your name\u2019s inclusion. In such cases, you will be marked out as a \u201cdoubtful\u201d citizen \u2013 a \u201cD-voter\u201d \u2013 with the prospect of being interned endlessly or thrown out of India. In this fug of paranoia, anyone might theoretically find themselves tagged \u201cdoubtful\u201d: Muslims, dissidents, journalists and opposition political workers. The BJP knows its priorities. \u201cNo Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Christian or Parsi,\u201d a new <a href=\"https://scroll.in/latest/949007/nationwide-nrc-in-pipeline-says-bjps-bengali-booklet-on-citizenship-law\" title=\"\">BJP booklet</a> assures readers, \u201cwill find their name in the D-voter list.\u201d Muslims, again, are conspicuous by their absence.</p> \n<p>The end game isn\u2019t to rinse 180 million Muslims out of India. It can\u2019t be, for practical reasons. Where would they go? Even those speculatively identified as illegal Bangladeshi immigrants cannot be sent back home unless Bangladesh accepts them. What the BJP is aiming for is what its founders have always wanted: a country that is Hindu before anything else. In the 1940s, both Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and Vinayak Savarkar, a leading RSS ideologue, were proponents of a two-nation theory. \u201cThe only difference,\u201d says Niraja Jayal, a political scientist who studies Indian democracy, \u201cwas that Jinnah wanted the territory of undivided India to be cut into two, with one part for Muslims. Whereas Savarkar wanted Hindus and Muslims in the same land, but with the Muslim living in a subordinate position to the Hindu.\u201d That unequal citizenship was what the RSS considered \u2013 and still considers \u2013 right and proper, Jayal said. \u201cSo you get a graded citizenship, a citizenship with hierarchies. You don\u2019t need genocide, you don\u2019t need ethnic cleansing. This does the job well enough.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Modi\u2019s first and second terms have now come to feel distinctly different. After 2014, the BJP consolidated its success by winning a series of state elections. The government began its citizenship registry in Assam, but its other prominent policies affected every Indian uniformly: a new tax on goods and services, chaotically implemented; a cancellation of high-value currency notes, intended to curb corruption but melting the economy down instead; and an Orwellian biometric identification scheme. The worst acts of rightwing violence \u2013 the beef lynchings \u2013 were committed by vigilantes emboldened by the BJP\u2019s rise, and often supported by party leaders. (Two years ago, after eight convicted lynchers were released on bail, one of Modi\u2019s ministers invited them to his house and <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-has-suspended-sentence-was-honouring-the-law-jayant-sinha-on-garlanding-ramgarh-lynching-convicts/story-oawPKViVZHsVcPAK84zN6N.html\" title=\"\">draped floral garlands</a> on them.) But the lynchings were not directly ascribable to the government in the way that events since Modi\u2019s re-election last year have been.</p> \n<p>In August 2019, three months into its second term, the government suspended a constitutional provision that has long granted special autonomies to the disputed border state of Jammu and Kashmir. Further, the state was split in two, and the halves brought under federal control. To forestall resistance, troops poured into the already heavily militarised Kashmir valley, and internet services across the state were shut down. They haven\u2019t yet been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/15/internet-partially-restored-kashmir-social-media-ban-stays\" title=\"\">properly restored</a>; each passing day sets a new record for the longest shutdown of the internet by a government anywhere in the world. Kashmir\u2019s leading opposition politicians were arrested; they haven\u2019t been heard from since. Justifying a draconian detention order, the government argued that one of these politicians deserved to be held because of his ability \u201cto convince his electorate to come out and vote in huge numbers\u201d.</p> \n<p>The RSS got the solution it wanted in Ayodhya as well. Since 1992, a legal battle has raged to determine what should be done with the site of the flattened mosque. In November, the supreme court \u2013 which appears increasingly pliant to the government\u2019s needs \u2013 ruled that the mosque had been destroyed illegally, but that the land should nevertheless host a temple. It was as if a burglar, having been dressed down, was then invited to move into the house he\u2019d robbed. The citizenship act was passed in December. Within half a year, with a speed and brazenness that left India dazed, the government had fulfilled some of the chief items on the RSS wishlist.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c39fd5c74e43f6ee75eb463ab4c381103dee0168\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c39fd5c74e43f6ee75eb463ab4c381103dee0168/0_0_4928_3076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti seen in Mumbai in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Given the ferocity and stamina of the anti-government protests since December, it seems bewildering that no similar mobilisations met any of the government\u2019s previous moves. From the 2019 election onwards, for several months, it seemed as if most Indians were implicitly in favour of this galloping onset of Hindutva. Why was it the citizenship act that electrified the public into protest? It may have partly been \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d, Jayal said, but it also induced a broader, more primal kind of insecurity.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith Kashmir, large segments of India have been persuaded over time that it\u2019s a troubled region \u2013 which is an unfair stereotype, but maybe that made it harder for people to respond to its change in status,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the Babri Masjid, it was fatigue over an issue that has dragged on for decades.\u201d The citizenship act, though, \u201cpromises a whole range of unpleasant possibilities\u201d. Despite the government\u2019s assurances to Hindus and other non-Muslims, \u201ceveryone is anxious to be told they have to search for papers, although of course it\u2019s worse for Muslims\u201d, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s the prospect of harassment. There\u2019s the fear of being declared illegal. There\u2019s the fear of the unknown.\u201d</p> \n<p>This sense of personal peril is matched by a sense of national peril. India can appear to be inured to injustices \u2013 the miscarriages of law, the iniquities of wealth and caste, the venality, the wounds and bruises to the body politic. What it still resists is any attempt to claw into the body and rearrange its very bones \u2013 its constitution. Nehru, Ambedkar and the other framers of India\u2019s constitution engineered the country to be a liberal, secular democracy. Until recently, that idea had come to seem so impossible to dislodge that even patently unsecular politicians feel compelled to pay lip service to it. \u201cSecularism is an article of faith for us,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.firstpost.com/politics/modi-in-up-others-are-misleading-bjp-is-the-real-secular-party-1415523.html\" title=\"\">Modi said</a> during his 2014 campaign. By then, as an RSS member, he\u2019d already been committed to the concept of a Hindu nation for 43 years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/we-are-not-safe-indias-muslims-tell-of-wave-of-police-brutality\">'We are not safe': India's Muslims tell of wave of police brutality</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When governments have threatened to split away from this constitutional foundation, they\u2019ve met widespread popular opposition. After the prime minister Indira Gandhi suspended civic freedoms \u2013 of speech, of assembly, of due process \u2013 in 1975, she had to suppress waves of protest for the next 18 months, until she called off her declared state of emergency. The recent agitations against the citizenship act are similar: defiance of a law that meddles with the fundamental design of India.</p> \n<p>For the first time since 1947, when the subcontinent went through its bloody partition into India and Pakistan, a politics is being constructed entirely around the premise of exclusion \u2013 of deciding who can\u2019t be Indian, or calibrating how Indian anyone can be. The rabid focus on identity is a piece of a global pattern, of course, but it is especially dangerous in a country that is as tenuous a construct as India. This is still, as it was in 1947, a land teeming with so many identities \u2013 plotted multi-dimensionally along the axes of caste, gender, class, religion, language and ethnicity \u2013 that the only way to make it work is to accept that everyone belongs equally to India.</p> \n<p>This egalitarian principle, therefore, has not been just an ideal; it has been a compact necessary for India\u2019s survival. When a government starts to make the case for some to be considered less Indian than others, subtracting first one identity and then another as if they were Jenga blocks, the structure turns unsteady. Either the union dissolves, or it is kept together only by an iron-fisted, authoritarian regime \u2013 the kind that unleashes violence through the police, as in Uttar Pradesh, or through party auxiliaries under police protection, as at JNU. The danger posed by the BJP is that it is both preparing itself to be that regime and guiding India into an instability from which it may never recover.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Soon after the violence began, on 5 January, Aamir was standing outside a residence hall in Jawaharlal Nehru University in south Delhi. Aamir, a PhD student, is Muslim, and he asked to be identified only by his first name. He had come to return a book to a classmate when he saw 50 or 60 people approaching the building. They carried metal rods, cricket bats and rocks. One swung a sledgehammer. They were yelling slogans: \u201cShoot the traitors to the nation!\u201d was a common one. Later, Aamir learned that they had spent the previous half-hour assaulting a gathering of teachers and students down the road. Their faces were masked, but some were still recognisable as members of a Hindu nationalist student group that has become increasingly powerful over the past few years. The group, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidya Parishad (ABVP), is the youth wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Founded 94 years ago by men who were besotted with Mussolini\u2019s fascists, the RSS is the holding company of Hindu supremacism: of Hindutva, as it\u2019s called. Given its role and its size, it is difficult to find an analogue for the RSS anywhere in the world. In nearly every faith, the source of conservative theology is its hierarchical, centrally organised clergy; that theology is recast into a project of religious statecraft elsewhere, by other parties. Hinduism, though, has no principal church, no single pontiff, nobody to ordain or rule. The RSS has appointed itself as both the arbiter of theological meaning and the architect of a Hindu nation-state. It has at least 4 million volunteers, who swear oaths of allegiance and take part in quasi-military drills. The word often used to describe the RSS is \u201cparamilitary\u201d. In its near-century of existence, it has been accused of plotting assassinations, stoking riots against minorities and acts of terrorism. (Mahatma Gandhi was shot dead in 1948 by an RSS man, although the RSS claims he had left the organisation by then.) The RSS doesn\u2019t, by itself, engage in electoral politics. But among its affiliated groups is the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the party that has governed India for the past six years, and that has, under the prime minister Narendra Modi, been remaking India into an authoritarian, Hindu nationalist state. It was nearly 7pm when Aamir saw the approaching mob. At that time in mid-winter, the campus of JNU, perhaps India\u2019s most influential state-run university, is unnervingly dark. It spreads over more than 400 hectares of wooded land, sealed off by a wall from the rest of south Delhi. Residence halls sit in groves of acacia and borage. To get anywhere from the gate requires a bicycle, an auto rickshaw or a long walk. The university\u2019s 8,000 students appear to occupy a remote world unto themselves. Since its founding in 1969, though, JNU has functioned as a microcosm of national politics. The ideologies of its students and faculty \u2013 exhibited in its hyperactive student politics \u2013 have traditionally been liberal, leftist and secular. Through its academics, JNU frequently moulded government policy; its graduates went into the media, major non-profits, the law or leftist parties. Over the years, JNU has stood for much of what the conservative, ethnocentric BJP has resented about the country it governs today. The university has been like a stone in the boot of the BJP, hobbling the party with every step. When he spotted the mob, Aamir ran into the dorms, up the stairs and into his friend\u2019s room. They locked the door, then hid on the balcony. They heard the attackers shattering panes of glass, barging into rooms and beating students. Aamir silenced his phone. \u201cI was sure they\u2019d break my arms and legs if they caught me,\u201d he said. The mob had come with clear intent, targeting students and faculty who had been critical of the BJP: a Muslim student from Kashmir, teachers with ties to the political left, members of groups that championed underprivileged castes. The president of the JNU student union, Aishe Ghosh, received a deep gash to her head and her arm was broken. The rooms of ABVP allies, though, were spared. Later, it emerged that the university\u2019s own cadre of ABVP had been bolstered by students from other universities \u2013 and perhaps by people who weren\u2019t students at all, people who were just RSS muscle. Rohit Azad, who has spent two decades at the university, first as a student and then a professor of economics, told me that although he had seen his share of violence between student groups, \u201cthis thing \u2013 this act of bringing in attackers from outside \u2013 that was unprecedented\u201d. It was as if the Young Republicans had invited some alt-right thugs to join them in running amok through Berkeley, beating up black and Hispanic students, Young Democrats and anyone who\u2019d expressed support for Bernie Sanders. Videos of the attacks leaked out through social media in real time. The police were called, but they didn\u2019t move to stop the violence. Instead, a posse of policemen installed itself at JNU\u2019s gate, allowing no one in. Yogendra Yadav, a political activist, arrived at the gate at 9pm. Ninety minutes later, the attackers emerged, still masked and armed. Even then, the police detained no one. Instead, they were permitted to walk away as if nothing had happened. When Yadav\u2019s colleague took photos, Yadav was set upon by a knot of men, knocked down and kicked in the face. The police did nothing. Later, from a video, Yadav identified a local ABVP official among those who had hit him. In a statement, the ABVP blamed the attacks on \u201cleftist goons,\u201d but on television members admitted that the masked, armed men and women on campus were part of the ABVP. Still, the Delhi police pressed no charges. \u201cThe police gave the goons cover, gave them free rein on campus,\u201d Yadav said. A JNU professor went further, claiming that: \u201cThe police are complicit.\u201d * * * The onslaught on JNU marked the middle of a season of nationwide protest, provoked by a new law. The Citizenship Amendment Act, passed by parliament on 11 December 2019, provides a fast track to citizenship for refugees fleeing into India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Refugees of every south Asian faith are eligible \u2013 every faith, that is, except Islam. It is a policy that fits neatly with the RSS and the BJP\u2019s demonisation of Muslims, India\u2019s largest religious minority. To votaries of Hindutva, the country is best served if it is expunged of Islam. The act was both a loud signal of that ambition and a handy tool to help achieve it. Since December, millions of Indians have turned out on to the streets to object to this vision of their country. The government has fought them by banning gatherings, shutting off mobile internet services, detaining people arbitrarily, or worse. After protests flared at Jamia Millia Islamia, an Islamic university in Delhi, cops fired teargas and live rounds, assaulted students and trashed the library. As demonstrations spread across the state of Uttar Pradesh, police raided and vandalised Muslim homes by way of reprisal. Detainees in custody were beaten; one man reported hearing screams in a police station all night long. (In various statements, the police claimed to be acting in self defence, or to prevent violence, or to root out conspiracy.) At least 20 protesters died of bullet wounds. Police officials denied firing at the crowds, even though the police carried the only visible guns at these rallies. Still, the protests have persisted well into February. At Shaheen Bagh, a neighbourhood in south-eastern Delhi, hundreds of thousands of people have turned up over nine weeks to take part in an indefinite sit-in. The BJP has taken a ruthless view of all this dissent. On one occasion, Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu cleric who is chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, said: \u201cIf they won\u2019t understand words, they\u2019ll understand bullets.\u201d One of Modi\u2019s ministers used \u201cShoot the traitors to the nation!\u201d as a call-and-response at a rally \u2013 the same slogan the ABVP had raised in JNU. In its 72 years as a free country, India has never faced a more serious crisis. Already its institutions \u2013 its courts, much of its media, its investigative agencies, its election commission \u2013 have been pressured to fall in line with Modi\u2019s policies. The political opposition is withered and infirm. More is in the offing: the idea of Hindutva, in its fullest expression, will ultimately involve undoing the constitution and unravelling the fabric of liberal democracy. It will have to; constitutional niceties aren\u2019t compatible with the BJP\u2019s blueprint for a country in which people are graded and assessed according to their faith. The ferment gripping India since the passage of the citizenship act \u2013 the fever of the protests, the brutality of the police, the viciousness of the politics \u2013 has only reflected how existentially high the stakes have become. * * * The RSS and the BJP\u2019s success, over the past six years, is owed in part to its adept poisoning of the public discourse. Politicians, indoctrinated media outlets and squadrons of social media trolls lie, polarise and demonise all day long. Among their stratagems is the invention of categories of abuse for their opponents, to convey with a single label why such people should not be trusted to have India\u2019s interests at heart. \u201cPresstitute\u201d is one, applied to liberal journalists to accuse them of selling their coverage for money or influence. \u201cSickular\u201d is another, born of the RSS\u2019s opinion that Indian secularism is a demented version of minority appeasement. The term \u201cJNU type\u201d refers to leftists of every stripe \u2013 from Maoists yearning for the revolution, to moderates who abhor Hindutva. Traditionally, JNU has specialised in the humanities, so \u201cJNU types\u201d also came to be scorned for their soft humanism \u2013 for their opposition to capital punishment, to the army\u2019s human-rights abuses, or to the state\u2019s repressions in Kashmir. All while studying for years and years on the government\u2019s dime, the BJP\u2019s supporters complain. It\u2019s enough to slot JNU types into the mother category: \u201canti-national\u201d. In its earliest years, JNU soaked up the ideology of the man it was named after \u2013 Jawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first prime minister \u2013 and of his party, the Congress. It was still only a generation since independence, and Nehru and the Congress, having led the freedom struggle, exerted enormous moral authority. The university\u2019s ethos and its very curriculum were built on Nehru\u2019s values, says Rakesh Batabyal, the author of JNU: The Making of a University. It was secular in its worldview, left of centre in its economics and technocratic in its thinking on policy. \u201cStudents came from all over the country,\u201d Batabyal told me. \u201cThere was a pluralism to the university that Nehru wanted for India.\u201d Over the next few decades, the locus of power in student politics migrated further leftwards, into groups that allied themselves with national communist parties. The ABVP, which opposed all these -isms \u2013 secularism, pluralism, socialism, communism \u2013 remained on the margins, just like its counterparts in national politics. The Hindu right had done nothing of note during the freedom struggle; in fact, the RSS didn\u2019t take part in the mass movements that forced the British out of India. For almost half a century after independence, the political parties backed by the RSS remained in the political wilderness. \u201cThey used to say that, back in the 1980s, if you were a supporter at an ABVP event, you went to it with a blanket covering your face,\u201d Azad, the JNU professor, told me. \u201cThat was how embarrassing it was considered to be.\u201d Then a mosque was destroyed, and India changed. For years, the RSS had claimed that the Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque in the town of Ayodhya, stood on the very spot where the Hindu deity Ram was born. The location warranted a temple, the RSS declared, not a mosque built by an invading Muslim king. Late in 1990, a BJP leader toured India\u2019s heartland for two months, in an air-conditioned Toyota mocked up to resemble a chariot, to rouse Hindus to demand that a temple replace the mosque. (The man who sat in the Toyota\u2019s cabin, serving as the rally\u2019s logistician, was Narendra Modi.) In December 1992, a crowd of men from the RSS and BJP razed the mosque, watched but unhindered by the police. In the following weeks, religious riots erupted across India, particularly in Mumbai. Two thousand people were killed. The BJP\u2019s obsession with the Babri mosque was bloody and divisive, but it also earned them new political capital. In 1996, the BJP came to power for the first time. On the campus of JNU, in tidy parallel, the fortunes of the ABVP bloomed: it won its first seat in the student union in 1992, three key union posts in 1996, and in 2000, the presidency of the union itself. The man who won that plum post, Sandeep Mahapatra, entered JNU in 1997 \u2013 a time, he told me, when the ABVP\u2019s supporters were proud and vocal about their allegiances. No one wrapped blankets around their faces any more. Part of the reason for the ABVP\u2019s rise, Mahapatra said, was fatigue with leftist ideas. \u201cThe Soviet Union had disintegrated. Even there, the left had been defeated,\u201d Mahapatra, now a lawyer in Delhi, said. \u201cThe students thought there was some space for nationalist thought.\u201d The 90s were a decade of disillusionment with socialism and communism, and so too in JNU. Mahapatra\u2019s opponents, he said, \u201cwere always talking about abstract things \u2013 what Mao had said, or what Marx had said\u201d. The ABVP, for its part, mined the same faultlines on campus that the BJP exploited in Indian society. \u201cWe talked about Kashmir, about the Ram temple, about the Hindu nation.\u201d These were all crucial items on the RSS wishlist: to take full possession of the disputed region of Kashmir, defeating Pakistan in the process; to build the temple in Ayodhya; to give Hindus primacy in India. Dust-ups and brawls between student parties, Mahapatra said, were common. Once, while speaking on a stage, he was injured by stones hurled at him by his opponents. In the 21st century, the tracks of India\u2019s politics and JNU\u2019s politics diverged somewhat. Across the country, the old communist parties fell out of favour. In West Bengal, a citadel of the left, the communists were voted out of the state government in 2011, having held it for 34 years. The Congress, run as a family shop by Nehru\u2019s dynasty, turned complacent and highly corrupt. In the 2014 parliamentary elections, it won just 44 seats \u2013 a historic low. The slide was swift and brutal. On campus, the leftist student groups splintered; new caste-based factions arose. But they all decided, Mahapatra said, to band together against the ABVP. Its numbers grew, but its electoral triumphs stalled. There hasn\u2019t been an ABVP union president since Mahapatra, but the group\u2019s power and authority have expanded in ways that tracked the havoc let loose by the Hindu right under Modi. * * * When Modi won his first term as prime minister in 2014, it was difficult to know how to read the result. Were those who voted for the BJP frustrated with the alternatives, or did they believe Modi to be the economic miracle-worker he claimed to be? Had they simply chosen to disregard the fact that he had allowed mobs of Hindu fanatics to murder hundreds of Muslims in riots during his chief ministership of Gujarat in 2002, or did they actively approve of this overt anti-Muslim agenda? Only after Modi settled into power did many BJP voters begin to clearly voice their sympathies for Hindutva. These revelations felt sudden and shocking, to the point that you wondered if these voters had silently longed for a pure Hindu nation well before Modi. Relationships ruptured the way they did after Trump\u2019s election or the Brexit referendum. Families bickered on WhatsApp groups, and friends fell out. \u201cBefore 2014, you\u2019d have found a pro-ABVP student and a pro-left student who were friends with each other,\u201d Cheri Che, a PhD student in history, told me. \u201cAfter 2014, that was increasingly difficult.\u201d At JNU, the ABVP\u2019s influence swelled. Che claimed that faculty and administration positions were filled with people who had RSS or ABVP connections. At one point, he said, the \u201cwardens\u201d \u2013 or supervisors \u2013 of nearly every residence hall were shunted out and replaced with ABVP sympathisers. Beyond the campus, Hindu nationalists felt so empowered that they formed gangs to lynch Muslims and lower-caste Hindus, on flimsy suspicions that their victims were smuggling cows or in possession of beef. (In Hinduism, the cow is revered as sacred.) Since 2014, at least 44 people have been murdered and 280 injured. The gangs acted with impunity, sometimes filming themselves, as if they\u2019d never be prosecuted \u2013 and they were proven correct. In one Uttar Pradesh town, a Muslim man, beaten so badly that he would eventually die, was dragged injured along the ground. A photo showed a policeman clearing a path through the crowd as the mob hauled the body behind him. On the JNU campus, Muslim students felt more and more anxious. On the day in 2017 when Yogi Adityanath, the Hindutva hardliner, was elected chief minister, a Kashmiri Muslim student was walking to a canteen. It was close to midnight. \u201cI saw a guy, a hardcore ABVP supporter,\u201d said the student, who asked not to be named. \u201cAs soon as he saw me, he said: \u2018Now that Yogi\u2019s here, we\u2019ll cut down and devour the Muslims.\u2019 He said it openly. There were a lot of people standing around. You wouldn\u2019t have heard anything like that earlier.\u201d In February 2016, Kanhaiya Kumar, a communist who was then the student union\u2019s president, was part of a campus protest against the hanging of a Kashmiri man dubiously convicted of terrorism. The ABVP called in news crews from pro-BJP channels. Over the next few days, these channels aired footage that seemed to show Kumar and others yelling slogans calling for the break-up of India. For viewers, the videos confirmed what they already suspected: that JNU was a hothouse of treason. A few weeks later, the videos were found to have been doctored. Regardless, the BJP\u2019s leaders kept referring to JNU\u2019s students \u2013 and to anyone who supported them \u2013 as \u201canti-nationals\u201d and traitors. The Delhi police arrested Kumar and charged him under a century-old sedition law. When the police took him to the courthouse for his hearing, they encountered a mob of dozens of lawyers and at least one BJP legislator hollering slogans. \u201cShoot him!\u201d they shouted. Then, inside the courthouse, while the police stood by, the mob beat Kumar up. Afterwards, a news report said, one of the attackers claimed with satisfaction: \u201cOur job is done.\u201d After the February 2016 protest, the Kashmiri JNU student learned that police had visited his home in Srinagar, in Kashmir, and taken down a host of details about him and his family. He hadn\u2019t even been at the protest, he said. Then he discovered that every Kashmiri student he knew in JNU had a similar story to tell. It shook him. \u201cWe decided \u2013 a group of us \u2013 that we\u2019d just stay out of things having to do with politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re vulnerable here.\u201d A little over a year ago, when he was going to the campus library one morning, he saw a big truck filled with people shouting slogans about the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Out of a set of loudspeakers on the truck, music from the Hindutva songbook poured out. Accompanying the truck, he said, were \u201cpeople on bikes, people on foot \u2013 and they were outsiders, not students,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought: \u2018The goons have come inside.\u2019\u201d In 2016, Modi\u2019s government installed at the head of JNU an engineering professor named M Jagadesh Kumar. The students and the press described Kumar as an RSS loyalist \u2013 part of the government\u2019s wider campaign to seed universities and cultural institutions with RSS appointees. Kumar denied any links with the RSS. On the evening of 5 January, as the attacks on campus escalated, Kumar messaged the police via WhatsApp, according to a police enquiry report. Instead of requesting help in curbing the mob, though, he asked for police to be stationed outside the gate. (Later, to a reporter, he said that he\u2019d wanted campus security to tackle the assaults, which he called \u201cunfortunate.\u201d) Only at 7.45pm did a JNU official ask the police into the campus to intervene, but by then the violence had ended. The attackers were still on the premises hours later, but the university and the police let them leave, as if they\u2019d dropped by for a visit and were now hurrying to catch the last bus home. * * * Even before the ABVP attacks, JNU had been seething. For weeks, the student union had been aggressively opposing a fee hike, boycotting registrations and forcing classes to be suspended. When the nationwide demonstrations against the citizenship act began, that was folded into the mobilisations on campus. To many students, the JNU administration, the RSS and the BJP were part of the same machine. By itself, the new law defies India\u2019s constitution, which is a long document steeped in the resolve to treat castes and religions with scrupulous equality. Written between 1946 and 1949, it was an exercise in nation-making \u2013 in gluing together a giant modern state from fragmented communities living across the land. To effect this, one of its chief promises was that citizenship would bear no connection to religion. The citizenship act\u2019s exclusion of Muslims violates that promise. But the act is most menacing when read in tandem with other recent government measures, which in totality aim to redefine who does and does not belong on Indian soil. These measures can be perplexing, even for Indians. For one, some of their functions seem to overlap. For another, they\u2019re constantly referred to by the kind of abbreviations that are unavoidable in Indian life. The Citizenship Amendment Act is the CAA; the National Register of Citizens is the NRC; the National Population Register is the NPR. On Twitter, hashtags about the #CAA-NPR-NRC issue devolve into a thick alphabet soup. The government started to create a register of citizens five years ago, in the north-eastern state of Assam. The riverine deltas and paddy fields of Assam lie across a porous border with Bangladesh, and migrants have crossed in both directions for decades. The arrival of Bangladeshis \u2013 many of them Muslims \u2013 became a heated political issue in Assam through the 70s and 80s. The migrants were blamed for taking jobs, usurping land and signing up for welfare benefits despite being ineligible for them. Previous governments, as well as India\u2019s supreme court, had agreed that a citizens\u2019 register was necessary to distinguish migrants from locals. Citizenship isn\u2019t always simple to prove in India; in a country of more than 1 billion people, fewer than 100 million hold passports, while other documents, issued at local levels by corrupt or inefficient officers, can be unreliable. For the BJP, the idea of a citizen\u2019s register served as both a profitable electoral tactic and a religious wedge. In a stump speech in 2014, Modi told an audience in Assam that while Hindu migrants would be accommodated, other \u201cinfiltrators\u201d would be sent back to Bangladesh. In April 2019, Amit Shah, now Modi\u2019s home minister, said that Bangladeshi immigrants were \u201ceating the grain that should go to the poor\u201d. They were \u201ctermites\u201d, Shah added. The BJP would pick them up, one by one, and \u201cthrow them into the Bay of Bengal\u201d. To get into the register, people had to prove first that an ancestor lived in Assam before 1971 and then that they were related to that ancestor. In a country of spotty electoral rolls and property deeds, of inconsistent name spellings and patchy documentation, this was always going to be difficult. When the registration of citizens began in 2015, Assam scrambled for its papers. Poor families, worried about being rendered stateless, spent their money on lawyers and documents. Some committed suicide. The so-called foreigners\u2019 tribunals, set up to hear appeals, were incentivised to strike people off the register; the more foreigners you identified, the better your chances of staying on the tribunal. In 2019, a Vice News examination of five of these tribunals found that nine out of 10 cases involved Muslims. Of the Muslims who appealed, 90% were declared illegal immigrants; for Hindus, the figure was 40%. The government plans to round up all these \u201cforeigners\u201d and transport them to fill nearly a dozen internment camps in the state. (One is already being built: a 28,000 sq metre, double-walled complex for 3,000 people, not far from the border with Bhutan. The centre has six watchtowers and a 100-metre-high light tower.) The BJP is so pleased with this process that it wants to compile a pan-Indian register of citizens, extending the exclusionary power of the process across a population of 1.3 billion. Assam\u2019s register was made public last August, and 1.9 million people, finding themselves omitted, had to hurry to file appeals. Four months later, the government passed the citizenship act. In this grand mechanism to determine \u201cIndianness\u201d, there will be one further component: a population register, hoovering up demographic data on the \u201cusual residents\u201d of India. But even this seemingly passive count of the population can transmute into yet another sieve for citizenship. After the population register is updated in September, lists of residents will be posted in each locality. Then anyone in the locality \u2013 officials, neighbours, vigilantes, RSS informers \u2013 can lodge an objection to your name\u2019s inclusion. In such cases, you will be marked out as a \u201cdoubtful\u201d citizen \u2013 a \u201cD-voter\u201d \u2013 with the prospect of being interned endlessly or thrown out of India. In this fug of paranoia, anyone might theoretically find themselves tagged \u201cdoubtful\u201d: Muslims, dissidents, journalists and opposition political workers. The BJP knows its priorities. \u201cNo Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Christian or Parsi,\u201d a new BJP booklet assures readers, \u201cwill find their name in the D-voter list.\u201d Muslims, again, are conspicuous by their absence. The end game isn\u2019t to rinse 180 million Muslims out of India. It can\u2019t be, for practical reasons. Where would they go? Even those speculatively identified as illegal Bangladeshi immigrants cannot be sent back home unless Bangladesh accepts them. What the BJP is aiming for is what its founders have always wanted: a country that is Hindu before anything else. In the 1940s, both Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and Vinayak Savarkar, a leading RSS ideologue, were proponents of a two-nation theory. \u201cThe only difference,\u201d says Niraja Jayal, a political scientist who studies Indian democracy, \u201cwas that Jinnah wanted the territory of undivided India to be cut into two, with one part for Muslims. Whereas Savarkar wanted Hindus and Muslims in the same land, but with the Muslim living in a subordinate position to the Hindu.\u201d That unequal citizenship was what the RSS considered \u2013 and still considers \u2013 right and proper, Jayal said. \u201cSo you get a graded citizenship, a citizenship with hierarchies. You don\u2019t need genocide, you don\u2019t need ethnic cleansing. This does the job well enough.\u201d * * * Modi\u2019s first and second terms have now come to feel distinctly different. After 2014, the BJP consolidated its success by winning a series of state elections. The government began its citizenship registry in Assam, but its other prominent policies affected every Indian uniformly: a new tax on goods and services, chaotically implemented; a cancellation of high-value currency notes, intended to curb corruption but melting the economy down instead; and an Orwellian biometric identification scheme. The worst acts of rightwing violence \u2013 the beef lynchings \u2013 were committed by vigilantes emboldened by the BJP\u2019s rise, and often supported by party leaders. (Two years ago, after eight convicted lynchers were released on bail, one of Modi\u2019s ministers invited them to his house and draped floral garlands on them.) But the lynchings were not directly ascribable to the government in the way that events since Modi\u2019s re-election last year have been. In August 2019, three months into its second term, the government suspended a constitutional provision that has long granted special autonomies to the disputed border state of Jammu and Kashmir. Further, the state was split in two, and the halves brought under federal control. To forestall resistance, troops poured into the already heavily militarised Kashmir valley, and internet services across the state were shut down. They haven\u2019t yet been properly restored; each passing day sets a new record for the longest shutdown of the internet by a government anywhere in the world. Kashmir\u2019s leading opposition politicians were arrested; they haven\u2019t been heard from since. Justifying a draconian detention order, the government argued that one of these politicians deserved to be held because of his ability \u201cto convince his electorate to come out and vote in huge numbers\u201d. The RSS got the solution it wanted in Ayodhya as well. Since 1992, a legal battle has raged to determine what should be done with the site of the flattened mosque. In November, the supreme court \u2013 which appears increasingly pliant to the government\u2019s needs \u2013 ruled that the mosque had been destroyed illegally, but that the land should nevertheless host a temple. It was as if a burglar, having been dressed down, was then invited to move into the house he\u2019d robbed. The citizenship act was passed in December. Within half a year, with a speed and brazenness that left India dazed, the government had fulfilled some of the chief items on the RSS wishlist. Given the ferocity and stamina of the anti-government protests since December, it seems bewildering that no similar mobilisations met any of the government\u2019s previous moves. From the 2019 election onwards, for several months, it seemed as if most Indians were implicitly in favour of this galloping onset of Hindutva. Why was it the citizenship act that electrified the public into protest? It may have partly been \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d, Jayal said, but it also induced a broader, more primal kind of insecurity. \u201cWith Kashmir, large segments of India have been persuaded over time that it\u2019s a troubled region \u2013 which is an unfair stereotype, but maybe that made it harder for people to respond to its change in status,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the Babri Masjid, it was fatigue over an issue that has dragged on for decades.\u201d The citizenship act, though, \u201cpromises a whole range of unpleasant possibilities\u201d. Despite the government\u2019s assurances to Hindus and other non-Muslims, \u201ceveryone is anxious to be told they have to search for papers, although of course it\u2019s worse for Muslims\u201d, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s the prospect of harassment. There\u2019s the fear of being declared illegal. There\u2019s the fear of the unknown.\u201d This sense of personal peril is matched by a sense of national peril. India can appear to be inured to injustices \u2013 the miscarriages of law, the iniquities of wealth and caste, the venality, the wounds and bruises to the body politic. What it still resists is any attempt to claw into the body and rearrange its very bones \u2013 its constitution. Nehru, Ambedkar and the other framers of India\u2019s constitution engineered the country to be a liberal, secular democracy. Until recently, that idea had come to seem so impossible to dislodge that even patently unsecular politicians feel compelled to pay lip service to it. \u201cSecularism is an article of faith for us,\u201d Modi said during his 2014 campaign. By then, as an RSS member, he\u2019d already been committed to the concept of a Hindu nation for 43 years. When governments have threatened to split away from this constitutional foundation, they\u2019ve met widespread popular opposition. After the prime minister Indira Gandhi suspended civic freedoms \u2013 of speech, of assembly, of due process \u2013 in 1975, she had to suppress waves of protest for the next 18 months, until she called off her declared state of emergency. The recent agitations against the citizenship act are similar: defiance of a law that meddles with the fundamental design of India. For the first time since 1947, when the subcontinent went through its bloody partition into India and Pakistan, a politics is being constructed entirely around the premise of exclusion \u2013 of deciding who can\u2019t be Indian, or calibrating how Indian anyone can be. The rabid focus on identity is a piece of a global pattern, of course, but it is especially dangerous in a country that is as tenuous a construct as India. This is still, as it was in 1947, a land teeming with so many identities \u2013 plotted multi-dimensionally along the axes of caste, gender, class, religion, language and ethnicity \u2013 that the only way to make it work is to accept that everyone belongs equally to India. This egalitarian principle, therefore, has not been just an ideal; it has been a compact necessary for India\u2019s survival. When a government starts to make the case for some to be considered less Indian than others, subtracting first one identity and then another as if they were Jenga blocks, the structure turns unsteady. Either the union dissolves, or it is kept together only by an iron-fisted, authoritarian regime \u2013 the kind that unleashes violence through the police, as in Uttar Pradesh, or through party auxiliaries under police protection, as at JNU. The danger posed by the BJP is that it is both preparing itself to be that regime and guiding India into an instability from which it may never recover. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

According to South Sudan\u2019s ministry of agriculture, mature locusts looking for places to breed have been confirmed in three locations after the insects crossed into southern Magwi county, on the border with Uganda, and are now moving west. Confirmation of the presence of the locusts, part of a once in a generation event that has produced swarms the size of cities, came after a joint team from the South Sudanese ministry of health and the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization visited the area. \u201cYesterday we received the report that desert locusts have entered South Sudan from Magwi county and our team and those of [the] FAO sent people there, and they have confirmed the presence of locusts in the area,\u201d said the country\u2019s agriculture minister, Anyoti Adigo Nyikwach. The appearance of the locusts follows a period of extreme weather, including devastating floods, that have further threatened the food supply. Experts are warning that the main March-to-May cropping season is now at risk. The situation, however, remains most serious in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia amid evidence that aerial spraying of pesticides against the swarms has so far had very limited impact. Desert locusts can travel up to 95 miles in a day and can eat their own body weight in plant material, meaning even a small swarm can consume as much food as 35,000 people in a day, according to the UN. Kenya, Somalia, Eritrea and Djibouti were already battling the worst locust outbreak in decades, with swarms also spreading into Tanzania and Uganda. Meshack Malo, South Sudan\u2019s representative for the FAO, said the locusts were mature and looking for breeding grounds that would form the basis of the next major infestation, which it is feared will occur later this month. \u201cThese [locusts] are deep yellow, which means that they will be here mostly looking at areas in which they will lay eggs,\u201d he said. According to the FAO\u2019s locust watch monitor, widespread breeding is now underway across the Horn of Africa. Teams planned to mark the place where they lay eggs and then come back to kill the young insects in 14 days, Malo said, since poisoning the eggs in the ground could damage the soil. At least 2,000 locusts have so far crossed the border, he said. During each three-month breeding cycle, a single locust can breed 20 more, giving rise to the massive swarms that are now threatening crops on either side of the Red Sea. Oil-rich South Sudan is recovering from five years of civil war that plunged parts of the country into famine in 2017 and forced a quarter of the population to flee their homes. In December, the UN\u2019s World Food Programme said the food security outlook was dire after floods affected nearly 1 million people, with some 60% of the population facing food insecurity.",

Six weeks before murdering her, while out on licence, Campbell told his probation officer that he felt like \u201cdoing it again\u201d. Strangulation was a factor in 29% of the 2018 femicides, compared with 24.9% between 2009\u201315. At the same time, increasing numbers of defendants are using the \u201crough sex gone wrong\u201d defence and claiming that the victim consented to violent and dangerous sexual practices, resulting in a woman\u2019s accidental death. In eight of the 2018 killings, the perpetrator made this claim. Recently published research found that more than a third of UK women under the age of 40 report having experienced unwanted slapping, choking, gagging or spitting during consensual sex. In five cases, children were killed with their mothers; in 12 other cases, children witnessed the killing. The damage to those children is immeasurable, and yet where is the support for them? We must believe women when they say they fear for their lives. It is up to all of us \u2013 neighbours, friends, family members and teachers \u2013 to look out for signs of domestic abuse and report it. But we also have to recognise that women are not just in danger from partners and ex-partners. Stalking and harassment of women by colleagues and acquaintances can lead to disastrous consequences for the victims, and yet these cases are often badly handled by police and rarely successfully prosecuted. These women die because there is a virtual amnesty on male violence. The conviction rate for rapes is at an all-time low \u2013 just 1.4% of those reported. The women who die as a result of male violence tell us an important story. These dead bodies symbolise the tyranny under which all women, to one degree or another, live. The men responsible for their deaths have committed extreme acts of patriarchal violence, and it is easy for other men to distance themselves from these crimes. But the fact is that so long as any form of male violence and abuse of women and girls is tolerated, the morgues will continue to bear witness to its inevitable and tragic consequence. \u2022 Julie Bindel is a journalist and activist, and the co-founder of Justice for Women",

Mitchell is deep in rehearsal for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/17/the-upstart-crow-review-gielgud-theatre-london\">stage adaptation</a> of Ben Elton\u2019s Shakespearean sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/17/the-upstart-crow-review-gielgud-theatre-london\">The Upstart Crow</a>, in which he plays the lead.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d toyed with the idea of doing a West End show for years,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI was nervous for the first preview, but nerves are partly what makes you get your shit together.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"baa84a50e2920e7534147b3b30984382c56b78d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baa84a50e2920e7534147b3b30984382c56b78d8/9_631_5033_3020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mitchell, second from right, with Rob Rouse, Danielle Phillips, Helen Monks and Gemma Whelan in The Upstart Crow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell, second from right, with Rob Rouse, Danielle Phillips, Helen Monks and Gemma Whelan in The Upstart Crow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mitchell is fiercely protective over comedy as an art form. \u201cIt worries me that if something is an absolutely po-faced, witless plodding through of something awful then it is taken to be acclaimed,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Peep Show, which finished in 2015, was as acclaimed as comedy gets. The rise of its stars has been impressive. Mitchell says the Oscar-winning triumph of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/12/olivia-colman-reveals-love-ultimate-feminist-the-queen-the-crown\">Olivia Colman</a> was no surprise \u2013 he would have put money on her winning an Academy Award back in 1993 when she was performing panto with Mitchell in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/jun/03/cambridge-footlights-comedy-university\">Cambridge Footlights</a>, of which he was president. \u201cShe got every laugh, straight away, first time and every night.\u201d</p> <p>Sounds as if that could have been annoying for him as the co-star. \u201cNo, because I\u2019m sexist enough to think, \u2018She\u2019s a woman so I couldn\u2019t have had her part anyway.\u2019 She just made me look better. It\u2019d be different if it was Robert Webb, of course. I\u2019ve resented every laugh that man has ever had.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell is similarly unsurprised by Peep Show writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/29/succession-comedy-drama-tv-media-barons-jesse-armstrong\">Jesse Armstrong</a>\u2019s success with the HBO satire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/19/best-tv-shows-2019-no-1-succession\">Succession</a>. Even if, watching it, he couldn\u2019t help but sense how their worlds had diverged. \u201cOn Peep Show, we had just about enough money to make a programme where people sat in rooms and had conversations. If there was a scene in a car, we\u2019d have to make sure it was stationary. So going from that to watching a fleet of helicopters flying across Manhattan \u2026 when they could have just had them walk into a meeting room and say, \u2018We\u2019ve just got off the helicopter\u2019 instead!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57a28d865f54cf0ab6134153d3a7abb3d29da215\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57a28d865f54cf0ab6134153d3a7abb3d29da215/0_109_3126_1876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Webb and Mitchell in 2005, two years into Peep Show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve resented every laugh he\u2019s had\u2019 \u2026 Robert Webb and Mitchell in 2005, two years into Peep Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In its skewering of the super-rich, Greed shares similarities with Succession. And when Mitchell starts ranting about capitalism he sounds remarkably irate. \u201cPeople probably don\u2019t realise how boldly unfair it is,\u201d he begins. \u201cThe film is based on what a lot of real-life men have done, which is get rich entirely without societal benefit. With capitalism, for all its flaws, the idea is that the wealth creators with cigars and top hats might have been terribly brutal and unfair, but at least they started factories, they made steel. Now it\u2019s just stripping companies\u2019 assets and leaving them for dead. It\u2019s the equivalent societal benefit if they only fiddled the numbers on a computer to put an extra four noughts in their account!\u201d</p> <p>The film\u2019s end credits were originally due to name and shame certain individuals and companies, but Sony got cold feet. (It now reveals statistics about inequality, but in a more general way.) \u201cIt\u2019s a depressing way for a large organisation to behave,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd what good has it done? Now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/07/the-muzzling-of-michael-winterbottom-how-sony-censored-greed\">the story is that it was censored</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell <em>tried </em>to enjoy filming Greed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/30/superyachts-and-bad-art-how-mykonos-became-the-party-island-of-the-super-rich\">Mykonos</a> \u2013 but he kept thinking about his wife and child, and then he started cursing himself for wanting to go home. He is married to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/dec/22/on-my-radar-victoria-coren-mitchell-cultural-highlights\">Victoria Coren Mitchell</a>, host of the brainiac quiz show Only Connect. The story of their relationship is often recounted in articles \u2013 they were briefly together, then they split and he pined for her for several years until eventually they made a go of it. Whenever Mitchell speaks about Victoria he sounds as if he can\u2019t believe his luck that he married her.</p> <p>\u201cI do read [the pieces] and think \u2026 is this going to induce vomit?\u201d he admits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5349f9ac9319d8e3335773617f017ae1f31a7ee6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5349f9ac9319d8e3335773617f017ae1f31a7ee6/385_107_2117_2646/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mitchell and Victoria Coren Mitchell at an after-party for The Upstart Crow.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell and Victoria Coren Mitchell at an after-party for The Upstart Crow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He thinks the success of their relationship could be down to the fact she\u2019s a professional poker player: \u201cIt helps because I\u2019ve not got into the habit of telling even small lies.\u201d Often \u2013 and perhaps rather weirdly \u2013 they like to sit on the sofa watching each other\u2019s shows. But he says watching Would I Lie to You, in which opponents guess whether or not the panel members\u2019 stories are truthful, is a very frustrating experience because she says \u201cThat\u2019s the lie\u201d immediately. \u201cShe\u2019s occasionally wrong, but only one in 20 times.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s something sweet about the way Mitchell talks about their relationship and maybe that\u2019s because he\u2019s so hard to untangle from Corrigan \u2013 his contentment is a kind of happy ending to Peep Show.</p> <p>These days, Mitchell\u2019s life revolves around his daughter Barbara, too. (\u201cA proper solid name for people who make their way, not a made up new thing,\u201d he says with classic Corrigan fogey-ness.) Mitchell loves fatherhood, but it wasn\u2019t always plain sailing. \u201cWhen she was a very small baby I found it frightening and weird,\u201d he says. \u201cI always felt that there should have been a responsible adult around, and realising that person was me was very against my nature.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe, he says, this has something to do with being a performer. \u201cBecause you get treated like a child.

Mitchell is deep in rehearsal for the stage adaptation of Ben Elton\u2019s Shakespearean sitcom The Upstart Crow, in which he plays the lead. \u201cI\u2019d toyed with the idea of doing a West End show for years,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI was nervous for the first preview, but nerves are partly what makes you get your shit together.\u201d Mitchell is fiercely protective over comedy as an art form. \u201cIt worries me that if something is an absolutely po-faced, witless plodding through of something awful then it is taken to be acclaimed,\u201d he says. Peep Show, which finished in 2015, was as acclaimed as comedy gets. The rise of its stars has been impressive. Mitchell says the Oscar-winning triumph of Olivia Colman was no surprise \u2013 he would have put money on her winning an Academy Award back in 1993 when she was performing panto with Mitchell in the Cambridge Footlights, of which he was president. \u201cShe got every laugh, straight away, first time and every night.\u201d Sounds as if that could have been annoying for him as the co-star. \u201cNo, because I\u2019m sexist enough to think, \u2018She\u2019s a woman so I couldn\u2019t have had her part anyway.\u2019 She just made me look better. It\u2019d be different if it was Robert Webb, of course. I\u2019ve resented every laugh that man has ever had.\u201d Mitchell is similarly unsurprised by Peep Show writer Jesse Armstrong\u2019s success with the HBO satire Succession. Even if, watching it, he couldn\u2019t help but sense how their worlds had diverged. \u201cOn Peep Show, we had just about enough money to make a programme where people sat in rooms and had conversations. If there was a scene in a car, we\u2019d have to make sure it was stationary. So going from that to watching a fleet of helicopters flying across Manhattan \u2026 when they could have just had them walk into a meeting room and say, \u2018We\u2019ve just got off the helicopter\u2019 instead!\u201d In its skewering of the super-rich, Greed shares similarities with Succession. And when Mitchell starts ranting about capitalism he sounds remarkably irate. \u201cPeople probably don\u2019t realise how boldly unfair it is,\u201d he begins. \u201cThe film is based on what a lot of real-life men have done, which is get rich entirely without societal benefit. With capitalism, for all its flaws, the idea is that the wealth creators with cigars and top hats might have been terribly brutal and unfair, but at least they started factories, they made steel. Now it\u2019s just stripping companies\u2019 assets and leaving them for dead. It\u2019s the equivalent societal benefit if they only fiddled the numbers on a computer to put an extra four noughts in their account!\u201d The film\u2019s end credits were originally due to name and shame certain individuals and companies, but Sony got cold feet. (It now reveals statistics about inequality, but in a more general way.) \u201cIt\u2019s a depressing way for a large organisation to behave,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd what good has it done? Now the story is that it was censored.\u201d Mitchell tried to enjoy filming Greed in Mykonos \u2013 but he kept thinking about his wife and child, and then he started cursing himself for wanting to go home. He is married to Victoria Coren Mitchell, host of the brainiac quiz show Only Connect. The story of their relationship is often recounted in articles \u2013 they were briefly together, then they split and he pined for her for several years until eventually they made a go of it. Whenever Mitchell speaks about Victoria he sounds as if he can\u2019t believe his luck that he married her. \u201cI do read [the pieces] and think \u2026 is this going to induce vomit?\u201d he admits. He thinks the success of their relationship could be down to the fact she\u2019s a professional poker player: \u201cIt helps because I\u2019ve not got into the habit of telling even small lies.\u201d Often \u2013 and perhaps rather weirdly \u2013 they like to sit on the sofa watching each other\u2019s shows. But he says watching Would I Lie to You, in which opponents guess whether or not the panel members\u2019 stories are truthful, is a very frustrating experience because she says \u201cThat\u2019s the lie\u201d immediately. \u201cShe\u2019s occasionally wrong, but only one in 20 times.\u201d There\u2019s something sweet about the way Mitchell talks about their relationship and maybe that\u2019s because he\u2019s so hard to untangle from Corrigan \u2013 his contentment is a kind of happy ending to Peep Show. These days, Mitchell\u2019s life revolves around his daughter Barbara, too. (\u201cA proper solid name for people who make their way, not a made up new thing,\u201d he says with classic Corrigan fogey-ness.) Mitchell loves fatherhood, but it wasn\u2019t always plain sailing. \u201cWhen she was a very small baby I found it frightening and weird,\u201d he says. \u201cI always felt that there should have been a responsible adult around, and realising that person was me was very against my nature.\u201d Maybe, he says, this has something to do with being a performer. \u201cBecause you get treated like a child. If you\u2019re making a TV show, they don\u2019t leave you to do anything for yourself \u2026 and I have a weakness for that.\u201d Mitchell still doesn\u2019t seem like much of a self-starter. He seizes the opportunities that come his way, but has zero desire to expand or progress. He seems to be that rare species of celebrity \u2013 happy at home, fulfilled at work, and with no vaulting ambition to upset the apple cart. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to move to Hollywood,\u201d he says, and we both laugh at the very idea of it. Greed is out on Friday. The Upstart Crow is at the Gielgud theatre, London, until 25 April.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Here\u2019s how the night played out: Elizabeth Warren made a strong showing, criticizing rivals with well-prepared remarks. Her campaign reported record fundraising during the debate. Facing his opponents for the first time on the debate stage, Mike Bloomberg found himself fending off attacks from every angle. The candidates questioned his record on race and policing, as well allegations that he encouraged a hostile work environment for women. Bernie Sanders, who is leading in polls, cruised through. He briefly faced criticism over his supporters\u2019 online attacks and said he disapproved of such behavior and disowned those who acted inappropriately. Moderates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar were at each other\u2019s throats vyying to lead the middle lane. Joe Biden generally failed to breakthrough. Who won the debate? The Guardian\u2019s opinion writers weigh in: Opinion: Bloomberg came under fire, and flopped Nathan Robinson says Mike Bloomberg was \u201cill-prepared, uncharismatic, and unlikable\u201d. The other candidates ran rings around him. Elizabeth Warren sank her teeth in early, interrupting Bloomberg\u2019s opening statement to point out how his long history of sexist comments about women made him a lot like Donald Trump. Warren landed even more brutal blows later in the debate, when she challenged Bloomberg to release women from the non-disclosure agreements his company had forced them to sign in sexual harassment lawsuits. Bloomberg mumbled some lame excuse about how the agreements were consensual, but was clearly caught off-guard, and Warren wouldn\u2019t let the issue go. Bloomberg looked feeble, and after the debate some Democratic bigwigs were already reportedly concluding that \u201cBloomberg isn\u2019t the answer.\u201d Read the full comment piece here: Opinion: Bernie Sanders is cruising towards the Democratic nomination. But can he win? Reflecting on tonight\u2019s debate, Richard Wolffe says, \u201cWe have officially reached the Hunger Games stage of this Democratic primary season.\u201d There\u2019s a reason why the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday turned into such an epic Donnybrook. It\u2019s called the primary calendar, which is inexorably counting down to the Super Tuesday contests in less than two weeks. At that point, one of the candidates on stage will emerge with a delegate lead that puts an end to all the quadrennial talk of a brokered convention. At this point, that candidate looks like Bernie Sanders. In the meantime, his five rivals on the debate stage have engaged in an entirely delusional sideshow of mutual annihilation. Read the full comment piece here: There were lots of disagreements on Wednesday\u2019s debate stage in Las Vegas, but one thing that everyone seems to agree on is that the debate marked the most intense and combative one of the primary cycle. Bloomberg went after Sanders, Buttigieg went after Klobuchar, and Warren pretty much went after everyone. Here\u2019s our early analysis ... Bloomberg under attack from the outset Bloomberg\u2019s rivals challenged the former New York Mayor from the outset, critiquing his legacy on stop-and-frisk, reports of past sexist remarks, and the non-disclosure agreements several women at his company have signed while settling lawsuits. \u201cDemocrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another,\u201d Warren said, comparing Bloomberg to Donald Trump. Warren made a fiery comeback Having posted disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire, Warren needed a strong performance. She came out swinging, criticizing her rivals with well prepared remarks. Here\u2019s how she ripped through the healthcare plans of her rivals earlier in tonight\u2019s debate: She also landed one of the punchiest attacks on Bloomberg, bringing the attention to his history of derogatory remarks about women: Pete and Amy appeared out to destroy each other Both midwestern candidates are competing in a crowded central lane, and tore each other down near the end of the debate. \u201cYou memorized a bunch of talking points,\u201d Klobuchar said, telling the former mayor he has not been \u201cin the arena\u201d. Buttigieg responded: \u201cI\u2019m used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important. You don\u2019t have to be in Washington to matter.\u201d Earlier in the evening, Buttigieg had criticized Klobuchar, for forgetting the name of the president of Mexico, she responded: \u201cAre you trying to say that I\u2019m dumb? Are you mocking me here, Pete?\u201d And Bernie once again sailed through Amid the attacks on Bloomberg and the rivalry between Buttigieg and Klobuchar, Sanders faced relatively little scrutiny. What a debate that was. Here\u2019s how people have been responding to it online, with the battles between the candidates drawing particular attention (and in some cases delight): While Warren went in on Bloomberg, whose policies and record stand in sharp contrast to hers, she didn\u2019t take on front-runner Bernie Sanders as much. Her surrogates brushed off questions as to why. \u201cIt\u2019s about showing who can bring together that coalition,\u201d said Allison Stephens, a DNC committeewoman from Nevada. Warren can bring \u201cpeople who look like me and people who look like Nevada together,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cAnd I happen to be a millennial of color.\u201d Though Sanders currently had the most support from young people and people of color, Stevens said Warren has shown she has the \u201cfighting spirit\u201d required to beat Donald Trump in the general election. Here are the final tallies for each candidate\u2019s speaking time tonight, with Elizabeth Warren coming out top, followed closely by Amy Klobuchar: Castro \u2014 the who has been a surrogate for Elizabeth Warren \u2014 said the Massachusetts senator had \u201cwon the debate, hands down.\u201d \u201cShe showed why she\u2019s the best person to take on Donald Trump,\u201d Castro said, emphasizing Warren\u2019s sparring with Mike Bloomberg. Bloomberg \u201cwas completely exposed and it was obvious the whole night,\u201d Castro said. Democrats\u2019 closing statements were marked by a dramatic intervention, when protesters erupted in the middle of Joe Biden\u2019s final remarks. Looks like those protesters were immigrant rights activists, who lamented the lack of discussion around immigration during the debate. Here\u2019s video of the moment. The immigrant rights group Raices claimed responsibility for the protest afterwards. Should billionaires exist? This is a question the candidates have been made to grapple with tonight. While Bernie Sanders, whose tweet last year inspired the question, is firmly on the side of getting rid of billionaires, he\u2019s the only one onstage who supports the idea. But not all viewers are so against it: The debate is wrapping up, and candidates are making their closing arguments. As Amy Klobuchar put it, \u201cThis has been quite a debate.\u201d Klobuchar: \u201cI wish everyone was as perfect as you\u201d. Defending her record, she said to Buttigieg, \u201cYou\u2019ve memorized a bunch of talking points, and a bunch of things,\u201d after listing off immigration reform legislation she\u2019s worked on as senator. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much love lost between the two moderate contenders tonight. United We Dream, which advocates for immigrant rights, weighed in: Pete Buttigieg is once again trying to sell himself as the best middle ground. \u201cMayor Bloomberg thinks he can buy this election, he said. Senator Sanders wants to burn the house down.\u201d He\u2019s going after fellow moderate Amy Klobuchar on her record on immigration, breaking into a bit of Spanish. Elizabeth Warren is coming out swinging against her opponents \u2013 having name-checked nearly all of them as she criticizes their campaign tactics and healthcare plans. Warren used her first answer to call out Mike Bloomberg for reportedly making sexist comments and using his personal fortune to bankroll his campaign, and she later criticized Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Bernie Sanders for their healthcare plans. Warren has seen her polling numbers slump in recent weeks, and her allies have complained that the media has covered her campaign unfairly since her third-place finish in Iowa. Klobuchar was able to turn in a much-better-than-expected showing in New Hampshire after a widely praised (and combative) debate performance earlier this month, and Warren may be hoping to replicate that success tonight. Buttigieg failed to address the substance of the question that referenced his award-winning high school essay: Why does he lag in support among young people. While Buttigieg has drawn in many older, white supporters, Sanders has by far won over young people. Polls show Trump joins in attacks on Bloomberg The president is apparently keeping tabs on the debate tonight, even as he stands at a podium in Arizona, where he\u2019s in the middle of a rally. \u201cNow they have a new member of the crew, Mini Mike,\u201d Trump said, referencing the former New York mayor\u2019s 5ft8in stature. \u201cNo boxes, we call him no boxes.\u201d \u201cI hear he\u2019s getting pounded tonight. I hear they\u2019re pounding him,\u201d he added, accusing Bloomberg of \u201cbuying\u201d his candidacy. The two wealthy New Yorkers have been trading barbs for the past week, with the president calling the former mayor a \u201closer\u201d and Bloomberg describing the president as a \u201cbarking clown\u201d. Candidates have aggressively targeted Bloomberg since the debate\u2019s opening, keeping the spotlight on his stop and frisk policy as well as his history of misogynistic insults. Warren hit Bloomberg with a particularly cutting remark when she said: \u201cDemocrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s put forward somebody who is actually a Democrat,\u201d said Buttigieg. \u201cI was into Bernie before it was cool,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg, responding to a question about his past admiration of the Vermont senator and his policies. Buttigieg won an award for an essay about Sanders that he wrote while in high school. But the camaraderie was short-lived. Sanders and Buttigieg quarreled whether the country is better off with revolutionary change, or moderation. In case you missed it, here\u2019s the tense moment Amy Klobuchar asked Pete Buttigieg if he was calling her \u201cdumb\u201d, after he attacked her for not knowing the name of the Mexican president during an interview: Sanders retorted that Bloomberg\u2019s brandishing of the communism descriptor was \u201ca cheap shot.\u201d In his zone, railing against the 1%, Sanders said: \u201cWe have socialism for the very rich, rugged individualism for the poor.\u201d Bloomberg hit back, \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, we\u2019re not going to throw out capitalism.\u201d He jabbed Sanders on the fact that the Vermont senator has three homes and recently became a millionaire himself. Moderator Chuck Todd asked, \u201cMayor Bloomberg, should you exist?\u201d \u201cShould you have earned that much money?\u201d Multibillionaire Bloomberg, of course, responded: \u201cYes,\u201d adding that he was \u201cgiving it away\u201d to make the country better. Contrasting himself with progressive Sanders and Warren, who endorse much higher taxes on the ultra-rich, Bloomberg said the country doesn\u2019t need \u201ccommunism\u201d. Now Bloomberg is addressing his previous comments that scapegoated the end of racist redlining practices for the financial crisis. Redlining \u201cis practiced everywhere and we have to cut it out\u201d, he said, once again brushing away his past comments and policies. Here\u2019s how long each candidate has spoken so far tonight, according to the New York Times\u2019 live tracker. It\u2019s worth pointing out that Elizabeth Warren came in fifth at the end of the last debate. And according to Twitter\u2019s Nick Pacilio, these are the most tweeted about candidates so far: Elizabeth Warren, who just chimed in with a reminder that she\u2019s got plans to promote environmental justice, is seeing a surge in fundraising, according to her campaign. During the debate, Warren\u2019s campaign had the best hour of fundraising to date. My colleague Oliver Milman makes a thoughtful point: Why are questions about climate change during the Democratic debates so often framed in the economic context? This was the memorable moment Elizabeth Warren went after Mike Bloomberg\u2019s record on women after the businessmen tried to tout his accomplishments. It drew a strong reaction from the billionaire: The fight over Nevada\u2019s culinary union Nevada\u2019s powerful culinary union took center stage earlier in the evening when candidates attacked Sanders over the union\u2019s criticism of his healthcare plan and reports that Sanders supporters harassed union officials as a result. Here\u2019s some background context from my colleague Mario Koran \u2026 The powerful hospitality workers union in Nevada, which has declined to endorse a candidate head of the caucuses, recently circulated a flier criticizing Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal. The flier claimed Sanders would \u201cend Culinary Healthcare\u201d and \u201crequire Medicare for All\u201d if elected president. The flyer took a comparably favorable view of the position taken by Sen Elizabeth Warren, who supports Medicare for all after a transition period. According to the Nevada Independent, officials from the Culinary Union received threatening messages on via phone, email and Twitter from Sanders\u2019 supporters angry about the flyer. On Tuesday, Sanders condemned supporters who make \u201cvicious attacks\u201d on others, highlighting his support from labor unions. \u201cI am the strongest, perhaps lifetime, supporter of unions in the United States Congress. The idea that anybody who works with me would make a vicious attack against a union leader, just because we disagree on an issue, is incomprehensible to me,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd you know what? I\u2019m just not sure that that\u2019s true.\u201d And we\u2019re back... We\u2019re now talking about climate change. \u201cI believe in science,\u201d Warren said, launching into a defense of her ambitious proposals to combat global heating. Sanders noted: \u201cThis is an existential threat... this is a moral issue.\u201d All the candidates tend to agree that climate change is a priority, though Warren and Sanders have the most progressive proposals. Taking a short break. This has been a lively one. Warren had another strong moment taking on Bloomberg over nondisclosure agreements women have signed at his company, saying: \u201cYou could release them from that immediately.\u201d \u201cThey signed those agreements, and we\u2019ll live with it,\u201d Bloomberg responded. When Bloomberg tried to suggest that it was a mutual \u201cconsensual\u201d agreement of silence that both sides wanted, Warren responded: \u201cIf they wish to speak out and tell their side of their story, that\u2019s ok with you? You\u2019re releasing them on television tonight?\u201d The exchange ended with Bloomberg refusing to say he would release women from nondisclosure agreements and some in the audience booing. Bloomberg at one point also defended his record on women, saying, \u201cIn my company, lots and lots of women have big responsibilities. They get paid the same as men.\u201d Warren responded: \u201cI hope you heard what his defense was, I\u2019ve been nice to some women.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, who forgot the name of Mexico\u2019s president in an interview with Univision, said it was a momentary lapse. When Buttigieg pushed back, she responded: \u201cAre you calling me dumb? Are you mocking me?\u201d Buttigieg was the one candidate who correctly named Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in the interview; Klobuchar and Tom Steyer (who is not on stage tonight) couldn\u2019t remember. Mayor Pete\u2019s campaign has been promoting the interview in campaig emails to supporters. One thing that everyone seems to agree on tonight is that this debate is the most intense, combative one yet. Bloomberg has gone after Sanders, Biden has gone after Bloomberg, and Warren has pretty much gone after everyone. Here\u2019s how viewers have been responding to the rumble happening on stage: Warren is drilling down on Bloomberg, and the fact that he won\u2019t release women from confidentiality agreements they signed relating to allegations of a hostile work environment at his company. She drew more parallels between Bloomberg and Donald Trump, who has brushed off a litany of sexual harassment accusations. Now Bloomberg is addressing his part comments on women, and allegations that he fostered a sexist work environment at his company Bloomberg LP. Bloomberg had a testy response. He said he takes the Me Too movement seriously and when someone makes sexist or discriminatory comments at his company, \u201cwe investigate it. And if it\u2019s inappropriate, they\u2019re gone that day,\u201d he said. Elizabeth Warren is pursuing a very new strategy tonight: attack everyone in sight. Here\u2019s how she ripped through the healthcare plans of her rivals earlier in tonight\u2019s debate: Echoing Donald Trump\u2019s excuses for not releasing his tax returns, Mike Bloomberg said it \u201ctakes time\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t go to Turbo Tax,\u201d he said. The multibillionaire has said he will release his returns \u201cin a few weeks\u201d. \u201cTransparency matters, especially in the Trump era,\u201d Pete Buttigieg said, referring to Bernie Sanders\u2019 reluctance to release detailed health records. Buttigieg, 38, said he\u2019s happy to get a physical and release the results \u2014 drawing chuckles and groans from the crowd. Sanders pivoted back to his healthcare plan, contrasting his Medicare for All proposal with Pete Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare for those who want it\u201d which Sanders described as \u201cstatus quo\u201d. Bloomberg is stumbling in his response to stop and frisk, even though he surely rehearsed for this moment. He said he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by it: \u201cI\u2019ve apologized. I\u2019ve asked for forgiveness. We stopped too many people.\u201d He claimed that he introduced stop and frisk to fight homicides in New York City, saying: \u201cI thought my first responsibility was to give people the right to live.\u201d \u201cIt got out of control.\u201d Bloomberg also said, \u201cI discovered we were doing too many stop and frisks.\u201d In reality, a court ordered the city to stop the policy, deeming it unconstitutional. Warren got applause for her response, noting the harm stop and frisk caused with communities of color, adding: \u201cYou need a different apology.\u201d Bloomberg addressed his stop-and-frisk policy: \u201cI thought my first responsibility was to give people the right to live,\u201d he said, but \u201cit got out of control\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve sat, I\u2019ve apologized, I\u2019ve asked for forgiveness,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cWe stopped too many people.\u201d He added: \u201cIf we took everybody that was wrong\u201d on criminal justice, \u201cthere would be nobody up here.\u201d That explanation wasn\u2019t enough for Warren, who once again leaped in. \u201cThis really is about leadership and accountability,\u201d she said. The policy was racist in its conception, she added. \u201cIt targeted communities of color; it targeted black and brown men from the beginning.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s first jab: \u201cLet me finish,\u201d he said as Biden tried to cut in as the former New York mayor criticized the hallmark healthcare legislation of the Obama/Biden administration. Overall, Bloomberg has been less fiery than his opponents. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s very on-brand response to Warren: \u201cPost-it notes were invented in my state\u201d. Warren\u2019s critique of her moderate rival is relentless. \u201cAmy, I\u2019ve seen your plan\u201d she said, describing it as \u201ctwo paragraphs\u201d. \u201cFamilies are suffering. You can\u2019t simply stand here and trash an idea to give healthcare coverage to everyone without having a realistic plan of your own,\u201d Warren said. This is a very nasty and negative start to the debate. Within 15 minutes, all of the candidates have aggressively targeted Bloomberg with well-delivered, rehearsed attacks on the former New York City mayor over stop and frisk and his history of misogynistic insults. Warren started with the strongest attack on Bloomberg, listing his past insults against women and noting she was not talking about Trump: \u201cDemocrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s first line was a dual attack on both Sanders and Bloomberg, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s put forward somebody who is actually a Democrat.\u201d So far, very little discussion of policy. Bloomberg has presented himself as the best candidate to take on Trump, but has largely not directly responded to the attacks and not addressed his past remarks on women. Elizabeth Warren, whose voice is hoarse as she is fighting off a cold, is coming across stong. She attacked her opponents\u2019 healthcare plans. Buttigieg\u2019s plan is a mere \u201cPowerPoint\u201d she said. \u201cAmy\u2019s plan is even less; it\u2019s a post-it note.\u201d And while Sanders\u2019 plan is \u201cgood start\u201d, but \u201chis campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question\u201d about it she said. \u201cHis own advisors say \u2018Eh, probably won\u2019t happen anyway.\u2019\u201d This is a very nasty and negative start to the debate. Within 15 minutes, all of the candidates have aggressively targeted Bloomberg with well-delivered, rehearsed attacks on the former New York City mayor over stop and frisk and his history of misogynistic insults. Warren started with the strongest attack on Bloomberg, listing his past insults against women and noting she was not talking about Trump: \u201cDemocrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s first line was a dual attack on both Sanders and Bloomberg, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s put forward somebody who is actually a Democrat.\u201d So far, very little discussion of policy. Bloomberg has presented himself as the best candidate to take on Trump, but has largely not directly responded to the attacks and not addressed his past remarks on women. Amy Klobuchar said she has an idea for how to stop sexism on the Internet: \u201cElect a woman\u201d. Bernie Sanders said he disowns his supporters\u2019 online attacks on those who disagree with the Vermont senator\u2019s candidacy and platforms. \u201cIf there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people \u2013 they are not part of my campaign,\u201d he said. He also said that some of the hateful comments aimed at union leaders in Nevada could have come from trolls and bots, rather than his campaign. The $60bn elephant in the room has been immediately addressed tonight, with every candidate using their first answers to go after the extremely wealthy Mike Bloomberg. Elizabeth Warren had the punchiest line of attack, bringing attention to Bloomberg\u2019s history of derogatory remarks about women: Already the debate is far livelier, and more contentious than some of the previous ones. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for the working class\u201d to have a say in government, Sanders jabbed at Buttigieg, \u201crather than your billionaire campaign contributors.\u201d Buttigieg hit back by pointing out that the powerful Culinary Union, which represents hospitality workers in Las Vegas, has taken issue with Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan. \u201cMayor Bloomberg, there\u2019s a lot for you to respond to,\u201d NBC\u2019s Lester Holt said, as the multibillionaire candidates\u2019 rivals \u2013 as expected \u2013 pounced on him. \u201cHe has not managed his city very, very well,\u201d Joe Biden weighed in, adding that with his stop and frisk policy, Bloomberg was \u201cthrowing up to 5 million black men up against the wall\u201d. Pete Buttigieg piled on: \u201cLet\u2019s elect someone who is actually a Democrat.\u201d Mike Bloomberg responded that if Sanders is the candidate, \u201cwe will have Donald Trump for the next four years\u201d. Elizabeth Warren cut in that there\u2019s one candidate who has referred to women as \u201cfat broads\u201d. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not talking about Donald Trump, I\u2019m talking about Mayor Bloomberg,\u201d she said. \u201cDemocrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\u201d The first question goes to Bernie Sanders: Bloomberg is pitching himself as a centrist; why is your revolution a better bet. Sanders\u2019 response immediately called out Bloomberg\u2019s stop-and-frisk policy. His campaign brings in people of color, and \u201cworks for all of us and not just the billionaire class\u201d, Sanders said. The six Democratic candidates participating on the debate tonight have taken their positions on stage, and the debate is about to begin. Trump wraps a multi-day trip to California Donald Trump is wrapping up a multi-day visit to California, where he\u2019s renewed his attack on the state\u2019s homelessness crisis and other pressing concerns in an effort to shame the Democratic leaders of the Golden State\u2019s biggest cities, my colleague Mario Koran writes from San Francisco. It is the president\u2019s fourth trip to California. On Tuesday, Trump met with organizers for the 2028 Olympic Games before heading to a fundraiser in Beverly Hills. During the stop, Trump took aim at Los Angeles officials, claiming they were working to shield undocumented immigrants by refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement agents to apprehend those in the country without authorization. In the last week, the Trump administration has ratcheted up the pressure on so-called sanctuary cities \u2013 where local law enforcement doesn\u2019t cooperate with Ice to apprehend people \u2013 by sending elite border patrol Swat teams to supplement immigration enforcement agents already on the ground. On Friday the Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, along with the LAPD chief, Michel Moore, released a video in which they promised to shield those in the city. \u201cRegardless of your immigration status, I want every Angeleno to know your city is on your side. Here in Los Angeles, our police department does not coordinate with ICE or participate in immigration enforcement,\u201d Garcetti said on Twitter. On Wednesday Trump was scheduled to attend a fundraiser hosted by Larry Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, a plan that drew fire from the tech company\u2019s employees who said in a statement that the president doesn\u2019t \u201caffirm Oracle\u2019s core values of diversity, inclusiveness, and ethical business conduct\u201d. Then later Wednesday it was on to the Central Valley, California\u2019s agricultural center, where Trump planned to join the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and \u201cto speak with hard working farmers in the Central Valley about efforts to dramatically improve the supply and delivery of water in California and other Western states\u201d, according to a White House statement. Trump is slated to head to Phoenix for an evening campaign stop before heading east for rallies in Colorado Springs and Las Vegas. Mike Bloomberg is about to face his Democratic rivals for the first time Minutes before the debate begins, Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaig aired ad on MSNBC. After spending more than $300m of his own fortune on huge ad buys, Bloomberg\u2019s name recognition and support have soared. But so far, he has avoided any direct confrontations with his opponents, having skipped the early primary states. Because the Democratic National Committee changed its rules to remove a public fundraising requirement to participate in the debates, Bloomberg will finally get to join his fellow contenders for the Democratic nomination on the debate stage in Las Vegas. In the run-up to the debate, his rivals have attacked Bloomberg\u2019s record on race and policing, even as the multibillionaire former mayor\u2019s past policies and comments have come back to haunt him. He has had to once again address allegations from former employees that he routinely made sexist comments at work. A newly resurfaced PBS interview from 2011 shows Bloomberg describing an \u201cenormous cohort of black and Latino males\u201d who \u201cdon\u2019t know how to behave in the workplace\u201d, and resurfaced video from 2019 showed him saying that trans rights were about \u201csome guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter\u201d. Amid the barrage of negative news coverage, Bloomberg\u2019s competitors have said they\u2019ll relish the chance to take him on tonight. On Tuesday, Bernie Sanders said Bloomberg\u2019s campaign was an example of \u201coligarchy, not democracy\u201d. Previewing the debate, Elizabeth Warren said, in a tweet: \u201cAt least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on Donald Trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire.\u201d Meanwhile, Bloomberg has largely avoided discussing his Democratic rivals, and his campaign has focused on how he can defeat Donald Trump in a general election. For the first time, he\u2019ll have to respond directly to his competitors\u2019 concerns. More dispatches from the lobby: Harry Reid, a former senator from Nevada who served as the Senate Majority leader from 2007 to 2015, said Nevada should be the first state to vote, because of its diversity and because of the state\u2019s strong record of electing women. \u201cWomen have empowered us,\u201d said Reid, who is in the audience of the debate. Can Pete Buttigieg broaden his appeal? I reported from California last week on whether Pete Buttigieg could capitalize on his strong early primary performance as he heads to Nevada, a diverse state that many see as more representative of the Democratic party today than earlier-voting states. The 38-year-old former mayor of a midsize midwestern city won the most delegates in Iowa, and the second-most votes in New Hampshire \u2013 both predominantly white states. Now, his campaign is scrambling to win over the diverse electorates in three forthcoming primary states: Nevada, South Carolina and California. So far, Buttigieg has struggled to earn the backing of voters of color. Only 4% of black Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters supported Buttigieg in a Quinnipiac poll published on Monday. By contrast, 27% of black voters supported the former vice-president Joe Biden. Buttigieg is also polling in the low single digits among Latinos, who make up 19% of likely voters in California \u2013 with Asian Americans making up another 13%. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor has acknowledged his struggle to court communities of color but says he\u2019s confident the momentum he\u2019s gained in Iowa and New Hampshire will win them over. So far, Buttigieg has spent much of his time in California connecting with wealthy donors in Silicon Valley and Hollywood. His courting of millionaires and billionaires, and in particular his lavish Napa wine cave fundraiser, have drawn sneers from some of his progressive competitors. Now his campaign is reaching for more diverse crowds. Ahead of next week\u2019s caucuses in Nevada, he\u2019s on a whirlwind tour of the west, with Friday stops in San Francisco and Palo Alto, as well as Turlock, a Central Valley town where he is helping raise money to boost down-ballot Democrats. This week his campaign also launched an ad in Nevada that features the polyglot Buttigieg pitching himself in Spanish as \u201cthe president who will turn the page and unify our very polarized country\u201d. His moderate appeal is what attracted Eileen Ikeda. \u201cI\u2019m looking for some who\u2019s not extremely left or right,\u201d she said at the Friday town hall. \u201cThat\u2019s why he appeals to so many older people \u2013 our generation is that way.\u201d But Ikeda, 70, said she does worry about his lack of support among minorities and young people: \u201cHe needs to maybe put more effort and address them more.\u201d Read the full story here. Bernie Sanders is leading in polls with 31% support nationally, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Mike Bloomberg is in second place, with 19% support \u2013 which allowed him to qualify for today\u2019s debate. Joe Biden comes in third, with 15% \u2013 down nine points since December \u2013 and Elizabeth Warren was fourth, with 12% support. Amy Klobuchar \u2013 who made a strong showing in New Hampshire and in the previous Democratic debate \u2013 has gained a few points since the poll was last conducted, in December. She placed fourth with 9% support, followed by Pete Buttigieg with 8%. However, Buttigieg currently has the most delegates of the pack \u2013 one more than Sanders \u2013 following his narrow advantage in Iowa. Inside the busy lobby of the Paris Theater in Las Vegas, there is a wide range of Nevada voters trying to get seats for the final debate before the state\u2019s Saturday caucus. I didn\u2019t find any Mike Bloomberg supporters in line, but there were a fair number of Elizabeth Warren supporters \u2013 and even a small group of Andrew Yang fans, despite his recent decision to suspended his campaign: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get people to vote for him to show there\u2019s support for his ideas,\u201d said Hannah Won, 37-year-old arts advocate and Yang voter who is a supporter of his signature universal basic income proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s larger than him. It\u2019s about his movement. It was kind of inevitable [that he would drop out], but I was hoping for another week. We mourned for a bit. But this isn\u2019t over. He\u2019s gone, but his movement is still alive.\u201d \u201cThis is the biggest election of our life time,\u201d said Linda Gannon, a 49-year-old Vegas resident who showed up to the debate hoping to get a seat to see Buttigieg, her top choice. \u201cI\u2019m a bit worried about him in Nevada, but I think he\u2019s got a shot. I feel confident any of the Democrats can beat Trump. We have to feel that way, and I will support any of them.\u201d Jocelyn Torres, 30, said she was a Warren fan and that she thinks the senator can do well on Saturday: \u201cHer plans are progressive and doable. I think we can have big ideas, but if we can\u2019t get them done, they are just ideas.\u201d Lorraine Oliver, a 68-year-old public health nurse in line to get into the debate, said she recently got a chance to meet Warren in person and was sold: \u201cShe has such in-depth knowledge. But she\u2019s not polling as well as I\u2019d like. I need her to shoot up in the polls.\u201d Not long after the Democrats looking to unseat him take to the debate stage, Donald Trump is expected to speak at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona. The Arizona rally is the first of three rallies Trump has scheduled in three Western states. He\u2019ll head to Colorado on Thursday and then Nevada on Friday, providing counterprogramming to the upcoming Democratic caucus in the latter. Earlier today, the president was in California, where he spoke about the construction of the southern border wall and access to water for farming. He also took an opportunity to jab his Democratic rivals. \u201cMini Mike hates the farm. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be the candidate anyway. Have to start working on Crazy Bernie pretty soon,\u201d Trump said. The bellwether caucus The caucus format of the \u201cfirst in the west\u201d vote tends to favor the campaign with the strongest ground support, reports Dan Hernandez from Las Vegas. Nevadans who don\u2019t vote early have to arrive at designated caucus precincts by 12pm to stand in their preferred candidate\u2019s corner. Loyalty, in the raucous scene, can be tested. And tensions developed during debates and through paid and unpaid media may be on display. Nevadans working on the Las Vegas Strip who want to vote will be able to step away from their card tables, beverage stations, kitchens and housekeeping carts and join fellow staff in ballrooms reserved to caucus inside the MGM Grand, Bellagio, Wynn and other resorts. A Las Vegas Review-Journal and AARP Nevada poll released on Friday showed Sanders with 25% support, followed by Biden with 18%, Warren at 13%, the businessman Tom Steyer at 11%, and Buttigieg tied Klobuchar at 10%. In addition to a burgeoning army of volunteers, the Sanders campaign employs 250 people in the silver state, more than double the staff of Pete Buttigieg, the second-largest campaign at 100. Lourdes Esparza, 38, said she volunteers for Sanders because her mother and grandmother can\u2019t afford adequate healthcare and were forced to ration medicine and pass on doctor\u2019s appointments to avoid co-pays. Esparza canvasses door-to-door despite also working weekdays at a teachers union and weekends hostessing at a restaurant. \u201c\u2018How much is it going to cost?\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be the first words that come out of my grandmother\u2019s mouth when she gets sick,\u201d Esparza said. Austreberto Hernandez, a 26-year-old immigrant rights advocate, said he will support Sanders for his \u201cdeliberate\u201d approach to progressivism. \u201cI feel like Bernie Sanders normalized the idea of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants [in 2015] because he said it a million times on the campaign trail.\u201d \u201cAll that stuff \u2013 universal healthcare, a $15 minimum wage \u2013 Bernie just pounded to death and now they\u2019ve become household names.\u201d Read the full story here. Good evening, liveblog readers! Tonight, the six presidential candidates are gathered in Las Vegas, Nevada for the ninth Democratic debate of this election cycle. We\u2019ll be bringing you live updates from the debate throughout the night. What to expect The Democratic presidential debate in Nevada will bring together six candidates days before the state\u2019s caucuses, and could be a make-or-break moment for some of the campaigns. Facing off in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening are Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar; the former vice president Joe Biden; the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg; and the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. The debate comes one week after Sanders won the New Hampshire primary, setting the stage for a primary battle between the Vermont senator and the more moderate candidates fighting his momentum. On the heels of a strong performance in the messy Iowa caucuses, Buttigieg came in a close second in New Hampshire, where Klobuchar\u2019s unexpected surge won her third place, and Warren and Biden both experienced disappointing results. The February results make Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucus a high-stakes race for many of the candidates, and the debate is providing the final opportunity for them to make their pitch on national TV. \u201cThe pressure is building here, and the gloves are going to be off,\u201d said Fred Lokken, a political science professor at Truckee Meadows community college in Reno. Sanders is likely to become a target of many of the candidates given his frontrunner status, similar to the way Biden was a magnet for criticisms in the early debates last year, Lokken predicted.

      "bodyText": "Expanding federal government powers to call out the military, national standards for hazard reduction and the mitigation of natural disasters \u2013 but not climate change itself \u2013 will be the focus of the bushfire royal commission. On Thursday, Scott Morrison released the letters patent establishing the national inquiry, pushing ahead despite concerns over federal overreach into states\u2019 emergency management powers and pressure from Labor jurisdictions to focus more explicitly on reducing emissions. The royal commission will be led by the retired air chief marshal Mark Binskin, who is joined by the former federal court judge and Ruddock religious freedom review panel member, Annabelle Bennett, and professor Andrew Macintosh, a specialist in climate risk and impact management. Morrison said in a statement: \u201cMy priority is to keep Australians safe and to do that, we need to learn from the Black Summer bushfires how nationally we can work better with the states and territories to better protect and equip Australians for living in hotter, drier and longer summers.\u201d The letters patent state the royal commission will examine \u201cAustralia\u2019s arrangements for improving resilience and adapting to changing climatic conditions, what actions should be taken to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters, and whether accountability for natural disaster risk management \u2026 should be enhanced\u201d. The terms also ask the commission to consider \u201cthresholds for, and any obstacles to, state or territory requests for commonwealth assistance\u201d, whether the commonwealth should have a power to declare a national state of emergency to create \u201cclearer authority to take action \u2026 in the national interest\u201d, such as deploying the Australian Defence Force. Morrison said that the inquiry \u201cacknowledges climate change, the broader impact of our summers getting longer, drier and hotter and is focussed on practical action that has a direct link to making Australians safer\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to look at what actions should be taken to enhance our preparedness, resilience and recovery through the actions of all levels of government and the community, for the environment we are living in,\u201d he said. Earlier in February, the ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, said the draft letters patent \u201c[ignore] the important role Australia must play in reducing global emissions to minimise the extent of climate change and its potential impacts on the Australian community\u201d. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, backed this view, telling Guardian Australia the proposal to examine resilience and adaptation was \u201ctoo narrow in scope\u201d. \u201cThe inquiry needs to look at the impact of climate change on Australian natural disasters and what can be done to reduce the impact, including meeting our international climate agreements,\u201d he said on Friday. In a sign of further potential trouble with the states, a Victorian government spokesman told Guardian Australia it will review the letters patent \u201cbefore making a final decision as to whether the state signs up to the royal commission\u201d. \u201cWe will have more to say in due course.\u201d While the states cannot prevent a royal commission proceeding, refusing to sign up would hamper the operation of an inquiry designed to forge consensus on changes to the federal balance of responsibilities for emergency management. On Thursday, Morrison said the commonwealth had \u201centered a constitutional grey zone\u201d during the Black Summer bushfires, by deploying 6,500 ADF personnel \u201cwithout clear rules\u201d. Morrison said there were currently \u201cno powers\u201d to declare a national state of emergency to trigger \u201cdirect federal government responses\u201d. All federal responses \u201care supposed to only be undertaken in response to state requests and authorisations\u201d, he said. The controversy over federal-state powers follows anger in the New South Wales government that Morrison had sought to blame the Liberal premier, Gladys Berejiklian, for not asking for assistance from the ADF. Morrison told reporters in Sydney the royal commission had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with showing the states have not done enough on hazard reduction, suggesting this was a \u201cpretty cynical view\u201d. He refused to criticise NSW for not requesting ADF help. Morrison said it was \u201cnot that usual\u201d for the prime minister to appear at a royal commission but noted it had the power to call him. Two former Labor prime ministers, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, appeared before royal commissions initiated by Coalition governments. Morrison argued that while the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of emergency management is controlled by states, including resourcing fire services, hazard reduction, land-clearing and planning, nevertheless Australians want \u201cgreater assurances at a national level that these important tasks are getting done\u201d. The inquiry will also consider \u201cnationally consistent accountability and reporting framework and national standards\u201d for disaster preparedness, response and resilience. Before the final letters patent were released, a Victorian government spokesman suggested the Morrison government should \u201cfocus on areas of commonwealth responsibility, rather than encroaching on matters that traditionally have been a state\u2019s responsibility\u201d. An ANU poll, published on Tuesday, found that confidence in the federal government decreased by 10.9% since October to 27% in January, with the Morrison government\u2019s handling of bushfires blamed. State governments enjoyed support from 40.4% of the 3,249 Australians polled. The royal commission is due to report by 31 August.",

Bloomberg looked tired, at times annoyed, and often sunk back instead of cutting in. He found himself apologizing often. Addressing his stop-and-frisk policy, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve sat, I\u2019ve apologized, I\u2019ve asked for forgiveness. We stopped too many people.\u201d \u201cYou need a different apology,\u201d Warren shot back. Warren had a blistering performance Following disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire, the Massachusetts senator needed to rally support ahead of this weekend\u2019s caucuses in Nevada. And she delivered. Her voice hoarse with a cold, Warren spoke the longest of any candidate on stage, jumping on every chance to call out her opponents\u2019 policies and contrast them with her own. Ripping through the other candidates\u2019 healthcare plans, Warren said what Buttigieg had was a \u201cPowerPoint\u201d. \u201cAmy\u2019s plan is even less; it\u2019s a Post-it note,\u201d she continued. And while Sanders\u2019 proposal is \u201cgood start\u201d, she added, \u201chis campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question\u201d about it. She also landed one of the punchiest attacks on Bloomberg, bringing the attention to his history of derogatory remarks about women: \u201cSo I\u2019d like to talk about who we\u2019re running against: a billionaire who calls women \u2018fat broads\u2019 and \u2018horse-faced lesbians\u2019,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd, no, I\u2019m not talking about Donald Trump. I\u2019m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\u201d Her fiery barbs and energetic performance seems to have paid off. Warren\u2019s campaign said she raised record amounts of money during the debate. Klobuchar and Buttigieg take aim at one another There didn\u2019t seem to be much love lost between the two midwestern contenders. Klobuchar, who in past debates has homed in on the South Bend mayor and has repeatedly argued he lacks experience to take up the presidency, escalated her critiques on Wednesday night. When Buttigieg questioned her record on immigration, Klobuchar hit back. \u201cYou\u2019ve memorized a bunch of talking points,\u201d she said, addressing Buttigieg. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the arena.\u201d When Buttigieg referenced an interview in which Klobuchar forgot the name of Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Klobuchar didn\u2019t take kindly. \u201cAre you calling me dumb? Are you mocking me?\u201d she asked Buttigieg. Sanders is still the frontrunner Sanders is the frontrunner in Nevada and has a double-digit lead over his opponents in the most recent national polls. And yet he didn\u2019t appear the man to beat on stage. Even Warren spared him the third degree. Sanders faced challenges over some of his supporters\u2019 online attacks, in particular reports that Sanders supporters harassed leaders of Nevada\u2019s powerful culinary union after it criticized his healthcare plan. \u201cIf there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people \u2013 they are not part of my campaign,\u201d Sanders said. But he benefited from the other candidates\u2019 arguments and stuck to his talking points, presenting himself as the candidate who could bring revolutionary change. And he easily brushed off Bloomberg\u2019s accusation that he was championing communism as a \u201ccheap shot\u201d.",

Angry Elizabeth Warren is the best Elizabeth Warren. Where has she been? Give her more to do, we miss her.</p> <p>There\u2019s no real winner here. Everyone took a lot of hits from their colleagues and no one crawled out unscathed. But I think we can easily declare a loser, and that would be the moderators. The moderators have indeed been the losers through this whole process. They ask the same questions their colleagues asked in the last 84 Democratic debates, they often don\u2019t follow up when answers are vague or misleading, they pose gotcha questions that have very low stakes. When <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDQqD9CkHz4\">a host for The View</a> has more perseverance on making a squirming Amy Klobuchar answer for her problematic prosecutorial past, particularly as it involves the lack of justice in police-related shootings, maybe it is time for some soul-searching, public resignations, and replacement by journalists with spines.

OK, cool, seems fine.</p> <p>The result was not as substantive as it could have (should have) been, but it made for some good TV. And at the end of the day, that\u2019s probably enough for our distinguished men and women of television media.</p> <p>There must be something to the idea that pressure and pain have the ability to shape one\u2019s character in transformative ways.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jessa Crispin is the host of the Public Intellectual podcast and a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Benjamin Dixon: \u2018Bloomberg has no chance\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Mike Bloomberg demonstrated tonight that, in his life as a billionaire, he must not have had to deal with any character-building pressures in a very long time. All of the money in the world could not purchase charisma enough to make up for the dull and glum presentation he gave tonight.</p> <p>I will admit that, up until this point, I believed Bloomberg was an existential threat to our democracy because of his ability to purchase everything from talent to silence. But no one could look at the debate tonight and honestly believe that the former mayor would stand a chance against Donald Trump. No one could look at Bloomberg\u2019s performance and believe that this man could inspire the movement necessary to win in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/20/democratic-debate-nevada-key-takeaways\">Democratic debate: key takeaways from the bust-up in Las Vegas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Michael Bloomberg spent more than $400m only to get on the national stage and show that he is not ready for prime time. This is what happens when you sit on the outside of the democratic process and use your money to create an image of you that is bigger than life.</p> <p>And it\u2019s hard to live up to that image when you lack the charisma and character that those of us in the working class earned the hard way.</p> <ul> <li><p>Benjamin Dixon is the host of The Benjamin Dixon Show</p></li> </ul> <h2>Art Cullen: \u2018Elizabeth Warren might have saved her campaign\u2019</h2> <p>Elizabeth Warren closed Wednesday\u2019s debate by describing herself as a fighter. She brought plenty of punch to the stage from the get-go by slicing and dicing billionaire Michael Bloomberg. Warren put her rivals on their heels \u2013 she said Bloomberg referred to women as \u201cfat broads and horse-faced lesbians\u201d, said Pete Buttigieg\u2019s healthcare plans boiled down to a PowerPoint presentation and that Amy Klobuchar\u2019s could fit on a Post-it note. Mike Bloomberg was awful. Klobuchar was on the defensive. And the elephant in the room, Bernie Sanders, was able to point out that Medicare for All will actually save $450bn \u2013 and universal healthcare is what put him at the front of the pack in the first place. He did not appear to lose stride. Warren saw Klobuchar\u2019s breakthrough in the New Hampshire debate. She spared no one, and savaged Bloomberg. Everyone was throwing punches but nobody hit as hard as Warren. With Super Tuesday less than two weeks away, this raucous debate was a clincher, and Warren might have saved her struggling campaign with direct appeals to minority women so important in the Nevada caususes. Joe Biden, not so much.</p> <ul> <li><p>Art Cullen is editor of the Storm Lake Times in north-west Iowa, where he won the Pulitzer prize for editorial writing. He is a Guardian US columnist and author of the book Storm Lake: Change, Resilience, and Hope in America\u2019s Heartland.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Arwa Mahdawi: \u2018Bloomberg bombed, Warren won\u2019</h2> <p>Looks like Michael Bloomberg just found out money can\u2019t buy you everything. The multibillionaire has spent almost $400m on ads but apparently zero time preparing for the debate stage. He had embarrassingly inadequate responses for predictable questions on stop-and-frisk and the silencing of women in his companies with NDAs. His lack of substance was matched with a complete lack of charisma. According to some in the Establishment, we should forgive Bloomberg\u2019s history of sexism and racism because he\u2019s the only person capable of beating Trump. If they still think that after this pitiful debate performance then we\u2019re in trouble.</p> <p>While Bloomberg bombed, Elizabeth Warren had her best debate ever. She was impeccably prepared and utterly eviscerated Bloomberg. Warren has been lagging in the polls, leading some to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/1230006988517650432?s=20\">prematurely write her off</a>; big mistake. Pete Buttigieg\u2019s performance was also noteworthy. The mayor may be able to read Norwegian but he can\u2019t seem to read a room. Buttigieg\u2019s constant attacks on Amy Klobuchar made him look like a mansplaining bully.</p> <p>\u201cMayo Pete\u201d has been gliding through this election but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if more people start to find his patronizing demeanour a little hard to stomach.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul> <h2>Lloyd Green: \u2018Bernie Sanders emerged as the winner\u2019</h2> <p>The Democrats\u2019 Game of Thrones-style debate was a two-hour extravaganza that boosted Donald Trump\u2019s chances. Obviously, that\u2019s not what the Democratic National Committee intended but it\u2019s what happened \u2013 a circular firing squad more intent on unloading on each other than at going at the president.</p> <p>Elizabeth Warren flayed Mike Bloomberg with a helping hand from Joe Biden. New York\u2019s ex-mayor appeared rusty and unprepared. The attacks were predictable yet he looked flatfooted. When you\u2019re defending non-disclosure agreements, you\u2019re losing. On Wednesday night, money didn\u2019t buy everything.</p> <p>Lest Warren get cocky, it is worth remembering that early voting in the Nevada caucuses was well under way before the Massachusetts senator took the stage. As a result, any post-debate bounce will probably be short-lived.</p> <p>Come Saturday evening, the headlines will either be about the order of finish or how Nevada botched its caucuses. Warning: Iowa redux is a real possibility.</p> <p>In the end, Bernie Sanders emerged as the winner in the room. He entered as the Democrats\u2019 frontrunner and nothing altered that reality. According to the polls, Sanders <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/nv/nevada_democratic_presidential_caucus-6866.html\">is leading by double</a><a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/nv/nevada_democratic_presidential_caucus-6866.html\"> digits both in Nevada</a> and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\">nationally</a> among Democrats. The question is whether his lead becomes insurmountable.

Angry Elizabeth Warren is the best Elizabeth Warren. Where has she been? Give her more to do, we miss her. There\u2019s no real winner here. Everyone took a lot of hits from their colleagues and no one crawled out unscathed. But I think we can easily declare a loser, and that would be the moderators. The moderators have indeed been the losers through this whole process. They ask the same questions their colleagues asked in the last 84 Democratic debates, they often don\u2019t follow up when answers are vague or misleading, they pose gotcha questions that have very low stakes. When a host for The View has more perseverance on making a squirming Amy Klobuchar answer for her problematic prosecutorial past, particularly as it involves the lack of justice in police-related shootings, maybe it is time for some soul-searching, public resignations, and replacement by journalists with spines. We have a moderator who referred to one candidate\u2019s followers as brownshirts, and he\u2019s just allowed to pretend to be an objective interlocutor? OK, cool, seems fine. The result was not as substantive as it could have (should have) been, but it made for some good TV. And at the end of the day, that\u2019s probably enough for our distinguished men and women of television media. There must be something to the idea that pressure and pain have the ability to shape one\u2019s character in transformative ways. Jessa Crispin is the host of the Public Intellectual podcast and a Guardian US columnist Benjamin Dixon: \u2018Bloomberg has no chance\u2019 Mike Bloomberg demonstrated tonight that, in his life as a billionaire, he must not have had to deal with any character-building pressures in a very long time. All of the money in the world could not purchase charisma enough to make up for the dull and glum presentation he gave tonight. I will admit that, up until this point, I believed Bloomberg was an existential threat to our democracy because of his ability to purchase everything from talent to silence. But no one could look at the debate tonight and honestly believe that the former mayor would stand a chance against Donald Trump. No one could look at Bloomberg\u2019s performance and believe that this man could inspire the movement necessary to win in November. Michael Bloomberg spent more than $400m only to get on the national stage and show that he is not ready for prime time. This is what happens when you sit on the outside of the democratic process and use your money to create an image of you that is bigger than life. And it\u2019s hard to live up to that image when you lack the charisma and character that those of us in the working class earned the hard way. Benjamin Dixon is the host of The Benjamin Dixon Show Art Cullen: \u2018Elizabeth Warren might have saved her campaign\u2019 Elizabeth Warren closed Wednesday\u2019s debate by describing herself as a fighter. She brought plenty of punch to the stage from the get-go by slicing and dicing billionaire Michael Bloomberg. Warren put her rivals on their heels \u2013 she said Bloomberg referred to women as \u201cfat broads and horse-faced lesbians\u201d, said Pete Buttigieg\u2019s healthcare plans boiled down to a PowerPoint presentation and that Amy Klobuchar\u2019s could fit on a Post-it note. Mike Bloomberg was awful. Klobuchar was on the defensive. And the elephant in the room, Bernie Sanders, was able to point out that Medicare for All will actually save $450bn \u2013 and universal healthcare is what put him at the front of the pack in the first place. He did not appear to lose stride. Warren saw Klobuchar\u2019s breakthrough in the New Hampshire debate. She spared no one, and savaged Bloomberg. Everyone was throwing punches but nobody hit as hard as Warren. With Super Tuesday less than two weeks away, this raucous debate was a clincher, and Warren might have saved her struggling campaign with direct appeals to minority women so important in the Nevada caususes. Joe Biden, not so much. Art Cullen is editor of the Storm Lake Times in north-west Iowa, where he won the Pulitzer prize for editorial writing. He is a Guardian US columnist and author of the book Storm Lake: Change, Resilience, and Hope in America\u2019s Heartland. Arwa Mahdawi: \u2018Bloomberg bombed, Warren won\u2019 Looks like Michael Bloomberg just found out money can\u2019t buy you everything. The multibillionaire has spent almost $400m on ads but apparently zero time preparing for the debate stage. He had embarrassingly inadequate responses for predictable questions on stop-and-frisk and the silencing of women in his companies with NDAs. His lack of substance was matched with a complete lack of charisma. According to some in the Establishment, we should forgive Bloomberg\u2019s history of sexism and racism because he\u2019s the only person capable of beating Trump. If they still think that after this pitiful debate performance then we\u2019re in trouble. While Bloomberg bombed, Elizabeth Warren had her best debate ever. She was impeccably prepared and utterly eviscerated Bloomberg. Warren has been lagging in the polls, leading some to prematurely write her off; big mistake. Pete Buttigieg\u2019s performance was also noteworthy. The mayor may be able to read Norwegian but he can\u2019t seem to read a room. Buttigieg\u2019s constant attacks on Amy Klobuchar made him look like a mansplaining bully. \u201cMayo Pete\u201d has been gliding through this election but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if more people start to find his patronizing demeanour a little hard to stomach. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnist Lloyd Green: \u2018Bernie Sanders emerged as the winner\u2019 The Democrats\u2019 Game of Thrones-style debate was a two-hour extravaganza that boosted Donald Trump\u2019s chances. Obviously, that\u2019s not what the Democratic National Committee intended but it\u2019s what happened \u2013 a circular firing squad more intent on unloading on each other than at going at the president. Elizabeth Warren flayed Mike Bloomberg with a helping hand from Joe Biden. New York\u2019s ex-mayor appeared rusty and unprepared. The attacks were predictable yet he looked flatfooted. When you\u2019re defending non-disclosure agreements, you\u2019re losing. On Wednesday night, money didn\u2019t buy everything. Lest Warren get cocky, it is worth remembering that early voting in the Nevada caucuses was well under way before the Massachusetts senator took the stage. As a result, any post-debate bounce will probably be short-lived. Come Saturday evening, the headlines will either be about the order of finish or how Nevada botched its caucuses. Warning: Iowa redux is a real possibility. In the end, Bernie Sanders emerged as the winner in the room. He entered as the Democrats\u2019 frontrunner and nothing altered that reality. According to the polls, Sanders is leading by double digits both in Nevada and nationally among Democrats. The question is whether his lead becomes insurmountable. We will know soon enough.

      "bodyText": "We are closing down this blog. A full wrap of what we know can be found here. Thank you for reading. Police have confirmed that they stormed the alleged suspect\u2019s home and found him dead and another body. Police also said another person has died from the first two shootings, taking the total dead in Hanau to 11. After a shooting on Wednesday evening in Hanau... the alleged perpetrator was found dead. According to witnesses, the police received information about a fleeing vehicle, which could be found as part of the large-scale search in the Kesselstadt district. The home address there was blocked off extensively and searched by special police forces. Two other bodies were found. One of the dead people is most likely the culprit. There are currently no indications of other perpetrators. The number of victims who were fatally injured at the crime scenes in Heumarkt and Kurt-Schumacher-Platz increased to nine, so that there are currently a total of eleven deaths. Investigations into the identity of the victims and the suspected perpetrator are ongoing. The suspect and another person have been found dead, according to the Hessenschau news site. This is what we know so far about the shootings in Hanau near Frankfurt in western Germany. Eight people are dead after shootings in the town, police said, in a short statement. Five people are also seriously injured. Police said a suspect fled one shooting in a \u201cdark vehicle\u201d. The hunt for the \u201cperpetrators\u201d was under way, police said, but they have not commented on reports that one man has been arrested. Police said there were \u201creports\u201d of two separate shooting incidents. Local media say two shisha bars \u2013 the Midnight and the Arena Bar &amp; Cafe \u2013 were targeted. Pictures of heavily armed officers and forensic investigators at two separate locations indicate that there were two shooting incidents about 2km apart. There was a huge police presence on the streets and a helicopter hovered above the town. There is no indication of motive for the attacks although the German tabloid Bild says some of the victims have a Kurdish background. The town\u2019s MP has called it a \u201chorrific scenario\u201d. Bild says victims of the attacks included young people and one woman. Some of the victims have a Kurdish background, the tabloid says. My colleague Patrick Lum has kindly mapped the points where we think the shootings took place based on the pictures from Hanau and reports from German news outlets. See my last but one post for the details. Hanau\u2019s federal MP, Katja Leikert, has called the attack a \u201chorrific scenario\u201d in a tweet in which she gives her \u201cheartfelt condolences\u201d to the victims. It does appear that there were two separate shooting incidents, although the police have not confirmed that. All the authorities have said so far is that there were \u201cinitial reports\u201d of two shootings at around 10pm local time and that a suspect was seen leaving a shooting in Heumarkt \u2013 which German media reports say was the first of two \u2013 in a \u201cdark vehicle\u201d. Pictures released by news wires show police at two different locations. The picture below shows a policeman outside the Domino Spielhalle which is in Steinheimer Strasse. That is around the corner from the Midnight bar in Heumarkt where local media reports the first shooting took place. This next picture shows a car outside the Arena Bar &amp; Cafe in Karlsbader Strasse, a little more than 2km away across the town, being inspected by police forensic officers. The bar is where local media say the second shooting took place. There is still no word from police about the reports of an arrest but Bild has quoted the mayor of Hanau, Claus Kaminsky as saying \u201cYou could not imagine a worse evening\u201d. The video news agency Ruptly has tweeted two videos taken in Hanau tonight. Mass shootings are comparatively rare in Germany although there have been a number in recent years with a mixture of motives. The most recent left six dead in the south-western town of Rot am See near Stuttgart. A 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of killing six members of his family, including his parents. Two people were shot dead in Halle in eastern Germany after a far-right attacker tried to break into a synagogue. Several others were injured. A German-Iranian teenager killed nine people in the centre of Munich in July 2016 before turning the weapon on himself. It is not illegal to own a gun in Germany but their sale is strictly controlled and require a licence to obtain legally. Hanau is a large town in the western German state of Hesse, 25km east along the Main river from Frankfurt. It has a population of around 100,000 people. Known for the precious metal industry, it is home to Heraeus, one of Germany\u2019s largest private companies which specialises in precious metals and medical technology. It is also the birthplace of the folklorists, the Brothers Grimm. Here are some more pictures of the scene in Hanau tonight. German media are reporting that a suspect has been arrested but the police have not made any comment on that yet. The mass-market newspaper Bild says one man has been arrested but that has not been confirmed by police. Bild also says there were two separate attacks. The first shooting occurred at the Midnight shisha bar in Heumarkt in the town centre. Then there was a second attack at the Arena Bar &amp; Cafe in Karlsbader Strasse. The Hessenschau regional broadcaster also reports that there were two shootings with three killed in the first attack and five killed in the second. It also says a suspect has been arrested. We can see from photographs already published by news wires and from television footage that there is a huge police opperation under way in the small town, which is close to Germany\u2019s financial hub, Frankfurt. Police in Hanau have released a statement about what they have described as a \u201cgunfight\u201d in the town. It confirms that eight people are dead and that the suspect or suspects are still at large. As we just reported, there were gun shots in Hanau on Wednesday evening, around 10pm, in which several people were injured. According to the latest findings, the police can now confirm that eight people were fatally injured. The search for the perpetrators is in full swing. There is still no reliable knowledge of the background. The criminal police are still asking for information under the number 06181 100-123. Details are sketchy at the moment but we have an initial report on our site already. You can read it here: Welcome to our rolling coverage of a shooting in the German town of Hanau near Frankfurt on Wednesday night. This what we know so far: Suspects opened fire in Hanau, 25km of Frankfurt, at around 10pm killing at least eight people, police said. Several have been injured. Police are hunting the suspects. Media reports say the suspect or suspects opened fire on a shisha bar in the town. News and TV pictures showed the town was swamped with heavily armed officers. The Hessenschau regional broadcaster said a second shisha bar had been attacked but that has not been confirmed by police.",

The stage where you can grab the \u201chorse-faced lesbian\u201d weapon and hurl it at an \u201carrogant\u201d billionaire within the first minutes of the show starting. It\u2019s the stage where a young midwestern mayor can trash the experience of a midwestern senator, who turns right back at him and says, \u201cAre you trying to say I\u2019m dumb or are you mocking me here?\u201d So much for all that midwestern niceness. There\u2019s a reason why the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday turned into such an epic donnybrook. It\u2019s called the primary calendar, which is inexorably counting down to the Super Tuesday contests in less than two weeks. At that point, one of the candidates on stage will emerge with a delegate lead that puts an end to all the quadrennial talk of a brokered convention. At this point, that candidate looks like Bernie Sanders. In the meantime, his five rivals on the debate stage have engaged in an entirely delusional sideshow of mutual annihilation. The odds will never be in their favor. They don\u2019t have the time for all the cannon fire before they lose the Nevada caucus and then watch Sanders sweep the majority of California delegates. Instead they engaged in an entirely futile effort to knock each other out of the contest so they could confront the frontrunner alone.

      "body": "<p>World-leading experts on the novel coronavirus have signed a statement of support for their Chinese colleagues, who are being attacked on social media and even threatened with violence as false rumours circulate about its origins.</p> <p>There is a real risk that the open and transparent relationship between the Chinese scientists and their western counterparts will come to an abrupt end, impeding the sharing of data and the hunt for treatments and vaccines against Covid-19, warned Dr Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance in the United States, whose research into emerging diseases led to the identification of the bat origin of Sars, among others.</p> <p>Daszak is one of 27 prominent public health scientists from nine countries who have signed the <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30418-9/fulltext#%20\">statement published by the Lancet medical journal</a>. They include Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust in the UK, Jim Hughes, former director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases in the USA, Rita Colwell, former head of the US National Science Foundation and other leaders in infectious disease research and public health.</p> <p>\u201cWe work very closely with the Chinese scientists. We have had incredible openness with the labs in China for the last 15 years, since Sars,\u201d said Daszak. \u201cWe collaborate on what are dangerous viruses and get incredible information that helps public health around the world. That is all under threat right now.\u201d</p> <p>The Chinese scientists and their families have been abused on social media and threatened with violence. They are saying, said Daszak, \u201cwe are not going to talk, because every time we speak we get criticised and threatened\u201d.</p> <p>Conspiracy theories circulating on social media claim the coronavirus was artificially manufactured in a lab conducting bioweapons research. They are \u201ccrackpot theories that need to be addressed, but in the age of social media it is just impossible,\u201d said Daszak.</p> <p>As with the conspiracy theories around MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination, those promulgating the rumours are in their own social media echo chambers. </p> <p>And as with anti-vaxx theories, the unfounded rumours have then been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/media/coronavirus-tom-cotton-china.html\">amplified by mainstream politicians</a> such as the US senator Tom Cotton, and international news platforms such as the Daily Mail.</p> <p>The signatories to the statement, says Daszak, have put their reputations on the line in support of their Chinese counterparts who are being targeted. \u201cThere are scientists out there trying to save our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been doing this for 15 years since the Sars outbreak.\u201d</p> <p>The Lancet letter is a \u201cstatement in support of the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals of China combatting Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins.

      "bodyText": "World-leading experts on the novel coronavirus have signed a statement of support for their Chinese colleagues, who are being attacked on social media and even threatened with violence as false rumours circulate about its origins. There is a real risk that the open and transparent relationship between the Chinese scientists and their western counterparts will come to an abrupt end, impeding the sharing of data and the hunt for treatments and vaccines against Covid-19, warned Dr Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance in the United States, whose research into emerging diseases led to the identification of the bat origin of Sars, among others. Daszak is one of 27 prominent public health scientists from nine countries who have signed the statement published by the Lancet medical journal. They include Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust in the UK, Jim Hughes, former director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases in the USA, Rita Colwell, former head of the US National Science Foundation and other leaders in infectious disease research and public health. \u201cWe work very closely with the Chinese scientists. We have had incredible openness with the labs in China for the last 15 years, since Sars,\u201d said Daszak. \u201cWe collaborate on what are dangerous viruses and get incredible information that helps public health around the world. That is all under threat right now.\u201d The Chinese scientists and their families have been abused on social media and threatened with violence. They are saying, said Daszak, \u201cwe are not going to talk, because every time we speak we get criticised and threatened\u201d. Conspiracy theories circulating on social media claim the coronavirus was artificially manufactured in a lab conducting bioweapons research. They are \u201ccrackpot theories that need to be addressed, but in the age of social media it is just impossible,\u201d said Daszak. As with the conspiracy theories around MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination, those promulgating the rumours are in their own social media echo chambers. And as with anti-vaxx theories, the unfounded rumours have then been amplified by mainstream politicians such as the US senator Tom Cotton, and international news platforms such as the Daily Mail. The signatories to the statement, says Daszak, have put their reputations on the line in support of their Chinese counterparts who are being targeted. \u201cThere are scientists out there trying to save our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been doing this for 15 years since the Sars outbreak.\u201d The Lancet letter is a \u201cstatement in support of the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals of China combatting Covid-19\u201d. \u201cThe rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens,\u201d it says, linking to all the scientific evidence published so far. The director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom, has also warned against rumours and misinformation, speaking of the \u201cinfodemic\u201d that needs to be fought alongside the epidemic. The statement continues: \u201cConspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.

When Aboriginal people resisted the British colonisers, former and serving convicts sometimes joined armed soldiers and free settlers in murderous retaliation. The barracks remains a Unesco world heritage-listed museum, and this weekend will reopen with new, immersive audio and visual technology telling its history inside. The outside of the structure has been reinvented, too. Wiradjuri-Kamilaroi artist Jonathan Jones\u2019 new public art installation \u2013 untitled (maraong manao\u0301uwi), which means emu footprint in Gadigal \u2013 required a team of a dozen people to cover 2500 sq metres of the courtyard with stones, to symbolise shared black and white history. In a design repeated on each square metre of the courtyard, workers have used stencils to embed white stones in the shape of what might be interpreted as an emu\u2019s footprint \u2013 but which is also reminiscent of the colonial broad arrow printed on convict uniforms. This 16m-year-old white quartz, quarried from Cowra in central-west New South Wales, is surrounded by red stones from Griffith, about 300km from Cowra by road. Cowra and Griffith are both in Wiradjuri country, where in 1824 governor Brisbane declared martial law on Indigenous people, triggering military raids and Aboriginal resistance in what became known as the Bathurst wars. Jones sought permission from Gadigal elders to bring the Wiradjuri-area stones to the site. \u201cAll too often \u2013 although we\u2019re getting better \u2013 in older history books, Aboriginal history stops in 1788 and colonial history begins,\u201d says Jones, 41. \u201cThere\u2019s a real break, when in fact we know they\u2019re completely enmeshed.\u201d Many families have Indigenous and non-Indigenous histories entwined, says Jones, who adds the installation can be interpreted in different ways. \u201cThe artwork is also designed to wake people up, because there was a general perception that there were no Aboriginal stories here.

The modern cinema hall was only half full on a Monday afternoon, and even the offer of delicious cream doughnuts had not lured that many from a working-class district of Tehran. At the close of the two-hour event, a hundred or so gathered on stage to wave small Iranian flags and confirm it was their patriotic duty to vote. Hosseini argued \u201cwe need a strong parliament to hold Rouhani to account\u201d.</p> <p>At times the speakers were close to beseeching the audience to each bring a further 100 people to the polling booths this week. The tone reflected the conservatives\u2019 great fear in these elections \u2013 that they will win with what one senior Iranian diplomatic official privately predicted would be a landslide, but the success will be soured by mass abstention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e6cf9a6ad51b7307c4717503191e3f3f80f8e72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e6cf9a6ad51b7307c4717503191e3f3f80f8e72/40_289_5419_3251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of conservative candidates at a meeting in Tehran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of conservative candidates at a meeting in Tehran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If turnout is low, the conservatives will regain the parliament since its base will come out to vote, but if it is too low the result could be taken as a vote of no confidence in the whole Islamic Republic. One survey shows 75% do not plan to vote, and in the elegant squares of the University of Tehran, small groups gathered calling for a boycott, holding placards saying: \u201cThe people are fighting poverty, the regime is looking for votes.\u201d</p> <p>One reformist candidate, Vahid Tootoonch, said \u201cit is a freezing cold atmosphere in Tehran towards the elections\u201d, and that at best he hoped for a vote around the 40% mark.</p> <p>Yet predictions in such a complex, multi-layered society as Iran are foolish, especially since it has been through some of the most turbulent months in its 41-year history. Hundreds were killed in riots caused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/16/protests-erupt-in-iran-after-government-raises-price-of-gas-by-50\">\u201cshock therapy\u201d fuel price rises</a> in November.

One disillusioned reformist activist said: \u201cThe regime\u2019s cover-up over the jet was the last straw for me. Iran\u2019s politics is a game. If the roots of a tree are poisoned, it does not matter how you decorate the leaves.

On Tuesday morning around Ferdowsi Square in Tehran the hundreds of currency exchange markets, which have proliferated since sanctions were imposed, bustled with customers. Overnight, the markets had pushed the value of the dollar up a further 10%, amid concern that Iran is set to be blacklisted again by the international Financial Action Task Force after failing to comply with a final warning to sign up to its money-laundering and anti-terror laws.</p> <p>Blacklisting would cut Iranian banks off further from the world financial system. Abdolnaser Hemmati, the governor of the Iranian Central Bank, insisted the risk of being blacklisted was low, but the steady flow of taxis turning up to the exchange markets showed many were unconvinced. At times $10,000 in cash were being bought and sold.</p> <p>The siege backdrop could not make for a greater contrast than the last parliamentary elections five years ago when Rouhani\u2019s reformists, promising to take the country out of economic isolation, became the largest party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/reformist-backed-candidates-tehran-iran-assembly-elections\">winning all 30 seats</a> in Tehran. Then the possibility of change gripped the capital.</p> <p>Now, at a thinly attended meeting for a reformist faction linked to the former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, held in a backroom, the panel were peppered with questions about their record and whether their support for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/purge-of-reformists-in-iran-election-could-doom-nuclear-deal-say-diplomats\">the nuclear deal</a> had been mistaken. Tootoonch doggedly defended the deal, saying it was a model for showing negotiations can have results, but he said no one could have foreseen that Donald Trump would be elected US president or Iran\u2019s conservatives would resist the deal as much as they did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ca300185c4875d6d4370b55bb63e0e9b71214ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ca300185c4875d6d4370b55bb63e0e9b71214ed/0_0_1024_683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poster shows the late Iranian military commander Qassem Suleimani and the late Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis during Friday prayers in Tehran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster shows the late Iranian military commander Qassem Suleimani and the late Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis as Iranian worshippers chant slogans during Friday prayers in Tehran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By contrast, Mohammad Sadegh Kooshki, a hardline academic at Tehran University, said he had always predicted the nuclear deal would not bear fruit. \u201cWe never held a tool to force the Americans to hold to their commitments. The Americans had a tool in sanctions. We did not, and as a result we have lost six years developing our nuclear power plants.\u201d</p> <p>The truth was that neither the US nor Europe dared allow a truly powerful independent industrial country to be formed in the Middle East\u2019s heartland, he said. \u201cThe Americans want us to be oil salesmen, just buying goods from them like the Saudis, and Emiratis. Big powers don\u2019t want to have rivals,\u201d he said. He favoured building relations with China or Russia.</p> <p>At the barracks-like and conservative Shahed University on the south side of Tehran, Dr Hamidreza Sayyedi was equally insistent Iran would survive. He said the religious nature of the regime was fundamental to its sustainability: \u201cIf England had suffered 1% of the level of sanctions that we have suffered, the country would have collapsed. We can endure.\u201d</p> <p>The Islamic Republic was not some medieval merger of church and state, but a newer, higher form of governance, he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93063de14f31bf4d3e9e76de0c98c757ce0ae6cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93063de14f31bf4d3e9e76de0c98c757ce0ae6cf/0_0_5450_3481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Iranian woman walks past electoral posters in Tehran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Iranian woman walks past electoral posters in Tehran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the question then arises that if the <strong> </strong>conservatives<strong> </strong>are so confident the tide is with them, why had the 12-strong Guardian Council composed of clerics and jurists largely appointed by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned so many reformists from standing in the elections?</p> <p>More than half the 14,000 applications to stand have been rejected for various reasons, such as a lack of true Islamic faith, or good health. But it is not the mass nature of the disqualifications that matter, but their targeted nature. Credible figures such as Ali Motahari, Mahmoud Sadeghi, and Shahindokht Molaverdi, all critics of various forms of state repression, have found themselves debarred. Even Rouhani complained in public and private that elections without contests were appointments, not democracy.</p> <p>The political engineering has meant the reformist umbrella group decided not to put forward a unified list for the 30 seats reserved for Tehran in the 290-strong parliament. But it left others to decide if they wished to put up lists, and did not advocate a boycott, a halfway house that dissatisfied some.</p> <p>The heavy-handedness of the intervention suggests Khamenei sees the reformists\u2019 disarray as a chance to consolidate his power ahead of the presidential election next year, and even prepare his succession.</p> <p>At an hour-long press conference on Wednesday a spokesman for the Guardian Council repeatedly denied claims he had rigged the elections, saying the candidate qualifications decisions were based on the law, asserting the Council was \u201cnot a political club\u201d.</p> <p>He said turnout in elections in Iran had never fallen below 50%, but if it did that was no problem, pointing that the figure was similar to some French elections.</p> <p>Mohsen Aref, a one-time campaigner for Rouhani at Allameh Tabataba\u2019i University in Tehran, argues Rouhani\u2019s failure has revealed the impossibility of reforming the regime.</p> <p>He said Tehran only revealed its truths slowly, and the real truth is that most Iranians are not religious hardliners, but highly educated people with a rich culture. \u201cWe want to engage with the world. Iran started as a totalitarian majority regime. It is now a totalitarian minority regime.\u201d Turnout, as much as the result, will help reveal if he is right.</p>",

Mohammad Hosseini, Iran\u2019s minister for culture and Islamic guidance from 2009 to 2013 under the then president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, replied. If elected, he said, he would always be available to his people. He even read out his phone number to the crowd to underline his sincerity. Popular anger at corruption, the slide in living standards and the political mistakes of the reformist government of President Hassan Rouhani is widespread in Iran, and fuels the conservatives\u2019 call for \u201ca strong parliament\u201d to be elected this Friday in nationwide elections. If the conservatives can take power, and appoint someone such as the former Tehran mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf as speaker, Rouhani can be kept on a tight leash in his final year of office before fresh presidential elections. The deeper question is whether the disillusionment about Rouhani masks a deeper fatalism and disenchantment with all formal politics in Iran. Despite a Motown-style singing quartet, occasional chants of \u201cdeath to America and death to Israel\u201d, the crowd at Hosseini\u2019s election meeting, divided by gender and leaning towards the age of 60 rather than 16, did not look that animated. The modern cinema hall was only half full on a Monday afternoon, and even the offer of delicious cream doughnuts had not lured that many from a working-class district of Tehran. At the close of the two-hour event, a hundred or so gathered on stage to wave small Iranian flags and confirm it was their patriotic duty to vote. Hosseini argued \u201cwe need a strong parliament to hold Rouhani to account\u201d. At times the speakers were close to beseeching the audience to each bring a further 100 people to the polling booths this week. The tone reflected the conservatives\u2019 great fear in these elections \u2013 that they will win with what one senior Iranian diplomatic official privately predicted would be a landslide, but the success will be soured by mass abstention. If turnout is low, the conservatives will regain the parliament since its base will come out to vote, but if it is too low the result could be taken as a vote of no confidence in the whole Islamic Republic. One survey shows 75% do not plan to vote, and in the elegant squares of the University of Tehran, small groups gathered calling for a boycott, holding placards saying: \u201cThe people are fighting poverty, the regime is looking for votes.\u201d One reformist candidate, Vahid Tootoonch, said \u201cit is a freezing cold atmosphere in Tehran towards the elections\u201d, and that at best he hoped for a vote around the 40% mark. Yet predictions in such a complex, multi-layered society as Iran are foolish, especially since it has been through some of the most turbulent months in its 41-year history. Hundreds were killed in riots caused by \u201cshock therapy\u201d fuel price rises in November. The government declined this week to give an official figure on the deaths. Then Donald Trump\u2019s assassination of the head of Iran\u2019s elite al-Quds force Qassem Suleimani \u2013 his picture adorns every highway in Tehran \u2013 reunited the country, only for Iranian military reprisals, leading to the mistaken downing of a Ukrainian civilian jet, reignited society\u2019s divisions. One disillusioned reformist activist said: \u201cThe regime\u2019s cover-up over the jet was the last straw for me. Iran\u2019s politics is a game. If the roots of a tree are poisoned, it does not matter how you decorate the leaves. I am done with it.\u201d Meanwhile the pressure on the economy, due to American sanctions as well as corruption, is relentless. On Tuesday morning around Ferdowsi Square in Tehran the hundreds of currency exchange markets, which have proliferated since sanctions were imposed, bustled with customers. Overnight, the markets had pushed the value of the dollar up a further 10%, amid concern that Iran is set to be blacklisted again by the international Financial Action Task Force after failing to comply with a final warning to sign up to its money-laundering and anti-terror laws. Blacklisting would cut Iranian banks off further from the world financial system. Abdolnaser Hemmati, the governor of the Iranian Central Bank, insisted the risk of being blacklisted was low, but the steady flow of taxis turning up to the exchange markets showed many were unconvinced. At times $10,000 in cash were being bought and sold. The siege backdrop could not make for a greater contrast than the last parliamentary elections five years ago when Rouhani\u2019s reformists, promising to take the country out of economic isolation, became the largest party, winning all 30 seats in Tehran. Then the possibility of change gripped the capital. Now, at a thinly attended meeting for a reformist faction linked to the former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, held in a backroom, the panel were peppered with questions about their record and whether their support for the nuclear deal had been mistaken. Tootoonch doggedly defended the deal, saying it was a model for showing negotiations can have results, but he said no one could have foreseen that Donald Trump would be elected US president or Iran\u2019s conservatives would resist the deal as much as they did. By contrast, Mohammad Sadegh Kooshki, a hardline academic at Tehran University, said he had always predicted the nuclear deal would not bear fruit. \u201cWe never held a tool to force the Americans to hold to their commitments. The Americans had a tool in sanctions. We did not, and as a result we have lost six years developing our nuclear power plants.\u201d The truth was that neither the US nor Europe dared allow a truly powerful independent industrial country to be formed in the Middle East\u2019s heartland, he said. \u201cThe Americans want us to be oil salesmen, just buying goods from them like the Saudis, and Emiratis. Big powers don\u2019t want to have rivals,\u201d he said. He favoured building relations with China or Russia. At the barracks-like and conservative Shahed University on the south side of Tehran, Dr Hamidreza Sayyedi was equally insistent Iran would survive. He said the religious nature of the regime was fundamental to its sustainability: \u201cIf England had suffered 1% of the level of sanctions that we have suffered, the country would have collapsed. We can endure.\u201d The Islamic Republic was not some medieval merger of church and state, but a newer, higher form of governance, he said. But the question then arises that if the conservatives are so confident the tide is with them, why had the 12-strong Guardian Council composed of clerics and jurists largely appointed by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned so many reformists from standing in the elections? More than half the 14,000 applications to stand have been rejected for various reasons, such as a lack of true Islamic faith, or good health. But it is not the mass nature of the disqualifications that matter, but their targeted nature. Credible figures such as Ali Motahari, Mahmoud Sadeghi, and Shahindokht Molaverdi, all critics of various forms of state repression, have found themselves debarred. Even Rouhani complained in public and private that elections without contests were appointments, not democracy. The political engineering has meant the reformist umbrella group decided not to put forward a unified list for the 30 seats reserved for Tehran in the 290-strong parliament. But it left others to decide if they wished to put up lists, and did not advocate a boycott, a halfway house that dissatisfied some. The heavy-handedness of the intervention suggests Khamenei sees the reformists\u2019 disarray as a chance to consolidate his power ahead of the presidential election next year, and even prepare his succession. At an hour-long press conference on Wednesday a spokesman for the Guardian Council repeatedly denied claims he had rigged the elections, saying the candidate qualifications decisions were based on the law, asserting the Council was \u201cnot a political club\u201d. He said turnout in elections in Iran had never fallen below 50%, but if it did that was no problem, pointing that the figure was similar to some French elections. Mohsen Aref, a one-time campaigner for Rouhani at Allameh Tabataba\u2019i University in Tehran, argues Rouhani\u2019s failure has revealed the impossibility of reforming the regime. He said Tehran only revealed its truths slowly, and the real truth is that most Iranians are not religious hardliners, but highly educated people with a rich culture. \u201cWe want to engage with the world. Iran started as a totalitarian majority regime. It is now a totalitarian minority regime.\u201d Turnout, as much as the result, will help reveal if he is right.",

Hannah Clarke died at the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s hospital on Wednesday night, less than 24 hours after her estranged husband and the children\u2019s father, former rugby league player Rowan Baxter, allegedly poured petrol on his family in a suspected domestic violence incident. The children \u2013 Laianah, four, Aaliyah, six, and Trey, three \u2013 died in the car after it burst into flames on a quiet suburban street in leafy Camp Hill, in Brisbane\u2019s east, on Wednesday morning during their regular school run. Lloyd Clarke, Hannah Clarke\u2019s father, called his estranged son-in-law \u201cscum\u201d and a \u201cmonster\u201d. \u201cHe might have said he cared and loved his children but I know it was always about him coming first,\u201d he said on social media. \u201cThe scum rots in hell.\u201d Hannah Clarke\u2019s brother, Nat Clarke, wrote he\u2019d had his sister, nieces and nephew \u201ctaken from me in the worst way possible by a heartless monster they called there dad former NRL player Rowan Baxter\u201d. \u201cEveryone who has been lucky enough to be apart of there lives would know just how sweet and loving these kids and my sister really were,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe last thing my sister said to my wife was I\u2019m so excited this year will be great. I\u2019m so [grateful] she and I got to reconnect and become such close friends before this tragedy I will forever love you all.\u201d On Wednesday members of Hannah Clarke\u2019s family set up a fundraising page for funeral costs and to support her parents, who, they said, had \u201cexhausted themselves to try and help Hannah escape this monster\u201d. Sister in-law Stacey Roberts said Hannah was \u201ca beautiful soul\u201d whose \u201cchildren [were] her life\u201d. \u201cAll she ever wanted was happiness,\u201d she said. \u201cHer children were only a reflection of her. Gorgeous happy kids who held a massive piece in my heart and I\u2019m sure many others cause that\u2019s exactly what they were like. We will miss them all more than anything!\u201d Police believe the estranged husband and father doused the car in petrol with his wife and children inside, before reportedly stabbing himself. He died at the scene. Hannah Clarke had managed to get out of the burning car, but died from her injuries in hospital on Wednesday evening. Witnesses told reporters Baxter had run from the car screaming, \u201che\u2019s poured petrol on me\u201d. Neighbours at the scene attempted to help the mother and children, including a man who \u201ctried his best to get to the car\u201d and received burns to his face. Prime minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday the country was grieving for the mother and her children. \u201cAustralians all over the country are just shocked, saddened and devastated about what has happened,\u201d he said. \u201cHannah and her three children so senselessly and maddeningly murdered in what has occurred in a terrible act of violence and it just grieves our hearts terribly today.\u201d On Wednesday Queensland MP Joe Kelly laid flowers at the scene and said he had been \u201csickened\u201d to hear the news. \u201cI think this would would rock any community,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are being killed by domestic violence every week in Australia and sadly it\u2019s now our community\u2019s turn. We have to continue to work really hard to stop people dying. \u201cTo do that we have to change our attitudes and culture and we have to make sure that we treat people with respect and relationships are based on collaboration, not control.\u201d The estranged couple had owned a fitness business called Integr8 and are believed to have separated before Christmas last year. The family was not involved in any family court or federal court proceedings. A former rugby league player and fitness coach, Rowan Baxter had been a member of the New Zealand Warriors NRL squad in the mid-2000s but did not play a first-grade game. His estranged wife was a trampolining champion. In the months leading up to the alleged attack his Facebook page was littered with pictures and videos of the three children and comments like \u201cloves them to the moon and back\u201d and \u201cdaddy misses you all\u201d. Six days ago a friend posted: \u201cChin up brother everything will work out just hang in there my bro a lot of people care about you and the situation your facing.\u201d Queensland police have yet to confirm whether they believe the attack was a murder-suicide. Neighbours reported hearing multiple explosions before seeing the SUV engulfed in flames in Raven Street about 8.30am on Wednesday. Neighbour Murray Campbell said he heard a number of loud bangs. \u201cIt was just horrible, multiple explosions, very loud,\u201d he said. A man who tried to help at the scene was also taken to hospital with facial burns. Childhood Domestic Violence Australia CEO Tracy McLeod Howe said it was a tragedy. In a statement on Wednesday afternoon police confirmed Rowan Baxter was declared dead at the scene after responding emergency crews attempted to revive him. \u201cPreliminary investigations indicate the woman was driving the car and the man was in the front passenger seat prior to the incident,\u201d police said in a statement. The Courier Mail reported the suburban Brisbane street had been blocked by crime tape at both ends, with police surrounding a car wrapped in orange plastic. Neighbour Murray Campbell said he heard a number of loud bangs which sounded \u201cvery much like a gas cylinder explosion\u201d. He said he called triple zero, and did not see anyone run from the car, which was engulfed in flames. Earlier, Queensland\u2019s police minister, Mark Ryan, briefed parliament about the incident and confirmed that the victims included children. \u201c[It is] a horrific incident,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe situation is at a very early stage and I am informed that police are investigating all of the circumstances surrounding this tragic set of events. \u201cMy thoughts are with all of those affected by this terrible tragedy.\u201d \u2022 If you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636",

      "bodyText": "A police officer has been charged with murder over the fatal shooting of an Aboriginal woman in Western Australia last year. The police officer, who was not named in court, appeared before the Perth Magistrates Court on Thursday afternoon and was referred to the Supreme Court for a bail hearing. He was arrested in Geraldton on Thursday morning. Joyce Clarke, 29, was shot dead by a police officer outside her house in Geraldton on 17 September. At the time, WA police said they were called to the Yamatji woman\u2019s house by her family, and that \u201cduring an incident at the address, an officer discharged their firearm causing a woman to receive a gunshot wound\u201d. Clarke\u2019s family said they called police for assistance in transferring her to hospital, because she was having \u201cdifficulty at home\u201d after being recently released from jail. Clarke\u2019s death prompted a snap protest in Geraldton and calls for greater oversight of deaths in police custody. Police conducted a critical incident review after the shooting, overseen by the corruption and crime commission. On Thursday, a spokesman for WA police said officers from the major crime squad arrested a police officer in Geraldton \u201cas a suspect in relation to the fatal shooting of Ms Clarke\u201d. \u201cMembers of Ms Clarke\u2019s family have been advised of this morning\u2019s developments, as have WA police force staff,\u201d the police statement said. \u201cAs this is an active investigation further information cannot be provided at this time and updates will be provided when possible.\u201d Anne Jones, Joyce\u2019s foster mother, told Guardian Australia: \u201cI\u2019ve been told that I cannot say anything that might influence a trial, but I\u2019m glad that steps have been taken to bring justice for Joyce. The whole Aboriginal community will watch this process with great interest.\u201d Her lawyer, George Newhouse from the National Justice Project, said \u201cAnne Jones has conducted herself with dignity throughout this traumatic and extended process. All she can do now is hope that there is a just outcome for her and her daughter.\u201d The WA Police Union said it was supporting the officer who was arrested on Thursday morning, including providing legal support. \u201cWe stand by the police officer 100% and will do throughout this ordeal,\u201d the union president, Harry Arnott, said.",

The ABC reported the government has advanced a proposal to change the Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s mandate, which would allow the agency \u2013 whose motto is to \u201creveal their secrets, protect our own\u201d \u2013 to spy on Australian citizens at home. Under the law, the ASD is banned from accessing Australian\u2019s online activity, limiting its surveillance powers to overseas based servers. News Corp national political editor Annika Smethurst first reported amendments were being considered to the ASD legislation in 2018. The story was strongly denied by the government at the time, and subsequently saw Smethurst embroiled in a press freedom fight after her home and office were raided by the Australian federal police. Dutton confirmed new powers which would change the ASD\u2019s domestic remit were still on the table in June last year, while refusing to confirm details of the proposal. The Australian federal police wants the power to be able to call in the ASD when its hunts for cyber criminals, including those related to child abuse and terrorism, lead back to Australian borders. But given the sensitivity, the AFP has also publicly shied away from confirming it is chasing the additional surveillance assistance. AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw told the National Press Club on Wednesday the Australian intelligence community was \u201cpretty happy with what [the AFP] have, but there are some challenges there in some additional legislation [that is required]\u201d. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right for me to ventilate that here,\u201d he said. Scott Morrison said Australia\u2019s crime and intelligence agencies would \u201cget what they need to protect kids\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that what happens in the real world should happen in the digital world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf thought someone was abusing a child somewhere, I would kick the door down. I would go and try to rescue that child. So those who want to abuse children shouldn\u2019t get to be able to hide in the internet. And if they are doing it, I am going to use every tool at my disposal to try to protect that child.\u201d The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, told the national broadcaster he believed it was time to have that conversation, a call he first made publicly mid last year. \u201cAt the moment, if there is a server in Sydney that has images of a five- or six-month-old child being sexually exploited and tortured, then that may not be discoverable, particularly if it\u2019s encrypted and protected to a point where the AFP or the Acic can\u2019t gain access to that server,\u201d Dutton told the ABC. \u201cIt can be a different picture if that server is offshore, so there is an anomaly that exists at the moment.\u201d The Australian Law Council president, Pauline Wright, said while protecting Australians remained the priority, there needed to be safeguards to ensure civil liberties were also protected. \u201cThis proposal would radically alter the current security landscape for how Australian Signals Directorate operates and there will need to be very strong safeguards in any such proposal,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Law Council would want to see the details of those safeguards to ensure they provide proper protections for the rights and freedoms that Australians rightly expect. \u201cThese rights and freedoms have already been eroded in recent years and should not be further undermined.\u201d The Greens senator Nick McKim said any proposal to expand the ASD\u2019s spy powers domestically should be rejected. \u201cIt\u2019s a proposal for the government to spy on Australians, in Australia.

Indonesia, the largest country in south-east Asia, claims to have no cases of coronavirus, but according to the Bali\u2019s tourism board, there have been around 40,000 cancellations of hotel bookings in recent weeks nonetheless. In the first half of February about 740,000 people visited the island \u2013 16.25% fewer than the same period last year \u2013 Bali\u2019s airport spokesman told state news agency Antara this week. Chinese tourists account for about one in six of the island\u2019s visitors, and since Indonesia banned all incoming flights from China on 5 February, their absence has hit hard. \u201cWe feel like there has been a significant downturn in terms of sales and customers,\u201d says Michelle Anindya, head of development at Seniman coffee studios in the popular tourist hub of Ubud, in central Bali. I Ketut Panjul, a driver based in Ubud, says the change has been very difficult: \u201cAs you know, tourism is the main part of our economy here. Ever since the government banned flights from China, it has been really slow,\u201d he said. January and February are already the low season in Bali, after the Christmas holiday bustle, but according to David Abraham, co-founder of Outpost, a co-working community with three locations on the island, \u201cthe main issue right now is the closed air travel routes from China\u201d. \u201cIt affects not only Chinese tourists but other Asian tourists as well,\u201d Abraham said, adding that demand from Australian and other non-Asian tourists had remained stable so far. Indonesia has been heavily criticised for potential under-reporting of coronavirus in its population of 262 million, especially after a Harvard public health study came out last week projecting that Indonesia should have found approximately five affected patients by now. Adang Bachtiar, a public health expert at the University of Indonesia, said Bali \u201cdoes not have the capacity\u201d to adequately treat patients if they become affected on the island. \u201cThe only laboratories that can even test for the virus right now are in Jakarta, so if someone were to get sick in Bali or Lombok, it\u2019s concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still very weak at both detection and management of this virus, especially outside Jakarta.\u201d More than 230 Indonesian citizens were evacuated from China and quarantined on Natuna Island for two weeks, but have reportedly all have tested negative for the virus and were released on Sunday. But there have been concerns about the Chinese man who was on holiday in Bali last month, from 22 to 28 January, and later tested positive for coronavirus on his return to China. Bali tourist officials say they have checked the hotel where he stayed and no one appears to have been affected. The World Health Organization says the general incubation period for the disease is 14 days. Business-related travel is also down: several conferences and meetings on Nusa Dua, a resort area in southern Bali, have been cancelled this month, preventing the arrival of at least 5,200 visitors, the managing director of the Indonesia Tourism Development Corporation says. \u201cBut Bali\u2019s been through a lot,\u201d notes Abraham. \u201cThe volcano [Mount Agung, which spewed ash in a minor eruption in 2019 ], before that the bombings, and so on \u2026 this is an ongoing cycle,\u201d he said, of events that cause temporary dips in tourism. Tara Louise, a 31-year-old British nail technician on holiday in Bali, says she is \u201cnot worried right now, as I think you should live in the moment, plus it is spreading worldwide currently so it\u2019s unsafe anywhere\u201d. She says she is more worried about passing through Singapore, which may lead to extra screening back in the UK. Regarding the general atmosphere in Bali, she says \u201cthere are a few face masks around but it\u2019s not too obvious, unlike in Thailand\u201d, where she has also recently been on holiday. Bali tourism officials have dug in their heels in recent days, arguing that, besides the slump in Chinese visitors, the island is doing fine. \u201cIt\u2019s a hoax,\u201d said Bali Tourism Agency head Putu Astawa last week, of media allegations that Bali was a \u201cghost town\u201d. Bali\u2019s health ministry also issued an \u201cOfficial Statement Regarding \u2018HOAX\u2019 Circulating About the Coronavirus\u201d asserting that zero cases have been detected on the archipelago so far. In Ubud, Michelle Anindya, head of development at Seniman coffee studios, says people are not outwardly scared or taking any major extra health precautions. \u201cNo one is really wearing face masks or panicking,\u201d she says, \u201cthough there are a lot of rumours floating around\u201d. One group of tourists that is not fazed is other Indonesians. \u201cIndonesians are delaying plans to travel overseas because of coronavirus, so they\u2019re opting for domestic destinations [like Bali] instead,\u201d says James Hutauruk, Jakarta-based founder of the Giga Great tour company, which caters to Indonesian travellers. \u201cWe are seeing a spike in requests for domestic packages.\u201d Accordingly, Astawat, head of the Bali Tourism Board, has asked the Indonesian president if he can discount domestic flight tickets. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 February 2020. An earlier version said a Harvard study had projected that Indonesia should have found \u201cat least 10\u201d people affected by coronavirus. In fact the study calculated an expected five cases, in a range from one to 11.",

As well as adopting the clear 2050 target that Scott Morrison appears reluctant to sign up to, in part because of rolling combat within the Coalition, Guardian Australia understands shadow cabinet has also decided to oppose using carryover credits from the Kyoto period to meet future emissions reduction targets.

Recent surveys suggest the number of horses in alpine areas has more than doubled in the past five years to more than 25,000. The population in the national park was estimated to have risen from 6,000 in 2014 to 19,000 in 2019, NPWS said. Extensive fires in the park this summer had caused further damage to the alpine areas as horses tried to escape, concentrating them in some areas. Managing the feral horses in alpine areas has long been a deeply contentious issue. The animals escaped from, or were abandoned by, colonisers in the 19th century. Kean\u2019s announcement came during an ABC radio interview on Wednesday morning and reported the outcome of a meeting of the Kosciuszko national park wild horse community advisory panel. Kean said: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time for a long time that we have had all the players at the table and it sounds like something we can live with. There was consensus among horse-lovers and national park-lovers about three areas where we need to completely remove the horses from.\u201d A monitoring program would be introduced, and fencing to prevent other horses moving in, he said. Asked if there would be a cull of the horses, he said all options were on the table but the focus would be on humane treatment of the animals, with physical removal the first option. He said the plan should help protect habitats of the vulnerable broad-toothed rat and critically endangered corroboree frogs. The advisory panel was convened after the wild horse management bill was introduced in 2018 by the NSW deputy premier, John Barilaro, whose Monaro seat covers parts of the park. Kean and Barilaro have clashed over the issue, but Kean credited Barilaro with establishing the process that led to the announcement. In a statement to Guardian Australia, Barilaro said the focus was \u201cto find a balance between the environment and the cultural connection of the brumbies to the Kosciuszko national park\u201d. He said: \u201cThis approach has proven that it can bring everyone together to let common sense prevail. It was this approach that identified the three areas of Kosciuszko national park that should see immediate reduction of horse numbers using humane methods. \u201cThere is a question mark around if there are in fact 4,000 horses in those areas, but regardless, the commitment we made to reduce horse numbers to a population of 3,000 still stands.\u201d The chief executive of the Invasive Species Council, Andrew Cox, said the announcement was a \u201cmajor step forward\u201d and a \u201cpositive initiative\u201d, especially after parts of the park had been hit by bushfires. He told Guardian Australia the new plan should be seen as an emergency measure that would be a saviour for the park\u2019s conservation in the aftermath of the fires. \u201cThere are thousands and thousands of horses \u2013 some were burned \u2013 and they are just making a mess of the park,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary that large numbers are removed because virtually nothing has been done for three years.\u201d Cox said the horses were driving species to extinction and the bushfires were now magnifying their impact.",

The administration\u2019s support could have major consequences in the case. From the Hill:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Google, backed by a broad swath of the tech industry, has argued that software developers and innovators rely on open APIs in order to create products that work together and build on one another.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Thursday\u2019s blog: Kari Paul in San Francisco, signing off for the night! Please turn to our separate live blog of tonight\u2019s Democratic debate, headed by politics reporter Maanvi Singh who is on the ground in Las Vegas. Before you go, here are the top stories of the night: The hashtag #AskBloomberg was trending on Twitter throughout the day ahead of tonight\u2019s debate, calling into question the former New York City mayor\u2019s past alleged personal digressions and policy choices. Former Elle magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll announced on Twitter Wednesday that she was fired from her previous job following intense backlash for revealing she was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump in the mid 1990s. A super PAC has been formed to support Elizabeth Warren. The Trump administration sided with software firm Oracle in an explosive copyright case against Google, shortly after its co-founder held a fundraiser for Donald Trump. Nevada Democrats will not say whether the caucus results will be released the day of the elections this week. Pop group TLC is performing at a Tom Steyer rally on Friday. Bernie Sanders denies he ever wanted to run against Barack Obama in 2012, despite a previous Atlantic story saying so. That\u2019s all, everyone! Again, follow Maanvi Singh for updates on tonight\u2019s debate. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign team is now staunchly denying a previous story that said the Senator attempted to challenge Barack Obama for the 2012 Democratic presidential nomination. An earlier report from the Atlantic\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere said Sanders was so seriously considering a run in 2012 that he had to be talked out of it by Senator Harry Reid. Reid is now saying he will not comment on the issue but that \u201cBernie was running for re-election in 2012. He would\u2019ve been a fool to run against Obama and Bernie\u2019s no fool\u201d. Ari Rabin Havt, campaign manager for Sanders, said the conversation never happened, and that it never \u201ccrossed his mind to challenge Obama\u201d. Today in unexpected celebrity presidential candidate endorsements: TLC is performing at a Tom Steyer rally this week in Nevada. Yes, that TLC, and yes, that Tom Steyer. The bestselling group known for 1990s hit singles including \u201cCreep\u201d, \u201cWaterfalls\u201d, and \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d will perform on Friday ahead of the Nevada caucuses. Despite the 2003 death of one of the three members, Lisa \u2018Left Eye\u2019 Lopes, the group still performs today, having come out with its most recent album in 2017. Want to know who wins Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses? Don\u2019t hold your breath. Democrats in the state have refused to commit to releasing results on the same day as the election following the disaster in Iowa\u2019s caucuses earlier this month. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee told the Associated Press that in this vote they will take care to emphasize accuracy over speed, so to avoid the struggles faced in Iowa, wherein an app malfunction delayed the results by days. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to release results as soon as possible, but our North Star, again, is accuracy,\u201d he said late Tuesday after touring an early voting site in Las Vegas. He said that high turnout, early voting, and other factors could make it more difficult to quickly tally all votes. Like Iowa, Nevada is for the first time reporting three stages of caucus votes rather than only the final vote. The Democratic party in Nevada had previously planned to use the same app used in Iowa to report votes, but abandoned the technology due to its failure in the first state to hold elections this year. It remains to be seen how Nevada\u2019s backup technology will work, and from the sounds of it, it may be slow going. The Trump administration is siding with software company Oracle in an ongoing copyright battle which major implications for tech giants. What has been referred to as \u201cthe copyright case of the decade\u201d will determine whether it is possible to copyright the computer code known as an application programming interface, or API, which allows software products to communicate with one another. In a Wednesday filing by the Department of Justice, the Trump administration said the Supreme court should rule in favor of Oracle, which claims that Google violated copyright law by copying 11,500 of the company\u2019s code more than a decade ago. The administration\u2019s support could have major consequences in the case. From the Hill: Google, backed by a broad swath of the tech industry, has argued that software developers and innovators rely on open APIs in order to create products that work together and build on one another. But Oracle, in a case that has bounced through lower courts for more than a decade, has alleged that Google exploitatively stole its code while building Android, which is today the world\u2019s most popular operating system. The Trump administration, including U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Joseph Hunt, the assistant attorney general of the DOJ\u2019s Civil Division, argued that \u201ccomputer programs are copyrightable\u201d and Oracle \u201cholds a valid copyright\u201d over the code in question. The Trump administration filed the brief in favor of Oracle just hours after the company\u2019s executive chairman Larry Ellison hosted a fundraiser for Donald Trump at his golf course in California. Oracle employees are planning a walk out in response to their executive\u2019s actions. A super PAC has formed to support presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, a noted critic of super PACs. Warren has frequently criticized the influence of big spending in politics, much of which is facilitated by PACS that are allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to support a candidate. This PAC, called Persist PAC, filed papers on Tuesday and has already launched a pro-Warren ad in Nevada ahead of the debates there on Wednesday. Warren\u2019s campaign told the Washington Post her position on PACs has still not changed. \u201cSince day one of this campaign, she has made clear that she thinks all of the candidates should lock arms together and say we don\u2019t want super pacs and billionaires to be deciding our Democratic nominee,\u201d the campaign said. Former ELLE magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, who in 2019 accused Donald Trump of raping her in the mid 1990s, said on Wednesday she was fired from her editorial position over backlash to coming forward. \u201cBecause Trump ridiculed my reputation, laughed at my looks, &amp; dragged me through the mud, after 26 years, ELLE fired me,\u201d Carroll wrote on Twitter. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Elle. It was the great honor of my life writing \u2018Ask E. Jean.\u2019\u201d The 76 year old revealed she had been sexually assaulted by the president in an excerpt from her 2019 book \u201cWhat Do We Need Men For?\u201d published by New York magazine. From NBC News: Trump has not only repeatedly denied the allegation, but has also denied ever meeting Carroll. When presented with a picture in which they were both photographed at a 1987 party alongside Carroll\u2019s former husband, John Johnson, Trump maintained that he had \u201cno idea\u201d who Carroll is. Carroll sued Trump for defamation in New York State Court in November, after which her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, had the black wool dress Carroll was wearing at the time of the alleged attack tested for DNA. Last month, Carroll\u2019s counsel served notice to Trump\u2019s lawyers for the president to submit a DNA sample by March 2 to see if he matched the unidentified male DNA found on the outfit. Yet, earlier this month, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that Carroll\u2019s defamation suit should be delayed until New York\u2019s highest court rules on whether former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant Summer Zervos, who has also accused Trump of assault and defamation, can proceed with a somewhat similar suit. Trump has denied Zervos\u2019 allegations. Ahead of his first debate in the race to the 2020 presidential elections, Michael Bloomberg is under fire over past statements, behavior, and policies as New York City mayor. The hashtag #AskBloomberg trended on Twitter on Wednesday, encouraging moderators to inquire into the candidate\u2019s past transphobic and sexist remarks, allegations of sexual misconduct, his support of the Iraq war, and policies affecting minority populations implemented while he was mayor of New York City. Hashtags were not Bloomberg\u2019s only problem on Twitter on Wednesday: he also exchanged insults with Donald Trump and rival candidate Joe Biden. The trend on Twitter represented a grassroots response to Bloomberg\u2019s extensive media campaign as he pursues the presidential office, on which he has already spent millions of dollars in advertising. Hello readers, Kari Paul in San Francisco here, taking over the blog from the West Coast. Stay tuned for more updates soon. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Kari Paul, will take over the blog for a few hours before we begin our special debate coverage from Las Vegas. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Mike Bloomberg and Trump traded insults over Twitter as the former New York mayor prepares for his first debate performance tonight. Bloomberg also attracted criticism from some of his Democratic rivals, including Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Sanders attacked Bloomberg for previously suggesting changes to Social Security and Medicare, while Biden criticized Bloomberg for incorporating Barack Obama into his ads even though he did not endorse Obama in 2008. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign criticized Sanders\u2019 press secretary for falsely claiming that Bloomberg had previously suffered heart attacks, as Sanders faces renewed scrutiny over his health following his own heart attack in the fall. The White House denied a claim from Julian Assange\u2019s lawyer that the WikiLeaks founder was offered a pardon if he denied Russian involvement in the 2016 leaking of Democratic emails. John Rood, a senior official at the Pentagon who raised concerns about the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military assistance, resigned, saying his departure was \u201crequested\u201d by the president. Kari will have more coming up, and the Guardian\u2019s west coast team will later be blogging from the Las Vegas debate, so stay tuned. The next debate is just a few hours away, but CBS News has announced the moderators for the tenth Democratic debate, which the outlet will host next Tuesday. \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell and \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-host Gayle King will moderate the debate, alongside \u201cFace the Nation\u201d moderator Margaret Brennan and chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. The debate will take place next Tuesday in Charleston, South Carolina, and it will be the final debate before the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday. The six candidates participating tonight have already qualified, and billionaire activist Tom Steyer hopes he can meet the delegate or polling requirements by the deadline. Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign said the candidate would not be standing on anything to boost his height during tonight\u2019s debate, despite Trump\u2019s claims to the contrary. The president has repeatedly referred to Bloomberg as \u201cMini Mike\u201d in tweets to mock the former New York mayor for his height. (But as the AP has pointed out, Bloomberg is not quite as short as Trump has claimed.) Bloomberg fired back at Trump last week, saying during a campaign event in North Carolina, \u201cHe calls me Little Mike and the answer is, \u2018Donald, where I come from we measure your height from your neck up.\u2019\u201d The White House said that Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke over the phone yesterday. \u201cThe two leaders discussed the importance of NATO, French and United States counterterrorism efforts in the Sahel, and other bilateral issues,\u201d the readout says. France said earlier this month that it would increase its troop presence in Africa\u2019s Sahel region, and during the Munich Security Conference this weekend, some congressional Republicans tried to convince defense secretary Mark Esper not to withdraw US forces from the region. Bernie Sanders may also be asked about this during tonight\u2019s debate: the Atlantic is reporting that the Vermont senator considered challenging Barack Obama for the 2012 Democratic nomination. The Atlantic reports: Bernie Sanders got so close to running a primary challenge to President Barack Obama that Senator Harry Reid had to intervene to stop him. It took Reid two conversations over the summer of 2011 to get Sanders to scrap the idea, according to multiple people who remember the incident, which has not been previously reported. That summer, Sanders privately discussed a potential primary challenge to Obama with several people, including Patrick Leahy, his fellow Vermont senator. Leahy, alarmed, warned Jim Messina, Obama\u2019s presidential reelection-campaign manager. ... Messina called Reid, then the Senate majority leader, who had built a strong relationship with Sanders but was also fiercely defensive of Obama. What could you be thinking? Reid asked Sanders, according to multiple people who remember the conversations. You need to stop. Some of Sanders\u2019 critics will likely point to the potential Obama challenge to resurrect questions about the Vermont senator\u2019s loyalty to the Democratic party, although Sanders\u2019 allies have dismissed those concerns by pointing to the fact that the independent lawmaker has consistently caucused with Democrats. It seems like all of Mike Bloomberg\u2019s opponents are joining in on attacking him before his first debate appearance tonight. Bernie Sanders tweeted a video criticizing the former New York mayor for previously suggesting changes to benefits programs like Social Security and Medicare. Bloomberg will likely come under fire from each of his five opponents on the debate stage tonight, but Sanders may also be trying to deflect some of the criticism away from himself. As the clear frontrunner in the race, Sanders is also likely to attract criticism from fellow candidates. A new poll of South Carolina Democrats shows Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders statistically tied in the early voting state. According to the UMass-Lowell/YouGov poll, Biden is attracting the support of 23% of South Carolina Democrats, putting him 2 points ahead of Bernie Sanders, which is well within the poll\u2019s 7.5-point margin of error. After disappointing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden is counting on strong showings in Nevada and especially South Carolina to regain some of his lost support. If he cannot pull off a win in South Carolina, before he goes on to the Super Tuesday states where he will have to face Mike Bloomberg, it could doom his candidacy. Tom Steyer, who will not be on the Democratic debate stage tonight but remains in the race, will start running an ad next week spotlighting Mike Bloomberg\u2019s controversial stop and frisk policy. The policy, which Bloomberg supported while he was mayor of New York, has been accused of unfairly targeting young men of color. In the ad, a narrator describes the policy, along with Bloomberg\u2019s comments about redlining, as \u201cracist.\u201d Steyer, who like Bloomberg is using his personal fortune to bankroll his candidacy, said the ad would run as part of a seven-figure buy across Super Tuesday states starting Monday. There\u2019s some reason to doubt the White House\u2019s claim that Trump \u201cbarely knows Dana Rohrabacher,\u201d the former Republican congressman who allegedly offered a pardon to WikiLeaks Julian Assange. Assange\u2019s lawyer said Rohrabacher offered him a pardon \u201con instructions from the president\u201d if Assange denied Russian involvement with the 2016 leaking of Democratic emails. Trump\u2019s press secretary called that claim a \u201ccomplete fabrication and a total lie.\u201d \u201cThe President barely knows Dana Rohrabacher other than he\u2019s an ex-congressman,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham. But Trump and Rohrabacher had a 45-minute meeting in 2017, and the president congratulated the infamously pro-Russia congressman on his primary victory the next year. Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg continue to attack each other over Twitter, likely previewing a contentious debate later tonight. Biden reacted to a video from Bloomberg featuring a glowing speech the former vice president gave about him in 2013 by calling out Bloomberg\u2019s past party affiliation as a Republican. Biden made similar comments moments ago while campaigning in Nevada, criticizing Bloomberg for including Barack Obama in his campaign ads when he refused to endorse Obama in 2008. The White House has denied a report that Trump offered a pardon to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange if he said Russia was not involved in the leaking of Democratic emails. According to Assange\u2019s lawyer, the former Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher extended the offer during a 2017 visit with Assange. Assange\u2019s lawyer said in a statement that Rohrabacher made clear he was offering a pardon to Assange, who is now fighting efforts to extradite him to the US, \u201con instructions from the president\u201d. But the White House called this story \u201ca complete fabrication and a total lie\u201d in a statement. \u201cThe President barely knows Dana Rohrabacher other than he\u2019s an ex-congressman,\u201d said the press secretary, Stephanie Grisham. \u201cHe\u2019s never spoken to him on this subject or almost any subject. It is is a complete fabrication and a total lie.\u201d An alum of Cambridge Analytica, the firm accused of improperly handling Facebook data, is reportedly now helping lead the Trump campaign\u2019s data program. Politico reports: Matt Oczkowski, who served as head of product at Cambridge before it went bankrupt and shut down in 2018, is helping oversee the Trump campaign\u2019s data program, according to two people familiar with the hire. Cambridge gained notoriety for its work on psychological voter profiling and because it allegedly improperly obtained the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users. The hiring of Oczkowski will likely intensify Democrats\u2019 fears about the online tactics Trump\u2019s campaign will deploy this year, although the president\u2019s advisers have claimed they did not use Cambridge data during the 2016 race. Democratic presidential candidates are previewing their strategies for tonight\u2019s debate on social media. After Joe Biden released a video earlier today criticizing Mike Bloomberg for opposing some of the Obama administration\u2019s policies, Bloomberg is now out with an ad attacking Biden. The video includes footage from a 2013 speech Biden gave praising Bloomberg\u2019s initiatives on gun control and climate change as mayor of New York. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone in my career \u2013 and I\u2019ve been hanging around a long time \u2013 who does more to create the future than you, Mike,\u201d Biden says in the ad. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump and Mike Bloomberg traded insults over Twitter, as the former New York mayor prepares for his first debate performance tonight. Advisers for Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders also sparred after Sanders\u2019 press secretary falsely claimed that Bloomberg had previously suffered a heart attack. Sanders has surged to the top of national polls, taking a double-digit lead over Bloomberg, who is also gaining steam. Trump continues to tweet about the justice department, despite reports that the attorney general, William Barr, is considering quitting over the president\u2019s Twitter activity. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump defended Rod Blagojevich in a tweet, saying the former Illinois governor did not sell a US Senate seat. But Blagojevich, who was commuted by Trump yesterday, was rather infamously recorded trying to sell the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama when he became president. \u201cI\u2019ve got this thing and it\u2019s fucking golden,\u201d Blagojevich was recorded saying. \u201cI\u2019m just not giving it up for fuckin\u2019 nothing. I\u2019m not gonna do it.\u201d Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich profusely thanked Trump for commuting his prison sentence in a press conference today. \u201cWe want to express our most profound and everlasting gratitude to President Trump,\u201d said Blagojevich, appearing alongside his family. \u201cHow do you properly thank someone who\u2019s given you back the freedom that was stolen from you?\u201d The former Democratic governor praised Trump\u2019s \u201ckind heart\u201d and said he would vote for the president if he can, calling himself a \u201cTrumpocrat\u201d. But others are less thrilled about Blagojevich\u2019s commutation, considering he was caught on tape trying to sell a Senate seat. A group of House Republicans from Illinois released a statement yesterday calling Blagojevich \u201cthe face of public corruption\u201d in the state and saying they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Trump\u2019s decision. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo condemned China for expelling three Wall Street Journal reporters over a critical op-ed published by the newspaper. The Journal has more on the reporters\u2019 expulsion: China revoked the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in Beijing, the first time in the post-Mao era that the Chinese government has expelled multiple journalists from one international news organization at the same time. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the move Wednesday was punishment for a recent opinion piece published by the Journal. Deputy Bureau Chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both U.S. nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian national, have been ordered to leave the country within five days, said Jonathan Cheng, the Journal\u2019s China bureau chief. In a new video, Joe Biden\u2019s campaign appeared to preview how the former vice president would confront Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage tonight. The video highlights Bloomberg\u2019s past clashes with the Obama administration, including the former New York mayor\u2019s criticism of the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform. The video concludes: \u201cMoney can\u2019t rewrite history.\u201d Bloomberg has incorporated Barack Obama into his campaign ads, irking some of the former president\u2019s allies who note Bloomberg did not endorse Obama in 2008. From a former national security council spokesperson under the Obama administration: White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley justified Trump\u2019s recent spate of commutations and pardons by saying the president is \u201cagainst aggressive sentencing.\u201d Gidley\u2019s comment was met with a hefty dose of skepticism, considering Trump\u2019s vocal support for the death penalty and his refusal to acknowledge the innocence of the wrongly convicted Central Park Five. Trump granted clemency yesterday to 11 people, including former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was caught on tape trying to sell a US Senate seat. In his resignation letter, senior Pentagon official John Rood noted that Trump had \u201crequested\u201d his departure. Rood was involved in approving Ukraine\u2019s receipt of US military assistance, and he reportedly raised concerns about the freeze on the funds, the issue at the heart of Trump\u2019s impeachment. As Mike Bloomberg fields complaints from his opponents about how he is using his personal wealth in the presidential primary, his campaign is reportedly launching an unusual effort to boost the billionaire candidate\u2019s mentions on social media. The Bloomberg campaign intends to pay hundreds of staffers $2,500 a month to post positive messages about the former New York mayor on their personal accounts. The Wall Street Journal reports: The effort, which could cost millions of dollars, is launching ahead of California\u2019s March 3 primary and could later be deployed nationwide, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. It is one of the most unorthodox yet by the heavy-spending billionaire and blurs the lines between traditional campaign organizing and the distribution of sponsored content. Most campaigns encourage their supporters to post on social media about their candidates, but paying them at this scale to express support on their personal accounts is unusual, experts say. ... To staff the effort, the campaign is hiring more than 500 \u2018deputy digital organizers\u2019 to work 20 to 30 hours a week and receive $2,500 a month, the documents show. In exchange, those workers are expected to promote Mr. Bloomberg to everyone in their phones\u2019 contacts by text each week and make social-media posts supporting him daily, the documents show. The effort will almost certainly intensify accusations from Bloomberg\u2019s opponents that he is attempting to use his $50bn fortune to \u201cbuy this election\u201d. Trump has confirmed that John Rood, a senior official at the Pentagon, is leaving the administration. Rood reportedly raised concerns about the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military assistance, which was at the center of Trump\u2019s impeachment. CNN explains: Rood is the Pentagon\u2019s top policy official and oversees aspects of the Pentagon\u2019s relationship with US allies and partners. Rood was involved in certifying to Congress that Ukraine had embarked on significant reforms to justify its receipt of $250 million in security assistance. That certification undermined one of the justifications -- concerns about corruption in Kiev -- that some members of the Trump administration made to defend blocking aid to Ukraine. Hours after Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which kicked off impeachment proceedings, Rood emailed Secretary of Defense Mark Esper -- who had been in the job two days -- informing him about an upcoming deputies meeting, \u2018to discuss the President\u2019s concern about endemic corruption in Ukraine and his reported view that US should cease providing security assistance,\u2019 according to emails reviewed by CNN. Rood notes in his email to the secretary that \u2018placing a hold on security assistance at this time would jeopardize this unique window of opportunity and undermine our defense priorities with a key partner in the strategic competition with Russia.\u2019 While some of his advisers spar with Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign, Mike Bloomberg is aiming his fire at Trump after the president accused him (without evidence) of violating campaign finance laws. Trump has repeatedly accused Bloomberg of violating campaign finance laws by receiving endorsements from lawmakers who have benefitted from Bloomberg\u2019s political contributions, even though such activity is not illegal. In recent days, Trump has used his bully pulpit against Bloomberg more than any other Democratic presidential candidate, even as the former New York mayor trails Bernie Sanders in the polls. But the president and Bloomberg have traded public insults frequently since the latter endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and mocked Trump\u2019s business practices at the Democratic National Convention. \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s running his business? God help us,\u201d Bloomberg said at the time. Briahna Joy Gray, Bernie Sanders\u2019 press secretary, said she misspoke when she falsely claimed Mike Bloomberg had previously suffered a heart attack. Gray emphasized Bloomberg and Sanders have both had coronary stents put in, but only Sanders underwent that procedure after suffering a heart attack. Gray also criticized Bloomberg for a tweet from his campaign manager attacking Sanders\u2019 supporters as \u201cBernie bros\u201d: The two campaigns are escalating their attacks on each other before tonight\u2019s debate, when Sanders and Bloomberg will face off for the first time as polls show them leading nationally. After his withdrawal from the Democratic presidential primary, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang is joining CNN as a political commentator. Yang based his long-shot campaign around his proposal for universal basic income, and he attracted enough support and donors to outlast much more \u201cestablished\u201d candidates. But Yang suspended his campaign last week after receiving only 3% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary. After dropping out, Yang told BuzzFeed News: \u201cThere\u2019s part of me that feels disappointed, like I didn\u2019t fulfill some people\u2019s goals for this campaign.\u201d He then memorably added: \u201cThere\u2019s also a competitive part of me, too \u2013 like I can\u2019t believe I lost to these people.\u201d Trump is once again lashing out against Mike Bloomberg, mocking the Democratic candidate for his height and accusing him (without evidence) of violating campaign finance laws. Trump has previously criticized Bloomberg for receiving endorsements from members of Congress who have benefitted from the billionaire\u2019s political donations, but that activity is not illegal. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen is currently serving time in prison after pleading guilty to violating campaign finance laws (among other charges). Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign responded to a false claim from Bernie Sanders\u2019 press secretary that Bloomberg had previously suffered heart attacks by releasing a statement on his health. In it, campaign manager Kevin Sheekey noted Bloomberg had coronary stents put in 20 years ago after a positive stress test, but he emphasized the candidate has never suffered a heart attack, as Sanders did this fall. Trump continues to ignore attorney general William Barr\u2019s advice to stop tweeting about the justice department. Barr said in an interview last week that Trump\u2019s tweets make his job \u201cimpossible\u201d, and he has reportedly threatened to quit over the president\u2019s Twitter activity (although a justice department spokesperson denied those reports). However, if Trump continues to tweet about justice department affairs, Barr may have to follow through on his reported threat. Ahead of tonight\u2019s Democratic debate, advisers for Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg are attacking each other, as polls show the two candidates leading nationally. During a CNN interview this morning, Sanders\u2019 press secretary was asked about whether the frontrunner should release more medical records, considering his heart attack this fall. In response, Briahna Joy Gray argued Sanders was being held to a double standard, considering Bloomberg had also \u201csuffered heart attacks in the past\u201d. But Bloomberg\u2019s campaign quickly clarified that the billionaire candidate has never had a heart attack, with one adviser calling Gray\u2019s claim \u201ca Trumpy lie\u201d. The confrontation comes as Sanders faces more questions about his health and concerns about him being the oldest president ever elected if he wins in November. During a CNN town hall last night, Sanders said he would not be releasing full medical records. \u201cWe have released quite as much documentation as any other candidate has,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI think we have released a detailed medical report and I\u2019m comfortable on what we have done.\u201d There\u2019s been a boost for Joe Biden ahead of the critical Super Tuesday set of primaries on 3 March. Sylvia Garcia, one of the first two Latina congresswomen from Texas, has endorsed him in public as early voting has begun in the state. \u201cThe vice-president is probably one of the most qualified people I\u2019ve seen run for president,\u201d the 69-year-old Garcia told Associated Press. \u201cHaving worked his way up from city hall to working side by side with President Obama is a story in itself. \u201cHe\u2019s not forgotten where he came from. He\u2019s proven himself. We know who he is. And like us, and I\u2019m talking about Latinos when I say \u2018us,\u2019 he has a strong sense of social justice and a deep respect for humankind as a Catholic.\u201d Early voting started in Texas on Tuesday, and closes on 28 February, giving Texans 10 days to express their preference before the voting on Super Tuesday itself. Garcia served as an impeachment manager during the Senate trial of Donald Trump. Tom Perez, chair of the Democratic National Committee, has been on CNN this morning attempting to reassure people that the fiasco of counting at the Iowa caucuses won\u2019t be repeated at the weekend. He said he had \u201ca lot of confidence in Nevada. We have gone to school over the lessons of Iowa. We are as low-tech as is humanly possible, while still preserving efficiency.\u201d He also hinted that there could be a higher than usual turn-out in Nevada, enabled partly by the change in the rules to allow early voting. Describing the math of the early voting phase as \u201cremarkable\u201d, Perez said \u201cIn the first three days there were 36,000 early voters. We had 84,000 total participants in 2016. And that 36,000 doesn\u2019t include yesterday, which I think may have been the biggest day of them all.\u201d Having visited several sites in the state, he said he put the expected increase down to people just \u201cwanting this president out\u201d. Another potential diplomatic row between the US and China has been opened up with the decision by Chinese authorities to revoke the press credentials of three journalists from the Wall Street Journal. The Chinese had objected to a column that was published naming China as the \u201creal sick man of Asia\u201d. The column had criticised China\u2019s efforts to combat the coronavirus epidemic. Despite none of them working on the piece in question, the three journalists - two American and one Australian - have been ordered to leave the country within five days. The Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of China has issued a statement via Twitter describing the move as \u201can extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organizations by taking retribution against their China-based correspondents\u201d adding that \u201cChina has not outright expelled a foreign correspondent since 1998, as far as the FCCC is aware.\u201d 2020 may not be a year that \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid!\u201d holds true for the top priorities of the US voter. A new joint poll by Politico and Harvard that has come out this morning which suggests that healthcare costs are going to trump the health of the economy as the number one concern. Regardless of party affiliation, some 80% of voters rated \u201ctaking steps to lower the cost of health care\u201d as \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d important, and there was a similar level of support for \u201creducing prescription-drug costs\u201d. The two issues polled higher than any structural changes to the healthcare system. It certainly seems unlikely to be the climate crisis election that some people have been calling for. The climate crisis ranked only 11th among voters concerns, with \u201cjust 52 % overall agreeing that it was crucial to drastically increase federal spending and regulation to combat the issue\u201d. In the last couple of hours the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has arrived in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. He had just been in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he was addressing the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. The Department of State have published a video of his talk, where he spoke of his love of entrepreneurs, saying: \u201cI love risk-takers and those people willing to just go out and crush it every day.\u201d He introduced several businesswomen who were beneficiaries of the White House\u2019s Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. State department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus re-iterated Pompeo\u2019s message. Pompeo also had to cope with a lapel-mic failure that left him delivering the first minute of his speech to an auditorium that couldn\u2019t actually hear him. The trip to Saudi Arabia is Pompeo\u2019s first visit since top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was killed by US forces. Before leaving Ethiopa, Pompeo said of the visit to Saudi Arabia: \u201cWe\u2019ll spend a lot of time talking about the security issues with the threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran in particular. \u201cThe pressure campaign continues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an economic pressure campaign, it\u2019s diplomatic pressures, isolation through diplomacy as well.\u201d Donald Trump doesn\u2019t get to take part in the set-piece election TV debates yet, but he certainly can\u2019t seem to keep away from them. Approaching Saturday\u2019s Nevada Democratic caucuses, the Trump campaign have chosen the day of the Democrats debate to publish a full-page ad attacking the leading candidates in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the city where it takes place. The advert, which pictures Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, declares that \u201cDemocrats will kill Nevada jobs\u201d and promises that \u201cBig government socialism will wreck the economy\u201d. It goes on to extol Trump\u2019s record in office. An image of it was tweeted out by Sarah Matthews, part of the Trump campaign\u2019s press team. CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto and Barbara Starr have been reporting that John Rood, currently undersecretary of defense for policy at the Pentagon, is expected to depart his role. According to their sources, Rood has \u201clost support among senior national security leadership and has been asked for his resignation\u201d. The Pentagon has declined to comment. Rood had been instrumental in implementing Trump\u2019s National Defense Strategy. A new poll this morning from ABC News and the Washington Post has firmly put Bernie Sanders into the lead ahead of tonight\u2019s debate in Las Vegas. The Vermont senator now commands 32% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, according to the poll. That\u2019s up eight points since the previous ABC News/Washington Post poll on 23 January. The poll also reflects the stalled momentum of Joe Biden\u2019s run for the White House. Long considered the party establishment favourite, over the same period his support has slumped to 17%, which is down 11 points. Mike Bloomberg is still behind Biden \u2013 on 14%, but that\u2019s a rise of six points in a few weeks. Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg also made slight gains, with 6% and 7% support respectively, while Elizabeth Warren remained unchanged on 11% support. The numbers will buoy the Sanders and Bloomberg teams going into the debate, but indicate again how much the other four contenders needs some kind of break-out moment tonight to reignite their campaigns If you\u2019d like something to listen to over breakfast this morning, then Wednesday\u2019s edition of Today In Focus might fit the bill. Our tech reporter Julia Carrie Wong spent a year analysing Trump\u2019s Facebook campaign. In this podcast she discusses how the sophisticated social media machine is targeting voters with nearly $20m spent on more than 218,000 different ads. Tonight\u2019s debate will be a test for Mike Bloomberg\u2019s strategy of bypassing Iowa and New Hampshire, and only getting his campaign into full stride ahead of his main aim \u2013 Super Tuesday on 3 March. Skipping the opening caucuses and primaries has never worked for a candidate in modern times. Democratic strategist Brian Brokaw has told Associated Press that for his first debate appearance: \u201cHe is going to have a giant target on his back from all sides. It\u2019ll either all come together brilliantly or could fall apart very quickly. The stakes are just incredibly high for him.\u201d There\u2019s a question mark over Bloomberg\u2019s readiness for the format. The last time he was on a debate stage was in 2009, and during his campaigns to be New York City mayor he never faced more than one challenger at a time. It is likely that the other five candidates will seize on their first opportunity to confront him in person. And there\u2019s been a lot emerging to confront him over during the last few days, as a series of past comments from Bloomberg about race have been highlighted. My colleague Adam Gabbatt has gathered together the most explosive quotes here. They are guaranteed to come up in Las Vegas tonight. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign. though, are promising to tackle the other contenders head on. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see us go toe-to-toe with Bernie Sanders on important issues\u201d said Bloomberg\u2019s senior adviser Tim O\u2019Brien, citing questions about Sanders\u2019 own personal wealth, and his record on criminal justice and gun control. Here\u2019s Sam Levin with more \u2026 Department of Justice spokesperson Kerri Kupec has attempted to quash the rumours that the attorney general, William Barr, has considered resigning over Trump\u2019s repeated tweeted interference in the Roger Stone case. She used her official account overnight to state: \u201cAddressing Beltway rumors: The Attorney General has no plans to resign.\u201d Stone is still expected to be sentenced tomorrow. Good morning. The main focus today for the Democratic challengers for the presidential election nomination is tonight\u2019s televised debate in Las Vegas. After a controversial change of qualifying rules let him in, former mayor of New York Mike Bloomberg will be making his debate debut. It\u2019s his chance to put his mouth where so far mostly his advertising money has been. He takes the stage mired in controversy about his record on race and a whole series of comments that have re-emerged to haunt his campaign. Joe Biden\u2019s flagging campaign could do with a blockbuster performance from the former vice-president in the debate tonight, which could help shape the outcome of Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses and the South Carolina primary the following week. It all starts at 6pm Pacific time, and will last for two hours. NBC and MSNBC will air it, and it will also be available to stream online. Donald Trump, meanwhile, is heading to Phoenix for his latest \u201cKeep America Great\u201d evening rally at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum. His day is likely to be dogged by continued controversy over his comments about Roger Stone\u2019s conviction and upcoming sentencing for witness tampering and lying to Congress, and the pardons he issued on Tuesday. The president\u2019s flurry of tweets about Stone yesterday, where he said \u201cEverything having to do with this fraudulent investigation is badly tainted\u201d may have pushed attorney general, William Barr, closer to the edge. Administration officials told the Washington Post and Associated Press that Barr has said to people people close to him that he is considering quitting his post. Having falsely claimed, in relation to the Stone case that \u201cI\u2019m actually, I guess, the chief law enforcement officer of the country\u201d the president also raised eyebrows yesterday by pardoning the swamp, rather than draining it. Among a handful of pardons issued on Tuesday was one to former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. Blagojevich\u2019s 14-year prison sentence for political corruption was commuted. The 63-year-old Democrat had been found guilty of crimes that included seeking to sell an appointment to Barack Obama\u2019s old Senate seat. Expect the row about that to continue rumbling today.",

By inviting the U2 frontman Bono to speak to his players a few days before Ireland face England, and by bringing the former captain Paul O\u2019Connell into camp for the week, Farrell\u2019s message to his squad is clear.

      "bodyText": "Andy Farrell hopes he has found what he\u2019s looking for. By inviting the U2 frontman Bono to speak to his players a few days before Ireland face England, and by bringing the former captain Paul O\u2019Connell into camp for the week, Farrell\u2019s message to his squad is clear. Identity matters. \u201cIrishness\u201d is something to be proud of and to be used to their advantage. If that sounds familiar it is because Eddie Jones, his opposite number on Sunday, has been trying to do the same thing with England since taking over in 2016. Indeed, he writes about it at length in his recently published autobiography and claims that, out of all the countries he was worked with, instilling an identity in his England team has been the hardest. His predecessor, Stuart Lancaster, tried with limited success too and it cannot be coincidence that Farrell has worked under both at Saracens and England respectively. But he is undaunted by their difficulties. \u201c[The idea] is to reiterate what it really means to be a proud Irishman,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cI suppose it means a little bit different to each individual but just understanding the connection as a whole, not just to the people in Ireland, not just those at Twickenham but that live in the UK as well, what it means to families going over there.\u201d It is a topic about which Farrell speaks eloquently and, listening to his players, they were evidently in thrall to Bono, who talked to the squad for an hour and 40 minutes.

There\u2019s a lot of angles he went on but he did touch on it and how the Irish are perceived abroad and how they\u2019re liked.\u201d CJ Stander, one of the form players of the Six Nations so far, was born in South Africa but qualified for Ireland on residency.

We know it\u2019s not going to be ideal conditions but we\u2019ve trained in these sort of conditions before we left Australia and preparing ourselves for what could be over here. We\u2019ve all prepared through the pre-season as best we can to play this game.

His club side made history last year, while NSW are gunning for a hat-trick of Origin series wins this season. An Ashes series is also on the horizon, as is a first World Cup with the Kangaroos next year. But at his heart the 27-year-old has not changed, despite stardom seeming to sit so easily on his shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cI still stick really close to a lot of my friends outside of footy, that sort of keeps me grounded,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how I am, I don\u2019t really like to brag or big-note myself. I still feel like I\u2019m a normal kid from Camden.

But Tedesco insists his team will be ready for the test, despite the high-profile omissions and playing no warm-up games. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy as it\u2019s our first game of 2020, but also it\u2019s the last piece of the puzzle for 2019 as well,\u201d he says. \u201c[We] have that motivation to finish off that year well. We know it\u2019s not going to be ideal conditions but we\u2019ve trained in these sort of conditions before we left Australia and preparing ourselves for what could be over here. We\u2019ve all prepared through the pre-season as best we can to play this game. It\u2019s always been on the front of our minds that it\u2019s a big test for our first game of the year.\u201d Collecting more silverware seems to be Tedesco\u2019s modus operandi these days. His club side made history last year, while NSW are gunning for a hat-trick of Origin series wins this season. An Ashes series is also on the horizon, as is a first World Cup with the Kangaroos next year. But at his heart the 27-year-old has not changed, despite stardom seeming to sit so easily on his shoulders. \u201cI still stick really close to a lot of my friends outside of footy, that sort of keeps me grounded,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how I am, I don\u2019t really like to brag or big-note myself. I still feel like I\u2019m a normal kid from Camden. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve always been and I don\u2019t think that will ever change.\u201d The fullback still believes his best is yet to come, and becomes animated by discussion about the Kiwi phenomenon and current Golden Boot holder, Roger Tuivisa-Sheck. Like Ali and Frazier, the two freakishly-talented fullbacks have a growing rivalry that is set to delight fans for years to come. Tedesco getting better remains a scary thought for opponents who have nightmares about his crab-like runs that break defences open at will and usually end in tries. St Helens will get the first look at the modest but majestic outside back this weekend. \u201cThe last two years of the Roosters have been really successful and I\u2019ve been playing some really good footy on the field,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I still think there\u2019s room for improvement. I can still get better. Obviously I\u2019m really happy and proud of what I\u2019ve been doing, but I\u2019m still excited about what I can improve on and get better at in the coming years. \u201cI\u2019ve just turned 27 so I still think I\u2019m in my prime and still working hard on the field to get better every day.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s chief tax fraud investigator says offshore accountants and lawyers who assist in hiding the assets of criminals and the rich from authorities will face the full force of a five country taskforce. Simon York, director of fraud investigations at Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, said the joint chiefs of global tax enforcement, or J5, a group made up of revenue authorities from the UK, US, Australia, the Netherlands and Canada, were focusing on professionals who helped set up structures used to hide money from authorities in high-tax jurisdictions. The J5 met in Sydney on Wednesday following a \u201cday of action\u201d last month on which authorities launched raids and other action against customers of a South American bank. York said most professionals did the right thing but a small minority helped set up complex structures used to evade tax. \u201cOver centuries tax evasion has relied on secrecy, on hiding their assets, their wealth, but things have changed dramatically really over the last decade,\u201d York said. He said secrecy was not as effective in a world where tax authorities were able to swap information and had access to leaks such as the Panama and Paradise papers that laid bare who owned what in the offshore world. \u201cWe found really clearly increasing complexity of this type of activity. \u201cYou\u2019re typically using a web of different things \u2013 trusts, crypto assets, complex corporate structures, informal currency services, all used together and in concert. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing people using multiple jurisdictions and some of those jurisdictions changing. \u201cWe have investigations where we\u2019ll see sometimes hundreds of companies stretching across the globe. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly challenging to investigate.\u201d This complexity led to \u201cincreased involvement of professionals\u201d in organising tax avoidance, he said. He said \u201cloads\u201d of professionals were competent and did the right thing, some lacked skills and needed help and some were \u201cdeliberately promoting and supporting evasion and criminals\u201d. \u201cWe have a particular focus on some of the offshore service providers that we think drive quite a lot of this behaviour.\u201d They faced \u201cthe full force of our enforcement capabilities,\u201d he said. Australian Taxation Office deputy commissioner Will Day said the role of professionals in organising offshore tax evasion was a key focus of the J5. The ATO already has a close focus on the role of domestic lawyers and accountants, both as advisers and as potential tax dodgers in their own right. He and York would not provide any more details about the institution against which the J5 took action last month, apart from saying that the allegations being investigated involved the abuse of correspondent banking arrangements. Day said it had been very encouraging to hear from Australian banks seeking details of the institution after last month\u2019s day of action \u2013 even though the ATO could not give them the information.",

      "bodyText": "Poetry, WH Auden once wrote, makes nothing happen. The same might be said of journalism. Auden understood himself as defending (rather than attacking) a form he loved, distinguishing what a poem might do from what could and should not be demanded from it. Similarly, the expectations of journalism have never been higher, with many liberals convinced that almost all the depredations of contemporary politics could be prevented if only the press put its mind to it. Yet, in reality, the vacuum that makes the media seem so important also limits what even the best journalism can do. Take the tenacious reporting that pursued Angus Taylor for using an allegedly forged document to smear Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore. Here was a potential scandal dissected forensically across sites like this one \u2013 and what was the result? A few weeks ago the AFP declared that Taylor\u2019s actions would not be investigated because of \u201cthe low level of harm and the apology made by the minister\u201d. The media spotlight directed at Taylor raised questions of potential wrongdoing for all to see \u2026 and then the authorities shrugged and moved on. Similarly, with his barely disguised contempt for journalists quizzing him about the sports rorts saga, Scott Morrison shows that he understands perfectly well what the media can and can\u2019t do. If he stonewalls and blusters for long enough, even the most determined interviewer must go to the next question \u2013 and then Morrison can repeat the tactic until the issue goes stale. Many commentators have contrasted today\u2019s political impunity with the story of Bob Hawke\u2019s special minister of state Mick Young, who famously stepped down after he and his wife failed to declare a stuffed Paddington bear in their luggage after an overseas trip. As the Age\u2019s Tony Wright says, Young\u2019s conduct would be \u201cunimaginable now\u201d. Yet no one would suggest that the media was somehow more effective back then. On the contrary, politicians in 1984 faced much less scrutiny than they do in the age of social media and 24-hour cable. The Paddington bear incident instead illustrates the importance of a political culture that no longer exists. Young left high school to work as a shearer and roustabout in South Australia before becoming an organiser with the Australian Workers\u2019 Union, back when something like half of the entire workforce belonged to a trade union. He rose up through the ranks of a Labor party that (like, in fact, the Liberals) possessed a functioning branch structure. You couldn\u2019t imagine any of that today. Not only has union density sunk to an all-time low, the political parties that once boasted huge memberships have become empty shells. Much the same might be said about the traditional churches, social movements and community groups. There\u2019s no mystery as to why. As Elizabeth Humphrys documents in her recent book on neoliberalism and Australia, the free market reforms implemented by Hawke and Paul Keating (and then extended by John Howard) devastated the labour movement \u2013 and, eventually, civil society more generally. Today, we\u2019re expected to relate to politics (and everything else) as atomised consumers (rather than members or participants), a mode fundamentally incompatible with the traditional values of civil institutions. In the past, the existence of stable mass organisations gave some force to political conventions like \u201cministerial responsibility\u201d, partly because traditions need institutional memory to persist but also (and more importantly) because those organisations provided the public with mechanisms (however imperfect) through which leaders might be disciplined. The density of civil society in the 1980s meant that political scandals could not be shrugged off in the same way that they can be today, since a much larger proportion of the population had some organised engagement with public life. It\u2019s that engagement that gives journalism heft. Think, for instance, about the role played by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward from the Washington Post in bringing down Richard Nixon. As Ken Burns and Lynn Novick write, \u201cwe often forget that the [Vietnam] war and the Watergate scandal were inextricably intertwined\u201d, with the highly politicised culture created by the peace movement keeping the Post\u2019s revelations alive and eventually forcing Nixon\u2019s resignation. The contemporary American context could not be more different. \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters,\u201d boasted Donald Trump in 2016. In that claim, you can see the problem facing journalists everywhere. No Bernstein and Woodward-style investigation could publicise the US president\u2019s bigotry, venality and incompetence as thoroughly as Trump does himself. Everyone knows who Trump is and what he represents \u2013 and yet that knowledge, in and of itself, changes nothing. It\u2019s not enough to know. You need to be able to act \u2013 and, today, most people feel that they can\u2019t. A widespread public alienation from the political process gives Trump (and the growing number of Trump imitators) tremendous latitude \u2013 a latitude that, in turn, fosters more public alienation. The Roman senator Tacitus one explained how \u201ccrime, once exposed, has no refuge but in audacity\u201d. Today, that\u2019s the default mode for a political class able to brazen out almost any scandal, safe in the knowledge that no particular penalty attaches to exposure. That\u2019s not to excuse those journalists who\u2019d rather be lapdogs than watchdogs. We need, more than ever, reporters prepared to make public what the powerful would prefer concealed. But, even more urgently, we need to rebuild a popular agency \u2013 for, without it, the most shocking expos\u00e9s will fall completely flat, again and again and again. \u2022 Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist",

In a hard-hitting report due to be submitted to the G20 group of leading developed and developing countries, experts said that issues including the climate emergency and mental health meant judging progress required a different yardstick of success. Against a backdrop of heightened political unrest in several major western nations despite continued growth in economic prosperity, Dennis Snower, president of the Global Solutions Initiative, a thinktank with links to the group of rich nations, said they should adopt a \u201crecoupling dashboard\u201d to assess wellbeing and environment alongside GDP.

All four dimensions would need to be in harmony to show a country was adequately serving the needs of its citizens, according to the proposals drawn up by Snower and Katharina Lima de Miranda, an academic at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The empowerment and solidarity indexes are drawn from existing major surveys of wellbeing compiled by the UN, World Bank and OECD, including assessments of job security, education levels, life expectancy, charitable activity, trust in strangers and confidence in government. Under the new dashboard, New Zealand, Finland and Iceland are among the most progressive nations on earth, while the US dramatically underperforms its level of GDP per head. India, China and Mexico rank among the worst performers on the dashboard of 35 nations. The report said that, over the past decade, the dashboard shows the empowerment of citizens and GDP levels in the UK have increased yet social solidarity has fallen, suggesting that the country has become more \u201cneoliberal\u201d. Although the plan could face resistance from some G20 nations and there is no guarantee the dashboard will ultimately be adopted, Snower said the proposal was the first stage in a drive to get countries to look beyond GDP as a signal of success.

Ministers are due to produce a long-awaited white paper on shaking up the planning system in the next few months.</p> <p>Last week the government <a href=\"https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/eight-councils-to-suffer-planning-powers-hit-following-latest-housing-delivery-test-results-65066\">announced that</a> eight local councils in London, the south-east or east of England would lose some planning powers after failing to meet targets for completed new homes.</p> <p>The LGA found that the number of granted planning permissions for new homes in England almost doubled between 2012-13 and 2018-19, from 198,800 to 361,800.</p> <p>While the organisation acknowledges there is an inevitable time lag between permissions being granted and the homes being built, it notes that over the same period the number of newbuild completions has risen more slowly, from 118,540 to 213,860.</p> <p>The LGA argues the figures show that rather than taking planning powers from councils, the white paper should consider other measures, notably allowing local authorities to build on land that has planning permission, for example by assisting compulsory purchase on such land, and allowing councils to charge full council tax on unbuilt developments.</p> <p>It is also calling on the government to change the right to buy system, under which tenants can purchase local authority homes, by letting councils keep all the money from such sales to help them to replace them.</p> <p>David Renard, the leader of Swindon council and the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, said: \u201cThe planning system is not a barrier to housebuilding. The number of homes granted planning permission has far outpaced the number of homes being built.</p> <p>\u201cNo one can live in a planning permission, or a half-built house where work on a site has begun but not been completed. Councils need powers to tackle our housing backlog and step in where a site with planning permission lies dormant and housebuilding has stalled. If we are to solve our housing shortage, councils need to be able to get building again and resume their role as major builders of affordable homes.\u201d</p>",

Robert Jenrick, the housing, communities and local government secretary, is reportedly considering taking planning powers away from councils in an attempt to speed up housebuilding. Ministers are due to produce a long-awaited white paper on shaking up the planning system in the next few months. Last week the government announced that eight local councils in London, the south-east or east of England would lose some planning powers after failing to meet targets for completed new homes. The LGA found that the number of granted planning permissions for new homes in England almost doubled between 2012-13 and 2018-19, from 198,800 to 361,800. While the organisation acknowledges there is an inevitable time lag between permissions being granted and the homes being built, it notes that over the same period the number of newbuild completions has risen more slowly, from 118,540 to 213,860. The LGA argues the figures show that rather than taking planning powers from councils, the white paper should consider other measures, notably allowing local authorities to build on land that has planning permission, for example by assisting compulsory purchase on such land, and allowing councils to charge full council tax on unbuilt developments. It is also calling on the government to change the right to buy system, under which tenants can purchase local authority homes, by letting councils keep all the money from such sales to help them to replace them. David Renard, the leader of Swindon council and the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, said: \u201cThe planning system is not a barrier to housebuilding. The number of homes granted planning permission has far outpaced the number of homes being built. \u201cNo one can live in a planning permission, or a half-built house where work on a site has begun but not been completed. Councils need powers to tackle our housing backlog and step in where a site with planning permission lies dormant and housebuilding has stalled. If we are to solve our housing shortage, councils need to be able to get building again and resume their role as major builders of affordable homes.\u201d",
