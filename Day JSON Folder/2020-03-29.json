For over 80% of people these symptoms are mild, for the much smaller number who develop the most serious illness, intensive care is needed around 10 days later.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor those who do not recover but die, data from China suggests this takes around another four days. The tragic deaths today will be from people infected roughly a month ago. It is inevitable that there will be more tragedies for families ahead.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe can reduce the final death toll only by following current Government advice.

They said his death underlined the need for frontline NHS staff to have proper personal protective equipment \u2013 and for everyone to stay at home. <br></p> \n  <p> Dr Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, which represents many hospital doctors in England, said: \u201cI am deeply saddened to hear of Mr El-Hawrani\u2019s death. He was a highly respected colleague in my own trust and it has left many of us feeling as low as we have ever been previously in our careers. The words of his family show what a wonderful person he was.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cHis death is a stark reminder that Covid-19 is not a disease that only affects the old and infirm. We must remember that healthcare workers are putting their lives on the line right now, and it\u2019s absolutely imperative that they have access to suitable personal protective equipment [PPE].\u201d</p> \n  <p>Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, who is self-isolating after displaying symptoms of the virus, said: \u201cI share the deep sadness about the death of Mr El-Hawrani that will be felt by the whole medical profession and wider NHS, and send condolences to his family on behalf of all of us.</p> \n  <p> \u201cCovid-19 is a risk to everyone, but clinical NHS staff are at the frontline in battling this disease. Everyone is rightly inspired by the skill and dedication of our NHS staff like Mr El-Hawrani.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe action that everyone in the UK can do to reduce the risk to the NHS is to continue to follow government advice on staying at home and social distancing. This is the practical support the NHS and its staff need from us all at the moment.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T19:04:00.345Z\">at 8.04pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e80e9f58f0878a2a48ac910\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T18:37:59.505Z\">7.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nigerian cities enter lockdown</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nigeria\u2019s president Muhammadu Buhari has ordered a lockdown in Lagos and the capital city of Abuja, AFP reports. </p> \n  <p>Nigeria has recorded 97 confirmed coronavirus cases and one death.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T18:55:46.922Z\">at 7.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e80e6078f08af215f6fda0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T18:25:00.880Z\">7.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than \u00a3250,000 has been raised to help provide free hot meals for NHS staff in the UK, less than a week after the initiative was started by a small group of friends.</p> \n  <p>About 4,000 meals have been provided to hospitals, and tens of thousands more are expected soon.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe were talking about how a group of friends who are NHS workers are just not eating properly,\u201d Andrew Muir Wood, one of the founders, told PA Media. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone to operate on an empty stomach let alone people trying to save lives, so we got together trying to work out how we could solve that.\u201d<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MealsForTheNHS/status/1242480481632784390\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">URGENT: NHS workers can\u2019t work if they\u2019re hungry.<br>There are doctors in your local hospital who will be in the middle of their shift tonight and won't have anything to eat.<br><br>Buy daily meals for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHSuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NHSuk</a> staff, direct from local restaurants, at <a href=\"https://t.co/L1jVV6qDR6\">https://t.co/L1jVV6qDR6</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FeedTheNHS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FeedTheNHS</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/l3KcmJJegP\">pic.twitter.com/l3KcmJJegP</a></p>\u2014 Meals For The NHS (@MealsForTheNHS) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MealsForTheNHS/status/1242480481632784390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 24, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>To support the campaign, visit <a href=\"https://www.mealsforthenhs.com/\">www.mealsforthenhs.com</a>.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T19:03:38.790Z\">at 8.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e80e2e18f08af215f6fd9f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T18:06:08.587Z\">7.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, Stuart, a street outreach worker from Brighton, says his job has changed dramatically since the coronavirus outbreak as every homeless person has to be indoors by this weekend. </p> \n  <p>While the threshold for housing people was once high, local authorities are now able to get accommodation in 30 minutes, he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all shifted and they are trying to negotiate with landlords and hotel owners to get people into accommodation. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been quick, you send five people over and within 30 minutes the council can say got somewhere.

Probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut. This would be an enforceable quarantine. I\u2019d rather not do it, but maybe we need it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But New York governor Andrew Cuomo says it wasn\u2019t mentioned when they spoke, and he\u2019s said<strong> such a move would be \u201ca federal declaration of war\u201d.</strong></p> \n  <p>Why you would want to just create total pandemonium on top of a pandemic I have no idea,\u201d Cuomo said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s totally opposite with what the president would want to do, work with the states, get the economy running and get some sense of stability. You wouldn\u2019t at this point literally fracture the entire nation because it\u2019s not just New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, it\u2019s Louisiana and New Orleans. The numbers will continue to rise and every few days it\u2019s going to be another hotspot.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cIt would be chaos and mayhem.

We\u2019ve launched a new one at the link below where I\u2019ll be taking you through the latest news for the next few hours: Hundreds of worshippers attended services at a Louisiana church on Sunday, flouting a ban on large gatherings, angering neighbours and seemingly turning a deaf ear to their governor, who once again warned that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed with new cases of the coronavirus, AP reports. An estimated 500 people of all ages filed inside the mustard-yellow and beige Life Tabernacle church in Central, a city of nearly 29,000 outside Baton Rouge. Assistant ministers and worshippers who stood outside the front doors and in the parking lot of Life Tabernacle told news reporters to leave, saying cameras would not be allowed on the property and they had been told not to talk to the news media. Hi everyone, I\u2019m Helen Sullivan with you now for the next few hours. You can get in touch with me at any point on Twitter @helenrsullivan. That\u2019s all from me, Clea Skopeliti. My colleague Helen Sullivan will be guiding you through the next few hours as events continue to unfold. Many thanks to everyone who got in touch via Twitter. Here are the main points from the last few hours: Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, has announced it will cap the number of people allowed to enter its islands to 100 a week from Tuesday. Up to 1,000 British nationals stranded in Peru are being repatriated by the foreign office tonight. Over 100 Irish nationals and dozens of others from 13 EU countries are also on their way back via a rescue flight organised by Ireland. Egyptian banks have been instructed to apply temporary caps on daily withdrawals and deposits, while Zimbabwe has legalised the use of foreign currency in domestic transactions as the countries deal with the outbreak. Costa Rica has confirmed 19 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases in the country up to 314. This follows Bolivia and Uruguay both announcing their first coronavirus deaths today. Fort Lauderdale\u2019s mayor has expressed opposition to having a cruise ship with coronavirus patients dock in the city\u2019s port. Mayor Dean Trantalis issued a statement explaining that the port is in the middle of a very urban area. 20,000 former NHS staff have returned to support the health service, Boris Johnson said in a video posted online. Nigeria\u2019s president has ordered a lockdown in Lagos and the capital city of Abuja. Moscow has announced a citywide lockdown beginning tomorrow, confining residents of the city of nearly 12 million people to their homes. France has announced 292 deaths in 24 hours, and has reached a total of 40,174 confirmed cases. Italy has said it will extend its month-long lockdown beyond 3 April. The decision came as the number of deaths in the country increased by 756 to reach 10,779. Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, has announced it will cap the number of people allowed to enter its islands at 100 a week from Tuesday, Reuters reports. The available hotel space will be used to quarantine people with coronavirus symptoms. The region has confirmed a total of 34 cases. Hundreds of British and Irish nationals gathered under white awnings are sat on rows of plastic chairs in a makeshift terminal set up at Lima\u2019s military airbase known as Grupo A\u00e9reo Ocho, amid emergency workers and soldiers. \u201cWe\u2019re all just really happy to be going home,\u201d said Ellie Harper , 32, who had been marooned in Huacachina, a desert oasis five hours from the Peruvian capital. \u201cAs hard as it has been to organise and get everything together, from this morning the organisation from the Irish embassy from the UK British embassy has been fantastic.\u201d \u201cThe staff at the airport have been really lovely and friendly and have explained everything to us really clearly and they\u2019re working to find ways to get absolutely everybody on board,\u201d she added. The first Boeing 777 left with 219 passengers and the second is expected to leave at full capacity taking 275 passengers including one extra stranded traveler, who works as a BA flight attendant and was able to use the drop seat used by the crew. \u201cWhile we\u2019re very happy to be going home we are mindful that there are still Brits in Peru who need repatriating,\u201d Harper said. Nine Britons and one Irish citizen who are staying in the Pariwana Hostel in Cusco have been prevented from joining the repatriation flights. Peruvian health authorities say they must remain under quarantine for up to three months along with some 140 fellow guests after two tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. \u201cWe were treated like we were going to get on a flight today to then find out five hours before we could be here indefinitely,\u201d Si\u00e2n Forkan, one of the British guests, told The Guardian. Patients in the UK dying now were infected around a month ago, weeks before the country started social distancing, an expert has warned. Professor James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, spoke out after a further 209 people died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK. Although this is a lower number than the 260 deaths the previous day, he warned it is too early to draw conclusions, underlining that \u201cdaily numbers can be lower (or higher) than expected due to random factors\u201d. Prof Naismith said: \u201cI am confident that provided we follow social distancing the increase in deaths will stop and this will be followed by a decrease in the daily numbers. \u201cIt can take up to two weeks from infection to onset of symptoms. For over 80% of people these symptoms are mild, for the much smaller number who develop the most serious illness, intensive care is needed around 10 days later. \u201cFor those who do not recover but die, data from China suggests this takes around another four days. The tragic deaths today will be from people infected roughly a month ago. It is inevitable that there will be more tragedies for families ahead. \u201cWe can reduce the final death toll only by following current Government advice. We must expect and welcome changes in Government advice as science, medicine and social science work together to learn more.\u201d Up to 1,000 British nationals stranded in Peru are being repatriated by the foreign office tonight. The British ambassador Kate Harrison has just confirmed on Twitter that one of the two British Airways flights leaving Lima tonight is full, with a second British Airways flight chartered by Ireland. Harrison said two more flights were due to leave Lima tomorrow. \u201cOur first flight in today, working with the Irish in this context, has left with a full capacity. So every single seat on that flight back to the UK is now full. The second plane that will take off today - we\u2019re looking to people from Cusco but other parts of Peru.. \u201cThis today will be our third flight leaving Peru for the UK, two flights chartered by the UK, one flight chartered by Ireland, and tomorrow we\u2019ll have two more British Airways flights flying back from Lima to London, bringing British nationals back to the UK back to their friends and back to their families,\u201d said Kate Harrison. More than 100 Irish nationals and dozens of others from 13 EU countries are also on their way back courtesy of a rescue flight organised by Ireland. Egyptian banks have been ordered to apply temporary caps on daily withdrawals and deposits, a policy that some analysts see as an attempt to control inflation and hoarding in the midst of the pandemic. The daily limit for individuals would be 10,000 Egyptian pounds and 50,000 pounds for companies, according to Reuters. This follows Zimbabwe legalising the use of foreign currency in domestic transactions in preparation for the country\u2019s 21-day lockdown. There\u2019s been an update on the Zaandam cruise ship, where four people have died. Fort Lauderdale\u2019s mayor, Dean Trantalis, is reluctant to have the ship dock at Port Everglades, saying in a statement: \u201cOur healthcare system could be extremely burdened by the time the ship arrives.\u201d He called on the Trump administration to develop a plan of action and for \u201cstringent separation procedures\u201d if the ship does dock. From Reuters: Costa Rica has confirmed 19 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases in the country up to 314. This follows Bolivia and Uruguay both announcing their first coronavirus deaths today. My colleague Henry McDonald reports from Belfast that a couple in their 70s have died of coronavirus. The man reportedly had cancer and the woman was being treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There have been 21 deaths in Northern Ireland. The UK government\u2019s effort to source 30,000 medical ventilators to treat Covid-19 patients has resulted in two significant orders so far; 10,000 for Dyson\u2019s new CoVent prototype and 10,000 from a consortium called Ventilator Challenge UK, which expects to begin producing this week. But some firms claim they could have provide medical ventilators sooner and were inexplicably snubbed. The government has this evening offered an explanation as to why. Regarding a ventilator offered by Worcester-based Gtech, a government spokesperson said the plans were rejected by the Technical Design Authority, which includes a panel of clinicians. \u201cUnfortunately the Gtech ventilator model did not pass the government\u2019s stringent safety tests and we will not be proceeding further,\u201d the spokesperson said. A firm called Direct Access said it could import 5,000 ventilators within a week and a further 20,000 within the month. The government said the plans \u201cdid not stand up to due diligence\u201d. My colleagues Erin McCormick and Patrick Greenfield and have the latest on the Zaandam cruise ship, on which four have died. The Port of Everglades has said a Covid-19-stricken cruise ship has not yet been given approval to dock in Florida after it was granted passage to pass through the Panama canal and travel towards Fort Lauderdale. Four people have died on the Zaandam cruise liner and dozens are ill with flu-like symptoms after it became stranded at sea when Latin American countries closed their ports in response to the global pandemic. On Saturday, Panamanian authorities reversed a decision to stop the Zaandam in the canal to travel to port in Fort Lauderdale. Hundreds of symptomless passengers have been transferred to its sister ship, the Rotterdam, during the weekend. On Sunday, the Panama canal indicated that both ships would be allowed to travel together although there has been no official confirmation from the Panamanian government. In a statement to the Guardian, Port Everglades said it would take about three days for the ship to reach south Florida, and that Holland American, the boats\u2019 owners, must then submit a plan before arrival to enter the port that meets \u201ca long list of Unified Command requirements\u201d. The ships\u2019 owners, Holland America Line, have not responded to requests for updates on the health of passengers onboard or the current travel plans. Medical leaders have praised Amged El-Hawrani, an ear, nose and throat consultant, who died today aged 55 of Covid-19. They said his death underlined the need for frontline NHS staff to have proper personal protective equipment \u2013 and for everyone to stay at home. Dr Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, which represents many hospital doctors in England, said: \u201cI am deeply saddened to hear of Mr El-Hawrani\u2019s death. He was a highly respected colleague in my own trust and it has left many of us feeling as low as we have ever been previously in our careers. The words of his family show what a wonderful person he was.\u201d \u201cHis death is a stark reminder that Covid-19 is not a disease that only affects the old and infirm. We must remember that healthcare workers are putting their lives on the line right now, and it\u2019s absolutely imperative that they have access to suitable personal protective equipment [PPE].\u201d Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, who is self-isolating after displaying symptoms of the virus, said: \u201cI share the deep sadness about the death of Mr El-Hawrani that will be felt by the whole medical profession and wider NHS, and send condolences to his family on behalf of all of us. \u201cCovid-19 is a risk to everyone, but clinical NHS staff are at the frontline in battling this disease. Everyone is rightly inspired by the skill and dedication of our NHS staff like Mr El-Hawrani. \u201cThe action that everyone in the UK can do to reduce the risk to the NHS is to continue to follow government advice on staying at home and social distancing. This is the practical support the NHS and its staff need from us all at the moment.\u201d Nigeria\u2019s president Muhammadu Buhari has ordered a lockdown in Lagos and the capital city of Abuja, AFP reports. Nigeria has recorded 97 confirmed coronavirus cases and one death. More than \u00a3250,000 has been raised to help provide free hot meals for NHS staff in the UK, less than a week after the initiative was started by a small group of friends. About 4,000 meals have been provided to hospitals, and tens of thousands more are expected soon. \u201cWe were talking about how a group of friends who are NHS workers are just not eating properly,\u201d Andrew Muir Wood, one of the founders, told PA Media. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone to operate on an empty stomach let alone people trying to save lives, so we got together trying to work out how we could solve that.\u201d To support the campaign, visit www.mealsforthenhs.com. In the UK, Stuart, a street outreach worker from Brighton, says his job has changed dramatically since the coronavirus outbreak as every homeless person has to be indoors by this weekend. While the threshold for housing people was once high, local authorities are now able to get accommodation in 30 minutes, he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all shifted and they are trying to negotiate with landlords and hotel owners to get people into accommodation. \u201cIt\u2019s been quick, you send five people over and within 30 minutes the council can say got somewhere. New accommodation seems to have cropped up from landlords offering their services, but it is frustrating because the government has not allowed local authorities to requisition buildings from private owners. That would be easier and quicker. I had a problem that one hotel changed their mind last minute after we were going to place people there.\u201d The other role he now has is supporting those indoors, and making sure they get food as all the day centres have closed. He said there was a mix of moods among homeless people. \u201cSome have taken the news of the outbreak in their stride, while others are panicking. There are a small number who don\u2019t want to go inside.\u201d Moscow has announced a citywide lockdown beginning tomorrow, confining residents of the city of nearly 12 million people to their homes to slow the spread of coronavirus. The restrictions are some of the most severe in the Russian capital\u2019s history and are comparable with steps taken in cities in Italy and China to slow the pandemic. As of Monday, residents will not be allowed to leave their homes except to seek medical care, to travel to work if they provide essential services, to go to the nearest store or chemist, or to walk pets no further than 100 metres from their home. The restrictions would not limit movement in and out of Moscow in personal cars, the statement read, emphasising that Russians could still enter or exit the capital. Similar restrictions are expected in the greater Moscow region, where another 7 million people live. It was not immediately clear if police or military would be deployed on the streets to enforce the ban. The statement referred to a \u201csmart system of control\u201d, indicating that the city may use facial recognition on cameras or use telephone geolocation data in order to track the movements of people around the city. \u201cThe extremely negative turn of events that we have seen in the largest cities of Europe and the United States have caused great concern for the life and health of our citizens,\u201d read a statement on the personal website of Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin. Russia has identified 1,534 cases of coronavirus so far. Eight deaths have been attributed to the virus. Vladimir Putin has announced a national holiday for the coming week but stopped short of declaring a national state of emergency. Sobyanin also said that because of an expected spike in job losses, the city would disburse 19,500 roubles (\u00a3200) per month in unemployment. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, the head of France\u2019s health authority, has issued an update on the country\u2019s situation. The total number of confirmed cases in France is 40,174. There are currently 19,354 people in hospital in France, an increase of 10% on the previous day. There are 4,632 people in intensive care in hospital; 359 more than yesterday. Of those in intensive care: 34% are under 60 years old; 64% aged 60-80; 60 people are under 30 years old. 7,132 people have recovered, Salomon said. There have been 2,606 deaths in French hospitals. This is an increase of 292 in 24 hours. Italy has said it will extend its month-long lockdown as the number of deaths in the country increased by 756 to reach 10,779. There are now 97,689 confirmed cases in Italy. Reuters reports that there have been 10 new coronavirus deaths in Ireland, bringing the country\u2019s total to 46. The health department has announced 200 new confirmed cases, making a total of 2,615. The United Arab Emirates has reported one new death and 102 new cases. This brings the death toll to three, and the total number of infections to 570. Here are some of the key developments: The coronavirus pandemic has killed over 30,000 people. The total number of confirmed cases is currently at 691,867, according to Johns Hopkins. The finance minister of Germany\u2019s Hesse state, Thomas Sch\u00e4fer, has killed himself after apparently becoming \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about how to deal with the economic impact of coronavirus. The Syrian health ministry has announced the country\u2019s first coronavirus death, as the total number of cases comes to nine. The death toll in Lombardy, Italy\u2019s worst affected region, has slowed. It rose by about 416 in a day to at least 6,360. The mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, has said the city will run out of critical medical supplies, including ventilators, by next Sunday, 5 April. New curfew regulations have been introduced in Serbia. The country has increased its curfew from 3pm till 5am on weekends, and 5pm till 5am on weekdays. The UK death toll has increased by 209 in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 1,228. The figure was lower than Saturday\u2019s record rise of 260. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has tightened social distancing measures. New advice states that public gatherings should include no more than two people outside of the household. Kuwait\u2019s health ministry has announced 20 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections to 225. Mexico has asked its 130 million citizens to stay at home for a month. The country\u2019s president has previously been criticised for not doing enough to deal with the crisis. Saudi Arabia has reported four deaths and 96 new coronavirus cases today. This brings the the death toll to eight and the total number of coronavirus cases to 1,299. Saudi Arabia has tightened its restrictions on movements to contain spread of coronavirus. The interior ministry has today banned residents from entering or exiting the city of Jeddah. The finance minister of Germany\u2019s Hesse state, Thomas Sch\u00e4fer, has killed himself after apparently becoming \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about how to deal with the economic impact of coronavirus, the Local reports. \u201cWe are in shock, we are in disbelief and above all we are immensely sad,\u201d state premier Volker Bouffier said in a statement. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org. As hospitals hit capacity in Spain, healthcare workers are being stretched to breaking point. Hospital staff in Madrid have been meditating to cope with the stress. The Syrian health ministry has announced the first coronavirus death in the country. Four new cases have also been confirmed, pushing the total number of infections to nine. The patient died upon her arrival to the hospital\u2019s emergency department, state run news agency reports. Syria has implemented several precautionary measures to slow the spread of the deadly virus, with a nationwide curfew from 6pm to 6 am beginning last week. Shops, markets and public transport have been shut down as well with only pharmacies allowed to keep their opens, according to Al Arabia. An aeroplane used as an air ambulance has burst into flames in the Philippines, killing all eight people onboard. The New York Times reports that it is unclear if the passengers were being airlifted for coronavirus treatment. Local reports say that in addition to the pilot, the plane was carrying two crew members, a doctor, a nurse, a flight medic and an American and a Canadian passenger. Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, has announced a funding boost for a children\u2019s helpline to support those who are isolated at home. Engineering firms have said that the UK may not have enough ventilators when coronavirus cases reach their peak, the BBC reports. The UK has just over 8,000 ventilators, but it is estimated the country will need 30,000 during the peak of the crisis, which is expected in two weeks\u2019 time. Manufacturers have said they will be unable to meet that deadline. Clea Skopeliti here, taking over from my colleague Jedidajah. Spot something I\u2019ve missed? Feel free to message me on Twitter @cleaskopeliti. As we cover the UK\u2019s daily government briefing too, please follow our UK blog here. The coronavirus death toll in the northern Italian region of Lombardy, the country\u2019s worst affected, has risen by about 416 in a day to at least 6,360, Reuters reports. Day-on-day the deaths were down markedly from Saturday\u2019s 542, which was the second largest since the outbreak first emerged just over five weeks ago. The number of cases in the region, which includes the country\u2019s financial capital, Milan, increased by 1,592 to approximately 41,007, the source said. Dutch GPs are phoning elderly and at-risk patients to check if they are willing to take the risk of dying at home in case they get Covid-19, so that their hospital bed can be taken up by someone with better survival chances, the Volkskrant newspaper reported. In the Dutch healthcare system such conversations are normally carried out face to face. Bianca Buurman, professor of acute elderly care at Amsterdam UMC, emphasised in an article published with three other colleagues the importance for healthcare providers to contact elderly people to ask what their wishes would be if they were affected by the virus. \u201cProximity is important for such tough topics, but going by is not an option now,\u201d Buurman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know whether such a conversation will further fuel fear.\u201d The US government\u2019s leading infection disease expert, Anthony Fauci, has said the country could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic. Speaking on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday, Fauci offered his prognosis as the federal government mulls rolling back social distancing measures in areas that have not been hard-hit by the outbreak, when the nationwide 15-day effort to slow the spread of the virus will come to an end. As Spain\u2019s Covid-19 death toll has surpassed that of China, and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has tightened the country\u2019s lockdown, my colleague Ashifa Kassam reports on the increasingly desperate attempts of Spanish doctors and nurses to fight the virus. The mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, has said his city will run out of critical medical supplies, including ventilators, by next Sunday, 5 April. In a tweet, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re at war and ventilators are our ammunition.\u201d New York is the worst-affected US state, with most deaths in the country having so far been recorded in New York, where also a third of the about 52,000 people who have so far been confirmed to have the virus are from. As we reported this morning, the British Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has said the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in Britain will depend on people\u2019s actions. He told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that the lockdown would remain in place for a \u201csignificant period\u201d. UK coronavirus live: lockdown measures will be in place for \u2018significant period\u2019, says Gove Here a video of Gove\u2019s comments by my colleague Elena Morresi: Hundreds of doctors in the UK have said they are less likely to return to the frontline or increase their hours to fight Covid-19 because they believe their families will not be properly compensated if they die, my colleagues Robert Booth and Denis Campbell report. Full story below. A plane loaded with medical supplies has arrived in New York from China on Sunday, the first in a series of flights the White House has organised over the next 30 days, Reuters reports. A commercial carrier landed at John F Kennedy airport carrying gloves, gowns and masks for distribution in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, three particularly hard-hit states in the US. The airlift is a product of a team led by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, which formed \u201cProject Airbridge\u201d, a partnership between several large US healthcare distributors and the federal government. Donald Trump, who initially played down the threat from the virus, has been searching for supplies to fill the mounting need for equipment to protect healthcare workers caring for Covid-19 patients. The coronavirus pandemic already looks to be profoundly reshaping Latin America\u2019s political landscape. Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 - whom nearly 60 governments recognise as the country\u2019s rightful interim president \u2013 has spent the last 15 months battling to topple Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and force his Socialist party from power. But on Saturday Guaid\u00f3 announced he now believed it was time for a national unity government to tackle the impending emergency, which is likely to hit the crisis-stricken country hard. \u201cFor obvious reasons it cannot be lead by Maduro,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 tweeted. \u201cBut neither can it be solely made up of the forces we represent,\u201d he added in a video address arguing that \u201call political and social forces\u201d needed to be included. Maduro\u2019s administration has so far confirmed 119 coronavirus cases and two deaths in Venezuela and has placed many parts of the country on lockdown in an attempt to halt its spread. But many suspect the real numbers are far higher and in Saturday\u2019s broadcast Guaid\u00f3 said the situation was likely to deteriorate, with Venezuela\u2019s collapsing healthcare system ill-equipped to deal with a wave of Covid-19 deaths. \u201cUnfortunately everything suggests the situation will get worse because of the situation our country finds itself in,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said. \u201cIn the coming weeks Venezuela could become the country with the highest number of infections in the region.\u201d New curfew regulations have been introduced in Serbia. On Saturday, Serbia stepped up its curfew from 3pm till 5am on weekends, and 5pm till 5am on weekdays. All people over 65 years old resident in cities have been asked to stay home at all times, except for designated shopping hours from 3am till 8am on Sundays. The borders have been closed for a while but now the period for which all returning citizens must self-isolate has been extended to 28 days Hi, this is Jedidajah Otte again, taking back over. My colleagues Lily Kuo and Helen Davidson are reporting that foreigners in China are observing a rise in xenophobia in the country amid the global Covid-19 outbreak. As Chinese health officials report new \u201cimported\u201d coronavirus cases almost every day, foreigners have been turned away from restaurants, shops, gyms and hotels, subjected to further screening, yelled at by locals and avoided in public spaces. The UK death toll from coronavirus has increased by 209 people in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 1,228 so far. The figure was lower than Saturday\u2019s record rise of 260, which may bring some hope that the rise in deaths could stabilise soon. The Department of Health and Social Care also said 19,522 had now tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK. More on our UK coronavirus liveblog. Iran\u2019s president has defended his country\u2019s response to the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East, saying the government has to weigh economic concerns as it takes measures to contain the pandemic. Hassan Rouhani told Associated Press that authorities had to consider the effect of mass quarantine efforts on Iran\u2019s beleaguered economy, which is under heavy US sanctions. \u201cIt\u2019s a dilemma playing out across the globe, as leaders struggle to strike a balance between restricting human contact and keeping their economies from crashing,\u201d Rouhani said at a cabinet meeting. \u201cHealth is a principle for us, but the production and security of society is also a principle for us. We must put these principles together to reach a final decision.\u201d On Sunday, state TV reported another 123 deaths, pushing Iran\u2019s overall death toll to 2,640 among 38,309 confirmed cases. In recent days, the country has ordered the closure of non-essential businesses and banned travel between cities. But those measures came long after other countries in the region imposed more sweeping lockdowns. Many Iranians are still flouting orders to stay home in what could reflect widespread distrust of authorities. More news from my colleague, Shaun Walker, our central and eastern Europe correspondent, based in Budapest: The main opposition candidate in Polish presidential elections has called on the public to boycott the vote if the government insists on going ahead with it on 10 May. Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party has refused to call off the vote despite a lockdown currently in place to fight coronavirus, with its incumbent Andrzej Duda the favourite to win another term. In the early hours of Saturday, the Polish parliament passed an amendment allowing pensioners and those in quarantine to vote by post. On Sunday, Ma\u0142gorzata Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska, the main opposition candidate, published an open letter on Facebook: \u201cThere is no other task in Poland today than to fight the [coronavirus] outbreak and its effects \u2026 In this situation, organising presidential elections would be a reckless act. Everyone should agree with the principle that we must not put human life at risk.\u201d She said if the vote did go ahead, the government would be responsible for any citizens who got sick, and called on other candidates to also boycott the race. The opposition has previously said the vote should be postponed because it would be inappropriate to run a campaign during a pandemic. Luxury fashion group Chanel has said it will launch production of face masks to help bolster supplies in France in its fight against the virus. Prototypes were being worked on and would roll off production lines once they received the approval of French authorities, reported Reuters. \u201cToday we are mobilising our workforce and our partners ... to produce protective masks and blouses,\u201d Chanel said in a statement. On Saturday, Olivier Veran, the health minister, said the government had ordered more than a billion face masks \u2013 mostly from China \u2013 to be supplied in the weeks and months ahead. France was using 40m face masks per week, he said. Doctors, nursing home carers and police have complained of shortages. Chanel also said it would not be putting any of its 4,500 employees into temporary unemployment as the company weathers the sharp downtown in economic activity. This is Nazia Parveen, briefly taking over from my colleague Jedidajah Otte. I\u2019ll be keeping you up to date on the situation around the world. You can get in touch with me on Twitter or by email at nazia.parveen@theguardian.com. I might not have time to reply but I will certainly give emails and messages a read. As reported earlier, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has stepped up measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. New advice warns that public gatherings should include no more than two people outside of the household. Morrison said Australians now needed to stay home unless they were shopping for food and other essentials, attending medical appointments, exercising, or attending work or education. People aged 70 and over \u201cshould stay at home and self-isolate for their own protection\u201d. Here is a video: India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has asked the population for forgiveness after imposing a lockdown, the BBC reports. After the shutdown, which was implemented with less than four hours\u2019 notice, was criticised for lacking a proper plan, Modi apologised for the impact in his weekly radio address. \u201cPossibly many would be angry at me for being locked in their homes. I understand your troubles but there was no other way to wage war against coronavirus. For a country like India with a population of 1.3 billion it is a battle of life and death and we have to win it,\u201d he said. Kuwait\u2019s health ministry has announced 20 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections to 225. Seven of the new cases are related to travel to the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. 13 others were infected due to their contact with previously confirmed cases, the health ministry said. Kuwait has reported 67 recoveries so far. Spain and Italy demanded more European help as they fight still-surging coronavirus infections amid the continents worst crisis since the second world war, the Associated Press reports. Both countries together account for more than half of the world\u2019s Covid-19 death toll, and are still seeing over 800 deaths a day each. Europe must demonstrate that it is able to respond to this historic call, the Italian premier, Giuseppe Conte, said on Saturday evening. \u201cI will fight until the last drop of sweat, until the last gram of energy, to obtain a strong, vigorous, cohesive European response,\u201d he said. The death toll of some countries could yet be much higher than reported, experts say, as unlike the US, France and Italy for instance do not count deaths that take place in nursing homes or in homes among their virus numbers. More news from my colleague Tom Phillips, our Latin America correspondent: Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 has called for the creation of an emergency government of national unity to face up to the coronavirus crisis. Guaid\u00f3 has been fighting to topple Nicolas Maduro since January 2019, so this represents a major direction change for his campaign. In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has reportedly told his health minister he will sack him if he criticises his handling of the coronavirus crisis. The health minister, in return, has asked Bolsonaro whether he is really ready to see army trucks transporting hundreds and hundreds of bodies through the streets of Brazilian cities in front of the cameras. One Brazilian commentator has come up with a new nickname for Brazil\u2019s far-right leader in today\u2019s paper: \u201cCaptain Corona.\u201d The sale of alcohol has been banned in the Greenland capital, Nuuk, in an attempt to reduce violence against children during the period of confinement, AFP reports. \u201cIn such a situation, we have to take numerous measures to avoid infection,\u201d the government leader Kim Kielsen said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cBut at the heart of my decision is the protection of children, they have to have a safe home.\u201d Nearly one in three people living in the autonomous Danish Arctic territory suffered sexual abuse during childhood. Experts link the abuse to alcohol, drugs and ignorance of children\u2019s rights. After Greenland closed down schools from Monday with 10 cases of the novel coronavirus diagnosed, a rise in violence followed. \u201cUnfortunately, in Nuuk, domestic violence has been on the rise in recent weeks,\u201d the health minister Martha Abelsen told local media. Excessive drinking by parents exposes children to dangers in the home, Greenlanders were warned. The alcohol ban came into force on Saturday and is scheduled to last until 15 April. Mexico has implored its 130 million citizens to stay at home for a month, arguing that is the only way to slow the transmission of the coronavirus through Latin America\u2019s second biggest economy. Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has been condemned for his dismissive response to the crisis and for continuing to attend public events, where he has hugged and kissed fans. On Saturday afternoon, one of the country\u2019s top health officials issued a direct plea to Mexican citizens not to go out. \u201cWe need to reduce the speed of transmission urgently. Urgently. This is our last chance to do it and do it now,\u201d said Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell, the deputy health minister. \u201cAnd this means we need to stay at home in massive numbers.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador, had made a similar call on Friday night in a pre-recorded message to the nation. But on Sunday morning the leftwing populist was out and about again, tweeting video footage from a tour he is conducting of cities along the Mexico-US border. So far 848 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Mexico and 16 deaths, although low testing rates means the real numbers are likely to be higher. Here a few key developments at a glance: Spain has recorded a further 838 deaths, a record daily increase of fatalities in the country. Tokyo has confirmed 68 new coronavirus cases, another record daily increase, as millions of people in and around Tokyo are urged to stay at home unless a trip outside is necessary. The British cabinet minister Michael Gove has said the lockdown restrictions in the UK could remain in place for a \u201csignificant period\u201d, as criticism mounted over the government\u2019s testing of cases and ordering of ventilators under an EU scheme they did not participate in because of \u201ccommunication problems\u201d. Italy\u2019s deputy health minister, Pierpaolo Sileri, has said he expects the country, which is globally the worst affected by Covid-19 and has now recorded more than 10,000 deaths, to hit its infection peak in no more than 10 days. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has announced further restrictions for the population, including limiting public gatherings to just two people. People should only leave their homes for essential reasons, and those over the age of 70 should stay home, he said. Domestic abuse victims are allowed to leave home to seek help despite the lockdown rules, the UK home secretary, Priti Patel, has said in a column in the Mail on Sunday. The Swiss Covid-19 death toll has risen to 257, up from 235 on the previous day, with the number of confirmed cases now at 14,336, from 13,213. All travellers entering South Korea will be subjected to two weeks of mandatory quarantine starting at midnight next Wednesday, the prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, announced on Sunday. Domestic flights will resume in Hubei province, except in Wuhan, from Sunday midnight local time, as China\u2019s new infections continue to fall. The Swiss Covid-19 death toll has risen from 235 to 257 in a day, Reuters report. The number of confirmed cases has increased to 14,336 from 13,213, the Swiss health agency said. Mass funerals still being held in ultra-Orthodox Jewish circles in Israel are threatening to accelerate the spread of the virus in the country, the Haaretz newspaper reported. An estimated 300 people ignored social distancing rules and participated in the funeral of rabbi Tzvi Shinkar in the predominantly ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak on Saturday night. The coronavirus is now spreading fastest in ultra-Orthodox communities in Israel, according to internal health ministry figures obtained by Haaretz. The French authorities are leafleting migrants in camps at Calais and Dunkirk this weekend before a \u201cvoluntary\u201d evacuation sparked by concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Police will begin transferring migrants to temporary centres across the on Tuesday. Officials insist this will be done on a \u201cvoluntary basis\u201d, according to reports in the local press. Buses will be sent to the camps transfer occupants to regional centres housing up to 100 people from 31 March. The migrants who agree to leave will be given a medical check before being placed in a bus and taken \u201cfar from Calais and Dunkirk\u201d. Once they reach the temporary accommodation they will be expected to keep the same lockdown rules as the rest of the French population. The decision to evacuate the migrants was taken after consultations with humanitarian organisations working in the camps, say authorities. Many of the French and British humanitarian organisations who have been helping the migrants with food and medical care have pulled out because of the difficulties with working since the national lockdown since 17 March and concerns about the risk to volunteers. There are believed to be around 600 migrants living in between five to eight encampments around the Channel port at Calais. There are an estimated 600 further north at Grande Synthe near Dunkirk. Even before the coronavirus crisis, life in the camps was grim. Volunteers said asking migrants who were often four or five sharing a single tent to maintain \u201csocial distancing\u201d was impossible. Tokyo has confirmed 68 new coronavirus cases, a record daily increase, the public broadcaster NHK reported on Sunday. Japanese authorities fear a rise in cases, after the country has so far benefited from low infection rates in an otherwise troubled region. 1,800 people have been reported infected in Japan, with 55 deaths as of Sunday afternoon, NHK said. Millions of people in and around Tokyo have been asked to avoid non-essential outings until 12 April. France\u2019s high-speed TGV trains are being used to free up intensive care beds in some of the country\u2019s worst-hit areas, AFP reports. The trains have been adapted into hospitals on wheels for transport critical patients around the country. \u201cWe have a lot more space than in an ambulance or a helicopter,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Braun, president of the Samu emergency service. A British national who tested positive for Covid-19 in South Korea may face penalties for not observing quarantine rules. The resident of Suwon, Gyeonggi province, got tested for the virus on 23 March, five days after he returned from a trip to Thailand, the Korea Herald reported. Although he was required to self-isolate until the results were out, he travelled to another city by bike that evening, and the next morning he visited an indoor golf range. Suwon\u2019s mayor, Yeom Tae-young, said on Facebook that the city would hold the person responsible for violating quarantine rules. \u201cThe city will deal with this sternly,\u201d he said. Under recently revised laws, those violating quarantine rules or obstructing quarantine efforts may face up to 1 year in prison and fines of up to 10m won. Additionally, foreign violators could face deportation, authorities said. My colleagues Shaun Walker and Christian Davies have written a story on concerns that eastern Europe might experience a surge in infections after a lack of testing to date. So far, eastern European countries have far lower infection rates than several of their western neighbours. Iran announced 123 more deaths from coronavirus over the past 24 hours, which brings the country\u2019s total to 2,640, AFP reports. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry confirmed seven new coronavirus cases in last 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections to 117, my colleague Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Afghanistan. Six of the new positive cases were reported in the western province of Herat, which neighbors Iran. Spain\u2019s cabinet is meeting this morning to approve a tightening up of the country\u2019s lockdown in which all non-essential workers will be ordered to stay at home for two weeks. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said the \u201cextraordinarily tough\u201d measures were needed as the county tries to halt the spread of the virus and reduce the strain on its overstretched hospitals. \u201cThis measure will reduce people\u2019s movement even further [but] it will reduce the risk of contagion and allow us to unblock out intensive care units,\u201d the prime minister said in a televised address on Saturday night. Despite the high death toll of recent days, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said that the situation in some regions appeared to be improving. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there,\u201d Sim\u00f3n told a press conference on Saturday afternoon. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019ll get confirmation, but we\u2019re getting close to the peak of the curve that we\u2019re studying so anxiously. In some parts of the country, they probably may even have passed it \u2013 but we need to be cautious with preliminary information.\u201d A further 838 people have died in Spain over the past 24 hours, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. It is the highest daily increase in fatalities so far, bringing the total number of deaths from the virus to 6,528. The total number of infections now stands at 78,797, up from 72,248. An update from the World Health Organization on the coronavirus outbreak in Kenya: Michael Gove has said the peak of the coronavirus is dependent on people\u2019s actions and that the lockdown will remain in place for a significant period. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr programme, the Cabinet Office minister said: It\u2019s difficult to know precisely [when the UK hit the peak of the coronavirus outbreak]. It depends on the action all of us take. if we practice the social distancing measures. If we follow the rules the government has outlined, if we follow that good scientific advice, then we can delay the infection rate and that gives our NHS the chance to become more resilient. So, the date of the peak depends on all of our behaviour. It\u2019s not a fixed point, a date in the calendar like Easter, it is something that all of us can affect by our actions. He added that the public must prepare for a \u201csignificant period\u201d of lockdown. Everyone is making a sacrifice and I appreciate the scale of that sacrifice. But the reason all of us are making these sacrifices is because all of us will have people whom we love who are at risk from this virus. I can\u2019t make an accurate prediction, but everyone does have to prepare for a significant period when these measures are still in place. This from my colleague Philip Oltermann, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin bureau chief: Italy\u2019s deputy health minister, Pierpaolo Sileri, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show he thinks the country is nearing the peak of its outbreak. More than 10,000 people in Italy have died far, exceeding by far death rates in other countries. Sileri said that in 10 days \u201cmaximum\u201d the country would see its infection rates reducing. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has announced further restrictions on movement, including limiting public gatherings to just two people. People should only leave their homes for essential reasons, and those over the age of 70 should stay home, he said. All playgrounds and outdoor gyms parks in Australia will close from Monday. Domestic flights will resume in Hubei province, except at Wuhan\u2019s Tianhe international airport, from Sunday midnight local time, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China. All passenger and cargo flights on domestic air routes via airports will resume. The province, for weeks the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, has seen its restrictions being gradually lifted by the government, as the country\u2019s cases of infection has continued to fall. Flights to and from the city of Wuhan are expected resume at midnight on 8 April, when the city\u2019s lockdown is due to be lifted. The Italian deputy health minister, Pierpaolo Sileri, has said that the lockdown in the country is beginning to work, but he said it would take at least a fortnight for the benefits to show, after all movement was banned and non-essential businesses closed on Sunday. Over the last few days we had an increase of infections [but] this was due to an increase in [testing]. We are searching more and obviously we have more results of positive people, mainly without symptoms. We are live in the peak of this epidemic. I believe in one week time, 10 days maximum, we will see a significant drop in cases. There were 900 people confirmed to have died in Italy from Covid-19 yesterday, bringing the total in the country to more than 10,000. Sileri rejected reported criticism from China concerning Italy\u2019s apparent failure to lockdown more quickly and more completely. I believe we have been very, very fast. We\u2019ve been very unlucky to have several outbreaks in a very active part of our country, Lombardy, and we did not find patient zero. Probably patient one was not even patient one. All travellers entering South Korea will be subjected to two weeks of mandatory quarantine starting midnight on Wednesday, 1 April, the prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, announced on Sunday. \u201cThe measure will also include short-term foreign visitors in order to practically block the entry for unimportant purposes, such as tourism,\u201d Chung said, according to CNN. Those who don\u2019t have an address in the country will be quarantined in a government provided facility for two weeks at their own expense. Previously, the mandatory quarantine order was for travellers coming into South Korea from the US and Europe. The cabinet minister Michael Gove said the UK government is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the rising number of deaths and infections. Gove told Sky News that Britain was now carrying out 10,000 tests per day and the government was doing \u201call that we can\u201d to accelerate that rate. \u201cNaturally we are very concerned and our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who have lost loved ones in the last few days,\u201d he told Sky News. Qatar Airways will continue to operate flights for as long as necessary to get stranded travellers home but might run out of cash soon, Reuters reported. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Akbar al-Baker, said: \u201cWe have enough cash to take us through a very short period of time,\u201d adding that it would eventually have to seek support from its owner, the Qatar government. Qatar Airways is one of few global carriers to continue operating after the coronavirus outbreak reduced global travel demand drastically over the past weeks. Domestic abuse victims are allowed to leave home to seek help despite the lockdown rules, the home secretary has said. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Priti Patel said restrictions imposed on the population by the government to stay indoors were even more challenging for people whose \u201chome is not the safe haven it should be\u201d. Police and campaigners had previously said the instruction to stay indoors poses risks for domestic abuse victims. \u201cI am acutely aware that the necessary guidelines about social distancing and self-isolation may leave the victims of hidden crime, such as domestic abuse and child sexual abuse, feeling especially isolated, vulnerable and exposed,\u201d Patel wrote. \u201cBut my message to every potential victim is simple: we have not forgotten you and we will not let you down. \u201cAnd my message to every perpetrator is equally as simple: you will not get away with your crimes.\u201d Here my colleague Harriet Sherwood\u2019s story on how the Covid-19 outbreak is driving midwife shortages in the UK. The NHS shortage of midwives has doubled since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, she reports, with one in five midwifery posts now unfilled, raising concerns about the safety of pregnant women, new mothers and newborn babies. The world\u2019s largest glove maker, Malaysia\u2019s Top Glove Corporation Bhd, which makes one in every five gloves globally, expects a product shortage as demand from Europe and the United States is exceeding its capacity, Reuters reports. The company has extended shipping times to cope with the demand surge, according to executive chairman Lim Wee Chai. Lim said orders received in the past few weeks, mainly from Europe and the United States, were almost double the company\u2019s production capacity. Top Glove can produce 200 million natural and synthetic rubber gloves a day. A 33-year-old member of staff of the Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, has died from complications with Covid-19, CNN reports. April Dunn served in the governor\u2019s Office of Disability Affairs. \u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we mourn the loss of our dear April,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cShe brightened everyone\u2019s day with her smile, was a tremendous asset to our team and an inspiration to everyone who met her. \u201cShe lived her life to the fullest and improved the lives of countless Louisianans with disabilities. April worked hard as an advocate for herself and other members of the disability community.\u201d My colleagues Patrick Greenfield and Erin McCormick have written a story about the crisis-stricken cruise liner Zaandam, which is trying to reach Florida. More than 30,000 people have died after contracting Covid-19, from more than 660,700 confirmed cases. The coronavirus death toll in France has passed the grim milestone of 2,000 deaths, with more than 38,000 cases, and the US has reported more than 120,000 cases. Japan has reported a record daily increase in cases, with 68 new confirmed diagnoses on Sunday. New Zealand reported its first death on Sunday, Singapore reported its third, Thailand its seventh, and Australia its 15th and 16th. The US CDC issued an immediate warning to residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to avoid all non-essential travel for the next 14 days. It came after US president Donald Trump had earlier proposed an enforced regional quarantine on the state of New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, prompting an angry rebuke from NY governor Andrew Cuomo. Trump later said quarantine would not be necessary and he had asked the CDC to instead issue a serious travel warning for the areas. Spain, Northern Ireland, and Timor-Leste are among countries to introduce new waves of restrictions. Ireland\u2019s Health Service Executive would begin distributing around \u20ac20m worth of personal protective equipment to health workers from Sunday, after the first of up to 11 flights made its way back from China with supplies. Thousands of migrants bound for the US have amassed in immigration shelters in Panama and Costa Rica as plans to relocate them to less crowded areas to lower the risk of spreading the coronavirus have faltered. UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 yesterday, has warned British households that the virus epidemic will get worse before it gets better. The Zandam cruise ship, which has hundreds of passengers on board including at least 130 with flu-like symptoms, has been granted passage through the Panama Canal. Four people on the ship have died and two of those with symptoms have been diagnosed with Covid-19. Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, wife of the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, said she has recovered from Covid-19. Her husband and their three children have been in isolation and haven\u2019t shown symptoms. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliff, the British-Iranian aid worker who has been detained in Iran on spying charges has had her prison leave extended and her case put forward for clemency, her husband said Hi all, I am taking over the blog from my colleague Helen Davidson. If you want to get my attention with an update on the Covid-19 situation, please flag either on Twitter @JedySays or email me at jedidajah.otte.casual@guardian.co.uk. Here\u2019s a wrap of today\u2019s developments, leading on the news that the US infectious diseases authority, the CDC, has urged millions of residents in three states touching the New York City region to avoid non-essential travel, citing extensive spread of coronavirus among the population. Japan has reported a record daily increase in cases, with 68 mew confirmed diagnoses on Sunday. Infections in Japan have climbed to more than 1,700, with 55 deaths as of early Sunday, excluding those from a cruise ship quarantined last month, broadcaster NHK reported. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has asked the tens of millions of people in the city and surrounding regions to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings until 12 April, particularly this weekend. There has been enormous concern about efforts taken - in multiple countries - to protect inmates from the virus, including in the US. On Saturday the federal bureau of prisons announced Patrick Jones, a 49-year-old prisoner in Louisiana who was serving a 27-year prison term for a drug charge, had become the first federal inmate to die from Covid-19. According to the BOP\u2019s website on Saturday, there were five inmates who have tested positive for Covid-19 at Oakdale, Reuters reports. Criminal justice advocates and prison union officials have in recent days called on the Justice Department to do more to try and prevent the spread of the virus. Critics have said the Justice Department should fast-track the release of non-violent offenders who qualify based on age and pre-existing conditions. In Australia, group of more than 100 lawyers in Victoria have called for the release of some prisoners during the pandemic, focusing on those who are vulnerable, close to parole, or with fewer than six months to go on their sentence. \u201cThe prison system is not an island and is not immune from the ravages of COVID-19,\u201d they wrote to government. \u201cIt will enter into the system creating intense hotspots, presenting extreme risk to prison and wider communities. Prisoners will be subject to lockdown, social isolation and isolation from their families. Their mortality rates will be higher in custody than if they were in the community. Allowing this unnecessary exposure to a potentially deadly infection to the listed classes of prisoner will be such as to amount to torture.\u201d From Reuters: Cambodia reported one new case of the coronavirus on Sunday, bringing the total to 103 as the country prepares to tighten entry requirements for foreign nationals to try to curb the spread of the virus. The new case is a 30-year-old woman who worked in a karaoke club in Cambodia\u2019s northwestern Banteay Meanchey province, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. A total of 21 patients have recovered since January, the ministry said. Cambodia\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Friday it cancel visas on arrival for foreign nationals for one month, effective midnight of March 30, to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Foreign nationals wishing to travel to Cambodia must obtain a prior visa abroad and they must have medical certificate \u201ccertifying that he/she has not tested positive\u201d with the virus, the ministry said. In addition, the must show proof of medical insurance with coverage of at least $50,000, the ministry said. Singapore has reported its third death from Covid-19. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said a 70 year-old male Singapore citizen with no recent travel history to affected places, died on Sunday. According to Channel News Asia, the man had a hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, and was admitted to hospital on 29 February, and had been in intensive care since 2 March. 70 new cases in Singapore were reported on Saturday, bringing the total to 802. Singapore recently introduced new restrictions on social gatherings and services, after concerns about a rise in imported cases and potential community complacency. Thailand has 143 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total of cases since the outbreak to 1,388, the spokesman of the government\u2019s Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) said on Sunday. It also reported one new fatality, bringing Thailand\u2019s since the outbreak started to seven. Following Trump\u2019s decision not to propose a quarantine over New York and neighbouring states, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued a warning against non-essential travel in the region instead. \u201cDue to extensive community transmission of Covid-19 in the area, CDC urges residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately,\u201d said the warning issued late on Saturday, local time. It said employees of trucking, food supply, financial services and some other industries were exempt from the measure, and governors of the three states had full discretion over how to carry out the advisory. The first of up to 10 flights to be sent to China to pick up medical equipment for Ireland is on its way back. More than \u20ac225m had been spent on personal protective equipment for Irish health workers, said the minister for health, Simon Harris. Usually around \u20ac15m is spent in a year. Ireland\u2019s Health Service Executive would begin distributing around \u20ac20m worth of equipment from Sunday, after warnings that stocks were running low. One group of doctors told the Irish Times they had procured \u20ac6,000 worth of PPE on their own after losing patience with the HSE. Jim Dolan, the owner of NBA team the New York Knicks, has tested positive for Covid-19. Here\u2019s a quick look at the biggest developments today: More than 30,000 people have died after contracting Covid-19, from more than 660,700 confirmed cases. The coronavirus death toll in France has passed the grim milestone of 2,000 deaths, with more than 38,000 cases, and the US has reported more than 120,000 cases. New Zealand reported its first death on Sunday. Spain, Northern Ireland, and Timor-Leste are among countries to introduce new waves of restrictions. US president Donald Trump earlier proposed an enforced regional quarantine on the state of New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, prompting an angry rebuke from NY governor Andrew Cuomo. Trump later said quarantine would not be necessary and he had asked the CDC to instead issue a serious travel warning for the areas. UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 yesterday, has warned British households that the virus epidemic will get worse before it gets better. The Zandam cruise ship, which has hundreds of passengers on board including at least 130 with flu-like symptoms, has been granted passage through the Panama Canal. Four people on the ship have died and two of those with symptoms have been diagnosed with Covid-19. And Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, wife of the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, said she has recovered from Covid-19. Her husband and their three children have been in isolation and haven\u2019t shown symptoms. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliff, the British-Iranian aid worker who has been detained in Iran on spying charges has had her prison leave extended and her case put forward for clemency, her husband said South Korea has reported 105 new confirmed cases of Covid-19, bringing the country\u2019s total to 9,583, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Sunday. Virus prevention measures took a violent turn in parts of Africa over the weekend. Read a full report from Jason Burke here, and below are some images which have come through, with details from AP. In Kenya, police fired tear gas at a crowd of ferry commuters as the country\u2019s first day of a coronavirus curfew slid into chaos. \u201cWe were horrified by excessive use of police force ahead of the curfew that began Friday night,\u201d Amnesty International Kenya and 19 other human rights groups said in a statement issued Saturday. The tear gas caused hundreds of people trying to reach a ferry in the port city of Mombasa ahead of the overnight curfew to touch their faces as they vomited, spat and wiped away tears, increasing the chance of the virus spread, the rights groups said. In an apparent show of force on Saturday, South Africa\u2019s military raided a large workers\u2019 hostel in the Alexandra township where some residents had defied the lockdown. From Reuters: Thousands of African, Haitian and Asian migrants bound for the United States have amassed in immigration shelters in Panama and Costa Rica as plans to relocate them to less crowded areas to lower the risk of spreading the coronavirus have faltered. Earlier this week, Costa Rica\u2019s government said it had begun transferring about 2,600 migrants headed for the United States from its southern border with Panama to its frontier with Nicaragua, citing concerns that large crowds could further spread the virus. However, the head of Costa Rica\u2019s immigration office, Raquel Vargas, told Reuters on Saturday that the transfer was suspended until further notice. \u201cWe must find a solution,\u201d Vargas said after Nicaragua decided to send its military to its southern border. Vargas said the transfer of the first group of migrants in coordination with Panama was \u201cvery successful,\u201d but that under the current circumstances more people could not be moved. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife said Saturday that she has recovered from being ill from COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus. \u201cI am feeling so much better,\u201d Sophie Gregoire Trudeau said in a statement on social media. She said she received the clearance from her doctor and Ottawa Public Health. Trudeau\u2019s office announced on 12 March that she had tested positive for the coronavirus after she fell ill upon returning from a trip to London. The prime minister and his family have been in self isolation at home since then. He and their three children didn\u2019t show symptoms. Timor-Leste has declared a state of emergency as part of its efforts to \u201ccontain the pandemic, save lives and ensure the subsistence of supply chains of essential goods and services for our population\u201d. The declaration by the presidency of the council of ministers said they were taking the action \u201ceven though they may limit some fundamental rights and freedoms\u201d \u201cThese measures are taken with respect for constitutional limits and following the guidelines of the World Health Organisation and the example of other States.\u201d The state of emergency came into place on Sunday, and will run until at least 26 April. Timor-Leste is one of the world\u2019s poorest nations, with around 40% of people living below the poverty line. The government has authorised the transfer of $100m from its petroleum fund to fund emergency measures and the purchase of medical supplies. Foreigners are prohibited from entering the country, except for foreigners born in Timor-Leste, resident citizens and legal representatives of minors of Timorese nationality. The restriction doesn\u2019t apply to oil rig workers in the Timor Sea. Anyone entering the country must quarantine for 14 days. Commercial and service establishments, markets and street vendors are allowed, but public transport will cease. Everyone must wear masks when entering commercial or servicing venues, and maintain hygiene and social distancing. All school activities are suspended on a face-to-face basis and the facilities of educational, education and vocational training establishments are closed. Teachers and students are prohibited from staying in the premises. Distance learning should be promoted through the means of information and communication in this period. Licences, authorisations, visas and residence permits, and other administrative acts and documents will remain valid regardless of expiry dates. In Argentina, Uki Go\u00f1i reports some optimism. Authorities are hopeful that Argentina may have imposed its nationwide lockdown early enough to avoid the kind of difficult scenarios seen in the US or Europe. The country added only 55 new cases of coronavirus and two deaths to its toll Saturday, bringing the total to 745 cases and 19 deaths so far, a sharp drop from the 101 cases Friday. \u201cThe spike is moving to May and we are hoping it won\u2019t be abrupt,\u201d said health minister Gin\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda. The lockdown was declared on March 20 when there were only 128 cases and three deaths reported. The government\u2019s deepest concern regarding the spread of the virus is the Greater Buenos Aires area around the capital city of buenos Aires, with a population of over 12 million people. Some 21% of the GBA live in shanty towns, most of them without access to running water, nearly half of whom sleep more than three to a room. Unemployment is over 10% and 40% of the employed are informal workers without benefits. \u201cThe quarantine is a dramatic situation for people in vulnerable situations,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Salvia of the Social Observatory of the Catholic University of Buenos Aires, which provides the most reliable statistics on poverty in Argentina. The quarantine has had one unexpected consequence, according to pharmacists, a shortage of Viagra, after the stock for March sold out early. \u201cThere was an unexpected consumption,\u201d said Marcelo Peretta, head of the Argentine Union of Pharmacists, who blamed the free time at home by the imposed quarantine for the run on the erectile dysfunction drug. \u201cWe had to limit the amount sold per person, we never thought we\u2019d sell this much Viagra.\u201d Further details on the first Covid-19 related death in New Zealand. The woman, who authorities said had underlying health conditions, was reportedly diagnosed with influenza on admittance to hospital. New Zealand health officials confirmed new 63 cases on Sunday \u2013 a drop from the increase of the previous two days \u2013 with the overall number of coronavirus cases standing at 514, said the director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield. Nine were receiving hospital care and one other was in intensive care on a ventilator. From Reuters: Mexico\u2019s deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell called on Saturday on all residents in Mexico to stay at home for a month, saying it was the only way to reduce the transmission rate of the coronavirus. Mexican health authorities said there was a total of 848 confirmed cases in Mexico as of Saturday, 131 more than the previous day, and 16 deaths. President Donald Trump will send off a naval hospital ship Saturday before it heads to New York City, as he aims to highlight the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. The USNS Comfort, a 1,000-bed hospital ship, had been undergoing planned maintenance, but was rushed back into service to aid the city which is now the centre of the nation\u2019s outbreak. It is scheduled to arrive Monday at a Manhattan pier a week after its sister ship, the USNS Mercy arrived in Los Angeles to preform similar duty on the West Coast. Trump, 73, is in a high-risk category because of his age, and federal guidance for weeks has advised those in that pool to refrain from non-essential travel of all sorts. He has already tested negative once after close contact with officials who came down with the virus. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to be hugging people and it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m going to be shaking people\u2019s hands and everything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I think it sends a signal when the president is able to go there and say thank you. So, you know, we\u2019ll be careful.\u201d China reported 45 new coronavirus cases in the mainland for 28 March, down from 54 on the previous day, Reuters reports. All but one involved travelers from overseas, the country\u2019s health authority said on Sunday. The reported number of imported cases also fell from 54 on the previous day, data from the National Health Commission showed. China also reported five new deaths on Saturday, all of which were in Wuhan in Hubei province, where the Covid-19 respiratory illness was first identified. A total of 3,300 people have now died in mainland China, with a reported 81,439 infections. Saturday marked the fourth consecutive day that Hubei province recorded no new confirmed cases. With traffic restrictions in the province lifted, Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, is also gradually reopening borders and restarting some local transportation services. The only domestic transmission on Saturday was recorded in central China\u2019s Henan province, which borders Hubei. Still in Australia, a 75-year-old Queensland woman, who had been on board the Ruby Princess cruise ship, has died overnight. A man aged in his 80s also died in a Melbourne hospital overnight. The deaths bring Australia\u2019s toll to 16. For more details on this and Morrison\u2019s press conference, follow our Australia-focussed blog here. Australian authorities are giving an update of the situation there. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia\u2019s daily rate of increase in cases had dropped from between 25-30% to 13-15%. Morrison says this shows the government\u2019s containment measures (which have caused some confusion among Australians with some very specific limits like a maximum 30 minutes at a hairdresser, only five people at a wedding, but 10 people at a bootcamp or funeral), are working. But the government will not release modelling to show this. Morrison pushes back on questions about adopting tactics used by other countries. He says they won\u2019t \u201ccut and paste measures from other places where they have completely different societies\u201d. He cites Chinese authorities welding people\u2019s doors shut, suggesting that maybe people were \u201cOK with that\u201d. Morrison has told media that of the country\u2019s 3,809 confirmed cases, 2,562 were imported from overseas. New Zealand, which is a few days into a lockdown lasting at least four weeks, has reported the first death attributed to Covid-19. Dr Ashley Bloomfield said the West Coast woman was in her 70s, and was initially diagnosed with influenza. Because of this hospital staff were only wearing PPE suitable for a case of influenza, not Covid-19, and 21 people were now in self-isolation. Bloomfield said none of the staff were showing symptoms, and staffing at the hospital wouldn\u2019t be affected because of the cancellation of all elective procedures. New Zealand has 514 cases, most with a link to international travel. \u201cToday\u2019s death is the reminder of the fight that we have on our hands,\u201d prime minister Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cStay at home, break the chain, and save lives.\u201d Donald Trump has now said there will be no need to enforce a regional quarantine on New York and neighbouring states. A few minutes ago the president tweeted that he would instead have the CDC issue \u201ca strong travel advisory\u201d. US president Donald Trump has flagged an enforced regional quarantine of the state of New York, and parts of Connecticut and New Jersey. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about certain things. Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it\u2019s a hotspot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might not have to do it, but there\u2019s a possibility that sometime today we\u2019ll do a quarantine, short-term, two weeks on New York. Probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut. This would be an enforceable quarantine. I\u2019d rather not do it, but maybe we need it.\u201d But New York governor Andrew Cuomo says it wasn\u2019t mentioned when they spoke, and he\u2019s said such a move would be \u201ca federal declaration of war\u201d. Why you would want to just create total pandemonium on top of a pandemic I have no idea,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally opposite with what the president would want to do, work with the states, get the economy running and get some sense of stability. You wouldn\u2019t at this point literally fracture the entire nation because it\u2019s not just New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, it\u2019s Louisiana and New Orleans. The numbers will continue to rise and every few days it\u2019s going to be another hotspot.\u201d He added: \u201cIt would be chaos and mayhem. If we start walling off areas all across the country it would just be totally bizarre, counterproductive, anti-American, anti-social.\u201d Read more here. Welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to colleagues in the UK for running the last day\u2019s coverage, which you can catch up on here. If you have questions, comments, or contributions, you can reach me on Twitter @heldavidson In the meantime, here are the latest updates: The global death toll has passed 30,000, with confirmed cases at 660,706. Northern Ireland has announced a wave of new restrictive measures which came into force an hour ago, including a ban on gatherings and leaving home without a reasonable excuse. Spain has announced further restrictions on movement to stem the flow of the virus, with all non-essential workers being told to stay home. Panama\u2019s government has said it will allow the Zaandam cruise ship to pass through the Panama Canal, after passengers got stuck on board when authorities refused to grant access. The cruise ship has 130 people with flu-like symptoms, and four have died. At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus. The coronavirus death toll in France has passed the grim milestone of 2,000 deaths, with more than 38,000 cases. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliff, the British-Iranian aid worker who has been detained in Iran on spying charges has had her prison leave extended and her case put forward for clemency, her husband said Cases in the US have passed 120,000. A letter from UK prime minister Boris Johnson will be sent to every household in Britain, warning them that the worst of the virus is yet to come.",

      "body": "<p>The coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to the demise of thousands of restaurants, pubs, shopping chains and other high street businesses, despite the government offering unprecedented financial support and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/british-firms-to-be-given-more-protection-from-bankruptcy\">changing insolvency rules</a> to give companies more time to pay debts.</p> <p>The nationwide lockdown has already forced the permanent closure of almost all branches of the restaurant chains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/carluccios-set-to-file-for-administration-amid-coronavirus-shutdown\">Carluccio\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/most-chiquito-uk-restaurants-will-not-reopen-after-coronavirus-lockdown\">Chiquito</a>. Other big restaurant groups, pubs and shopping chains have warned that they could collapse if the government extends the self-isolation conditions beyond the initial three-week period.</p> <p>The fashion chain Monsoon Accessorize said on Sunday it had been badly affected by the outbreak and was looking at a range of options. One is a sale of the business, which is being explored by restructuring experts at FRP Advisory, raising fears for the future of the chain\u2019s 3,500 employees.</p> <p>The number of people visiting the high street has decreased by three-quarters since the government ordered non-key workers to venture out of their homes only to buy food, for other essential services, or for daily exercise.</p> <p>The retail intelligence firm Springboard said footfall last Tuesday \u2013 the first day of the lockdown \u2013 was down 75.4% compared with the same day in 2019. \u201cThe annual decline in UK footfall on Tuesday 24 March was the most severe on any day since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, but it was still less than in both Italy and the US,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director of Springboard.</p> <p>Pressure on retailers was underlined by analysts at Goldman Sachs, who predicted that clothing and homeware sales at Marks &amp; Spencer could fall by 60% in the three months to the end of June. The credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has cut its assessment of M&amp;S\u2019s long-term debt from BBB to BB+, a grade that is often referred to as \u201cjunk\u201d debt.</p> <p>The downturn comes as new figures showed that pub and restaurant businesses were already under severe pressure before the coronavirus struck the UK.</p> <p>More than 1,400 restaurant businesses and at least 500 pub businesses collapsed into insolvency last year, according to the accountancy group UHY Hacker Young. The number of collapses in 2019 was 10% higher than in 2018, and included high-profile names such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/21/jamie-oliver-jobs-administrators-restaurants-jamies-italian\">Jamie Oliver\u2019s UK restaurant empire</a>.</p> <p>Peter Kubik, a partner at UHY Hacker Young, said restaurant chains were likely to be the hardest hit from the coronavirus crisis. \u201cMost other businesses can shift their staff to home working or sell through the internet. Clearly that is not possible for pubs,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Restaurant Group has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/most-chiquito-uk-restaurants-will-not-reopen-after-coronavirus-lockdown\">the majority of its Chiquito </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/most-chiquito-uk-restaurants-will-not-reopen-after-coronavirus-lockdown\">restaurants </a>will not reopen when movement restrictions are lifted, and nor will its 11 London-based Food &amp; Fuel pubs, leading to the loss of 1,500 jobs.</p> <p>The group, which also owns Wagamama and Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s, has previously blamed falling sales for the decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/03/chiquito-close-restaurant-group-wagamama\">close more than 100</a> of its outlets. The company is run by Andy Hornby, who was chief executive of HBOS during the 2008 financial crisis when the bank had to be rescued by Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>The Italian restaurant chain Carluccio\u2019s is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/carluccios-set-to-file-for-administration-amid-coronavirus-shutdown\">understood to be preparing to file for administration</a>. The restructuring specialist FRP Advisory confirmed it was working with the chain, which has 73 sites and about 2,000 employees.</p> <p>Fred Diamond, a consumer analyst at GlobalData, said the outlook for the restaurant and pub sector looked increasingly bleak. \u201cAs people adjust to isolation by making their home as comfortable as possible, street retailers will have an even harder time convincing people to leave their living rooms. The restaurant sector will, by the end of this, have fewer stores and less cash,\u201d Diamond said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to the demise of thousands of restaurants, pubs, shopping chains and other high street businesses, despite the government offering unprecedented financial support and changing insolvency rules to give companies more time to pay debts. The nationwide lockdown has already forced the permanent closure of almost all branches of the restaurant chains Carluccio\u2019s and Chiquito. Other big restaurant groups, pubs and shopping chains have warned that they could collapse if the government extends the self-isolation conditions beyond the initial three-week period. The fashion chain Monsoon Accessorize said on Sunday it had been badly affected by the outbreak and was looking at a range of options. One is a sale of the business, which is being explored by restructuring experts at FRP Advisory, raising fears for the future of the chain\u2019s 3,500 employees. The number of people visiting the high street has decreased by three-quarters since the government ordered non-key workers to venture out of their homes only to buy food, for other essential services, or for daily exercise. The retail intelligence firm Springboard said footfall last Tuesday \u2013 the first day of the lockdown \u2013 was down 75.4% compared with the same day in 2019. \u201cThe annual decline in UK footfall on Tuesday 24 March was the most severe on any day since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, but it was still less than in both Italy and the US,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director of Springboard. Pressure on retailers was underlined by analysts at Goldman Sachs, who predicted that clothing and homeware sales at Marks &amp; Spencer could fall by 60% in the three months to the end of June. The credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has cut its assessment of M&amp;S\u2019s long-term debt from BBB to BB+, a grade that is often referred to as \u201cjunk\u201d debt. The downturn comes as new figures showed that pub and restaurant businesses were already under severe pressure before the coronavirus struck the UK. More than 1,400 restaurant businesses and at least 500 pub businesses collapsed into insolvency last year, according to the accountancy group UHY Hacker Young. The number of collapses in 2019 was 10% higher than in 2018, and included high-profile names such as Jamie Oliver\u2019s UK restaurant empire. Peter Kubik, a partner at UHY Hacker Young, said restaurant chains were likely to be the hardest hit from the coronavirus crisis. \u201cMost other businesses can shift their staff to home working or sell through the internet. Clearly that is not possible for pubs,\u201d he said. The Restaurant Group has said the majority of its Chiquito restaurants will not reopen when movement restrictions are lifted, and nor will its 11 London-based Food &amp; Fuel pubs, leading to the loss of 1,500 jobs. The group, which also owns Wagamama and Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s, has previously blamed falling sales for the decision to close more than 100 of its outlets. The company is run by Andy Hornby, who was chief executive of HBOS during the 2008 financial crisis when the bank had to be rescued by Lloyds TSB. The Italian restaurant chain Carluccio\u2019s is understood to be preparing to file for administration. The restructuring specialist FRP Advisory confirmed it was working with the chain, which has 73 sites and about 2,000 employees. Fred Diamond, a consumer analyst at GlobalData, said the outlook for the restaurant and pub sector looked increasingly bleak. \u201cAs people adjust to isolation by making their home as comfortable as possible, street retailers will have an even harder time convincing people to leave their living rooms. The restaurant sector will, by the end of this, have fewer stores and less cash,\u201d Diamond said.",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic could cause UK economic output to plunge by an unprecedented 15% in the second quarter of the year and unemployment to more than double, according to dire forecasts. The deepest recession since the financial crisis is now all but unavoidable, according to analysts at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), after businesses shut up shop and consumer spending fell dramatically as a result of lockdown restrictions. The centre said it expected the economy to have shrunk marginally in the first three months of the year by 0.5%, followed by the steepest economic contraction since comparable records began more than 20 years ago. The predicted slump would dwarf the 2.2% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the banking crash took hold, marking by far the worst three-month period since at least 1997. Japan\u2019s Nomura bank has pencilled in a slightly less precipitous fall for the UK of 13.5%, but also predicted a significant rise in unemployment. The bank\u2019s analysts forecast that government initiatives designed to persuade employers not to let staff go will not be enough to stop the figure more than doubling from 3.9% to 8% between April to June, before creeping up to 8.5% in the third quarter. The Department for Work and Pensions said on Wednesday that 477,000 people had applied for universal credit in just nine days, forcing it to redeploy thousands of civil servants to help process the claims. The CEBR and Nomura predict unprecedented economic pain in the second quarter, but both expect a subsequent rebound, assuming coronavirus restrictions are eased and the government takes economic stimulus measures. The CEBR said a cut in VAT could help to kickstart consumer spending, and it expects measures to promote investment in business, which would not recover until 2030 otherwise. That would deliver a \u201csharp bounceback\u201d in the second half of the year, it said, although 2020 GDP would still be 4% lower than 2019. House prices will fall 13% in the year to the end of March 2021, the CEBR said.",

      "bodyText": "A charity founded by Charles Dickens has launched a competition to find real modern-day characters who could have provided the basis for one of the author\u2019s classic creations. Dickens helped to found the Journalists\u2019 Charity in 1864. To mark the 150th anniversary of his death, the charity is asking for written portraits of a modern-day Dickensian character. The subject could be someone in public life, including a politician or and celebrity, or an NHS worker helping to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Entrants have a 300-word limit and are encouraged to take inspiration from Dickens\u2019s prose to bring to life a contemporary figure who could rank alongside Betsey Trotwood, Miss Havisham or Bill Sykes. Ian Dickens, president of the Dickens Fellowship and the author\u2019s great-great-grandson, said the competition was \u201cfull of rich potential and modern-day relevance\u201d because the range of characters that Dickens invented opened the door to all. \u201cDrawn from acute observation of those he knew and those he chanced upon, they connect with the reader because we all recognise elements within them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd such rich pickings continue to place themselves firmly in front of us every day, if we bother to stop, listen and imagine. I can\u2019t wait to meet them.\u201d The author\u2019s characters, including Ebenezer Scrooge and Jacob Marley, were often inspired by people who lived or worked near Dickens, while his villains are still often compared to real-life politicians. Dickens spent time as a parliamentary reporter during the 1830s, when the reform of the poor laws was being debated, and the influence of his reporting notes from the period can be seen in his second novel, Oliver Twist. He was among the group who founded the Journalists\u2019 Charity in 1864, which offers assistance to journalists who are struggling financially and presents annual awards for those who demonstrate \u201can outstanding commitment and contribution to journalism\u201d. The writing competition is free to enter, although organisers encourage entrants to donate to the charity, which will direct support to journalists in need. Ramsay Smith, chairman of the Journalists\u2019 Charity, said: \u201cJournalists the world over are doing a brilliant job reporting the coronavirus pandemic, but the reality is that many, particularly freelance journalists, are facing an extremely challenging time.\u201d All funds will go towards helping journalists who are struggling at a time when newspaper circulation figures are down and freelance work is being cut due to the coronavirus pandemic. The winning entry will be drawn by the veteran cartoonist Stanley McMurtry, who worked for the Daily Mail until 2018. \u201cThis competition provides a great opportunity for people \u2013 journalists and non-journalists alike \u2013 to put their creative skills to work in these strange times. We hope everyone who holds the works of Dickens dear will take part,\u201d Smith added. David Copperfield was recently adapted by Armando Iannucci, who used colourblind casting on the production, which starred Dev Patel as Copperfield, Benedict Wong as Mr Wickfield, Rosalind Eleazar as Agnes and Nikki Amuka-Bird as Mrs Steerforth. Iannucci called it \u201ca response to the kind of toxic conversations we\u2019re having in politics at the moment\u201d and antithetical to the image of Britain as a \u201cdivided and angst-ridden\u201d country that is constantly \u201cputting up barriers\u201d. \u201cI wanted to celebrate what I think Britain is, which is something more lively and vibrant and cheery,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m an optimist.\u201d The deadline for the competition is 9 June 2020, the 150th anniversary of the author\u2019s death, and rules and examples can be found at journalistscharity.org.uk. Hard times: modern politicians who got the Dickensian curse George Osborne Mr Micawber (David Copperfield) The former chancellor earned comparisons to the impecunious clerk after his Mansion House speech in 2015, where he doubled down on his \u201clive within your income\u201d maxim that was also favoured by the character. Three years earlier, the former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Forsyth said the chancellor was aping Micawber by adopting a \u201csomething will turn up\u201d attitude toward the economy. Donald Trump Ebenezer Scrooge (A Christmas Carol) After unveiling a plan to slash food stamp benefits for more than half a million unemployed Americans just before Christmas, Trump became the latest in a long line of politicians to be compared to the miserly Scrooge. Paul Krugman of the New York Times noted that by Trump-era standards, \u201cEbenezer Scrooge was a nice guy\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn Mrs Jellyby (Bleak House) The historian David Starkey said Jeremy Corbyn resembled the \u201ctelescopic philanthropist\u201d Mrs Jellyby in Bleak House because of what he called the former Labour leader\u2019s obsession with \u201cobscure causes\u201d into which he \u201cthrew himself with dour enthusiasm\u201d at the expense of more immediate concerns. Dominic Cummings Sydney Carton (A Tale of Two Cities) Gina Miller read the novel while trying to ignore online trolling, and said that within its pages \u201cyou\u2019ll find Dominic Cummings\u201d. Some speculated that she was referring to Sydney Carton, the doomed fixer for the vain, feckless Mr Stryver. Gavin Williamson Uriah Heep (David Copperfield) The education secretary earned a brutal comparison with perhaps the ugliest of all Dickens\u2019s villains after what the New Statesman called \u201cruthless manoeuvring\u201d and repeated promotions despite \u201chaving no obvious talent other than ingratiating himself with the exceptionally vain\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Strict limits on the number of students that each university in England can recruit are set to be imposed by the government in an effort to avoid a free-for-all on admissions, with institutions plunged into financial turmoil as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>A government source said each university would face limits on the number of UK and EU undergraduates it could admit for the academic year starting in September, in a move backed by higher education leaders. It will be the first such limit since the university admission cap was lifted in 2015.</p> <p>This month, the Guardian reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/06/uk-universities-face-cash-black-hole-coronavirus-crisis\">British universities faced a black hole </a>of hundreds of millions of pounds in tuition fees as international students from China and other countries severely affected by coronavirus are forced to cancel or postpone enrolments.</p> <p>UK university campuses are closed and teaching has moved online. To avoid certain universities hoovering up domestic students to fill their courses, leaving other, less prestigious institutions with empty lecture theatres, the pain will be spread through the introduction of a cap, it is understood.</p> <p>\u201cUnless there are significant developments, this will happen,\u201d said one policymaker involved in the discussions between the government and universities.</p> <p>The imposition of a cap means that students currently going through the application process are set to have their choices restricted.

      "bodyText": "Strict limits on the number of students that each university in England can recruit are set to be imposed by the government in an effort to avoid a free-for-all on admissions, with institutions plunged into financial turmoil as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the Guardian has learned. A government source said each university would face limits on the number of UK and EU undergraduates it could admit for the academic year starting in September, in a move backed by higher education leaders. It will be the first such limit since the university admission cap was lifted in 2015. This month, the Guardian reported that British universities faced a black hole of hundreds of millions of pounds in tuition fees as international students from China and other countries severely affected by coronavirus are forced to cancel or postpone enrolments. UK university campuses are closed and teaching has moved online. To avoid certain universities hoovering up domestic students to fill their courses, leaving other, less prestigious institutions with empty lecture theatres, the pain will be spread through the introduction of a cap, it is understood. \u201cUnless there are significant developments, this will happen,\u201d said one policymaker involved in the discussions between the government and universities. The imposition of a cap means that students currently going through the application process are set to have their choices restricted. It also means some students will not be able to attend universities at which they have been offered place. The policy was backed by the board of Universities UK at a virtual meeting held on Friday, although it was strongly opposed by some leading universities, including several members of the Russell Group of research-intensive institutions. The decision is likely to be announced within the next few days, although some well-known institutions are fighting a rearguard battle in Whitehall over worries that they will also face financial difficulty if they cannot recruit additional student numbers from the UK to replace the international tuition fees they expect to lose. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK (UUK), the group that includes most mainstream English universities, said: \u201cThe UUK board discussed a range of measures needed to promote financial stability of the sector in these tough times. Foremost was the need for government financial support for universities.

Under current rules, all EU citizens have until June 2021 to apply for settled status. However, there are concerns that the pandemic will mean that the government support available to help EU citizens will reduce, and public awareness campaigns, designed to reach the most vulnerable people and those without an online presence, will be delayed.

Morrison said the daily rate of increase had declined from 25-30% a week ago to as low as 9% on Sunday.

It instructs frontline workers to use goggles in procedures most likely to generate virus-carrying aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube.</p> \n<p>It states that aprons rather than disposable full-sleeve gowns can be worn in other cases. The British Medical Association said this differs from WHO guidance on gowns and goggles for all healthcare workers dealing with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases.</p> \n<p>Nurses said the latest official guidance about personal protection \u201clacks any credibility\u201d. \u201cEvery minute we wait for new guidance is a minute too long,\u201d said Dame Donna Kinnair, Royal College of Nursing general secretary. \u201cThe confusion must stop. We need action.\u201d</p> \n<p>NHS England said it was reviewing the guidance and would issue new instructions on what equipment to wear in what circumstances in the coming days.</p> \n<p>Dr Claudia Paoloni, president of HCSA, the hospital doctors\u2019 union, said there was no \u201cluxury of days\u201d. \u201cRoyal Colleges have been taking matters into their own hands with reinterpretations of the guidance, which is causing confusion and contradiction on the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cSome trusts have broken ranks and rightly introduced more stringent measures. The rate at which the disease is progressing means the government and PHE need to get on top of this, and quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>Two hundred and nine fatalities from coronavirus were announced in the UK on Sunday. The increase was smaller than feared, but health experts cautioned against seeing any glimmer of hope.</p> \n<p>The Department for Health and Social Care announced that 19,522 people had tested positive for the disease in the UK, following another 6,961 tests in the last day. That testing rate is short of the 10,000 tests the government has promised and well short of the 25,000 tests a day that Boris Johnson promised.</p> \n<p>The former prime minister Tony Blair joined the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, in calling for ramping up testing for the virus. Speaking on Sky News, Blair said: \u201cIt is all about getting to mass testing as fast as possible, because we have to know who has the disease and who has had the disease in order to get the lockdown eased and get people back to work.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bde155c3-43e7-4929-8506-bb043a798a88\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2JsWf-2nN1Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "The deaths of the first British doctors from Covid-19 have intensified pressure on ministers to accelerate the supply of protective equipment and address growing fears among frontline staff that they risk catching and spreading coronavirus. As the UK\u2019s death toll from the virus rose to 1,228 over the weekend, two surgeons were confirmed to have died in what the NHS medical director described as \u201ca stark reminder to the whole country that we all must take this crisis seriously\u201d. Amged El-Hawrani, a 55-year-old ear, nose and throat consultant, died on Saturday at Leicester Royal Infirmary, while Adil El Tayar, 63, an organ transplant specialist, died on Wednesday at West Middlesex University Hospital in London, it emerged. Both had contracted Covid-19. As they mourned the death of their colleagues, doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 groups attacked continuing shortages of protective equipment \u2013 from masks to gowns \u2013 and complained that there was still confusion despite fresh official guidance about their proper use. There were further calls to ramp up testing of NHS workers. Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer, said fatalities were expected to increase. With Britain beginning its second full week under effective lockdown, she indicated that normal life was not likely to resume for three to six months \u2013 and \u201cit is plausible it could go further than that\u201d, she cautioned. On Monday, the public was asked to stop all non-essential travel, work from home if possible, and limit exercise to once a day, with a ban of gatherings of more than two people. All pubs, restaurants, cafes, cinemas and gyms have been told to close. Harries said: \u201cOver time \u2013 probably over the next six months \u2013 we will have a three-week review, we will see where we\u2019re going. We need to keep that lid on and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal. \u201cSo I think three weeks for review. Two or three months to see whether we\u2019ve really squashed it, with about three to six months ideally, and lots of uncertainty in that, but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal. It is plausible that it could go further than that.\u201d Harries described El-Hawrani\u2019s death as \u201ca worrying event\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is in no one\u2019s interests that we lose our colleagues.\u201d Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said his death was \u201cnot just an individual human tragedy, but a stark reminder to the whole country that we all must take this crisis seriously\u201d. Pradeep Kumar, a surgeon, said he was angry at the loss of his friend. \u201cDid it have to be this way?\u201d he said. \u201cSuch a waste of precious life.\u201d Tayar had spent his final days volunteering to stem the outbreak in an A&amp;E department in the Midlands. \u201cHe wanted to be deployed where he would be most useful in the crisis,\u201d his cousin, British-Sudanese journalist Zeinab Badawi, said. Boris Johnson, who continues to suffer \u201cmild symptoms\u201d of Covid-19, released a video on Sunday night announcing that 20,000 former NHS workers had returned to the frontline, up from 7,500 on Monday. At least 2,660 doctors have heeded the call to return from retirement to fight the pandemic, but hundreds have warned that they will not do so or increase their hours unless they are guaranteed proper compensation if they die, the Guardian has learned. The families of doctors who leave the NHS pension scheme are not normally paid death-in-service compensation, which is worth over two years\u2019 salary. The department of health and social care said it was \u201cconsidering proposals to offer further support for those returning to the frontline\u201d. With supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) becoming the key concern for frontline health workers, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, insisted that he understood the urgent need for protection. At the the daily government press conference, he said over 200m items of protective kit had been delivered so far, including 170m masks, 42.8m gloves, 13.7m aprons, 2.3m pairs of eye protectors and 182,000 gowns to 58,000 \u201chealthcare settings\u201d, including hospitals and GP surgeries. Addressing \u201call those who rely on this equipment, and their families and loved ones\u201d, Jenrick said: \u201cWe will not stop until we have got you the equipment you need.\u201d NHS England and Public Health England (PHE) have acknowledged there had been distribution and supply problems. In a letter sent on Saturday to hospitals, GPs and commissioning bodies, their leaders said they were \u201cnow confident that all logistical issues are being solved and that every part of the NHS that needs PPE will be supplied in good time with adequate stock\u201d. But Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association council, said: \u201cThe reality is that [PPE is] still not reaching hundreds, if not thousands, of frontline staff on the ground \u2013 with current reports from around the country from doctors that supplies are running out, being rationed or of inadequate protection. \u201cWe already have many doctors telling us that they\u2019re extremely concerned that they feel the level of PPE that they currently have is not adequate to protect themselves and their colleagues against Covid-19 \u2026 Doctors here will understandably be concerned when they see images in the media of their colleagues around the world treating patients in full overalls and full face protection, and asking why the same is not recommended or available here.\u201d Guidance issued over the weekend by NHS England and PHE about how the equipment should be used also diverges from World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, doctors said. It instructs frontline workers to use goggles in procedures most likely to generate virus-carrying aerosols, such as inserting a breathing tube. It states that aprons rather than disposable full-sleeve gowns can be worn in other cases. The British Medical Association said this differs from WHO guidance on gowns and goggles for all healthcare workers dealing with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases. Nurses said the latest official guidance about personal protection \u201clacks any credibility\u201d. \u201cEvery minute we wait for new guidance is a minute too long,\u201d said Dame Donna Kinnair, Royal College of Nursing general secretary. \u201cThe confusion must stop. We need action.\u201d NHS England said it was reviewing the guidance and would issue new instructions on what equipment to wear in what circumstances in the coming days. Dr Claudia Paoloni, president of HCSA, the hospital doctors\u2019 union, said there was no \u201cluxury of days\u201d. \u201cRoyal Colleges have been taking matters into their own hands with reinterpretations of the guidance, which is causing confusion and contradiction on the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cSome trusts have broken ranks and rightly introduced more stringent measures. The rate at which the disease is progressing means the government and PHE need to get on top of this, and quickly.\u201d Two hundred and nine fatalities from coronavirus were announced in the UK on Sunday. The increase was smaller than feared, but health experts cautioned against seeing any glimmer of hope. The Department for Health and Social Care announced that 19,522 people had tested positive for the disease in the UK, following another 6,961 tests in the last day. That testing rate is short of the 10,000 tests the government has promised and well short of the 25,000 tests a day that Boris Johnson promised. The former prime minister Tony Blair joined the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, in calling for ramping up testing for the virus. Speaking on Sky News, Blair said: \u201cIt is all about getting to mass testing as fast as possible, because we have to know who has the disease and who has had the disease in order to get the lockdown eased and get people back to work.\u201d",

Periodically the French authorities attempt to prevent them from coming but asylum seekers continue to arrive. Some pay people-smugglers to get them into lorries parked near the port while those who have no money try to conceal themselves in moving trucks.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Who travels to camps on the Channel? </b></p>\n    <p>Many asylum seekers have relatives or friends in the UK or have some level of English language skills. But the 1,000 or so refugees currently living in Calais and Dunkirk represent a very small proportion of refugees seeking asylum across Europe.<br></p>\n    <p>Although the situation in Northern France attracts attention because it is at the UK border, the numbers gathered here are tiny compared with the 100,000- plus who arrived in Europe in 2017, the vast majority of whom intend to claim asylum elsewhere in Europe.</p>\n    <p><b>What are politicians doing to change the situation?</b></p>\n    <p>The British government has contributed to a \u00a317m joint Anglo-French package of security measures, including the construction of a 1km-long concrete wall, aimed at preventing asylum seekers from getting close lorries arriving at the port.</p>\n    <p>But charities say extra security does not prevent the arrival of new refugees. They want the British government to make it easier for vulnerable unaccompanied children to travel legally and for France to accept that there will always be some refugees in Calais, and provide dignified reception centres.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Conditions in the camps are worsening, with shortages of food, water and showers as NGOs are forced to pull out because of the coronavirus pandemic, although no cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the camps.</p> \n<p>Many refugees \u2013 mostly from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq and Sudan \u2013 often make repeated attempts to cross to the UK. Last year, 1,900 reached the UK by boat, with many others arriving by lorry. Eighty migrants are understood to have reached the UK by boat last week, with some reports of around 160 attempts in one day.</p> \n<p>While numbers are disputed, internal documents collated by NGOs in the area and seen by the Guardian revealed there are about 1,500 people in Calais, including 160 unaccompanied children, the youngest of whom is 11. There are about 600 people in Grand Synthe in Dunkirk, including around 35 families. Some have serious health problems such as diabetes, and others have suffered broken limbs including a broken arm and a broken jaw.</p> \n<p>A 16-year-old boy from Sudan told the Guardian that he planned to run away and cross the Channel rather than go into one of the French centres. \u201cIf we are taken away to these centres we won\u2019t know what will happen to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI will run away and I will keep trying to reach the UK by lorry.

This thing is going to be like a miracle, everything\u2019s going to be OK by Easter and we\u2019ll have the churches full.\u2019 \u201cAnd then a couple of days later he talks about a quarantine. [New York governor] Andrew Cuomo didn\u2019t know about it, nobody really seemed to know, it just came out of his head.\u201d DeSantis, a fervent supporter of the president, is following suit, King believes: \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s ahead of the curve, I think he\u2019s somewhere behind it. This whole situation is a little bit like the barn door has been locked but the horse was stolen, I\u2019m going to say, 10 days ago.\u201d The author did have some good news for fans. Publication of his next book, If It Bleeds, has been brought forward two weeks to 28 April, to entertain self-isolating readers sooner. King noted that the new publication date would be the same as his fellow bestselling author John Grisham\u2019s new novel, Camino Winds. \u201cI want to talk to the publisher about maybe doing a two-for-one,\u201d he said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be cool, a double feature?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hull Trains is to become the first British rail operator to suspend all services, after cancelling trains between London and the port city until further notice due to the \u201cunprecedented circumstances\u201d caused by coronavirus. The company, part of rail operator FirstGroup, said it has been forced into the decision to safeguard the future of the business, after passenger numbers dwindled following government advice to avoid nonessential travel. Most routes on the UK rail network have been stripped back because of decreased demand but Hull Trains is the first company to stop running altogether. The government has also suspended rail franchises in England because of the pandemic, relieving the companies that run them of financial risk. Hull Trains is not a franchise owner but an open access operator, which takes the full commercial risk of its business rather than sharing it with the government. Open access train companies buy the right to run trains on government infrastructure, in order to foster competition with franchise companies. Government-owned LNER also runs a service between London and Hull, after a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin Group was stripped of the franchise. As one of three such firms in the country, Hull Trains has not been offered additional financial support from the government, which franchised rail operators have. Louise Cheeseman, the managing director of Hull Trains, said that suspending services was a difficult decision but it would help keep the business alive. \u201cWe have explored every avenue to try to keep trains running but sadly it is not currently financially viable to run our services,\u201d she said, adding that the company will resume services as soon as it can. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very difficult week for the business but the reluctant decision to temporarily suspend services is the right one based on the current unprecedented circumstances and I hope our passengers understand this. \u201cThe move protects the long-term future of Hull Trains and our people\u2019s jobs, which is important as it will allow us to reinstate operations quickly when possible.\u201d Mick Cash, the general secretary of transport union RMT, said: \u201cThis decision affects 130 rail staff around the Hull area and they must be treated as an absolute priority. \u201cWe expect the company and the government to guarantee wages at 100% and not some reduced rate and we also expect jobs, service, pensions and conditions for these rail staff to be fully protected throughout this crisis. \u201cWe will be in direct talks to secure our members the guarantees they are entitled to.

It has received only 192. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything that we can,\u201d Edwards said. Detroit, Michigan, is also hurtling towards becoming a major disaster area. By Sunday there had been more than 2,000 confirmed cases in the city and 46 deaths.

Like many other governors she has been frustrated by the slow response of the federal government in providing ventilators and essential protective gear for frontline medical workers. Trump has responded to her appeals for help by denigrating her as \u201cthe woman from Michigan\u201d and by recounting publicly how he advised the vice-president, Mike Pence, not to talk to her. She refused to rise to the bait, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t have the energy to respond to every slight.\u201d Coronavirus continues to overshadow the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Biden appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday and cautioned against raising \u201cfalse expectations\u201d \u2013 a clear reference to Trump\u2019s much-vaunted ambition to reopen parts of the country. \u201cThe American people have never shied away from being able to deal with the truth,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe worst thing you can do is raise false expectations and then watch them get dashed \u2013 then, they begin to lose confidence in their leadership.\u201d",

And that\u2019s where you need to be concerned about extremists exploiting legitimate concerns.</p> <p>\u201cDisaffected English nationalists were manifesting themselves at the extremes in things like the British National party and National Action, which fed the undertone that articulated itself as extreme rightwing terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>However, the crossbench peer warned that it remained to be seen whether potential far-right supporters would be wholly satisfied by Johnson\u2019s administration.</p> <p>\u201cAttention still needs to be paid to this group, as it is not clear that they will feel entirely assuaged as a result of the fact that people are paying wider attention to them now. Terrorist problems emerge when you have a significant population who feel alienated and nobody takes notice of them, causing frustration and anger,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Evans, who was made a life peer in 2014, made the comments in an interview with the US-based Combat Terrorism Center. He has previously said the rise of far-right terrorism in Britain has been encouraged by years of austerity following the 2008 recession.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect it is a reflection of the social pressures on communities as a result of austerity measures. There seems to be a constituency of disaffected males (for the most part, but not entirely) who find extreme rightwing beliefs attractive. And they have started to get their acts together to organise into groups and plot.\u201d</p> <p>In the interview, he said some far-right terrorists had been \u201cconsciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of violent Islamists\u201d.</p> <p>He added that the EDL was \u201cmutually symbiotic\u201d with Anjem Choudary\u2019s al-Muhajiroun group and described the emergence of neo-Nazi terrorist organisation National Action and its successor groups, which have described their ideology as \u201cwhite jihad\u201d, as predictable.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere is some evidence that they have been consciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of the violent Islamists in getting their grievances on the table as a result of violence and thought, \u2018Well, we can do something like that.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Last September the head of counterterror police, Neil Basu, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/19/fastest-growing-uk-terrorist-threat-is-from-far-right-say-police\">vowed to thwart</a> the rise of the far right, which the force has said is the fastest-growing terrorist threat in the UK.</p> <p>The number of white terror suspects being arrested in the UK has outstripped those of Asian background for two years in a row, and of the 25 attack plots that have been foiled since March 2017, 16 were Islamist, eight far right and one \u201cother\u201d.</p> <p>In 2018 MI5 took the lead in investigating the most dangerous extreme rightwing terrorists in a sign of how seriously the threat was being taken.</p> <p>Some terrorists were incited by extreme rightwing propaganda, such as Thomas Mair, who murdered the MP Jo Cox in 2016. But others, like Darren Osborne, who attacked Muslim worshippers with a van in north London, had acted after reading lawful material from groups such as the EDL and mainstream media.</p>",

And that\u2019s where you need to be concerned about extremists exploiting legitimate concerns. \u201cDisaffected English nationalists were manifesting themselves at the extremes in things like the British National party and National Action, which fed the undertone that articulated itself as extreme rightwing terrorism.\u201d However, the crossbench peer warned that it remained to be seen whether potential far-right supporters would be wholly satisfied by Johnson\u2019s administration. \u201cAttention still needs to be paid to this group, as it is not clear that they will feel entirely assuaged as a result of the fact that people are paying wider attention to them now. Terrorist problems emerge when you have a significant population who feel alienated and nobody takes notice of them, causing frustration and anger,\u201d he added. Evans, who was made a life peer in 2014, made the comments in an interview with the US-based Combat Terrorism Center. He has previously said the rise of far-right terrorism in Britain has been encouraged by years of austerity following the 2008 recession. \u201cI suspect it is a reflection of the social pressures on communities as a result of austerity measures. There seems to be a constituency of disaffected males (for the most part, but not entirely) who find extreme rightwing beliefs attractive. And they have started to get their acts together to organise into groups and plot.\u201d In the interview, he said some far-right terrorists had been \u201cconsciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of violent Islamists\u201d. He added that the EDL was \u201cmutually symbiotic\u201d with Anjem Choudary\u2019s al-Muhajiroun group and described the emergence of neo-Nazi terrorist organisation National Action and its successor groups, which have described their ideology as \u201cwhite jihad\u201d, as predictable. He added: \u201cThere is some evidence that they have been consciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of the violent Islamists in getting their grievances on the table as a result of violence and thought, \u2018Well, we can do something like that.\u2019\u201d Last September the head of counterterror police, Neil Basu, vowed to thwart the rise of the far right, which the force has said is the fastest-growing terrorist threat in the UK. The number of white terror suspects being arrested in the UK has outstripped those of Asian background for two years in a row, and of the 25 attack plots that have been foiled since March 2017, 16 were Islamist, eight far right and one \u201cother\u201d. In 2018 MI5 took the lead in investigating the most dangerous extreme rightwing terrorists in a sign of how seriously the threat was being taken. Some terrorists were incited by extreme rightwing propaganda, such as Thomas Mair, who murdered the MP Jo Cox in 2016. But others, like Darren Osborne, who attacked Muslim worshippers with a van in north London, had acted after reading lawful material from groups such as the EDL and mainstream media.",

The MP\u2019s sister, Rachel, could also face admonishment from police after she tweeted that she had visited her parents to deliver a \u201ccake, a crumble and a lamb curry!\u201d It comes as a 13-year-old boy was arrested and his mother was \u201cdealt with\u201d as police forces across the country were given new powers to detain people failing to comply with coronavirus lockdown rules. Ste Richardson, a senior section officer for West Yorkshire police, arrested the teenager under emergency legislation introduced on Thursday, which granted police powers to issue \u00a360 on-the-spot fines or make arrests for breaches of the UK\u2019s coronavirus rules. The officer, who is based in Leeds, said on social media the boy had refused to give him any details and he had had \u201cno choice\u201d but to arrest him. It is unclear how the child had broken the lockdown rules. In a now-deleted tweet, Richardson wrote: \u201cToday I arrested a 13 year old male under the new coronavirus powers. The male refused to give me any details so I could take him home under the Act. He was arrested and taken to custody. His mother was dealt with for being a responsible person failing to comply.\u201d Ken Marsh, the head of the Metropolitan Police Federation, has previously said that the parents of older teenagers should be forced to pay fines if they were caught ignoring government guidance. Elsewhere, a motorist was stopped by a motorway patrol on a 224-mile round trip to buy an item from eBay \u2013 with his wife in the boot, police said. The driver travelled from Coventry to collect the eBay purchase of windows in Salford, Greater Manchester, despite the public being warned only to make essential journeys due to the coronavirus pandemic. After they picked up his purchase in Salford, the driver\u2019s wife could not fit in the vehicle for the two-hour return journey south. She was travelling in the boot of the car when they were pulled over by a motorway patrol on the M6 in Cheshire, according to a tweet by the North West Motorway Police Twitter feed. Officers wrote out a traffic offence report for the driver. On Friday, Derbyshire police were criticised after releasing drone footage of walkers at a beauty spot along with the warning that such exercise did not constitute \u201cessential travel\u201d. At the weekend the same force took the step of dying the normally clear waters of a picturesque quarry near Buxton black in an attempt to deter people from visiting. In North Yorkshire police have been carrying out spot checks near Harrogate and said checkpoints could appear anywhere, any time. Roadblocks were also set up in Plymouth, Devon, while in Cornwall 150 vehicles were checked in Penzance, Hayle and St Ives. In Northern Ireland, police were preparing to target tourist sites and visitor locations, as they adopted new rules at 11pm on Saturday. Northern Ireland was the last part of the UK to develop regulations flowing from the new powers. Officers across the UK have issued fines less than 24 hours after new laws were brought into force, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said. Those who ignore the tougher restrictions on movement could be hit with a \u00a360 fine initially \u2013 reduced to \u00a330 if paid within 14 days \u2013 and another for \u00a3120 for a second offence. Fines could reach \u00a31,000-plus for repeat offenders. Derbyshire police said they broke up a \u201cmassive party\u201d on Saturday night involving 25 adults and children. The Derby West response section of the force tweeted: \u201cOfficers have just attended an address in absolute shock to find 25 adults and children having a massive party with speakers and karaoke. Everyone dispersed and hosts dealt with. It is clear people are still having complete disregard for the Government advice and rules.\u201d In Surrey, police broke up a house party in the Stanwell area, while in Cornwall walkers were criticised for ignoring lockdown advice and pouring into rural villages. A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall police said they were receiving regular reports from people concerned about others flouting the lockdown rules with about five calls an hour since 10am on Saturday. Many forces have created hotlines to submit tip-offs about people allegedly flouting the social distancing rules, including gatherings of more than two people. West Midlands, Greater Manchester, and Avon and Somerset have also established online forums for those keen to report rule-breakers.",

the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented, according to a former government chief scientific adviser.</p> \n  <p>Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, told the Guardian that a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled.</p> \n  <p>The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government.

Normal life will not resume for at least six months, according to the chief deputy medical officer (see 4.51pm) as she warned the coronavirus death toll was expected to increase \u201cfor the next week or two\u201d. Dr Jenny Harries described the first confirmed death of a frontline NHS worker with coronavirus as \u201cworrying\u201d, as Amged El-Hawrani\u2019s family paid tribute to the \u201cmuch-loved husband, son, father, brother, and friend\u201d (see 4.07pm). The UK death toll from coronavirus increased by 209 people in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 1,228 so far (see 2.05pm). The figure was lower than Saturday\u2019s record rise of 260, which may bring some hope that the rise in deaths could stabilise soon. NHS workers should not be asked to work without protective equipment, said the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick. Directly appealing to frontline workers, he said the government \u201cwill not stop\u201d until healthcare staff are provided with the equipment they need as he outlined the vast amounts of stocks which are in the process of being received around the country (see 4.19pm). A 108-year-old woman and survivor of the 1918 Spanish flu is thought to have become the oldest victim of coronavirus in the UK. Hilda Churchill died in a Salford care home on Saturday, hours after testing positive for Covid-19 and just eight days before her 109th birthday. 19,522 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK, after 127,737 tests, the Department of Health confirmed; while 95 people in Scotland are in intensive care with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, with the figures for England, Wales and Northern Ireland unknown. The UK\u2019s biological security strategy, published in 2018 to address the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented and a lack of resources was to blame, according to Prof Ian Boyd, a former government chief scientific adviser. Government does not rule out mass repatriation flights, with Britons stranded around the world struggling to return from places where a lockdown has been imposed (see 5.07pm). Labour deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon said criticism of China\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak by ministers represented a \u201cTrump-style\u201d ploy to distract from government failures (see 3.31pm). Evictions from private rented accommodation and social homes are to be banned in Scotland during the coronavirus outbreak under emergency legislation (see 3.22pm). It comes after the UK government was accused of breaking a promise to renters when proposed laws only extended the notice period that landlords must give tenants before they can evict them from two months to three. The nationwide lockdown is allowing animals to roam paths which they usually shy away from. \u201cWe have annual visitor numbers in excess of 1 million and suddenly, in the peak of breeding season, they are not going to be here,\u201d said the conservation manager of the largest national nature reserve in England. \u201cNature is just going: \u2018Ahhh, it\u2019s all to ourselves now.\u2019\u201d Harries said she expected the coronavirus death toll to increase \u201cfor the next week or two\u201d. But then we anticipate that if we keep doing what we\u2019re doing \u2026 we do anticipate that those numbers will start to drop. Asked about death figures she said it \u201clags behind our impressions on the rate of increase of infections\u201d. So, we just need to watch it carefully, hold tight for a week or two, keep doing what we\u2019re doing and then come back and ask me the question again and I think hopefully we will be on the way down a little bit. Jenrick said that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had been working \u201cextremely hard\u201d with British missions worldwide to bring those stranded abroad back to the UK. He has spent this weekend speaking with his counterparts in a range of countries, where there are citizens who we want to get back safely to the UK as soon as possible. On arranging further rescue flights for those still abroad, Jenrick said: We haven\u2019t ruled out repatriation flights and we are doing those in some cases. There is a flight ongoing at the moment, for example to Peru, to bring back a group of British citizens who have been in a difficult situation there. If we need to do more steps of that kind in the days ahead, then we will of course do so. We want to get those British citizens back safely to the UK. Robert Jenrick said that he had heard the news shortly before the briefing that Dr Amged El-Hawrani had \u201cvery sadly passed away\u201d. The deaths we are reporting daily at these press conferences are very sobering. Every death is a tragedy. We don\u2019t want to see any unnecessary death. Dr Jenny Harries said as a medical professional she usually would not comment on an individual case but added she was \u201cvery saddened\u201d that a professional colleague had passed away. It clearly is a worrying event, it is worrying for the nation because it is another death in our statistics, it is another loss to a family. And it will be a loss to an NHS family as well. It is in no-one\u2019s interests that we lose our colleagues. The Muslim Council of Britain has highlighted that Amged El-Hawrani is the third doctor of the Islamic faith to have died from confirmed or suspected coronavirus. Directly appealing to frontline workers, Jenrick said the government \u201cwill not stop\u201d until healthcare staff are provided with the equipment they need. We simply cannot and should not ask people to be on the frontline without the right protective equipment. To NHS and social care workers, all those who rely on this equipment, and to their families and loved ones watching this afternoon. We understand and we will not stop until we have got you the equipment you need. I\u2019ll continue to post the full quotes from the presser as we get them. When asked whether the country would be on lockdown for the next six months, Harries said: We actually anticipate our numbers will get worse over the next week, possibly two, and then we are looking to see whether we have managed to push that curve down and we start to see a decline. This is not to say we would be in complete lockdown for six months, but as a nation we have to be really, really responsible and keep doing what we\u2019re all doing until we\u2019re sure we can gradually start lifting various interventions which are likely to be spaced \u2013 based on the science and our data \u2013 until we gradually come back to a normal way of living. She said the government would review lockdown measures in three weeks\u2019 time. The issue of the three weeks is for us to review where we are and see if we\u2019ve had an impact jointly on the slope of that curve. But I think to make it clear to the public if we are successful we will have squashed the top of that curve, which is brilliant, but we must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living that would be quite dangerous. If we stop then all of our efforts will be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak. So over time, probably over the next six months, we will have a three-week review. The press conference has now concluded. The Guardian\u2019s Kate Proctor asks whether the scale of the repatriation package for Britons stranded abroad will equal that of Germany\u2019s \u20ac50m (\u00a345m) package. Jenrick says the foreign secretary has been working \u201cextremely hard\u201d with British embassies around the world. He adds that Britons have been advised to return on commercial flights where available and that repatriation flights \u2013 such as those under way from Peru \u2013 would come if necessary. We are the world\u2019s leading country in supporting vaccine research, Jenrick adds. He recognises there will be lessons to be learned, in the UK and elsewhere, but that the current focus is on saving lives. Harries confirms that the large rises of deaths in recent days have been expected and reiterates deaths are expected to continue to rise. On whether further social distancing measures have been modelled, Jenrick says he hopes the current policies will be sufficient. The restrictive measures the UK has imposed have been largely respected, Jenrick says, after people met en masse in parks last weekend before the new orders were made. There is a moral obligation upon everyone, including young people who think they are invincible, to protect others, the minister adds. This is a moving target, Harries clarifies, saying there is a time lag between reporting of people becoming symptomatic and deteriorating. We actually anticipate our numbers will get worse over the next week, possibly two, she adds, then we will see if we have managed to push the curve down. There may be a few months on the way, she says. Jenrick extends his sympathies to the family of Amged El-Hawrani. He says Boris Johnson will write to the British people this week saying that we all have the power to influence the course of events. \u201cIf we want to protect people\u2019s lives \u2026 then we need to take heed of the medical advice,\u201d he repeats. Harries says she would not usually comment on individual cases but his death is worrying and extends her condolences to his family. \u201cIt is in no one\u2019s interest that we lose our colleagues on the frontline and we really want to support them,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a disease like this, we need to remember it\u2019s not just the NHS or a family \u2026 This will affect all of us. We should not take this as a signal to the NHS.\u201d She adds that new guidance will be issued shortly for people working in essential services. Harries confirms the government will review the lockdown measures in three weeks, but says it will take three to six months to see if the policies have \u201csquashed\u201d the virus. \u201cAs a population we have evidence we are getting better at [social distancing],\u201d she adds. \u201cWe need another couple of weeks to see that through.\u201d She says that there will be further uncertainty and does not confirm when the lockdown will end. Asked what the current forecast for the pandemic is, after Boris Johnson said the UK would turn the tide within 12 weeks a fortnight ago, Jenrick says: Nobody is pretending that this will be over in a few weeks ... But if we all play our part and follow the medical advice we can turn the tide of this virus. Harries adds that this is a \u201cmoving feast\u201d and that Johnson had noted the modelling at the time. She said she hopes the UK will indeed have turned the tide by the date he cited. Please call your elderly neighbours before you go shopping to help them get their groceries, he adds before taking questions from journalists remotely. Care packages sent out already included tea, biscuits and tinned goods, and thousands more will be delivered to those who cannot get their groceries, Jenrick says. A new phone number will be on a letter that vulnerable people will soon receive to help support them, he says, imploring the millions of most vulnerable to remain home for 12 weeks. We will not stop until we have got you the equipment you need, Jenrick proclaims. We\u2019ve established the national supply distribution response team, he says, supported by the armed forces, to work around the clock to deliver the equipment to those who need it most. This includes: 170m masks 42.8m gloves 13.7m aprons 182,000 gowns Almost 10m items of cleaning equipment 2.3m eye protectors These are being delivered to GP surgeries, dentists, pharmacies, community providers, along with hospitals and care homes. One issue, he says, is the provision of PPE. \u201cWe simply cannot and should not ask people to be on the frontline without the right protective equipment,\u201d he concedes. Strategic coordination centres will be set up across the country led by gold commanders from the emergency services to lead communities through the challenging period - from Cornwall to Cumbria \u2013 with members of the armed forces embedded within these teams to plan local response to the virus. He announces he has put in place across the country measures to put the country on emergency footing, an unprecedented step in peacetime, he says. Jenrick confirms there have been 127,737 tests, with 108,215 testing negative and 19,522 testing positive. Of those who have contracted the virus, 1,228 have died, he said. The virus is indiscriminate, Jenrick added, calling for people to stay home. The press conference has now begun. Last night 63-year-old Adil El Tayar, an organ transplant specialist, became the first working NHS surgeon to die from coronavirus. He died on Wednesday at West Middlesex university hospital in London, his family said. The doctor, who had worked around the world, spent his final days volunteering on the frontlines against the outbreak in an A&amp;E department in the Midlands. NHS England appear to have sought to draw a distinction between El Tayar, who was not a frontline healthcare worker, and El-Hawrani, in their announcement that the latter was the first frontline hospital worker to die from coronavirus. The government\u2019s daily press conference is due to begin shortly, convened by the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, alongside Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England. NHS England have said El-Hawrani is the first confirmed hospital frontline worker to die after testing positive for coronavirus. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: My deepest condolences are with Amged\u2019s family at this extremely sad time. The NHS is a family and we all feel deeply the loss of any of our colleagues, as we all continue to unite and work together to tackle the spread of coronavirus, I know that the whole of the NHS and the public we serve will want to extend our sympathies to the El-Hawrani family. Nobody can be in any doubt about the scale of the challenge we face with this virus, and Amged\u2019s death is not just an individual human tragedy but a stark reminder to the whole country that we all must take this crisis seriously, which means everyone abiding by the government\u2019s clear instructions to stay indoors, self-isolate, keep strictly to social distancing advice and practise good hygiene, which means washing hands more often and for longer. The advice issued by government and the health service can be the difference between life and death, so this is everybody\u2019s chance to be a lifesaver. A spokesman for El-Hawrani\u2019s paid tribute to him: Amged was a loving and much-loved husband, son, father, brother, and friend. His greatest passions were his family and his profession, and he dedicated his life to both. He was the rock of our family, incredibly strong, compassionate, caring and giving. He always put everyone else before himself. We all turned to him when we needed support and he was always there for us. He had so many responsibilities and yet he never complained. Amged reached the very top of his profession and we know he made a difference to thousands of lives during his career. He viewed his role as a doctor as one of life\u2019s most noble pursuits. He was also a leader, who educated many doctors who have subsequently become ENT consultants. We are incredibly proud of the legacy he has left behind and all that he has achieved. We would like to thank all those involved in his care for their kindness and compassion during his illness. They worked tirelessly for their patient, as he would have done for his own. Losing Amged is devastating for our family. Life without him is impossible to imagine but together, we will do all we can to honour his memory and live how he would have wanted us to. El-Hawrani\u2019s son Ashraf said: Most of my dad\u2019s time was dedicated towards his family, and the rest of that time was dedicated towards his profession. He taught me the significance of respect and equality. He also stressed the importance of not worrying about the things I cannot control, which he displayed to me right up until the end of his life. He did not seek the praise and approval of others, he was satisfied by viewing the positive effects of his actions and the wellbeing of his family. I am incredibly proud to say that for 18 years of my life, Amged El-Hawrani was my father. Amged El-Hawrani\u2019s colleagues have paid tribute to the ENT consultant who died at Leicester Royal Infirmary on Saturday evening after testing positive for Covid-19. Gavin Boyle, chief executive at University Hospitals of Derby and Burton (UHDB), said: Mr El-Hawrani, known to his colleagues as Amged, was an extremely hard working consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) trainer who was well liked at the Trust and particularly at Queen\u2019s Hospital Burton where he worked. Amged played a leading role in the merger between the hospitals in Burton and Derby and helped bring the two clinical teams together. He was keen to support colleagues outside of ENT and was well known across a wide number of departments. He was known for his dedication and commitment to his patients. He had also raised funds for the hospitals, including climbing in the Himalayas with a group of friends some years ago. The whole UHDB family are desperately saddened at losing Amged who was such a valued and much loved colleague. On behalf of everyone here at UHDB, including our patients and the communities we serve, I would like to offer our sincere condolences to his family. We would also like to thank our colleagues at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust for their professionalism and the compassionate care they have shown for Amged and his family. Interesting graph published earlier by the FT showing that the growth rate in new cases is beginning to slow. Consultant Amged El-Hawrani, 55, who had tested positive for coronavirus, has died at Leicester Royal Infirmary, University Hospitals of Derby and Burton has said. Low-paid women are at high risk of exposure to coronavirus as they are more likely to be in jobs such as social care, nursing and pharmacy, a study has found. Out of 3.2 million workers employed in the highest-risk roles, about 2.5 million are women, according to Autonomy, an economics thinktank. As many as a million of those workers \u2013 who are considered to be at highest risk because they normally work closely with the public and people with diseases and infections \u2013 are also among the lowest paid, according to the study. A 108-year-old woman and survivor of the 1918 Spanish flu is thought to have become the oldest victim of coronavirus in the UK. Hilda Churchill died in a Salford care home on Saturday, hours after testing positive for Covid-19 and just eight days before her 109th birthday. She is the oldest victim of the virus to be named in the UK. She was born in 1911, the year before the Titanic sank and three years before the start of the first world war. It was also seven years before the Spanish flu pandemic, which infected 500 million worldwide and killed her sister. The coronavirus pandemic had prompted Churchill to reminisce about the Spanish flu, according to her grandson, Anthony Churchill. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, he said: As I was telling her about this coronavirus she started talking about the Spanish flu and she remembered how bad that was. Moles are daring to clamber above ground to hunt for worms, oystercatchers are nesting on deserted beaches, and overlooked plants such as ivy-leaved toadflax are gaining new friends. The shutdown of modern life as we know it is liberating British wildlife to enjoy newly depopulated landscapes. But conservationists say the impact is not all positive, with wildlife crimes going unreported and vital work including monitoring unable to be carried out. Jake Fiennes, the conservation manager of the 9,600-acre Holkham national nature reserve, the biggest in England, said: We have annual visitor numbers in excess of one million and suddenly, in the peak of breeding season, they are not going to be here. Nature is just going \u2018ahhh, it\u2019s all to ourselves now. The Labour deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon has claimed criticism of China\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak by minister\u2019s represents a \u201cTrump-style\u201d ploy to distract from government failures. Questioned about the limited extent of testing in the UK earlier, the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said some of the signals coming out of China were not clear about \u201cthe scale, the nature, the infectiousness\u201d. The former Tory party leader Iain Duncan Smith meanwhile highlighted a delay to China\u2019s coronavirus reporting and accused states of \u201ckow-towing\u201d to China to secure trade deals, while the Mail on Sunday quoted a senior government source saying a \u201creckoning\u201d would follow the crisis. The paper also quoted an anonymous cabinet minister as saying: \u201cWe can\u2019t stand by and allow the Chinese state\u2019s desire for secrecy to ruin the world\u2019s economy and then come back like nothing has happened.\u201d Tweeting overnight as the Mail on Sunday published its front page, Burgon said: Sturgeon also said the Scottish parliament would meet for one day this week to consider and, she hopes, pass emergency legislation specifically for Scotland. This would include legislation to ensure no one can be evicted during the coronavirus crisis. Amongst a number of other things that legislation will ensure that no one can be evicted from their home during this crisis. It will increase to six months in most cases the minimum period of notice a landlord must give to a tenant before eviction. The legislation will apply to tenants in both the private sector and the social housing sector and will provide all tenants with additional security at what is an immensely difficult time. We expect to publish the emergency legislation and introduce it to parliament on Tuesday and parliament will then have the opportunity to consider it on Wednesday. The announcement comes after Labour and renters\u2019 campaign groups accused the UK government of breaking its promise to protect people from evictions during the coronavirus epidemic after emergency legislation tabled on Monday evening only extended the notice period that landlords must give tenants before they can evict them from two months to three. Bit of a row ensuing on Twitter between the health minister Nadine Dorries \u2013 who has been isolating due to being infected with Covid \u2013 and Sky News correspondents. TLDR: Dorries objected to Beth Rigby\u2019s suggestion that the contraction of coronavirus by Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock showed that the UK\u2019s approach to the pandemic was flawed. Sturgeon also revealed that 95 people were in intensive care on Saturday night with either confirmed or suspected Covid-19. Meanwhile, she announced that a new volunteer campaign named Scotland Cares will launch tomorrow to allow people to register to volunteer during the pandemic, following the establishment of similar NHS initiative by the UK government. Hull Trains is to temporarily suspend all its services from Monday as a result of \u201cunprecedented circumstances\u201d to safeguard the future of the business, the company has announced. Nicola Sturgeon has thanked people for staying home despite the occasional sunshine as she noted the rapid growth in the number of cases in Scotland. The first minister acknowledged that the rise in confirmed cases was putting pressure on NHS and care services. An area of concern which I know has been expressed in recent days is around the provision of personal protective equipment for those on the frontline. I can confirm today some new steps to improve even further the supply of PPE ... Over the past four to six weeks, around 34m items of PPE have been delivered to hospitals across Scotland. All health boards now have a single point of contact to manage PPE supply and distribution. This should help ensure the right people receive the correct equipment, she added. Eight weeks of PPE will be delivered to GP surgeries from tomorrow and should arrive by the end of the week, while additional staff are being employed to help deliver PPE to the care sector. However, Sturgeon did not elaborate on the amount of equipment care homes should expect to receive. Derbyshire police said they broke up a \u201cmassive party\u201d on Saturday night involving 25 adults and children. Meanwhile, police in Northern Ireland are to target tourist sites and visitor locations to ensure compliance with social-distancing rules, the chief constable has said. People who repeatedly fail to comply with officer requests to disperse could face fines up to \u00a3960 under new emergency regulations agreed by the Stormont Executive. The measures, which came into force at 11pm on Saturday, also provide for fines up to \u00a35,000 for businesses not adhering to the new rules around closures and implementation of social-distancing practices. For readers noticing the slight discrepancy between the UK death toll figures and those announced by the constituent nations\u2019 health authorities, we are looking into it and will keep you posted. On a day where the government has sought to make clear the importance of testing, Sky News\u2019 Joe Pike makes an important point. One more person has died after testing positive for coronavirus in Scotland, taking the total there to 41, the Scottish government has announced. The UK\u2019s total includes 190 deaths in England, NHS England said in a statement. The patients were aged between 39 and 105. All but for of them had underlying health problems. The four that did not have heath problems were aged between 57 and 87. The NHS figures also reveal that London hospital continue to be the worst hit. Of the 190 deaths in England, 15 were at Barts Health trust, five each were at Chelsea and Westminster and Imperial College, six were at King\u2019s College, seven at Lewisham and Greenwich, and 10 at the Royal Free. The worst hit hospitals outside London were: Portsmouth, University Hospitals Birmingham, and Mid Essex all with seven deaths; Worcestershire Acute Hosptials with six; and Epsom and St Helier with five. The UK\u2019s latest death toll includes six more fatalities in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 21 deaths. Northern Ireland\u2019s department for health, also announced that a further 86 patients have tested positive out of a total of 742. The UK death toll from coronavirus has increased by 209 people in the last 24 hours bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 1,228 so far. The figure was fewer than Saturday\u2019s record rise of 260, which may bring some hope that the rise in deaths could stabilise soon. The Department of Health and Social Care also said 19,522 have now tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK. Ten more people have died from coronavirus in Wales, taking the country\u2019s total to 48. Dr Giri Shankar, the incident director for the coronavirus outbreak response at Public Health Wales, said: 148 new cases have tested positive for novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1241, although the true number of cases is likely to be higher. 10 further deaths have been reported to us of people who had tested positive for novel coronavirus (Covid-19), taking the number of deaths in Wales to 48. We offer our condolences to families and friends affected, and we ask those reporting on the situation to respect patient confidentiality. The UK\u2019s biological security strategy, published in 2018 to address the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented, according to a former government chief scientific adviser. Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, told the Guardian that a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled. The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government. However, a 2019 parliamentary inquiry into biological security was postponed and then cancelled because MPs were focused on Brexit and then the December general election. Police in Northern Ireland are to target tourist sites and visitor locations to ensure compliance with physical distancing rules, the chief constable has said, PA reports. People who repeatedly fail to comply with officer requests to disperse could face fines up to \u00a3960 under new emergency regulations agreed by the Stormont Executive. The measures, which came into force at 11pm on Saturday, also provide for fines up to 5,000 for businesses not adhering to the new rules around closures and implementation of social-distancing practices. Northern Ireland was the last part of the UK to develop regulations flowing from new powers secured through legislation passed at Westminster earlier in the week. Fifteen people with Covid-19 have died in Northern Ireland. The new regulations include a list of which type of business premises should close during the current clampdown on public life, and which can continue operating as an essential service. Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Simon Byrne set out the police\u2019s approach to using the new enforcement powers on coronavirus restrictions. He said: \u201cOfficers will apply their discretion and will ask questions to establish individual circumstances. We will instruct people to return home if they do not have a reasonable excuse to be out of their house.\u201d Byrne said officers would be targeting popular tourism locations and visitor spots to ensure people were not gathering. (This is Matthew Weaver standing in for Mattha Busby while he takes a break). North Somerset council is making an \u201curgent plea\u201d for protective equipment as care workers across the area are forced to work without it due to supplies \u201cdrying up\u201d. The council has appealed to local schools, colleges and businesses with such items to help \u201cbridge the gap\u201d until new stocks reach the south west, expected to be on 6 April. Mike Bell, the council\u2019s deputy leader and executive member for adult social care, said: Our care homes and community care workers are desperate. We need basic items such as masks, disposable gloves, aprons and hand sanitiser. Please, if you have them stored away, and don\u2019t have an immediate care-related need, get in touch. You will help save lives. The peak of the coronavirus is dependent on people\u2019s actions and the lockdown will remain in place for a \u201csignificant period\u201d, Michael Gove said (see 10.01am). I can\u2019t make an accurate prediction, but everyone does have to prepare for a significant period when these measures are still in place. On his broadcast round, Gove appeared to lay the blame for the UK\u2019s lack of mass testing on China, raising the prospect of increased diplomatic tension between the two countries. Asked why Britain did not have sufficient testing, despite the first case in China being known about in December, Gove said some of reporting from China was not clear about the scale of the disease. The move appears to be part of a concerted attempt from No 10 to shift responsibility for the pandemic, and the UK\u2019s apparent inability to adequately respond, eastwards (see 11.16am). The Cabinet Office minister did not provide any assurance as to when all health and social care staff \u2013 who number well over a million \u2013 would be tested. He simply told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cI hope that we will be able to test as many frontline workers at the earliest possible stage.\u201d The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called for mass testing to end the coronavirus lockdown as quickly as possible. The success that countries such as South Korea and Germany have had in using mass testing to curb the spread of the virus should serve as an example, he said (see 9.10am). Rebecca Long-Bailey said it was unacceptable for self-employed workers to have to wait until June to be paid through the government\u2019s support scheme and she suggested the health of many others who are continuing to go to work was unnecessarily being put at risk. (see 9.44am) Labour MP and doctor Rosena Allin-Khan said she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the UK\u2019s coronavirus advice was not in keeping with WHO guidance and she urged Boris Johnson to self-isolate for 14 days rather than seven (see 9.21am). Care home managers are refusing to accept elderly people discharged from NHS hospitals owing to coronavirus fears, and one has said government-issued protective equipment for residents and staff is \u201ccompletely useless\u201d. A shortage of midwives on NHS maternity units has doubled since the start of the outbreak, with one in five midwifery posts now unfilled, raising concerns about the safety of pregnant women, new mothers and newborn babies. A London doctor said that there will be no new staff for the Nightingale hospital and NHS staff will be asked to spread even further, describing the situation as \u201crobbing Peter to pay Paul\u201d (see 11.02am), as the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said there was a \u201ccontinual stream\u2019 of Covid patients entering London hospitals (see 9.58am). The actor James McAvoy donated \u00a3275,000 to a crowdfunding campaign set up to by a group of doctors to raise money to buy vital protective equipment for NHS staff treating coronavirus. A man was arrested after deliberately coughing in the face of a paramedic, police have said. There have been a spate of similar incidents since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. Two-thirds of people in the UK want the government to request an extension to the Brexit transition period in order to focus on the coronavirus outbreak, polling commissioned by the cross-party campaign group Best for Britain and anti-racism group Hope Not Hate has suggested (see 11.43am). The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS combat Covid-19 has reached 750,000, two days after the target was increased after hitting the initial 250,000 goal within less than 24 hours, the Royal Voluntary Service has announced. This is today\u2019s most upvoted comment, from a reader named JohnTest who certainly does not mince his words. Hate to point out the obvious, but UK has not embarked on the testing campaign because it would rapidly become apparent that we do not have the capacity. That would then lead to awkward questions about the wisdom of running down a country\u2019s health service. Far better to divert with Dunkirk, mass volunteer campaigns and hand clapping nonsense. Meanwhile our loved ones that work in the NHS are being sent like lambs to the slaughter without protective gear. Those who have liberty but are isolating, meanwhile, are being instructed by people who are still working to cherish the moments they have with their family at this unprecedented time. In the past week four people in one wing alone at Harmondsworth immigration removal centre near Heathrow airport have been quarantined and there have been unconfirmed reports of one detainee there testing positive for Covid-19 and being released, according to the campaigning group Bail for Immigration Detainees. An online medical fetish store made news yesterday after it announced it had donated its entire stock of disposable scrubs to an NHS hospital. Later, the company said the real heroes were NHS staff and dismissed claims they had not gifted the uniforms to the health service. We may be isolating and avoiding non-essential travel and contact, but the coronavirus lockdown presents a unique opportunity to attract wildlife to your doorstep. Here\u2019s how: During the fine weather of the past week or so, my garden has been alive with the sounds of spring. From my office window I can hear the metallic wheezing of a greenfinch, the metronomic sound of a chiffchaff calling out its name, trilling wrens, repetitive song thrushes, tuneful robins, and just now, a quartet of ravens high in the sky overhead, uttering their deep, croaking call. And this is not just at dawn and dusk \u2013 the traditional peak times for birdsong \u2013 but all day long. If you have never tried to attract birds to your garden, it\u2019s easier than you think. Just as we humans need food, drink and accommodation, so do they. So your mission \u2013 should you choose to accept it \u2013 is to create the avian equivalent of a five-star hotel and restaurant. Earlier, Michael Gove said there would be an opportunity to learn the lessons from the government\u2019s widely criticised approach to the coronavirus pandemic once it is over (see 10.17am). But an inquiry already appears to be under way within the medical community. Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said coronavirus testing for NHS \u201cshould have happened sooner\u201d after healthcare workers began to be tested en masse this weekend. She told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge: Well, I believe it should have happened sooner but we are where we are and we need it now so nurses are, everyday they are carrying out services to patients, they are giving treatment to patients and they will be last than one metre away so they particularly need to know whether the person they are dealing with, whether they themselves, test positive for coronavirus so that they can take time, the appropriate time off but also protect themselves and their families. Care home managers are refusing to accept elderly people discharged from NHS hospitals owing to coronavirus fears, and one has said government-issued protective equipment for residents and staff is \u201ccompletely useless\u201d. David Steedman, the manager of Arlington House care home in Sussex, said he had five empty rooms but he was not taking in people discharged from hospital as it would be \u201cmadness\u201d to expose residents and staff to the risk of infection. Senior local government figures last night urged the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to \u201cmove faster\u201d and provide protective equipment for all social care workers to ensure their safety. Currently, available stocks are in some cases unfit for purpose, the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services said. We have been sent pictures of PPE that is used, dirty and damaged. This cannot and will not be used. Earlier, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said it was unacceptable for self-employed workers to have to wait until June to be paid through the government\u2019s support scheme (see 9.44am). And she suggested the health of many others who are continuing to go to work was unnecessarily being put at risk. Now, there are workers right across the country this week who have been going to construction sites, warehouses, call centres, where their health is being put at significant risk and the government now needs to be very clear about what non-essential and essential work is and to make sure those workers are at home if they are not providing an essential function and that they are financially protected. Certainly where we see the pictures that we\u2019ve seen this week in warehouses and building sites, where workers are on top of each other and we hear reports, every single MP across the country will have had reports about workers who are frightened because they know that their colleagues have gone home sick with suspected coronavirus. She added that an announcement on the outcome of the Labour leadership contest, in which she is a contender, would be made remotely. I think we\u2019re trying to deal with these strange times and have an announcement on the leadership contest that our members and the public can view from their homes really. It is logistically quite challenging and we\u2019ve all been asked to do this victory speech so that it can be sent out over the airways as quickly as possible after we win. I haven\u2019t done mine yet by the way! It is going to be a bit bizarre, yes. The actor James McAvoy has donated \u00a3275,000 to a crowdfunding campaign set up to by a group of doctors to raise money to buy vital protective equipment for NHS staff treating coronavirus. One of the medics behind the project, Dr Salaj Masand, said: We are overwhelmed and speechless at the trust and faith people have put into us to deliver this. The number of very generous donations from everyone doubled our target within three days. Loss of taste and smell is being added to the list symptoms for coronavirus, according to ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Only by implementing carefully controlled programmes that use two very different Covid-19 test kits will it be possible to predict how the disease will affect the country, researchers have said. To locate those in the first category \u2013 the newly infected \u2013 medical staff need to use a polymerase chain reaction test, which can find viral particles on a person. The test locates a particular coronavirus gene sequence and creates multiple copies that can then be easily detected. Andrew Preston, of Bath University, said that the PCR test was in itself very effective for detecting the virus but that that efficacy was dependent on how well healthcare workers took samples from patients, from the nose and the back of the throat. If a virus is not picked up on the swab, the result will be negative. Thus, how effectively the swab is taken, and the amount of virus present at the sampling sites, will determine whether the virus is detected from an infected person. Prof Adam Finn, of Bristol University, said: Testing people across the country to find if they have been infected by Covid-19 will tell us precisely how the disease is behaving. This will create certainty about where we stand and about the measures we need to take to limit the spread of the virus. At present we are in the dark. That should stop once we get the antibody test up and running. A man has been arrested after deliberately coughing in the face of a paramedic, police have said. The ambulance service was called just before 11pm on Saturday to a man in Stroud, Gloucestershire, who was feeling unwell. A spokeswoman for Gloucestershire police said: They attended an address where another man who was self-isolating allegedly deliberately coughed in the face of one of the paramedics. The man, a 43-year-old, was arrested, charged and remanded for assaulting an emergency worker by way of coughing and threatening GBH by infecting with Covid-19. His arrest follows a spate of similar incidents since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. Earlier this morning the fitness instructor Joe Wicks was on the BBC discussing his online physical education sessions. Here is his 10-minute home workout for seniors: LBC\u2019s political editor, Theo Usherwood, who has now recovered from coronavirus, has paid tribute to NHS staff for saving his life. The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, has responded to Michael Gove\u2019s suggestion earlier that \u201csome of the reporting from China was not clear about the nature, the scale, the infectiousness\u201d of coronavirus. He said: The evidence this was a serious virus was well documented through January into February. We need to understand precisely how ministers were responding, rather than feeble excuses that they didn\u2019t know. Going forward, every effort must be made, nationally and internationally, to ensure that we are in the best possible position to provide medical care as the number of cases grows. Polling commissioned by the cross-party campaign group Best for Britain and anti-racism group Hope Not Hate has suggested that almost two-thirds of people in the UK want the government to request an extension to the Brexit transition period in order to focus on the coronavirus outbreak. The Focaldata poll of 2,022 people showed 64% of people agreed with the statement \u201cThe government should request an extension to the transition period in order to focus properly on the coronavirus\u2019, while 36% agreed with the statement \u201cThe Brexit transition period must end on 31 December whether a deal has been fixed or not\u201d. Best for Britain\u2019s call for an extension to the transition period has been echoed by numerous bodies and pressure groups, including the Scottish and Welsh governments. The same poll also found that 65% of people wished the government to seek membership of the EU early warning and response system for medical emergencies, amid reported reluctance within No 10 to remain a member. Best for Britain\u2019s CEO, Naomi Smith, said: It\u2019s simply not reasonable to expect we will have tied up negotiations with the EU by the end of the year while dealing with a warlike emergency. Nor is it desirable. Most people just want the government to get on with the job at hand so that lives can be saved and normality restored as quickly as possible. The country is simply not in a place to weather two storms at the moment. Hope Not Hate\u2019s CEO, Nick Lowles, said: EU schemes like the early warning and response system and the ventilator procurement programme are critical tools for responding to this urgent public health crisis. The government must put politics aside and urgently seek participation in these schemes. It would be foolhardy for ideology to get in the way of practical measures to keep people safe. Ramping up testing should be a national priority, the Labour MP David Lammy has said. Meanwhile, this Sunday Telegraph report of a pandemic trial run in 2017 that was not followed up with extra funding is continuing to do the rounds on Twitter. A woman in hospital with suspected Covid-19 has said she has been moved to a ward with vulnerable patients. Delia Colwill, from Berkshire, was taken into hospital on Tuesday, six days after she first began showing symptoms of the coronavirus. The 47-year-old suffers from a spinal cord injury that affects her nervous system and has chronic pain. She said the virus had \u201cabsolutely knocked me sideways\u201d and she had been tested for coronavirus, receiving mixed results with one positive and one negative. She told the PA news agency: I\u2019m not sure what to believe. I\u2019ve suddenly been moved to a general ward with very vulnerable patients and I have no mask, nothing and I still have a virus. I\u2019m not sure what to make of the testing and the situation honestly because I\u2019ve had five doctors say it\u2019s Covid-19, one confirmed test positive and now a negative. Her symptoms have varied from \u201chorrific head pain and sinus pain that feels like my brain is exploding out of my skull\u201d to blackout headaches and intense sweats, while she has also suffered from a loss of appetite and sense of taste. She has now been in the hospital for five days and said staff looking after her were exhausted by the influx of new patients. The Mail on Sunday today reported that No 10 is furious over China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and its initial underreporting of the crisis, but as my colleague Peter Walker notes, it is worth highlighting how the government is seeking to shift blame before the pandemic peaks. A London doctor has said that there will be no new staff for the Nightingale hospital and NHS staff will be asked to spread even further, describing the situation as \u201crobbing Peter to pay Paul\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian they gave an account of what the medics are saying about the new hospital space in the Excel centre. It was all framed as if there would be a cavalry coming of newly up-skilled doctors, doctors from other regions, those out of retirement to staff it. But it is becoming more clear there is not a cavalry but just more space for us to spread into, but with the same number of staff.\u201d The more I see official policies and documents for it I know every single name on a document or email ... We have a world leading network of critical care in London and it is the same names and faces who, in addition to running their own hospitals at surge capacity, are also expecting to provide cover equipment and staff to Excel. We need to be clear that this is not something that is coming to save London hospitals. This is a sign we will have to surge past any surge done so far. The doctor said that they were trying to make more space and there was likely to be a criteria for those treated at the Nightingale. One of the issues is medical wards are now all full of covid patients who don\u2019t need intensive care so we cannot step down patients to medical wards as they are near surge capacity too. At what level do you want surge capacity for extra beds - do you want them to be intubated intensive care beds? Or people who are on a tiny bit of oxygen? Do you want it to be for patients who have appendicitis who happen to get sick during all of this? There will be criteria for getting into the Nightingale but think it will be more about whether you are safe to be at a facility that does not have the depth of specialty backup. At first the Nightingale felt like a great idea as though a bunch of people would come to run it but now we have realised it is robbing Peter to pay Paul and it felt more like a publicity stunt. As they have been filling in the Nightingale and more concrete plans are coming out ... we are seeing leadership consultants we really admire moving over there and everyone is starting to realise there is not a cavalry we are the same team and stretch to cover this but maybe that is good and mean safer care across London. Following his round of broadcast interviews, it is now clear that Michael Gove did not provide any assurance as to when all health and social care staff \u2013 who number well over a million \u2013 would be tested. If 25,000 are tested a day \u2013 which is the government\u2019s intention after it succeeded in testing 10,000 per day during a trial over the weekend \u2013 then that would take 40 days for the first million workers. The Cabinet Office minister simply told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cI hope that we will be able to test as many frontline workers at the earliest possible stage.\u201d Some hospitals are \u201cbending the rules\u201d over the provision of protective gear for healthcare workers treating coronavirus patients, the Royal College of Nursing chair has said. Many smaller producers and retailers will struggle during the lockdown, but the challenge is especially acute for those on Scotland\u2019s islands, where ferry travel is now limited to essential trips only. The new website isle20.com aims to bring customers to smaller island companies, offering everything from hampers of Scottish tablet made on Skye, Orkney rum and seaweed-based cosmetics from Colonsay. Isle 20 was set up by Rhoda Meek, who runs the Tiree Tea company. She said: Lots of wee makers rely completely on tourism. Most local post offices are running their own safety measures. We\u2019re conscious of not overloading the local post service, so we\u2019re trying to be mindful of that but we\u2019re not Amazon warehouse ... if we get one order a day we\u2019re delighted. Tiree, in the Inner Hebrides, has a few suspected cases and the community has been practising physical distancing: On the one hand, we\u2019re used to being quite isolated, and we\u2019re very used to looking out for each other, making sure people get to the shops and so on. But what is absolutely counter to the Hebridean way is not going into people\u2019s homes, or stopping for a chat. The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS combat Covid-19 has reached 750,000, two days after the target was increased after hitting the initial 250,000 goal within less than 24 hours, the Royal Voluntary Service has announced. The drive will now be temporarily paused to enable the RVS to process the applications and work together with the NHS to get the volunteers up and running. The RVS chief executive, Catherine Johnstone, said: We have been absolutely overwhelmed by the response and cannot thank the public enough. As history shows, it is often in times of crisis that we pull together and become our best selves. The chief nursing officer for England, Ruth May, said: I want to thank each and every one of the 750,000 people who have committed their precious time to help some of the most vulnerable people stay home and save lives. Coronavirus is an unprecedented global health emergency and your generosity and goodwill offers every one of us some light at the end of the tunnel. The former prime minister Tony Blair has said a point will need to be reached where a \u2018very large\u2019 proportion of the population is tested for coronavirus. He echoed the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt in calling for mass testing: The Labour former health secretary Andy Burnham has said the government is getting \u201cmost things right\u201d but has called for the lockdown to be extended. Speaking to BBC Politics England, he said: There are some places open that really shouldn\u2019t be. Because workers in those places can\u2019t observe the two metre distancing. The environment doesn\u2019t help, the handrails, the door handles, the surface tops. There are some workplaces, I think, that are still contributing to the spread of the virus and I\u2019d like to see a clearer ruling on that. I\u2019ve received 300 complaints from 150 businesses from people saying that they can\u2019t safely distance. And that is giving them a lot of concern because they are going home after working to their families. Gove has apologised to a company that said it did not receive a reply from the government after offering to procure ventilators for the NHS. An NHS supplier in Nantwich said that in the international market it had found 25,000 ventilators that it could have procured for the government. However, the supplier said that having asked the government if it wanted the ventilators, it did not get a reply. Gove told Marr: I\u2019m very sorry if that company says that it didn\u2019t get a reply, I\u2019ll investigate as soon as I\u2019ve stopped talking to you [Andrew Marr]. It is the case that for companies that have got in touch with the government those offers of help have been forwarded to the relevant people in the NHS and in other aspects of government in order to make sure we secure those supplies. If that company wants to get in touch directly with me, we\u2019ll investigate, because there have been some cases where people had hoped they might be able to help, but in fact the material that they produce has not met the NHS specifications, it\u2019s not what\u2019s required in order to save lives, but we have been following up every single lead presented to us. Gove said there was \u201ccommunication confusion\u201d after the government missed the deadline to join an EU scheme to get extra ventilators. Downing Street said this week that the UK had decided to pursue its own scheme rather than joining the EU\u2019s procurement scheme. However, a No 10 spokesman said that officials did not get emails inviting the UK to join and that it could join future schemes. Gove told Marr: There was some confusion over our involvement in that scheme, but I\u2019ve talked to senior figures in the NHS and they\u2019ve reassured me that there is nothing that we can\u2019t do as an independent nation that being part of that scheme would have allowed us to do.\u201d Asked whether an email was received by the government, he said: There was some communication confusion, I don\u2019t know all the details of that, but I do know having talked to senior figures in the NHS that there\u2019s nothing that participating in that scheme would have allowed us to do that we have not been able to do ourselves. On Sky, Gove said there was an \u201cincreased level of infection\u201d and an \u201cincreased level of mortality\u201d to come for the UK The models are projections and of course we adjust our action on the basis of behaviour, on the basis of data, on the basis of facts, on the basis of science but people should, as the prime minister\u2019s letter today absolutely underlines and recognises, that the situation will get worse before it gets better and that is why it is so important that all of us play our part. It is also why it is so inspiring that those leading the NHS have been able to increase capacity, increase the number of beds available and ensure that we can be in the best position to deal with the increased level of infection and, indeed, the increased level of mortality that is coming. He said the NHS now had just over 8,000 ventilators, with another 8000 to come including from abroad, and potentially 10,000 more from a deal with Dyson Well, we have available to the NHS now just over 8000 ventilators. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve repurposed some of the intensive care capacity that we have in the NHS, it\u2019s also the case that Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the NHS, has done a deal with the private sector in order to increase ventilator capacity available to the NHS, and we are going to get another 8000 or so ventilators, including some of which have been sourced from abroad, which have come in here from other countries, and of course we are increasing our capacity to manufacture ventilators in the UK. As you\u2019ll be aware, we have done a deal with Dyson, which means provided all the appropriate tests are passed, we can have an additional 10,000 ventilators from that source and there are other companies, from Maclaren to Rolls Royce and others, who are changing the way in which they manufacture, in order to join in the national effort to increase the ventilator capacity available. Gove said the UK had been ordering coronavirus tests for the last month and suggested criticism of the government\u2019s approach should be made once the coronavirus pandemic was over. Asked why the UK had not mass-tested like Germany and was not \u201chunting\u201d down Covid-19 patients like the World Health Organization has urged, he said: Its certainly the case the Germans have had success in testing. There are other countries that are also ramping up testing. But the acceleration here in the UK is significant. If one looks at a league table ... then the UK is rising up that. But frankly, the most important thing is not to look backwards but forwards and do everything to increase the number of tests. Once this epidemic is over there will be an opportunity to look back and learn the lessons. Some more lines from Gove\u2019s interview, in which he said that a \u201cwalk of up to an hour\u201d would be appropriate for most people as their daily exercise during the lockdown, depending on their level of fitness. Michael Gove has said the peak of the coronavirus is dependent on people\u2019s actions and that the lockdown will remain in place for a significant period. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr programme, the Cabinet Office minister said: It\u2019s difficult to know precisely [when the UK hit the peak of the coronavirus outbreak]. It depends on the action all of us take. if we practice the social distancing measures. If we follow the rules the government has outlined, if we follow that good scientific advice, then we can delay the infection rate and that gives our NHS the chance to become more resilient. So, the date of the peak depends on all of our behaviour. It\u2019s not a fixed point, a date in the calendar like Easter, it is something that all of us can affect by our actions. He added that the public must prepare for a \u201csignificant period\u201d of lockdown. Everyone is making a sacrifice and I appreciate the scale of that sacrifice. But the reason all of us are making these sacrifices is because all of us will have people whom we love who are at risk from this virus. I can\u2019t make an accurate prediction, but everyone does have to prepare for a significant period when these measures are still in place. Dr Katherine Henderson, a consultant at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospitals and president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, has blamed supply chain issues for the lack of PPE and said none of her staff had yet been tested for coronavirus. We are seeing a continual stream of patients into London hospital who have got coronavirus. London is very busy, its got a lot of critical care capacity ... but obviously some places see a surge and we have to make arrangements. Asked if testing was starting to happen, she said six members staff who were off sick with symptoms and that 10 had been self-isolating. There\u2019s no question we are really keen to get staff testing up and running so that we can get these very key people back to work. We haven\u2019t started testing staff particularly but we are confident there will be a roll-out of that but the sooner that happens the better from our point of view. We have staff who are staying in local hotels who have identified that somebody is beginning to feel unwell at home and then they move out really rapidly. That\u2019s been helpful and that has worked but to get people tested to ensure that the index case is negative would be incredibly helpful. She added that hospitals were adapting their rotas to cope with high numbers of staff being off sick. People are talking about 20% and all of us have been doing staff plans working on the basis that 10%, 20%, 30% of staff could be off at any one time, and adapting rotas to make it possible to staff units.\u201d On the availability of personal protective equipment in hospitals, Henderson pointed to issues within the supply chain: The best thing that is going to happen is there\u2019s going to be some new guidance coming out in the next couple of days, which I think will relieve a lot of people\u2019s anxieties. We need to make sure frontline healthcare workers, social care, GPs, all have the appropriate kit they need to see patients. The Labour leadership contender Rebecca Long-Bailey has said the government must be \u201cvery clear\u201d about what is classed as essential work. There are workers right across the country this week who have been going to construction sites, warehouses, call-centres, where their health is being put at significant risk. The government needs to now be very clear about what non-essential and essential work is, and make sure those workers are at home if they\u2019re not providing an essential function and are financially protected. The Labour MP told Sky News that every politician across the country will have had reports about workers who are concerned that their fellow employees have suspected Covid-19 \u2013 from construction sites to call centres \u2013 and she called for non-essential workers to be furloughed. We know that people\u2019s lives are being put at significant risk and that places further pressure on the NHS further down the line. There\u2019s no excuse for those employers not to furlough those staff because the government scheme is being made available to provide 80% of their wages. She added that self-employed workers having to wait until June to be paid was not acceptable. Many self-employed people have to wait until June to receive a payout from this. That is not acceptable, when we see other countries, such as New Zealand, who will have similar schemes far quicker. We need the government to really, really make sure that resources are deployed into HMRC, so that those self-employed people who are eligible can access that cash as quickly as possible and aren\u2019t forced to go to work. A shortage of midwives on NHS maternity units has doubled since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, with one in five midwifery posts now unfilled, raising concerns about the safety of pregnant women, new mothers and newborn babies. The Royal College of Midwives is urging NHS leaders to ringfence maternity services as midwives are redeployed to care for people with Covid-19, fall sick themselves or are forced to self-isolate because of illness within their household. The former prime minister Tony Blair has echoed Jeremy Hunt in calling for mass testing, saying that a point will need to be reached where a \u201cvery large\u201d proportion of the entire population is tested for coronavirus. Your risk, obviously, is as you start to ease the lockdown, how do you then deal with any resurgence of the disease? This, of course, is what they\u2019re now dealing with in China and South Korea, and elsewhere. Unless you have that testing capability that you can apply at scale, and by the way when I say mass testing I mean I actually think you will need to get to the point where you\u2019ve got the capability, and I assume we\u2019re preparing for this now, of testing literally a very large proportion of the entire population. You may have to do those tests two or three different times because you need all the time to be able to track what\u2019s happening with the disease, to learn where, for example, there may be a surge or a hotspot of it, and take immediate action. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP, has called for NHS staff and social care workers to be given immediate access to testing. She told Sky News: These are the people who are at the front line, these are people who need to know whether or not they have the virus or not. So, if they feel better, if they\u2019re feeling poorly, they can return to work and keep working. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s entirely fair that senior politicians are having access to testing when frontline NHS staff, who are going in to work night shifts, day shifts, double shifts at the moment, can\u2019t get the tests that they need. And she warned that no single group of people are immune from coronavirus. We were hearing so often that it only really affects people over 70, it only really affects people that have underlying health conditions, and that\u2019s why I asked the prime minister in [PMQs] - why are the social distancing measures merely just suggestions? Because what we were seeing echoed on the NHS frontline was the fact that people were coming in who were young, fit and healthy. Of course, the majority of the patients will be older, those that actually require ventilation, but no single group of people are immune. On the UK\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 described by some observers as idiosyncratic \u2013 Allin-Khan said she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the country\u2019s coronavirus advice was not in keeping with that of the WHO. They are saying that you can still be able to spread the virus long after your symptoms have resolved and they are actually saying that it is recommended that you stay self-isolated for 14 days. So, for senior politicians such as the prime minister and the health secretary to suggest that they will return to work after seven days is a real worry for people working in the health sector like myself, because we need to save lives and we need people to properly observe self-isolation processes. I would like Boris Johnson, the prime minister, to self-isolate for 14 days. Good morning, Welcome to our UK-focused coronavirus news live blog. We\u2019ll bring you developments as they happen after the UK recorded the highest single-day increase in deaths yesterday since the Covid outbreak began. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has called for mass testing to end the coronavirus lockdown as quickly as possible. The success that countries such as South Korea and Germany have had in using mass testing to curb the spread of the virus should serve as an example, he said. Just weeks after it was the second hardest-hit country in Asia, South Korea has dramatically slowed its infection rate, recording 105 new cases on Sunday. Meanwhile, Germany has carried out four times as many tests as the UK and recorded 342 deaths. Hunt said mass testing gave authorities greater clarity in identifying and containing potential outbreaks. Where you find it, you can isolate and contain it. And where you don\u2019t, vital services continue to function. With mass testing, accompanied by rigorous tracing of every person a Covid-19 patient has been in touch with, you can break the chain of transmission. So far, only those who fit a rigid criteria can be tested for coronavirus, besides the most unwell patients. Testing for NHS and social care workers is now being rolled out after widespread criticism that healthcare workers were being forced to self-isolate at home due to mild symptoms such as a cough in case they have the virus. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told Sky News this morning that 10,000 healthcare workers were now being tested each day. We\u2019re going to move to get that up to 25,000 a day and we\u2019re doing all that we can to increase and to accelerate that, and I hope that we will be able to test as many frontline workers at the earliest possible stage. We\u2019ve been working, as I say, with scientists, with the big players in providing medical supplies and drugs, like Boots, and others, in order to increase the number of tests that we have.

But at thedocumentary\u2019s heart, is the story of the Brazilian Lais Araujo, now 24, who was spotted in a favela eight years ago by Wilson Egidio, Nascimento-DeLuca\u2019s brother-in-law and coach of Manhattan Soccer Club, a youth side based in New York.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this girl who I just saw, Kely, we have to try and get her here,\u201d said Egidio in a text to Nascimento-DeLuca on his return to the city. \u201cThere\u2019s no future for her there, she was playing with all the boys, she\u2019s super skinny, she\u2019s 16, she was playing with no shoes on and she\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be90d14301e7f4e0caf4150c67cbddb7c7732e49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be90d14301e7f4e0caf4150c67cbddb7c7732e49/0_277_3413_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lais Araujo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lais Araujo, right, the star of Warriors of a Beautiful Game, in action for Adelaide United last season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Brake/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nascimento-DeLuca wanted to help but was also hesitant given she worked as a creative director and, her father aside, had no connection with football. But then while working on a series of T-shirts for a fledgling brand, which included tops with images of Pel\u00e9 on them, she had an idea. \u201cListen, I want to shoot this on a girl player,\u201d she pitched to the CEO of the company. \u201cI think we need to change the narrative a little and I know the girl.\u201d</p> <p>It marked the beginnings of a relationship in which Nascimento-DeLuca would grow as much as Araujo. \u201cI have four kids and a job and so our conversations were very much on the side,\u201d says Nascimento\u2011DeLuca of the early period of their contact after the t-shirt shoot. \u201cShe would send me a WhatsApp message excited because she had heard that in a month a scout from the national team would be coming to her town and she was going to work extra hard. In the two years we chatted it happened several times and they never came, ever. Those things started to lodge themselves in the back of my head.\u201d</p> <p>Then, however, Araujo\u2019s life began to change. She got to the US, invested in a good camera phone and with the help of friends made a showreel. It worked \u2013 she was soon in the orbit of the University of Florida, having impressed at junior college level, and after impressing for them she caught the eye of those in charge of selecting players for Brazil\u2019s under-20s team. By 2016, she was her country\u2019s No 10 at the U20s World Cup in Papua New Guinea, playing alongside four players who are now senior Brazil internationals.</p> <p>As Nascimento-DeLuca followed Araujo\u2019s journey, her eyes were opened to the struggles of women footballers. \u201cI thought that this was a) an amazing story and b) truly fucked up. That this girl comes from a country that literally breeds talent and had to go through this journey to get to our U20 national team.\u201d</p> <p>That led to Nascimento-DeLuca researching women\u2019s football. \u201cI was really shocked by so many things. I knew nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t necessarily shocked at the systemic sexism, because I\u2019m South American, and a woman, and alive. But I was shocked at some of the statements that were being made in 2015 by those in charge of promoting the team and sport in Brazil.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c9e27117019bddc4c40febd9280b54e448724d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c9e27117019bddc4c40febd9280b54e448724d1/0_1057_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marta being interviewed for the documentary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Kely Nascimento-DeLuca</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For someone who has grown up with a global superstar as a father, Nascimento-DeLuca\u2019s social consciousness is striking. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very profoundly unique experience being the daughter of Pel\u00e9 in a country that is as systemically racist as Brazil. I was always very aware that everywhere we went nobody looked like me, and definitely not my father.</p> <p>\u201cIt was interesting because my father is the type of person who treats everyone that works for him like family. I don\u2019t mean altruistically, I mean that he doesn\u2019t know how to have staff. That sounds horrible, I don\u2019t mean to sound uppity, he just doesn\u2019t make that distinction. If you\u2019re standing there and I\u2019m eating? Sit down. It\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t know how to be wealthy.</p> <p>\u201cYou become very aware that if it wasn\u2019t for one magical bit of genius, your life could be completely different because of the way you look. That\u2019s huge. There were many painful things about moving to the US at that time. There was no FaceTime. It was like moving to Mars. But they put us in the United Nations school, so we weren\u2019t aliens. And they moved us to a city where no one gave a fuck. Like truly. He was the least famous person here by a mile.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eab54a0bd1d0eb0ee493f48e9264a4164bb7cc0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eab54a0bd1d0eb0ee493f48e9264a4164bb7cc0c/115_544_4854_2913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kely (left) in 1985 with Pel\u00e9 and Regina Dante at a film premiere in New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kely (left) in 1985 with Pel\u00e9 and Regina Dante at a film premiere in New York. \u2018He was the least famous person here by a mile,\u2019 says Kely</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ann Clifford/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That has meant Nascimento-DeLuca never attempting to capitalise on her connection, partly because in the arts it wouldn\u2019t have helped much anyway. But it certainly helped as she sought to make her documentary. It took a year to raise the money required for Warriors of a Beautiful Game to become a reality, with the first investor being St\u00e9phane Mbia, the former Cameroon international who Nascimento-DeLuca met at a Paris Saint-Germain game.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is any time when using his name is justified and should be encouraged I think it is to do something like this. For many reasons,\u201d she says. \u201cHis [Pel\u00e9\u2019s] career \u2013 I mean, he was a genius \u2013 and his longevity is a great juxtaposition to any woman\u2019s, like Marta\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see that it\u2019s all the same emotions, it\u2019s all the same strings it pulls on. And yet one has been allowed to thrive and been allowed to reach incredible parts of society and culture and the other one hasn\u2019t to nearly the same extent.\u201d</p> <p>For Araujo, it has not been easy. She graduated in 2018 and went to Norway, then to Adelaide. Now she is back in Brazil having fallen off the radar after she prioritised her diploma over the NWSL draft and staying in the pool for the under-20s team. For Nascimento-DeLuca, the hope is that she has done her story justice.</p> <p>\u201cI feel a lot of pressure to make the women in the film proud and to tell the story that they want told. I want it to be a love letter to the sport that makes other people fall in love with it.\u201d</p> <p>And perhaps a rather obvious question \u2013 has Pel\u00e9 seen the documentary? \u201cHe\u2019s seen the teaser. He said it\u2019s good,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cBut he\u2019s always like: \u2018I\u2019ll reserve my judgment, let\u2019s see the whole thing first\u2019.\u201d</p>",

By 2016, she was her country\u2019s No 10 at the U20s World Cup in Papua New Guinea, playing alongside four players who are now senior Brazil internationals. As Nascimento-DeLuca followed Araujo\u2019s journey, her eyes were opened to the struggles of women footballers. \u201cI thought that this was a) an amazing story and b) truly fucked up. That this girl comes from a country that literally breeds talent and had to go through this journey to get to our U20 national team.\u201d That led to Nascimento-DeLuca researching women\u2019s football. \u201cI was really shocked by so many things. I knew nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t necessarily shocked at the systemic sexism, because I\u2019m South American, and a woman, and alive. But I was shocked at some of the statements that were being made in 2015 by those in charge of promoting the team and sport in Brazil.\u201d For someone who has grown up with a global superstar as a father, Nascimento-DeLuca\u2019s social consciousness is striking. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very profoundly unique experience being the daughter of Pel\u00e9 in a country that is as systemically racist as Brazil. I was always very aware that everywhere we went nobody looked like me, and definitely not my father. \u201cIt was interesting because my father is the type of person who treats everyone that works for him like family. I don\u2019t mean altruistically, I mean that he doesn\u2019t know how to have staff. That sounds horrible, I don\u2019t mean to sound uppity, he just doesn\u2019t make that distinction. If you\u2019re standing there and I\u2019m eating? Sit down. It\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t know how to be wealthy. \u201cYou become very aware that if it wasn\u2019t for one magical bit of genius, your life could be completely different because of the way you look. That\u2019s huge. There were many painful things about moving to the US at that time. There was no FaceTime. It was like moving to Mars. But they put us in the United Nations school, so we weren\u2019t aliens. And they moved us to a city where no one gave a fuck. Like truly. He was the least famous person here by a mile.\u201d That has meant Nascimento-DeLuca never attempting to capitalise on her connection, partly because in the arts it wouldn\u2019t have helped much anyway. But it certainly helped as she sought to make her documentary. It took a year to raise the money required for Warriors of a Beautiful Game to become a reality, with the first investor being St\u00e9phane Mbia, the former Cameroon international who Nascimento-DeLuca met at a Paris Saint-Germain game. \u201cIf there is any time when using his name is justified and should be encouraged I think it is to do something like this. For many reasons,\u201d she says. \u201cHis [Pel\u00e9\u2019s] career \u2013 I mean, he was a genius \u2013 and his longevity is a great juxtaposition to any woman\u2019s, like Marta\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see that it\u2019s all the same emotions, it\u2019s all the same strings it pulls on. And yet one has been allowed to thrive and been allowed to reach incredible parts of society and culture and the other one hasn\u2019t to nearly the same extent.\u201d For Araujo, it has not been easy. She graduated in 2018 and went to Norway, then to Adelaide. Now she is back in Brazil having fallen off the radar after she prioritised her diploma over the NWSL draft and staying in the pool for the under-20s team. For Nascimento-DeLuca, the hope is that she has done her story justice. \u201cI feel a lot of pressure to make the women in the film proud and to tell the story that they want told. I want it to be a love letter to the sport that makes other people fall in love with it.\u201d And perhaps a rather obvious question \u2013 has Pel\u00e9 seen the documentary? \u201cHe\u2019s seen the teaser. He said it\u2019s good,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cBut he\u2019s always like: \u2018I\u2019ll reserve my judgment, let\u2019s see the whole thing first\u2019.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When I unearthed a score of Krzysztof <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE3B0XwF3tg\">Penderecki\u2019s Symphony No 1</a> in my local library during my early teens, my idea of what music could be changed forever. I knew how conventional music sat on the page, but the score of Penderecki\u2019s symphony looked like a byzantine scientific diagram had somehow got mangled in the photocopier with an Ordnance Survey map: disembodied staves, notes scattering everywhere, thick black lines sliding off the page. Once I managed to find a recording, it sounded great too \u2013 an utterly addictive playground of restless, relentlessly surprising noise.</p> <p>Penderecki, whose death at the age of 86 was announced today, was born in D\u0119bica, in south-east Poland in 1933. He emerged as a force in Polish modern composition alongside such figures as Witold Lutos\u0142awski, Tadeusz Baird, Andrzej Dobrowolski and Henryk Miko\u0142aj <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2010/nov/12/gorecki-symphony-sorrowful-songs\">G\u00f3recki</a> who, during the late 1950s, were all constructing pieces using clusters of notes jam-packed together, often requiring players to explore terrain that pushed beyond the conventions of their instrument.</p> <p>In 1960, the young composer wrote a piece for 52 string instruments that he called 8\u201937\u201d (a nod towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/aug/13/john-cage-contemporary-music-guide\">John Cage\u2019s 4\u201933\u201d</a>) in which sounds collided like swarms of bees; instruments were slapped and hit, and bows were employed to make violins et al squeak and squeal rather than sing. The piece made an immediate impression and when Penderecki, struck by the emotional turmoil of the apocalyptic sounds he had unleashed, retitled it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp3BlFZWJNA\">Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima</a>, he found himself with an unexpected hit.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKLADdOy9S8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GKLADdOy9S8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKLADdOy9S8\">Penderecki\u2019s Second Symphony</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>His First Symphony, which was completed in 1973, drew this period of sonic exploration to a close. By the time Penderecki started his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKLADdOy9S8\">Second Symphony</a> in 1979, subtitled \u201cChristmas\u201d, he had re-engaged with a Romanticism that recalled Wagner, Bruckner, Mahler and Schumann, and obviously relished doing so; the symphony took its title from references to Silent Night that he had woven through the texture. Traditionally perspectives on Penderecki divide sharply at this point: admirers of the<em> </em>Threnody and First Symphony pour scorn on the Christmas Symphony and everything that followed in its wake, while those who like the Romantic version of Penderecki thank their lucky stars that he had moved on from the avant garde.</p> <p>In reality, though, neither point of view really gets<strong> </strong>Penderecki right. Threnody \u2013 and similar works such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M0JdkKH9pg\">Fluorescences</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq-3hfFnrfI\">De natura sonoris I</a> \u2013 were undoubtedly impressive, but<strong> </strong>perhaps lacked the careful ear of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/aug/27/gyorgy-ligeti-contemporary-music-guide\">Ligeti</a>\u2019s works using the orchestra as a sound mass, written during the same period<strong>.</strong> And if the project of latter-day Penderecki was about creating a sequence of symphonies, concertos and sacred works that could tap into that apparently unquenchable enthusiasm that audiences have for big Romantic statements like those made by the likes of Mahler and Shostakovich, those mass audiences never quite came.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G41KmDsN5s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0G41KmDsN5s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G41KmDsN5s\">Penderecki\u2019s St Luke Passion</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Christmas Symphony had its longueurs, but Penderecki was a very devotional man, and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G41KmDsN5s\">St Luke Passion</a> he completed in 1966 suggested that his focus could be sharpened by the constraints of text \u2013 as the devotional works that followed, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46vR2yOM5Vo\">Canticum Canticorum Salomonis</a>, Polish Requiem and De Profundis, proved. Penderecki\u2019s later instrumental music could feel oddly misjudged: a 2001 Piano Concerto, written in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, was liberally sprinkled with jaunty bass lines and comedy \u201cwrong\u201d notes.</p> <p>And yet Penderecki remained culturally important, a composer often considered a gateway into modern composition by those outside new music - his visceral, other-worldly sounds were eagerly repurposed by film-makers, and proved malleable and adaptable enough for musicians of other disciplines to work up into something new. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHIjVdHBEi8\">His music was used in The Exorcist</a>; by David Lynch in Wild at Heart, Inland Empire and in his recent reboot of Twin Peaks; and Penderecki was reportedly very displeased with how Stanley Kubrick had chopped up and looped sections of De natura sonoris II during the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8w7XlbAvXM\">climactic scene of The Shining</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8w7XlbAvXM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S8w7XlbAvXM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In 1991, the Manic Street Preachers opened their song You Love Us with a lengthy sample from Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuBe3IouaFo\">Aphex Twin</a> produced remixes of the Threnody and Polymorphia in 2011, working with the composer himself. Penderecki also formed an unlikely partnership with Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood, which resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/18/penderecki-greenwood-threnody-popcorn-review\">a collaborative album</a> in 2012 and a whole new audience for a composer then about to turn 80.

      "bodyText": "When I unearthed a score of Krzysztof Penderecki\u2019s Symphony No 1 in my local library during my early teens, my idea of what music could be changed forever. I knew how conventional music sat on the page, but the score of Penderecki\u2019s symphony looked like a byzantine scientific diagram had somehow got mangled in the photocopier with an Ordnance Survey map: disembodied staves, notes scattering everywhere, thick black lines sliding off the page. Once I managed to find a recording, it sounded great too \u2013 an utterly addictive playground of restless, relentlessly surprising noise. Penderecki, whose death at the age of 86 was announced today, was born in D\u0119bica, in south-east Poland in 1933. He emerged as a force in Polish modern composition alongside such figures as Witold Lutos\u0142awski, Tadeusz Baird, Andrzej Dobrowolski and Henryk Miko\u0142aj G\u00f3recki who, during the late 1950s, were all constructing pieces using clusters of notes jam-packed together, often requiring players to explore terrain that pushed beyond the conventions of their instrument. In 1960, the young composer wrote a piece for 52 string instruments that he called 8\u201937\u201d (a nod towards John Cage\u2019s 4\u201933\u201d) in which sounds collided like swarms of bees; instruments were slapped and hit, and bows were employed to make violins et al squeak and squeal rather than sing. The piece made an immediate impression and when Penderecki, struck by the emotional turmoil of the apocalyptic sounds he had unleashed, retitled it Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima, he found himself with an unexpected hit. His First Symphony, which was completed in 1973, drew this period of sonic exploration to a close. By the time Penderecki started his Second Symphony in 1979, subtitled \u201cChristmas\u201d, he had re-engaged with a Romanticism that recalled Wagner, Bruckner, Mahler and Schumann, and obviously relished doing so; the symphony took its title from references to Silent Night that he had woven through the texture. Traditionally perspectives on Penderecki divide sharply at this point: admirers of the Threnody and First Symphony pour scorn on the Christmas Symphony and everything that followed in its wake, while those who like the Romantic version of Penderecki thank their lucky stars that he had moved on from the avant garde. In reality, though, neither point of view really gets Penderecki right. Threnody \u2013 and similar works such as Fluorescences and De natura sonoris I \u2013 were undoubtedly impressive, but perhaps lacked the careful ear of Ligeti\u2019s works using the orchestra as a sound mass, written during the same period. And if the project of latter-day Penderecki was about creating a sequence of symphonies, concertos and sacred works that could tap into that apparently unquenchable enthusiasm that audiences have for big Romantic statements like those made by the likes of Mahler and Shostakovich, those mass audiences never quite came. The Christmas Symphony had its longueurs, but Penderecki was a very devotional man, and the St Luke Passion he completed in 1966 suggested that his focus could be sharpened by the constraints of text \u2013 as the devotional works that followed, Canticum Canticorum Salomonis, Polish Requiem and De Profundis, proved. Penderecki\u2019s later instrumental music could feel oddly misjudged: a 2001 Piano Concerto, written in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, was liberally sprinkled with jaunty bass lines and comedy \u201cwrong\u201d notes. And yet Penderecki remained culturally important, a composer often considered a gateway into modern composition by those outside new music - his visceral, other-worldly sounds were eagerly repurposed by film-makers, and proved malleable and adaptable enough for musicians of other disciplines to work up into something new. His music was used in The Exorcist; by David Lynch in Wild at Heart, Inland Empire and in his recent reboot of Twin Peaks; and Penderecki was reportedly very displeased with how Stanley Kubrick had chopped up and looped sections of De natura sonoris II during the climactic scene of The Shining. In 1991, the Manic Street Preachers opened their song You Love Us with a lengthy sample from Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima, while Aphex Twin produced remixes of the Threnody and Polymorphia in 2011, working with the composer himself. Penderecki also formed an unlikely partnership with Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood, which resulted in a collaborative album in 2012 and a whole new audience for a composer then about to turn 80. That year, Greenwood told the Guardian that he was attracted to Penderecki\u2019s music because it spoke this universal truth: \u201cPenderecki\u2019s early music, and the whole thing of writing for orchestras, still feels very modern. If I think about music in the future, I imagine it often as not involving electricity, in some dystopian, postapocalyptic future. And that\u2019s what I get from Penderecki: people making music by taking these instruments out of boxes and playing them. That\u2019s a very bizarre and modern thing.\u201d",

That testing rate is short of the 10,000 tests the government has promised and well short of the 25,000 tests a day that Boris Johnson promised. The former prime minister Tony Blair joined the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, in calling for ramping up testing for the virus. Speaking on Sky News, Blair said: \u201cIt is all about getting to mass testing as fast as possible, because we have to know who has the disease and who has had the disease in order to get the lockdown eased and get people back to work.\u201d In an article for the Sunday Telegraph, Hunt said: \u201cWith mass testing, accompanied by rigorous tracing of every person a Covid-19 patient has been in touch with, you can break the chain of transmission. Meanwhile, epidemiologists warned that the death toll was likely to continue to rise more steeply for days and weeks to come. Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u201cIt would be most unwise to infer any trend from a single day\u2019s data. Only when the epidemic has peaked \u2013 which is some time away \u2013 and we get sustained daily reductions in new cases and then sustained daily reductions in deaths will we know that we are beginning to get on top of the epidemic.\u201d Duncan Young, professor of intensive care medicine at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cSadly, this is likely caused by delays in reporting over the weekend rather than a change in the rate of spread of the virus.\u201d Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, chair of Cambridge University\u2019s Winton centre for risk and evidence communication, said: \u201cIt may seem callous to say that 209 deaths is reassuring, but it breaks the run of 30% daily increases we have seen recently.\u201d But he added: \u201cIt is still too early to claim that the curve is beginning to flatten off. It is also important not to overinterpret counts for single days; delays in reporting can lead to the numbers varying far more than one would expect by chance alone.\u201d He pointed out that one of the deaths reported on Sunday occurred 13 days ago. London hospitals continue to be the worst hit by the pandemic. Of the 190 deaths recorded in England in the last 24 hours, 15 were at Barts Health trust, 10 at the Royal Free, and seven at Lewisham and Greenwich. But the figures also confirm that hospitals in the Midlands are facing growing pressure. There were seven deaths at University Hospitals Birmingham and six at Worcestershire Acute Hospitals. The latest figures also included six more deaths in Northern Ireland, taking its total to 21, one more in Scotland, where the total is 41, and 10 more in Wales, bringing its total to 48. Public Health Wales revealed that 514, or more than 41% of Wales\u2019s 1,241 confirmed coronavirus cases, were in Aneurin Bevan University Health Board. The area includes Newport\u2019s Royal Gwent Hospital, which has been badly hit by the virus. Last weekend it was announced that five patients had died there, including Marita Edwards, the first victim of hospital-acquired coronavirus in the UK. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 April 2020. Queen\u2019s Hospital Burton is in Staffordshire, not Derbyshire as an earlier version stated. This has been corrected.",

It\u2019s also about meditating on what we are grateful for \u2013 family, friends, a room with a view \u2013 even in quarantine we need to find meaning in our lives, to know we are seen, that our pain is validated by others and to know we are loved. At these times of lament, charities have always filled an important role \u2013 to organise the collective support for the one in need, anchored in a common benevolent love of humanity. But even here the virus challenges us. Many of our charities are facing their own crises, first in the largely older volunteer force who do the work and, inevitably, facing a reduction in the amount of money people can afford to donate to support their work. Some of these institutions may not survive, others will need to fundamentally rethink their delivery models, but what will remain constant is the need for the act of charity, that benevolent love of humanity, to sustain us. That\u2019s why the nation\u2019s major charities are coming together to create a \u201cCharities Cabinet\u201d to advise the government on ways we can deliver all our citizens the basics of a roof, a meal, a sense of human connection and a reminder that in the midst of global mayhem every individual matters. Charities exist to prioritise the needs of the vulnerable; whether they have insecure housing, or no housing. All indeed matter. Charity is the old English word for inclusive love. This is a moment in our shared humanity when we don\u2019t know what happens next, but I suspect that we will need more than just an economic stimulus; we will need a stimulus in civility, in community and in charity that can only be generated from within, as we lament and then renew ourselves together. In the words of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the 19th century maverick Australian poet and politician: \u201cLife is mostly froth and bubble, Two things stand like stone. Kindness in another\u2019s trouble, Courage in your own.\u201d These will be the saddest of times, but when it passes we will have the chance to rebuild our world on the charity in all of us. \u2022 Join Tim Costello as he gives the inaugural Australia at Home lunchtime briefing at 1pm Monday",

      "bodyText": "Record heat and drought across Australia delivered the worst environmental conditions across the country since at least 2000, with river flows, tree cover and wildlife being hit on an \u201cunprecedented scale\u201d, according to a new report. The index of environmental conditions in Australia scored 2019 at 0.8 out of 10 \u2013 the worst result across all the years analysed from 2000. The year delivered unprecedented bushfires, record heat, very low soil moisture, low vegetation growth and 40 additions to the threatened species list. The report\u2019s lead author, Prof Albert van Dijk of the Australian National University\u2019s Fenner school of environment and society, told Guardian Australia 2019 was \u201cprobably the worst in a century or more\u201d for the environment. \u201cThis is not the new normal \u2013 this is just getting worse and worse,\u201d he said, adding that 2019 had seen a \u201ccontinuing descent into an ever more dismal future. You start to see ecosystems fall apart and then struggle to recover before the next major disturbance.\u201d The Australia\u2019s Environment report scored environmental conditions across seven indicators \u2013 inundation, streamflow, vegetation growth, leaf area, soil protection, tree cover and the number of hot days. Across all years analysed, 2005 was the next worst year, impacted by the millennium drought. The year 2010 was the best; it was also one of Australia\u2019s wettest on record. Van Dijk said the cause of the impacts for 2019 were global heating as well as natural variability in Australia\u2019s climate. The number of days above 35C was 36% higher than the previous 19 years. The population had continued to grow and the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions had remained high, the report said. Greenhouse gas emissions per person were 11% below the 2000-18 average, but remained among the highest in the world because of high energy use per person and the burning of coal for electricity. Findings were underpinned by about 1m gigabytes of data, including satellite data that only became available from 2000, as well as field data and on-the-ground surveys. Reviewing biodiversity impacts, the report highlighted the number of spectacled flying foxes \u2013 one of many species vulnerable to heat stress \u2013 had dropped to 47,000 from an average of 100,000 before 2016. The numbers of threatened species had risen by 36% since 2000, the report said. River flows were 43% below the 2000-18 average, causing water storages to drop and mass fish deaths in the Murray-Darling Basin, and wetland environments had also seen record-low inundation. River flows were above average around the coast of northern Queensland, around Karratha in Western Australia and at Strahan in Tasmania\u2019s west. The protection of soils by vegetation and moisture was \u201cextremely poor\u201d, causing dust storms. The average soil moisture was also lowest since at least 2000 and farming productivity had been hit. The Great Barrier Reef, which has just experienced its third mass bleaching event in five years, had escaped bleaching in 2019 but its condition remained poor. World heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests, the Blue Mountains, alpine regions, eastern Gippsland and Kangaroo Island had all been badly hit by bushfires. A co-author of the report, Dr Marta Yebra, said: \u201cOur data clearly shows that the combination of dry forests and hot weather made for an especially explosive mixture.\u201d All the findings and data from the report, now in its fifth year, can be viewed on a website and interactive map.",

The firm said it wanted all its staff to be tested regularly to ensure customers who cannot visit the shops because they are observing lockdown protocols can receive deliveries safely. It has paid \u00a31.5m for the testing kits, with 40,000 already delivered and a further 60,000 to come. Ocado refused to state from which company it had bought the tests. While Ocado has managed to source testing kits for staff contributing to the food supply effort, nurses and doctors have been left waiting.

Ocado said testing would help ensure staff can continue \u201cworking round the clock\u201d to get as much food delivered to as many homes as possible, with demand 10 times higher than average. Its ordering service has buckled under the strain of rocketing orders, prompting its chairman, Stuart Rose, to urge Britons to stop stockpiling groceries, insisting \u201cnobody will starve\u201d during the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cNo matter how hard we work, we do not have enough capacity to serve these unprecedented levels of demand,\u201d Ocado said in an emailed statement. \u201cOur priorities are the safety and wellbeing of our customers, colleagues and the community.\u201d The kits will allow Ocado to test grocery packers and delivery drivers who have emerged as one of the most vital segments of the workforce during the coronavirus crisis because of their role in bringing food to those who cannot leave the house. Anyone involved in the production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery of food has been given \u201ckey worker\u201d status, affording them certain privileges such as permission to send their children to school. Ocado said if it were asked to do so, it would hand over testing kits to the government to ensure that health workers were first in line. \u201cOcado is clear that the NHS takes priority in the national effort to combat coronavirus and kits will be made available to the NHS if and where required,\u201d it said. The government has said that tests for NHS healthcare workers will be rolled out next week, allowing them to confirm whether they have been infected or are safe to work. It bought 3.5m of the kits but has been criticised over the time it has taken for them to reach frontline staff most at risk of contracting the virus from patients. While key workers have had to wait to be tested, private health firms have come under fire for selling thousands of test kits to wealthy buyers for up to \u00a3295 each. Public Health England said last week that mass home-testing would be possible \u201cwithin days\u201d via a procedure that involves pricking the finger to produce a drop of blood, which is then analysed by a device. The test is being validated in Oxford to ensure it works. The health body said the kits would soon be available on the high street, or to order via Amazon\u2019s delivery service. But Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, later played down the idea that millions of the tests would be available on the internet this week. High street pharmacist Boots said on Friday night that it had agreed to help the government open drive-through Covid-19 testing facilities by assisting with recruitment of staff, although it has no plans to test in stores.",

      "body": "<p>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual national on temporary release from a five-year jail sentence, is for the first time under formal consideration for clemency, her family has been told. A decision will be made by the highest level of Iran\u2019s multi-layered government. There is no guarantee that clemency will be granted, or that she will be allowed to return to the UK.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe, seen by some as a bargaining chip in the wider diplomatic dispute between the UK and Iran, was given a temporary fortnight\u2019s release from Evin prison, Tehran, on 17 March along with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/iran-to-pardon-10000-including-security-prisoners\"> 85,000 other prisoners at risk from the coronavirus outbreak.</a> She has been allowed to stay at her parents\u2019 house in Tehran but made to wear an ankle brace that keeps her within 300 metres of her parents\u2019 home.</p> <p>All prisoners sentenced for five years or less were given temporary release, permitting half of all Iran\u2019s political prisoners to be freed.</p> <p>The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced early last week that what had initially been seen as a fortnight\u2019s release for furloughed prisoners had been extended to early April since there was no sign that the coronavirus pandemic was easing. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s inclusion in that extension was only confirmed to the family by the prison on Saturday.</p> <p>Arrested in April 2016, she was sentenced in September to five years in jail. Her sentence is due to come to an end within 10 months unless new charges are levelled against her - something the Islamic revolutionary guards corps has threatened in the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec9acfe94f50a554009065481e533af29fffd373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec9acfe94f50a554009065481e533af29fffd373/0_579_2764_3454/800.jpg\" alt=\"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe pictured with her ankle brace\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe pictured with her ankle brace</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Free Nazanin Campaign/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The potential offer of clemency, relayed to Nazanin\u2019s father by the prison authorities at the weekend, will be recommended to the Iranian prosecutor general\u2019s office. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, described the move as \u201cpotentially a baby step towards freedom\u201d. \u201cI spoke to her yesterday and her mood was pretty upbeat,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ratcliffe told the Guardian: \u201cThe deputy prosecutor can either approve clemency or refer the file back to the supreme leader\u2019s office with a recommendation that she not be granted clemency, or it could just sit on his desk for a bit.</p> <p>\u201cThe supreme leader can refuse a recommendation not to grant clemency, or can follow it and specify that Nazanin not be granted. But the default in the process following the supreme leader\u2019s proclamation last week is that the law requires eligible people to be granted clemency.</p> <p>\u201cSo it is a good that her file has been put forward \u2013 an acknowledgement by the judiciary that she is formally eligible, and she is being treated so far like everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>He and his wife, 41, have suffered painful false dawns before, partly because the Iranian political system has many different centres of decision-making.</p> <p>British officials believe any decision to grant her clemency will be taken at the highest level, including an assessment of the wider political benefits to Iran in winning support for the lifting of sanctions.

      "bodyText": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual national on temporary release from a five-year jail sentence, is for the first time under formal consideration for clemency, her family has been told. A decision will be made by the highest level of Iran\u2019s multi-layered government. There is no guarantee that clemency will be granted, or that she will be allowed to return to the UK. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, seen by some as a bargaining chip in the wider diplomatic dispute between the UK and Iran, was given a temporary fortnight\u2019s release from Evin prison, Tehran, on 17 March along with 85,000 other prisoners at risk from the coronavirus outbreak. She has been allowed to stay at her parents\u2019 house in Tehran but made to wear an ankle brace that keeps her within 300 metres of her parents\u2019 home. All prisoners sentenced for five years or less were given temporary release, permitting half of all Iran\u2019s political prisoners to be freed. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced early last week that what had initially been seen as a fortnight\u2019s release for furloughed prisoners had been extended to early April since there was no sign that the coronavirus pandemic was easing. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s inclusion in that extension was only confirmed to the family by the prison on Saturday. Arrested in April 2016, she was sentenced in September to five years in jail. Her sentence is due to come to an end within 10 months unless new charges are levelled against her - something the Islamic revolutionary guards corps has threatened in the past. The potential offer of clemency, relayed to Nazanin\u2019s father by the prison authorities at the weekend, will be recommended to the Iranian prosecutor general\u2019s office. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, described the move as \u201cpotentially a baby step towards freedom\u201d. \u201cI spoke to her yesterday and her mood was pretty upbeat,\u201d he said. Ratcliffe told the Guardian: \u201cThe deputy prosecutor can either approve clemency or refer the file back to the supreme leader\u2019s office with a recommendation that she not be granted clemency, or it could just sit on his desk for a bit. \u201cThe supreme leader can refuse a recommendation not to grant clemency, or can follow it and specify that Nazanin not be granted. But the default in the process following the supreme leader\u2019s proclamation last week is that the law requires eligible people to be granted clemency. \u201cSo it is a good that her file has been put forward \u2013 an acknowledgement by the judiciary that she is formally eligible, and she is being treated so far like everyone else.\u201d He and his wife, 41, have suffered painful false dawns before, partly because the Iranian political system has many different centres of decision-making. British officials believe any decision to grant her clemency will be taken at the highest level, including an assessment of the wider political benefits to Iran in winning support for the lifting of sanctions. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has deliberately made no political statement since her release from jail, but the pressure to release other prisoners is intense, with reports of unrest in prisons continuing this weekend. The Iranian foreign ministry has been mounting an increasingly effective international campaign, including with American Democrats, to turn up the diplomatic heat on the US for its refusal to suspend economic sanctions to help Iran purchase medical equipment needed to help fight the pandemic. Britain has been privately urging Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, to see if the US can remove any blocks to a new Swiss channel, the Swiss humanitarian trade arrangement, that is supposed to ease the flow of humanitarian supplies to Iran. International bankers say they still do not have sufficient reassurance from the US Treasury that they will not be sanctioned if they finance the trade. At the same time, Iran has been seeking help in securing a $5bn (\u00a34bn) IMF loan, something the US could block. A reformist MP from Tehran, Alireza Rahimi, tweeted on Sunday that the IMF was going to release \u201ca substantial portion\u201d of the loan. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said: \u201cThe US government had moved from sabotage to assassinations to waging an economic war and economic terrorism on Iranians and now to medical terrorism. This even exceeds what is permissible on the battlefield.\u201d However, hardliners are determined to send out a message that the government can ride out the crisis alone, and seem mainly eager to take aim at the failure of Europe and the US to bring the pandemic under control. Pressure has also been mounting on the sometimes incoherent Iranian leadership over its handling of the pandemic.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 100 critically endangered sea turtles have hatched on a deserted beach in Brazil, their first steps going almost unnoticed because of coronavirus restrictions that prohibit people from gathering on the region\u2019s sands. The 97 hawksbill sea turtles, or tartarugas-de-pente as they are known in Brazil, hatched last Sunday in Paulista, a town in the north-eastern state of Pernambuco. Photographs taken by government workers, the only people to witness the event, showed the tiny creatures making their way down the beach and into the Atlantic waves. Locals have been forbidden from gathering on Pernambuco\u2019s spectacular shoreline since last weekend, when the state governor, Paulo C\u00e2mara, ordered a partial shutdown and urged residents to stay indoors to slow the spread of coronavirus. Speaking to the Guardian last week, C\u00e2mara said such measures \u2013 which the country\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has actively undermined \u2013 were vital if Brazil were to avoid a crisis similar to the one that has taken hold in Europe. \u201cOnly isolation will stop the curve growing at the speed it is growing in other places,\u201d he said. C\u00e2mara said the government of Pernambuco, which has so far confirmed 68 Covid-19 cases and five deaths, was racing against time to make hospital beds available for patients. \u201cAll of our efforts are now geared towards delaying its profileration \u2026 [so that] when this curve grows, and it will grow, we are as ready as we possibly can be to care for people,\u201d he said. According to Brazil\u2019s Tamar conservation project, which protects sea turtles, hawksbills lay their eggs along the country\u2019s north-eastern coast and are considered a critically endangered species. They can grow up to 110cm in length, weigh 85kg and owe their Portuguese name, which translates as \u201ccomb turtles\u201d, to the fact that their shells were once widely used to make combs and frames for glasses. The turtle\u2019s English name comes from its narrow, pointed beak, according to the WWF. Paulista\u2019s environmental secretary, Roberto Couto, said the town was home to four of the five types of turtle found along Brazil\u2019s coastline: the hawksbill, the green sea turtle, the olive ridley turtle and the loggerhead turtle. More than 300 turtles have hatched there this year.

A fierce novel exploring the subjugation of \u2013 and violence against \u2013 women through the ages.</p> <h2>Radical Acts of Love <br>Janie Brown</h2> <p><em>Canongate, \u00a314.99, pp304</em></p> <p>For 30 years, Janie Brown was an oncology nurse and counsellor helping people suddenly facing terminal illness. Here, she recounts 20 conversations with patients whose responses to their diagnoses range from anger to guilt and grief. Brown is a deeply compassionate and sensitive interlocutor and these accounts brim with humanity. In addition to the case studies, Brown offers practical advice about learning to accept death without despair. Insightful, wise and life-affirming, Brown\u2019s book teaches us that sharing someone\u2019s final weeks is perhaps the most radical act of love we can offer.</p> <h2>Letters of Note: Mothers <br>Shaun Usher</h2> <p><em>Canongate, \u00a36.99, pp176</em></p> <p>The Letters of Note brand continues with a new series of pocket-size paperbacks on a variety of themes: love, music, war, art, cats and, here, mothers. The letters range from the famous to the quietly heroic. None is more poignant than that written in 1950 by the Czech socialist politician Milada Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 to her 16-year-old daughter. Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 had been arrested and sentenced to death for treason, and the letter was written the night before her execution.

      "bodyText": "The Bass Rock Evie Wyld Jonathan Cape, \u00a316.99, pp368 It\u2019s the early 18th century and Sarah is accused by villagers of being a witch after crops fail and livestock falls sick; fast-forward more than two centuries and Ruth is struggling with a claustrophobic postwar community after she marries a widower and becomes stepmother to his sons; six decades later, Viviane finds echoes of the past while clearing out her grandmother\u2019s house. A fierce novel exploring the subjugation of \u2013 and violence against \u2013 women through the ages. Radical Acts of Love Janie Brown Canongate, \u00a314.99, pp304 For 30 years, Janie Brown was an oncology nurse and counsellor helping people suddenly facing terminal illness. Here, she recounts 20 conversations with patients whose responses to their diagnoses range from anger to guilt and grief. Brown is a deeply compassionate and sensitive interlocutor and these accounts brim with humanity. In addition to the case studies, Brown offers practical advice about learning to accept death without despair. Insightful, wise and life-affirming, Brown\u2019s book teaches us that sharing someone\u2019s final weeks is perhaps the most radical act of love we can offer. Letters of Note: Mothers Shaun Usher Canongate, \u00a36.99, pp176 The Letters of Note brand continues with a new series of pocket-size paperbacks on a variety of themes: love, music, war, art, cats and, here, mothers. The letters range from the famous to the quietly heroic. None is more poignant than that written in 1950 by the Czech socialist politician Milada Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 to her 16-year-old daughter. Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 had been arrested and sentenced to death for treason, and the letter was written the night before her execution. Heartbreaking. \u2022 To order The Bass Rock, Radical Acts of Love or Letters of Note: Mothers, go to guardianbookshop. com. Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315",

      "body": "<p>\u2018Growing up,\u201d says Kayleigh Llewellyn, \u201cmy mum had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/what-is-bipolar-disorder-google\">bipolar disorder</a> type one. So quite severe. The love you have for your mother or father is so deep-seated, there\u2019s a contradiction: you love the person, but you also feel ashamed of them, because you\u2019re a teenager and you don\u2019t know any better.\u201d</p> <p>Llewellyn has poured this experience into <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06myb3d\">In My Skin</a>, an emotional rollercoaster of a TV drama about Bethan, a Welsh teenager coming of age and living a double life as she negotiates mental illness, friendships and her sexuality. Bethan\u2019s mother Trina has bipolar disorder and is sectioned in a psychiatric ward. In an early episode, Trina says something so horrible to Bethan that I gasped out loud in my living room. At other times, the sympathy I feel for her has me weeping. But there are plenty of laughs along the way.</p> <p>Bethan shoulders much of the burden of her mother\u2019s illness alone, although her gran and a kindly but interfering PE teacher do try to help. She\u2019s ambitious and dreams of being a writer, while trying to survive in a hostile and homophobic school. She also desperately wants to impress popular girl Poppy, on whom she has a crush, lying about her home life even to her closest friends, portraying it as secure and middle class.</p> <p>\u201cI lived in fear that kids in my school would find out my mum was frequently being sectioned,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cI thought they would make fun of me, ostracise me \u2013 or even worse, make fun of my mum.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"15e785ddacd2ce4d655c500ab90d238be34401d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15e785ddacd2ce4d655c500ab90d238be34401d5/0_0_2400_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I just could not afford to live any more\u2019 \u2026 Llewellyn.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I just could not afford to live any more\u2019 \u2026 Llewellyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karla Gowlett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Llewellyn initially trained as an actor and didn\u2019t start writing until she was 27. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know any actors, and I certainly didn\u2019t know any writers.

Within a week, producer Nerys Evans \u2013 who is also Welsh with a working-class background \u2013 had persuaded the BBC to commission the pilot, which won two <a href=\"http://www.bafta.org/wales/awards\">Bafta Cymru awards</a> including best TV drama.

It was such a responsibility. It was about visualisation, breath work, and lots and lots of research, and I was able to use emotional recall from personal experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Hartley watched videos of people with hypomania, and had in-depth chats with Llewellyn and others who had experience of bipolar disorder. On set, she was isolated from most of the cast and crew and didn\u2019t wash her hair, staying in character for the duration. \u201cWe came up with a scale of one to five,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cBipolar has stages\u2013 you\u2019re not just hypomanic all time. So Jo could be given <em>this</em> number for the level of her mania. And then we had an amazing doctor based in Cardiff who specialises in bipolar patients, who read all of our scripts and gave advice.\u201d</p> <p>Llewellyn\u2019s sister also read all the scripts and gave her blessing, but her mother was very ill when they were shooting the pilot, and did not watch it until two weeks after it was first shown on BBC Three. \u201cShe was in Wales and I was in London and I was on the edge of my seat feeling sick waiting for the phone to ring. Eventually she called and said, \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Was there a temptation to dial down some of the more shocking things Trina says, to give a more sympathetic portrayal? Llewellyn says not. \u201cI want people to have the takeaway that Trina is a kind woman and a good mother who\u2019s very ill. I hope I struck that balance. But to give an accurate representation of what it is to care for someone who\u2019s mentally ill, you have to show it warts and all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We wanted to recreate the Wales we knew: you can be on a grotty street, but the vista around you is beautiful hills</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe all know there is something we can each say to our mother, our sister, our partner, that would cripple them, but of course you love them, you don\u2019t want to hurt them. When you\u2019re with someone who is ill, they don\u2019t have that filter. I can\u2019t, when my mum is well, hold her to account for the things she said when she was completely unwell and that she has no memory of. You just have to absorb it. I\u2019m sure that there are lots of people who struggle to, and I have, to a degree. But you won\u2019t ever get an apology.\u201d</p> <p>Llewellyn\u2019s father died in 2015. They had been estranged for 10 years. In the show, Bethan also faces occasional cruelty from her dysfunctional father, an alcoholic Hell\u2019s Angel who drives a rag and bone truck. He\u2019s played by Rhodri Meilir.</p> <p>Having grown up in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales\">Wales</a>, which has some of the poorest estates in western Europe, seeing the poverty and deprivation she knew portrayed accurately on screen was a new experience for Llewellyn. She says you either have the comedies, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gavin-and-stacey\">Gavin and Stacey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/07/stella-review-ruth-jones-old-fashioned-comedy-sam-wollaston\">Stella</a>, or dramas such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sex-education\">Sex Education</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/25/the-end-of-the-fing-world-review-a-binge-worthy-comedy-about-teen-nihilists-on-the-run\">The End of the F</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/25/the-end-of-the-fing-world-review-a-binge-worthy-comedy-about-teen-nihilists-on-the-run\">***ing World</a>, which are shot in Wales but look like America.</p> <p>\u201cNo disrespect to those shows, but Nerys and I talked a lot about wanting to recreate accurately the Wales we knew. You can be on a really grotty disgusting street that has old mattresses thrown out and litter everywhere, but the vista around you is the most beautiful green hills. The two live side by side. And the things that Gavin and Stacey and Stella captured, those warm, broad characters, that to me is real. We wanted that, but also the grittier side \u2013 people struggling on the breadline and struggling to find good mental health care.\u201d</p> <p>In My Skin has plenty of comic relief, particularly from Bethan\u2019s gran. \u201cI love the phrase \u2018Make \u2019em laugh, make \u2019em cry\u2019,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cMostly because I think that is life. And it comes naturally to me. Like lots of people who\u2019ve been marginalised or have something to hide, you deflect with comedy. I\u2019ve done that my whole life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f21a44d89fa8dbfe0a259dff2898f33b25030fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f21a44d89fa8dbfe0a259dff2898f33b25030fe/0_245_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Assassin \u2026 Llewellyn is also a writer on Killing Eve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Assassin \u2026 Llewellyn is also a writer on Killing Eve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Sid Gentle Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She\u2019s influenced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/oct/07/jill-soloway-my-father-told-me-he-was-trans-and-it-changed-my-life-\">Jill Soloway</a>, whose show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/transparent\">Transparent</a> perfected that mixture of belly laughs and gut punches. She thinks diversity in the TV industry is slowly improving and that, as a working-class lesbian Welsh woman, it\u2019s a good time to be \u201ca box tick\u201d because broadcasters are now interested in diverse stories. \u201cPeople are talking so much more about mental health issues, which is such a big part of the battle \u2013 that people feel able to discuss it and not hide in the shadows. But there is a long way to go.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cMy mum, to this day, having been a mental health patient for over 30 years, has still never been offered talking therapy. It\u2019s just extreme medication. I love the NHS. It\u2019s kept my mum alive. But they\u2019re spread so thin, they can\u2019t offer something that would be so useful.\u201d</p> <p>As for the show, she says: \u201cI hope that anyone who has either mental health issues or has been a carer for a mentally ill person just feels seen. That they watch it and say \u2018Someone gets me\u2019 \u2013 and feel a hand on their shoulder.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 In My Skin will be available on BBC Three and iPlayer on 29 March. The seriesl starts on BBC One and BBC One Wales on 1 April at 10.45pm.</p>",

When you\u2019re with someone who is ill, they don\u2019t have that filter. I can\u2019t, when my mum is well, hold her to account for the things she said when she was completely unwell and that she has no memory of. You just have to absorb it. I\u2019m sure that there are lots of people who struggle to, and I have, to a degree. But you won\u2019t ever get an apology.\u201d Llewellyn\u2019s father died in 2015. They had been estranged for 10 years. In the show, Bethan also faces occasional cruelty from her dysfunctional father, an alcoholic Hell\u2019s Angel who drives a rag and bone truck. He\u2019s played by Rhodri Meilir. Having grown up in Wales, which has some of the poorest estates in western Europe, seeing the poverty and deprivation she knew portrayed accurately on screen was a new experience for Llewellyn. She says you either have the comedies, such as Gavin and Stacey and Stella, or dramas such as Sex Education and The End of the F***ing World, which are shot in Wales but look like America. \u201cNo disrespect to those shows, but Nerys and I talked a lot about wanting to recreate accurately the Wales we knew. You can be on a really grotty disgusting street that has old mattresses thrown out and litter everywhere, but the vista around you is the most beautiful green hills. The two live side by side. And the things that Gavin and Stacey and Stella captured, those warm, broad characters, that to me is real. We wanted that, but also the grittier side \u2013 people struggling on the breadline and struggling to find good mental health care.\u201d In My Skin has plenty of comic relief, particularly from Bethan\u2019s gran. \u201cI love the phrase \u2018Make \u2019em laugh, make \u2019em cry\u2019,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cMostly because I think that is life. And it comes naturally to me. Like lots of people who\u2019ve been marginalised or have something to hide, you deflect with comedy. I\u2019ve done that my whole life.\u201d She\u2019s influenced by Jill Soloway, whose show Transparent perfected that mixture of belly laughs and gut punches. She thinks diversity in the TV industry is slowly improving and that, as a working-class lesbian Welsh woman, it\u2019s a good time to be \u201ca box tick\u201d because broadcasters are now interested in diverse stories. \u201cPeople are talking so much more about mental health issues, which is such a big part of the battle \u2013 that people feel able to discuss it and not hide in the shadows. But there is a long way to go.\u201d She adds: \u201cMy mum, to this day, having been a mental health patient for over 30 years, has still never been offered talking therapy. It\u2019s just extreme medication. I love the NHS. It\u2019s kept my mum alive. But they\u2019re spread so thin, they can\u2019t offer something that would be so useful.\u201d As for the show, she says: \u201cI hope that anyone who has either mental health issues or has been a carer for a mentally ill person just feels seen. That they watch it and say \u2018Someone gets me\u2019 \u2013 and feel a hand on their shoulder.\u201d \u2022 In My Skin will be available on BBC Three and iPlayer on 29 March. The seriesl starts on BBC One and BBC One Wales on 1 April at 10.45pm.",

Thomas Schaefer, the finance minister of Germany\u2019s Hesse state, took his own life apparently after becoming \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about how to cope with the economic fallout from the epidemic. The main opposition candidate in Polish presidential elections called for the vote to be boycotted if the government insists on going ahead with it on 10 May.

The Principality Stadium in Cardiff will be converted into an emergency field hospital, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/excel-coronavirus-hospital-will-be-by-far-the-largest-in-the-uk\" title=\"\">London\u2019s ExCel conference centre will house 4,000 temporary beds</a>.</p> <p>Stevenage of League Two have launched a hotline for the over-70s to signpost services and offer food deliveries, with their chief executive, Alex Tunbridge, saying: \u201cWe are no longer a football club at present. We are turning the club into a community careline.\u201d</p> <p>The NHS began installing equipment at Plymouth on Thursday, while IT, telephone connections and signage have since been set up. There is scope for Argyle to hand their entire stadium to the NHS, with the majority of the club\u2019s 70 full-time staff working remotely while a skeleton team tend to the stadium.</p> <p>\u201cWe have left the door open for that to happen. It works in that those non-emergency cases and routine things can be done. If necessary we could use different parts of the stadium as well to do different activities. There are four separate stands and all of those can be used in one form or another. It is easy to think football is just a game but it\u2019s so much more than that. It\u2019s part of people\u2019s lives, routines and it\u2019s important from a social aspect. It is only right that it serves to be a community asset, particularly at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Plymouth have also raised almost \u00a325,000 since launching a crowdfunding campaign with the aim of supporting local suppliers, pledging to donate one match ticket to NHS staff from Devon and Cornwall for every \u00a3100 raised.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can be successful without kicking a ball to help save people\u2019s lives, that to me is a big yes,\u201d says Ryan Lowe, the Plymouth manager. \u201cThere are parents, nurses and doctors putting their bodies on the line and not going home to see their families, so it is great we can do something to give back.</p> <p>\u201cFootball has taken a back step and rightly so because it\u2019s not about football and we\u2019re doing our bit to help that. Everyone is missing football and desperate to get back playing but ultimately the most important thing is to save lives and stop this cruel virus.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On Monday morning, the Plymouth dressing room will not be home to players or coaching staff gearing up for a promotion push but rather National Health Service nurses welcoming the first wave of antenatal patients. The League Two club have handed over the use of their new grandstand to the NHS to ease the strain on the city\u2019s Derriford hospital during the coronavirus crisis, with the Home Park boardroom temporarily moonlighting as a phlebotomy clinic and the conference hall becoming a waiting room. A fortnight ago Dr Jonathan Cope, the associate medical director for primary care at University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, approached the club in search of alternative facilities and following conversations between the club\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Parkinson, and the chairman, Simon Hallett, Plymouth soon put wheels in motion to ease pressure on one of Devon\u2019s primary hospitals by transforming the redeveloped grandstand, which was completed in December at a cost of \u00a38m, into a clinical environment. \u201cHome Park can be used for important and routine services such as blood tests and all of the things people require outside of the emergency side of things at the hospital, which, unfortunately, is going to have a lot of footfall over the coming weeks,\u201d Parkinson says. \u201cIt will serve a purpose to help those day-to-day services keep running, allowing the hospital to focus on emergencies.\u201d Manchester City, Watford and Forest Green are among a clutch of clubs to make a similar gesture, with the NHS set to use the Etihad Stadium to train doctors and nurses during the pandemic, while Swansea have offered use of the Liberty Stadium to the emergency services with football suspended until at least 30 April. The Principality Stadium in Cardiff will be converted into an emergency field hospital, while London\u2019s ExCel conference centre will house 4,000 temporary beds. Stevenage of League Two have launched a hotline for the over-70s to signpost services and offer food deliveries, with their chief executive, Alex Tunbridge, saying: \u201cWe are no longer a football club at present. We are turning the club into a community careline.\u201d The NHS began installing equipment at Plymouth on Thursday, while IT, telephone connections and signage have since been set up. There is scope for Argyle to hand their entire stadium to the NHS, with the majority of the club\u2019s 70 full-time staff working remotely while a skeleton team tend to the stadium. \u201cWe have left the door open for that to happen. It works in that those non-emergency cases and routine things can be done. If necessary we could use different parts of the stadium as well to do different activities. There are four separate stands and all of those can be used in one form or another. It is easy to think football is just a game but it\u2019s so much more than that. It\u2019s part of people\u2019s lives, routines and it\u2019s important from a social aspect. It is only right that it serves to be a community asset, particularly at this time.\u201d Plymouth have also raised almost \u00a325,000 since launching a crowdfunding campaign with the aim of supporting local suppliers, pledging to donate one match ticket to NHS staff from Devon and Cornwall for every \u00a3100 raised. \u201cIf we can be successful without kicking a ball to help save people\u2019s lives, that to me is a big yes,\u201d says Ryan Lowe, the Plymouth manager. \u201cThere are parents, nurses and doctors putting their bodies on the line and not going home to see their families, so it is great we can do something to give back. \u201cFootball has taken a back step and rightly so because it\u2019s not about football and we\u2019re doing our bit to help that. Everyone is missing football and desperate to get back playing but ultimately the most important thing is to save lives and stop this cruel virus.\u201d",

This isn\u2019t the time to defraud our citizens.\u201d G\u00f3nzalez Laya reminded the Dutch minister that \u201cthis is 2020, not 2008\u201d, adding: \u201cThe pandemic is affecting all of us. It\u2019s not about the failure of one sector or one geographic region.\u201d",

The Granite City is still one week away from a market collapse even deeper than the 2016 price crash.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a real worry so soon after the last downturn,\u201d one taxi driver says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long for people to lose their jobs if the oil price is under $35 [\u00a328] a barrel. Within three or four months of low oil prices contract workers can be out of work. It\u2019s always quicker than you\u2019d think.\u201d</p> <p>A week later oil is trading at about $25 a barrel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/saudi-arabia-price-war-wipes-billions-from-value-of-major-oil-firms-royal-dutch-shell-bp\">wiping billions from the market value of UK oil companies</a>, and an industry report warns that the North Sea oil and gas industry is in a \u201cpaper-thin\u201d position. Oil companies are expected to axe their spending plans to weather the latest market rout, which threatens to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/19/north-sea-oil-gas-prices-plunge-market-collapse-uk-economic-crisis\">halve the revenue from the barrels of oil they produce this year</a>.</p> <p>\u201cDuring the last oil price crash Aberdeen was not ready at all,\u201d says one North Sea veteran. \u201cThe city itself completely changed within the space of a few months. Around 150,000 people in the UK lost their jobs, and Aberdeen bore the brunt.\u201d</p> <p>He asks not to be named because after more than 20 years working in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/oilandgascompanies\">the North Sea oil and gas industry</a> he is struggling to find work. In recent days a verbal job offer from one North Sea firm was rescinded and an interview with another cancelled. Employers have brought in hiring freezes across the city and recruiters have scrapped their meeting schedules for the next few weeks.</p> <p>This disquiet is still fresh in the city\u2019s collective memory. The last oil market downturn was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/06/oil-prices-crash-to-11-year-low\">deeper and longer than any oil market rout in history</a>, lasting from late 2014 to its nadir at $28 a barrel in the first weeks of 2016. It was punctuated by about 150 North Sea job losses a day and a string of bankruptcies. At its depths property prices in Aberdeen plummeted and mortgage arrears spiralled to double the national level.</p> <p>\u201cThe last downturn was a tough one for the city,\u201d says Derek Leith, a senior partner at EY\u2019s Aberdeen office. \u201cBut what it meant was that Aberdeen began to think very seriously about the fact that eventually the era of oil and gas will come to an end and the city needs to be famous for doing something else.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of effort to change the trajectory to make Aberdeen a centre for energy, rather than of oil and gas. The idea is to use the city\u2019s existing skills and pivot towards renewables and other clean energy sources,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-29T13:47:32/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Brent crude graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-29T13:47:32/embed.html\">Brent crude graph</a> </figure>  <p>As the UK moves towards a net-zero carbon future many have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/26/oil-regulator-to-revise-remit-to-address-climate-crisis\">questioned whether there can still be a place for the UK\u2019s ageing oil industry</a>. Now, a green future might be Aberdeen\u2019s best bet for a long-term future.</p> <p>\u201cIf you were to ask a dyed-in-the-wool Aberdonian who has worked in the oil industry for the last 20, 30 years whether they are interested in climate action they would probably only go along with it as long as it didn\u2019t impact their livelihoods,\u201d the North Sea veteran says. \u201cThese same people are realising that renewables might just save them.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Ian Wood is one such convert. During the North Sea\u2019s boom years in the 1970s and 80s the billionaire oil tycoon used the UK\u2019s lead in offshore oil and gas to transform his modest family firm, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/woodgroupjohn\">Wood Group</a>, into one of the world\u2019s largest oil engineering companies. Today, he believes the city that ignited the world\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels believes it may hold the answer to tackling its consequences.</p> <p>Wood set up Opportunity North East as oil prices tumbled in 2015. His threefold plan to rebalance the region\u2019s economy recasts the offshore heritage and engineering legacy of the north-east of Scotland as a vital advantage in building a greener economy.</p> <p>First, accelerate the offshore wind boom, including a new generation of floating wind farms. Next, use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/24/offshore-windfarms-can-provide-more-electricity-than-the-world-needs\">this abundant clean energy</a> to siphon off the carbon from hydrocarbon gas, in a process known as steam methane reforming, to produce clean-burning hydrogen for transport fuels and industry. Finally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/20/north-sea-oilfields-could-help-contain-climate-change-says-report\">store the leftover carbon \u201cwaste\u201d from this process beneath the seabed</a> to prevent it contributing to rising global temperatures.</p> <p>\u201cThis all sounds very glib,\u201d Wood says. \u201cIt will take, in my opinion, 10 to 15 years to get this right. Once we have it, we will be able to sequester quite a lot of carbon emissions.\u201d</p> <p>Getting it right would also secure a route to market for North Sea gas and a place for Aberdeen at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/21/is-hydrogen-the-solution-to-net-zero-home-heating\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/21/is-hydrogen-the-solution-to-net-zero-home-heating\">centre of the UK\u2019s hydrogen economy</a>. The city has already taken steps to lay claim to a green future, including the establishment of the Net Zero Solution Centre, a hub of green tech innovation within the Oil and Gas Technology Centre (OGTC), which could one day export low-carbon energy solutions globally.</p> <p>Colette Cohen, the chief executive of the OGTC, says leading oil companies are beginning to take meaningful steps towards complying with the UK\u2019s legally binding climate targets, but the oil price collapse has raised doubts.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we were first set up three years ago the industry was still struggling against the last oil market downturn,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we were talking about what their carbon footprint would look like in the next decade, companies were saying: \u2018I may not exist then, it\u2019s really financially challenging right now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the last year, there has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/12/bp-sets-net-zero-carbon-target-for-2050\">a palpable shift within the industry</a>, she says, but the latest market crash \u201chas to be a concern\u201d for future green investments. \u201cEverything around net zero costs money. If oil companies are backed into survival mode their ability to spend any spare cash on future-proofing their operations becomes more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Leith believes the latest crash may be enough to convince companies that investing in clean energy alternatives and \u201csurvival mode\u201d are not mutually exclusive.</p> <p>\u201cThere are always some who would prefer to batten down the hatches and hope for an upturn in oil prices so that they can go back to what they regard as normal. If anyone is still under that misconception then the last few weeks should have put that to bed,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 March 2020. An earlier version incorrectly referred to an \u201celectrolyser machine\u201d as removing carbon from hydrocarbon gas; this is actually done through a process called steam methane reforming.</p>",

At its depths property prices in Aberdeen plummeted and mortgage arrears spiralled to double the national level. \u201cThe last downturn was a tough one for the city,\u201d says Derek Leith, a senior partner at EY\u2019s Aberdeen office. \u201cBut what it meant was that Aberdeen began to think very seriously about the fact that eventually the era of oil and gas will come to an end and the city needs to be famous for doing something else. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of effort to change the trajectory to make Aberdeen a centre for energy, rather than of oil and gas. The idea is to use the city\u2019s existing skills and pivot towards renewables and other clean energy sources,\u201d he says. As the UK moves towards a net-zero carbon future many have questioned whether there can still be a place for the UK\u2019s ageing oil industry. Now, a green future might be Aberdeen\u2019s best bet for a long-term future. \u201cIf you were to ask a dyed-in-the-wool Aberdonian who has worked in the oil industry for the last 20, 30 years whether they are interested in climate action they would probably only go along with it as long as it didn\u2019t impact their livelihoods,\u201d the North Sea veteran says. \u201cThese same people are realising that renewables might just save them.\u201d Sir Ian Wood is one such convert. During the North Sea\u2019s boom years in the 1970s and 80s the billionaire oil tycoon used the UK\u2019s lead in offshore oil and gas to transform his modest family firm, Wood Group, into one of the world\u2019s largest oil engineering companies. Today, he believes the city that ignited the world\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels believes it may hold the answer to tackling its consequences. Wood set up Opportunity North East as oil prices tumbled in 2015. His threefold plan to rebalance the region\u2019s economy recasts the offshore heritage and engineering legacy of the north-east of Scotland as a vital advantage in building a greener economy. First, accelerate the offshore wind boom, including a new generation of floating wind farms. Next, use this abundant clean energy to siphon off the carbon from hydrocarbon gas, in a process known as steam methane reforming, to produce clean-burning hydrogen for transport fuels and industry. Finally, store the leftover carbon \u201cwaste\u201d from this process beneath the seabed to prevent it contributing to rising global temperatures. \u201cThis all sounds very glib,\u201d Wood says. \u201cIt will take, in my opinion, 10 to 15 years to get this right. Once we have it, we will be able to sequester quite a lot of carbon emissions.\u201d Getting it right would also secure a route to market for North Sea gas and a place for Aberdeen at the centre of the UK\u2019s hydrogen economy. The city has already taken steps to lay claim to a green future, including the establishment of the Net Zero Solution Centre, a hub of green tech innovation within the Oil and Gas Technology Centre (OGTC), which could one day export low-carbon energy solutions globally. Colette Cohen, the chief executive of the OGTC, says leading oil companies are beginning to take meaningful steps towards complying with the UK\u2019s legally binding climate targets, but the oil price collapse has raised doubts. \u201cWhen we were first set up three years ago the industry was still struggling against the last oil market downturn,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we were talking about what their carbon footprint would look like in the next decade, companies were saying: \u2018I may not exist then, it\u2019s really financially challenging right now.\u2019\u201d In the last year, there has been a palpable shift within the industry, she says, but the latest market crash \u201chas to be a concern\u201d for future green investments. \u201cEverything around net zero costs money. If oil companies are backed into survival mode their ability to spend any spare cash on future-proofing their operations becomes more difficult.\u201d Leith believes the latest crash may be enough to convince companies that investing in clean energy alternatives and \u201csurvival mode\u201d are not mutually exclusive. \u201cThere are always some who would prefer to batten down the hatches and hope for an upturn in oil prices so that they can go back to what they regard as normal. If anyone is still under that misconception then the last few weeks should have put that to bed,\u201d he says. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 March 2020. An earlier version incorrectly referred to an \u201celectrolyser machine\u201d as removing carbon from hydrocarbon gas; this is actually done through a process called steam methane reforming.",

Finally, the clocks have gone back to British Summer Time. We\u2019ve lost an hour of sleep, but hello, light.</p> <p>The greatest hope for the new season this year is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/will-spring-slow-spread-of-coronavirus-in-northern-hemisphere\">that </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/will-spring-slow-spread-of-coronavirus-in-northern-hemisphere\">better weather will start to make </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/will-spring-slow-spread-of-coronavirus-in-northern-hemisphere\">it harder for coronavirus</a> to spread. And for those lucky enough to still have their health, spring can provide other consolations. Its strong sense of a new beginning nudges our outlook and actions in welcome ways. Katherine Milkman, a behavioural scientist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, has studied the phenomenon and found that there is more to spring cleaning than the sunlight suddenly showing up cobwebs and window smears. \u201cThe start of spring generally makes us feel more motivated \u2013 it\u2019s a so-called \u2018fresh start date\u2019,\u201d she says. As such, it makes us feel less connected to the past. \u201cThat disconnect gives us a sense that whatever we messed up on previously, we can get right now. Maybe the old you failed to quit smoking or start a lasting exercise routine, but the new you can do it.\u201d</p> <p>These moments, she says, also tend \u201cto promote bigger-picture thinking, which gets us focused on our goals\u201d. Whether facing health, financial or professional worries, newly working from home or home schooling, or being suddenly at a loss for something to do, Milkman says this effect can stretch \u201cacross all of our goal-oriented activities. We\u2019ve seen that it affects everything from decisions about exercise to retirement savings.\u201d</p> <p>Spring can also fortify us with the relief it brings from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/30/sad-winter-depression-seasonal-affective-disorder\">seasonal affective disorder</a> (Sad). Even if you do not have a clinical case of it, says Hugh Selsick, chair of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sleep\">sleep</a> working group at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, \u201cmost people will experience some degree of lifting of mood in the summer months\u201d. Studies looking at populations in North America have illustrated this neatly, according to Selsick. \u201cThe further north you go, the worse our mood gets in the winter, because of that lack of light. For us [in the north] the payoff is that we also get these really nice bright long, spring and summer days.</p> <p>\u201cAs humans, we evolved in a tropical place, where there was a lot more light,\u201d Selsick says. This means our brains have evolved to expect a certain amount of it. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why we are so susceptible to changes in light,\u201d he says. And why the gloomier months can negatively affect sleep patterns and mood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bc064788ce5ef127c161ef8f2febc0ce808e485\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bc064788ce5ef127c161ef8f2febc0ce808e485/0_0_5671_3780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman looking through a window\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breathe deep ... our brains have evolved to expect more light than we get in winter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: martin-dm/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sad symptoms that spring might alleviate include low mood, tiredness, sleeping longer than normal and, says Selsick, cravings of carbohydrates in particular. So feel free to harness this knowledge to fuel a new effort to start exceeding your five a day.</p> <p>Now that most of us are only allowed out once a day, for exercise, the greatest gains in terms of making the most of spring light are to be had from stepping out first thing in the morning. Not only will getting up and out help avoid the crowds of joggers, but morning light is the most crucial for setting our circadian rhythms. \u201cIt\u2019s much better at synchronising our body clocks and getting us back into sync with the outside world,\u201d says Selsick.</p> <p>When it\u2019s dark, we produce melatonin, which acts as a time signal to the body, telling it we should be sleepy. \u201cThat first bit of light in the morning,\u201d says Selsick, \u201cis very effective at switching that melatonin off, which then tells the brain and the rest of the body it\u2019s now time to be awake and active.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a special set of receptors in our eyes which communicate directly with the body clock in the brain,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey\u2019re particularly sensitive to blue-green light, which on a [sunny] day like today is the colour of the sky. So that sort of bright sunlight, that outdoor light is what our brains are particularly sensitive to.\u201d Exposure to this in the morning helps us to wake up and shake off bleary-eyed grumpiness. \u201cAnd it helps to regulate our sleep. If your body knows when the day is starting, it\u2019s easier for it to also know at what time it needs to start winding down and getting ready for sleep.\u201d And of course sleeping well has the positive knock-on effect of giving you a better shot at feeling content and having good overall health.</p> <p>The big danger with being locked down, warns Selsick, is \u201callowing your whole rhythm to drift\u201d. Even if a temporary break from commuting allows you to sleep in a little, keep your waking-up time consistent to reap the benefits of the spring sunshine. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting that first dose of light at a different time every morning, your body has no idea where it is in time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re essentially jet-lagging your body by having a different rising time every day.\u201d Setting regular meal times helps keep our daily rhythms in sync, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s essential that we make the most of opportunities to be outside, whether it\u2019s that one permitted outing, or additional gardening, or spending some time on the balcony. \u201cThe more outdoors you can get the better, without getting in close contact with people,\u201d says Selsick.</p> <p>Getting some sun can fill our heads with new ideas, too. In 2005, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01602.x\">psychologists at the University of Michigan</a> found that half an hour out in the sun boosted not only mood, but also memory and creativity. To test the latter, they assessed changes in what they call cognitive broadening \u2013 \u201ca style of thinking in which people become more creative and which is hypothesised to be an adaptive shift in cognition that leads to behavioral flexibility and exploration\u201d, write the authors.</p> <p>Late-evening light may be less likely to have an impact on circadian rhythms than morning rays, but, says Selsick, \u201cpeople do generally report a better quality of life if they have some light in the evening\u201d. Indeed. A 2016 study by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032716306553\">researchers at Brigham Young University in Utah</a> looked at six years of data from more than 16,000 adults and found that seasonal increases in hours of sunshine correlated with decreased mental health distress.</p> <p>Longer days also seem to extend the amount of use we get from waking hours. When it\u2019s light in the evenings, it feels like daytime for longer. Staying up to batch cook, bake bread or, in the current climate, have beers with friends over Zoom, will seem appealing all of a sudden. \u201cLight does to some extent push sleep away a little bit,\u201d says Selsick. \u201cAnd people do often feel more alert when there\u2019s bright light.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9ed444914f683c827e0bc6f5d1d9bc85b9bc0cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9ed444914f683c827e0bc6f5d1d9bc85b9bc0cd/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gardening time with my daddyYoung man and his son taking care of their plants on the balcony of loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Have balcony, will garden ... a spot of seasonal potting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AleksandarNakic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And of course, with spring, light and warmth comes nature.

So plant some seeds and watch them grow, whether that\u2019s in a flowerbed or a window-sill or balcony pot. Get a bird feeder \u2013 ensuring it\u2019s inaccessible to squirrels, which are bird\u2019s nest predators. Dig out your binoculars and indulge in some twitching, or figure out (with some online help) which song belongs to which bird. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/will-spring-slow-spread-of-coronavirus-in-northern-hemisphere\">Will spring slow spread of coronavirus in northern hemisphere?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The green shoots of a new chapter in our lives provide opportunities to do better, says Milkman. \u201cThe Covid-19 crisis is inaugurating a new era and shaking up our routines.

For us [in the north] the payoff is that we also get these really nice bright long, spring and summer days. \u201cAs humans, we evolved in a tropical place, where there was a lot more light,\u201d Selsick says. This means our brains have evolved to expect a certain amount of it. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why we are so susceptible to changes in light,\u201d he says. And why the gloomier months can negatively affect sleep patterns and mood. Sad symptoms that spring might alleviate include low mood, tiredness, sleeping longer than normal and, says Selsick, cravings of carbohydrates in particular. So feel free to harness this knowledge to fuel a new effort to start exceeding your five a day. Now that most of us are only allowed out once a day, for exercise, the greatest gains in terms of making the most of spring light are to be had from stepping out first thing in the morning. Not only will getting up and out help avoid the crowds of joggers, but morning light is the most crucial for setting our circadian rhythms. \u201cIt\u2019s much better at synchronising our body clocks and getting us back into sync with the outside world,\u201d says Selsick. When it\u2019s dark, we produce melatonin, which acts as a time signal to the body, telling it we should be sleepy. \u201cThat first bit of light in the morning,\u201d says Selsick, \u201cis very effective at switching that melatonin off, which then tells the brain and the rest of the body it\u2019s now time to be awake and active. \u201cWe have a special set of receptors in our eyes which communicate directly with the body clock in the brain,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey\u2019re particularly sensitive to blue-green light, which on a [sunny] day like today is the colour of the sky. So that sort of bright sunlight, that outdoor light is what our brains are particularly sensitive to.\u201d Exposure to this in the morning helps us to wake up and shake off bleary-eyed grumpiness. \u201cAnd it helps to regulate our sleep. If your body knows when the day is starting, it\u2019s easier for it to also know at what time it needs to start winding down and getting ready for sleep.\u201d And of course sleeping well has the positive knock-on effect of giving you a better shot at feeling content and having good overall health. The big danger with being locked down, warns Selsick, is \u201callowing your whole rhythm to drift\u201d. Even if a temporary break from commuting allows you to sleep in a little, keep your waking-up time consistent to reap the benefits of the spring sunshine. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting that first dose of light at a different time every morning, your body has no idea where it is in time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re essentially jet-lagging your body by having a different rising time every day.\u201d Setting regular meal times helps keep our daily rhythms in sync, too. It\u2019s essential that we make the most of opportunities to be outside, whether it\u2019s that one permitted outing, or additional gardening, or spending some time on the balcony. \u201cThe more outdoors you can get the better, without getting in close contact with people,\u201d says Selsick. Getting some sun can fill our heads with new ideas, too. In 2005, psychologists at the University of Michigan found that half an hour out in the sun boosted not only mood, but also memory and creativity. To test the latter, they assessed changes in what they call cognitive broadening \u2013 \u201ca style of thinking in which people become more creative and which is hypothesised to be an adaptive shift in cognition that leads to behavioral flexibility and exploration\u201d, write the authors. Late-evening light may be less likely to have an impact on circadian rhythms than morning rays, but, says Selsick, \u201cpeople do generally report a better quality of life if they have some light in the evening\u201d. Indeed. A 2016 study by researchers at Brigham Young University in Utah looked at six years of data from more than 16,000 adults and found that seasonal increases in hours of sunshine correlated with decreased mental health distress. Longer days also seem to extend the amount of use we get from waking hours. When it\u2019s light in the evenings, it feels like daytime for longer. Staying up to batch cook, bake bread or, in the current climate, have beers with friends over Zoom, will seem appealing all of a sudden. \u201cLight does to some extent push sleep away a little bit,\u201d says Selsick. \u201cAnd people do often feel more alert when there\u2019s bright light.\u201d And of course, with spring, light and warmth comes nature. April will see the return of swallows, swifts, cuckoos, martins and other feathery summer visitors. The more birds we see in our neighbourhoods, and the more greenery, the more robust our mental health will be, according to a 2017 study by the University of Exeter. In 2019, data from 20,000 British people crunched by researchers at the same university showed that the more time spent enjoying nature, the greater life satisfaction reported. This is why GPs have been prescribing gardening as therapy. So plant some seeds and watch them grow, whether that\u2019s in a flowerbed or a window-sill or balcony pot. Get a bird feeder \u2013 ensuring it\u2019s inaccessible to squirrels, which are bird\u2019s nest predators. Dig out your binoculars and indulge in some twitching, or figure out (with some online help) which song belongs to which bird. The green shoots of a new chapter in our lives provide opportunities to do better, says Milkman. \u201cThe Covid-19 crisis is inaugurating a new era and shaking up our routines. Horrific as the crisis is, it presents an opportunity to size up our routines and consider what we want to change and how we can be better. I hope people will capitalise on that motivation and find ways to help one another (from a requisite social distance) and themselves achieve important goals.\u201d Yes, we are on lockdown. We may be emotionally exhausted and scared, but at least spring makes our daily outdoor exercise allowance more enticing. On warmer days, we can throw open the windows, let the fresh air flood in and expel the indoor pollutants that have accumulated from a winter\u2019s worth of cooking and cleaning. We can welcome the reduction in traffic noise and fumes. These may be bittersweet byproducts of virus hell, but it\u2019s all the better to hear the birds.",

      "body": "<p>The world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-has-26k-living-per-1sqkm-says-bmc-report/story-83y9dyIsVpnQxjQAH9Y1nO.html\">second-most crowded city</a> is trying to stay home, but it wasn\u2019t built for social distancing. Ever since it became an entrep\u00f4t of the British empire, Mumbai has been optimised to keep things moving \u2013 both labour and capital. Over the last fortnight, its citizens have been retreating from public premises. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/28/slum-loaded-term-homegrown-neighbourhoods-mumbai-dharavi\">majority</a> are now confined to one- or two-room tenement housing, often with dividing walls made of tin and tarpaulin. These stand cheek-by-jowl with shops, restaurants and crowded medical clinics. Isolation is for people who live in homes with attached toilets.</p> <p>The numbers aren\u2019t yet staggering. Unlike New York City, which currently accounts for nearly 10% of the world\u2019s known Covid-19 cases, <a href=\"https://howindialives.com/gram/coronadistricts/\">Mumbai counts 74</a> as of this writing. Unlike London, authorities here initiated shutdowns before India\u2019s government passed orders for a national lockdown.</p> <p>The novel coronavirus was first detected here, as elsewhere, among wealthy international travellers, but last week it made its <a href=\"https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/wily-virus-moves-into-slum-chawls/articleshow/74819907.cms\">first appearance</a> in Mumbai\u2019s informal settlements, where unchecked spread would be devastating. Under these circumstances, the extreme measure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/indias-13bn-population-locked-down-to-beat-coronavirus\">quarantining 1.3 billion people</a> may have looked like a sensible decision to stave off tragedy. Yet on the first morning after lockdown, it was immediately clear that another tragedy was already under way.</p> <p>Television news programmes showed long lines of migrant labourers leaving big cities, starting the long walk, on empty stomachs and in blistering heat, to their homes in rural India. With industry and construction at a standstill, daily wagers found themselves out of jobs, instantly unable to afford food or shelter. Without buses and trains, they were out of transport. From Mumbai, 300 workers were found <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-lockdown-300-rajasthan-workers-found-travelling-in-truck-containers-from-telangana-2201303\">stowing away</a> in stifling container trucks. From Delhi, weary migrants trickling back into the neighbouring province of Uttar Pradesh on foot <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/coronavirus-india-lockdown-supply-chain-problem-6331743/\">recalled scenes of famine</a> in British India.</p> <p>How have we been plunged, unprepared, into wartime? Independent India\u2019s welfare state evolved precisely in response to its depredations under empire: its core job has always been to feed the hungry. We have a powerful central government led by the country\u2019s most popular politician, Narendra Modi. Since February, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1227536939479228417\">opposition politicians</a> have been warning of the approaching risks. The southern state of Kerala, the first to start widespread testing and quarantine measures, has prevented uncontrolled outbreak within its borders for several weeks.</p> <p>So, at least in principle, this country should not have gone from bracing for an epidemic to expecting twin catastrophes of contagion and starvation. But we have. As every country in the world faces up to the mistakes it has made in confronting this disease, it\u2019s hard not to feel that India is emblematic of how unprepared the world was for Covid-19. What else was going to happen in a country that has more billionaires than anywhere save China and the US, but still has the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_in_India\">world\u2019s highest incidence of tuberculosis</a>? </p> <p>Indian epidemiologists already <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/956932/interview-suppression-wont-work-in-india-slow-down-the-coronavirus-this-will-be-a-long-haul\">knew</a> that total lockdown wouldn\u2019t work in India the way it does in Europe: the infrastructure to ensure basic necessities at every doorstep doesn\u2019t exist, which is why many essential services, from grocery delivery to agricultural work, are exempt from curfews.</p> <p>The infectious diseases expert <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/coronavirus-outbreak/coronavirus-outbreak-its-a-long-road-to-normal-says-leading-epidemiologist-j-muliyil\">Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil</a> advised us to devise various forms of community participation in controlling the disease instead: discouraging large gatherings and preparing to practice social distancing for months at a time. India\u2019s only option was to \u201cmitigate\u201d, he told the digital publication Scroll \u2013 not \u201cmilitate\u201d.</p> <p>This was oblique, but prescient. Indians are now spectators as police are filmed committing brutality on the streets, beating, humiliating, even <a href=\"https://scroll.in/latest/957298/covid-19-lockdown-man-out-to-buy-milk-in-west-bengal-beaten-up-by-police-dies-claims-family\">allegedly murdering people</a> who step out to hunt for essentials. There is a resonant continuity with scenes from India\u2019s winter of political dissent, during which Modi\u2019s government excused or enabled nauseating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/we-are-not-safe-indias-muslims-tell-of-wave-of-police-brutality\">police violenc</a>e to suppress street protests.</p> <p>This footage is available, for now, because the government has designated media work an \u201cessential service\u201d that must function through the emergency. Meanwhile, misinformation and <a href=\"https://news.abplive.com/videos/news/india-up-cm-yogi-adityanath-welcomes-package-under-pm-garib-kalyan-yojana-1183059\">propaganda</a> bolt through televisions and WhatsApp, spreading superstition, medical hoaxes and racist rumours about minorities, none of which Modi has addressed, in spite of three long prime-time discourses on Covid-19 delivered to the nation.</p> <p>Last week, even before the grievous spectacle of internal displacement began, Modi told Indians that we face a challenge greater than that of the world wars. It was a significant claim to make to a country that sent millions of soldiers to those battlefields, and suffered the effects deeply. But it also suggested that the prime minister knows the situation is far worse than his government is letting on: the epidemiologist Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan pointed out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrsXCxs2xg&amp;feature=youtu.be\">in an interview</a> that if Modi believed India\u2019s modest official numbers and projections, he would not have used such a grave analogy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-means-we-really-are-finally-all-in-this-together\">Coronavirus means we really are, finally, all in this together  | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What lies in store for India?

But our nation of 1.3 billion is still only testing 18 people per million: some say <a href=\"https://scroll.in/pulse/957380/testing-is-key-to-fighting-coronavirus-so-why-does-india-have-such-a-low-testing-rate\">because of red tape</a>, others that India is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SreenivasanJain/status/1239806166995046406\">hiding the extent of the problem</a>.</p> <p>In Mumbai, where people otherwise take a certain big-city pride in toughing it out through crises, the Covid-19 lockdown has taken away our most visible source of support: each other. Many can afford to Instagram quarantine cooking and lie around reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decameron\">The Decameron</a>, like our peers in the global elite. But these numbers are a fraction of the population that has lost the certainty of its next meal, the prospect of its next job and, for perhaps the first time in a generation, the optimism that tomorrow will be better.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s second-most crowded city is trying to stay home, but it wasn\u2019t built for social distancing. Ever since it became an entrep\u00f4t of the British empire, Mumbai has been optimised to keep things moving \u2013 both labour and capital. Over the last fortnight, its citizens have been retreating from public premises. A majority are now confined to one- or two-room tenement housing, often with dividing walls made of tin and tarpaulin. These stand cheek-by-jowl with shops, restaurants and crowded medical clinics. Isolation is for people who live in homes with attached toilets. The numbers aren\u2019t yet staggering. Unlike New York City, which currently accounts for nearly 10% of the world\u2019s known Covid-19 cases, Mumbai counts 74 as of this writing. Unlike London, authorities here initiated shutdowns before India\u2019s government passed orders for a national lockdown. The novel coronavirus was first detected here, as elsewhere, among wealthy international travellers, but last week it made its first appearance in Mumbai\u2019s informal settlements, where unchecked spread would be devastating. Under these circumstances, the extreme measure of quarantining 1.3 billion people may have looked like a sensible decision to stave off tragedy. Yet on the first morning after lockdown, it was immediately clear that another tragedy was already under way. Television news programmes showed long lines of migrant labourers leaving big cities, starting the long walk, on empty stomachs and in blistering heat, to their homes in rural India. With industry and construction at a standstill, daily wagers found themselves out of jobs, instantly unable to afford food or shelter. Without buses and trains, they were out of transport. From Mumbai, 300 workers were found stowing away in stifling container trucks. From Delhi, weary migrants trickling back into the neighbouring province of Uttar Pradesh on foot recalled scenes of famine in British India. How have we been plunged, unprepared, into wartime? Independent India\u2019s welfare state evolved precisely in response to its depredations under empire: its core job has always been to feed the hungry. We have a powerful central government led by the country\u2019s most popular politician, Narendra Modi. Since February, opposition politicians have been warning of the approaching risks. The southern state of Kerala, the first to start widespread testing and quarantine measures, has prevented uncontrolled outbreak within its borders for several weeks. So, at least in principle, this country should not have gone from bracing for an epidemic to expecting twin catastrophes of contagion and starvation. But we have. As every country in the world faces up to the mistakes it has made in confronting this disease, it\u2019s hard not to feel that India is emblematic of how unprepared the world was for Covid-19. What else was going to happen in a country that has more billionaires than anywhere save China and the US, but still has the world\u2019s highest incidence of tuberculosis? Indian epidemiologists already knew that total lockdown wouldn\u2019t work in India the way it does in Europe: the infrastructure to ensure basic necessities at every doorstep doesn\u2019t exist, which is why many essential services, from grocery delivery to agricultural work, are exempt from curfews. The infectious diseases expert Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil advised us to devise various forms of community participation in controlling the disease instead: discouraging large gatherings and preparing to practice social distancing for months at a time. India\u2019s only option was to \u201cmitigate\u201d, he told the digital publication Scroll \u2013 not \u201cmilitate\u201d. This was oblique, but prescient. Indians are now spectators as police are filmed committing brutality on the streets, beating, humiliating, even allegedly murdering people who step out to hunt for essentials. There is a resonant continuity with scenes from India\u2019s winter of political dissent, during which Modi\u2019s government excused or enabled nauseating police violence to suppress street protests. This footage is available, for now, because the government has designated media work an \u201cessential service\u201d that must function through the emergency. Meanwhile, misinformation and propaganda bolt through televisions and WhatsApp, spreading superstition, medical hoaxes and racist rumours about minorities, none of which Modi has addressed, in spite of three long prime-time discourses on Covid-19 delivered to the nation. Last week, even before the grievous spectacle of internal displacement began, Modi told Indians that we face a challenge greater than that of the world wars. It was a significant claim to make to a country that sent millions of soldiers to those battlefields, and suffered the effects deeply. But it also suggested that the prime minister knows the situation is far worse than his government is letting on: the epidemiologist Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan pointed out in an interview that if Modi believed India\u2019s modest official numbers and projections, he would not have used such a grave analogy. What lies in store for India? Dr Laxminarayan, the director of the Centre For Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, warns that without mitigation, at least a million Indians could be critically ill in a matter of weeks: four or five times fewer than in a scenario without lockdown, but still overwhelming for a country with inadequate public healthcare. \u201cTest, test, test,\u201d says the World Health Organization. But our nation of 1.3 billion is still only testing 18 people per million: some say because of red tape, others that India is hiding the extent of the problem. In Mumbai, where people otherwise take a certain big-city pride in toughing it out through crises, the Covid-19 lockdown has taken away our most visible source of support: each other. Many can afford to Instagram quarantine cooking and lie around reading The Decameron, like our peers in the global elite. But these numbers are a fraction of the population that has lost the certainty of its next meal, the prospect of its next job and, for perhaps the first time in a generation, the optimism that tomorrow will be better. Despair cannot be the only side-effect of a pandemic. But at this moment, only the fear of death, and the impending grief we share with the rest of the world, links us all. \u2022 Supriya Nair is a writer and a columnist for the Mumbai Mirror \u2022 This article was amended on 29 March 2020.

      "bodyText": "Jair Bolsonaro has reportedly told his health minister he will sack him if he dares criticise his handling of the coronavirus crisis. According to a report in the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, the Brazilian president\u2019s warning came during a top-level meeting on Saturday as the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country rose to more than 3,900 and the death toll hit 114. The health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, reportedly informed Brazil\u2019s far-right leader he would have no choice but to publicly criticise him if he insisted on going out in public despite warnings to stay indoors. \u201cBolsonaro replied that, if he did so, he would fire him,\u201d the conservative newspaper reported, citing anonymous sources. Bolsonaro\u2019s downplaying of coronavirus \u2013 and his public call for Brazil to relax quarantine measures and get back to work \u2013 have appalled critics and many citizens, sparking nightly pot-banging protests in major cities. On Friday, the president shrugged his shoulders at the likely deaths, telling an interviewer: \u201cSome will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo said that at Saturday\u2019s summit \u2013 which was also attended by Brazil\u2019s justice and defence ministers \u2013 Mandetta tried to convince Bolsonaro of the gravity of the situation. He reportedly said: \u201cAre we ready for the worst-case scenario, with army trucks transporting bodies through the streets? And cameras livestreaming that on the internet?\u201d Mandetta, who is an orthopaedic doctor, noted that even 1,000 deaths would be the equivalent of four Boeing aircraft crashes. Experts believe far more people are likely to die. Recent modelling by researchers from Imperial College London suggested Brazil could have more than 1.1 million Covid-19 deaths if no action were taken to control the pandemic; 529,000 if only elderly people were forced to isolate; and 44,200 if drastic measures were implemented. Bolsonaro\u2019s efforts to undermine regional governments\u2019 efforts to enforce such shutdowns have sparked a political rebellion by the governors of nearly all of Brazil\u2019s 27 states. Speaking to the Guardian last week, Fl\u00e1vio Dino, the leftwing governor of Maranh\u00e3o, criticised Bolsonaro\u2019s denial of the dangers of coronavirus and his \u201ccatastrophic\u201d dawdling. \u201cIf you\u2019re on a battlefield and don\u2019t know which weapon to use, which direction to shoot, and when to open fire, you expose the whole army to serious harm,\u201d Dino said.",

      "body": "<p>The Polish composer and conductor Krzysztof Penderecki, who has died aged 86, was an outstanding representative of musical modernism\u2019s success in the 1960s. From the early 70s he became equally emblematic of the subsequent failure of so many of that modernism\u2019s principal pioneers to sustain a lifelong career without abandoning their original principles.</p> <p>In Penderecki\u2019s case, that appeared to mean the substitution of his early trademark emphasis on sound itself, the innovative textures of his choral and orchestral music replacing themes and tonality as the basis for musical construction, with a more lyrical and Romantic style that seemed more like a continuation of 19th-century compositional concerns than a radical reappraisal of received materials.</p> <p>The composer\u2019s earlier manner reached its apogee in the St Luke Passion for two vocal soloists, reciter, three mixed choruses, children\u2019s choir and orchestra; its world premiere took place in March 1966 in M\u00fcnster Cathedral.</p> <p>As the German critic Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt put it: \u201cA large ecclesiastical choral work, composed by a representative of the new music in socialist Poland, performed for the first time in a centre of West German Catholicism, in the former bishop\u2019s seat of the daring anti-Nazi Graf von Galen [a prominent critic of the Third Reich when bishop of M\u00fcnster during the 40s]: this gives occasion to a variety of thoughts.\u201d Many performances worldwide of the Passion took place over the next few years.</p> <p>Penderecki\u2019s later approach is perhaps best exemplified by the First Violin Concerto, written in 1977 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/24/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Isaac Stern</a>; by the Polish Requiem for four soloists, chorus and orchestra (1984, revised in 1993), many sections of which are dedicated to individuals or mass martyrs from Polish history; or by the Credo for five vocal soloists, chorus, children\u2019s choir and orchestra (1998), in which Bach and Polish sources are encountered in a broadly 19th-century harmonic idiom.</p> <p>Penderecki was born in D\u0119bica, in south-eastern Poland, the youngest of three children of Zofia (nee Wittgenstein) and Tadeusz Penderecki. His father was a lawyer, and an amateur violinist and pianist. Armenian ancestry came from a grandmother, who took the young Penderecki to an Armenian church in Krak\u00f3w; this aspect of the composer\u2019s heritage was highlighted in 2015 with the premiere of a new choral work, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTULkAtKM_o\" title=\"\">Psalm No 3</a>, commemorating the Armenian Genocide of 1915, at Carnegie Hall, New York.</p> <p>Composition studies with Artur Malawski and Stanis\u0142aw Wiechowicz at the State Higher School of Music (now known as the Academy) in Krak\u00f3w (1954-58) led to his being appointed a teacher of composition there himself. This was only five years after the death of Stalin; and, despite the advent of the Warsaw autumn international festival of contemporary music in 1956, communist rule in Poland discouraged modernist tendencies.</p> <p>Penderecki himself was then still writing music essentially neoclassical in style, and in 1958 it must have looked as though the young composer was set for a safe but dull career of merely local significance.</p> <p>In the following year, however, came a rise both to sudden maturity and to fame surely as swift as that experienced by any composer at any period.

      "bodyText": "The Polish composer and conductor Krzysztof Penderecki, who has died aged 86, was an outstanding representative of musical modernism\u2019s success in the 1960s. From the early 70s he became equally emblematic of the subsequent failure of so many of that modernism\u2019s principal pioneers to sustain a lifelong career without abandoning their original principles. In Penderecki\u2019s case, that appeared to mean the substitution of his early trademark emphasis on sound itself, the innovative textures of his choral and orchestral music replacing themes and tonality as the basis for musical construction, with a more lyrical and Romantic style that seemed more like a continuation of 19th-century compositional concerns than a radical reappraisal of received materials. The composer\u2019s earlier manner reached its apogee in the St Luke Passion for two vocal soloists, reciter, three mixed choruses, children\u2019s choir and orchestra; its world premiere took place in March 1966 in M\u00fcnster Cathedral. As the German critic Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt put it: \u201cA large ecclesiastical choral work, composed by a representative of the new music in socialist Poland, performed for the first time in a centre of West German Catholicism, in the former bishop\u2019s seat of the daring anti-Nazi Graf von Galen [a prominent critic of the Third Reich when bishop of M\u00fcnster during the 40s]: this gives occasion to a variety of thoughts.\u201d Many performances worldwide of the Passion took place over the next few years. Penderecki\u2019s later approach is perhaps best exemplified by the First Violin Concerto, written in 1977 for Isaac Stern; by the Polish Requiem for four soloists, chorus and orchestra (1984, revised in 1993), many sections of which are dedicated to individuals or mass martyrs from Polish history; or by the Credo for five vocal soloists, chorus, children\u2019s choir and orchestra (1998), in which Bach and Polish sources are encountered in a broadly 19th-century harmonic idiom. Penderecki was born in D\u0119bica, in south-eastern Poland, the youngest of three children of Zofia (nee Wittgenstein) and Tadeusz Penderecki. His father was a lawyer, and an amateur violinist and pianist. Armenian ancestry came from a grandmother, who took the young Penderecki to an Armenian church in Krak\u00f3w; this aspect of the composer\u2019s heritage was highlighted in 2015 with the premiere of a new choral work, Psalm No 3, commemorating the Armenian Genocide of 1915, at Carnegie Hall, New York. Composition studies with Artur Malawski and Stanis\u0142aw Wiechowicz at the State Higher School of Music (now known as the Academy) in Krak\u00f3w (1954-58) led to his being appointed a teacher of composition there himself. This was only five years after the death of Stalin; and, despite the advent of the Warsaw autumn international festival of contemporary music in 1956, communist rule in Poland discouraged modernist tendencies. Penderecki himself was then still writing music essentially neoclassical in style, and in 1958 it must have looked as though the young composer was set for a safe but dull career of merely local significance. In the following year, however, came a rise both to sudden maturity and to fame surely as swift as that experienced by any composer at any period. Penderecki had, anonymously, as its terms required, submitted three works to a competition organised by the Union of Polish Composers. When his name turned out to be on the scores winning all the top three prizes, the works involved \u2013 Strophes, Emanations and Psalms of David \u2013 all immediately became well-known in European avant-garde circles, and commissioners of new works quickly beat a path to his door. The reasons for Penderecki\u2019s increasing popularity during this time clearly lay in the fact that his reliance on sound itself, rather than on melody or harmony as such \u2013 an approach that came to be called \u201csonorism\u201d \u2013 was allied to a highly expressive manner that quickly resonated with listeners beyond the avant garde, promising to create a new public for contemporary music. The works that Penderecki now began to write \u2013 deploying sound masses including unusual instrumental and vocal techniques, and combining conventional and more graphic methods of notation \u2013 extended this coupling of experimental sound-world and immediacy of expression to develop a texture-based language of assertive individuality. In the St Luke Passion, the use of chant, recitative and chorales, not to mention the BACH motif (using German note-names, B flat-A-C-B natural) and occasional major triads, helped to make it famous as an instinctively dramatic reworking of a genre familiar from the baroque period. The work was also very timely since, despite emerging from communist Poland, it expressed a spirit of post-second world war reconciliation. Penderecki\u2019s Passion became regarded as a kind of avant-garde counterpart to Benjamin Britten\u2019s War Requiem, premiered only four years before it. An expressive approach to new materials and means such as Penderecki\u2019s found contemporary parallels in the outputs not only of other Polish composers such as Henryk G\u00f3recki and, to some extent, Witold Lutos\u0142awski, but also in those of Iannis Xenakis and Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti. Part of the broader agenda here was a concern to find a way forward that addressed the problems of musical structure and comprehensibility raised by the so-called total serialism of such composers as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen, and that yet retained a radical attitude to musical materials. West Germany, in particular, opened its doors to Penderecki in the 60s: the publisher Hermann Moeck and Heinrich Strobel \u2013 a radio producer who also ran the Donaueschingen Music Days \u2013 were soon prominent champions. It was not long before Penderecki was showered with awards, both in that country and elsewhere. One of the first of these, a Unesco prize, went to his most famous early composition before the St Luke Passion, his Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1960). Written for 52 strings and originally known as 8\u201937\u201d (the work\u2019s length), Threnody is classic early Penderecki: its vividly unconventional writing for massed strings, including quarter-tones, tremolos and multiple glissandi, allied \u2013 after the composer changed the title \u2013 to highly emotive and political subject matter. This combination would serve him well both at this period and later. Indeed, just as the highly expressive, sometimes programmatically charged, approach of other early works such as Polymorphia for 48 strings (1961), with its thunderously concluding C-major chord, or the Dies Irae for three vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra (1967), which commemorates the dead of Auschwitz, was subsequently carried over into the more conventional sound-world of Penderecki\u2019s output from the 70s onwards, so the potentially incompatible range of musical materials to be found in some of his 60s compositions can sometimes be detected in his later output too.

Works such as the Te Deum for four vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra (1980) \u2013 dedicated to Cardinal Karol Wojty\u0142a of Krak\u00f3w, who became Pope John Paul II in October 1978 \u2013 and the Polish Requiem \u2013 both of which quote old Polish hymns \u2013 should be understood in this light.

The most recent of the composer\u2019s eight symphonies \u2013 subtitled Lieder der Verganglichkeit (Songs of Transience), for three vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra, a 50-minute choral symphony in 12 movements setting 19th- and early 20th-century German poets \u2013 was completed in 2005 and revised in 2008.

      "body": "<h2>John Lennon <em>by Julian Lennon</em></h2> <p>A lot of the happy memories of my father are from the late 1960s at Kenwood, the old Tudor house we had in Surrey, when I was a little boy. Without knowing it, I probably saw some of the greatest musicians in the world come and go through that house.</p> <p>I remember sitting on the roof of that house with my dad making a balsawood aeroplane. There was a great view from up there. As a kid, I thought my dad was pretty happy \u2013 with the family, the family home and his place in the world. Who could have predicted that everything was about to change?</p> <p>The Beatles had just released <em>Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>. At the time, my dad had his famous psychedelic Rolls-Royce Phantom V, which I adored because it had a record player in the back. We also had a Honda Monkey bike, a mini motorcycle we used to ride around on. Ringo [Starr] lived down the road and my dad would take me to see him on the bike. </p> <p>At Kenwood, my father and I were close. So close, in fact, that though my first name is also John, I started to get called Julian or Jules since when my mum would shout, \u201cJohn, your dinner\u2019s ready!\u201d both my dad and I would react.</p> <p>Then suddenly my dad literally disappeared off the face of the planet. At least, that\u2019s how it seemed to me. He and Yoko Ono were deeply and publicly in love. And I felt as if my mum and I had been cast aside. Not everyone forgot about us, though. Paul wrote Hey Jules after dropping in to check how my mum and I were doing. (Obviously, the title of the song changed to Hey Jude).</p> <p>Maybe 10 years passed during which my dad and I barely spoke. I was very angry about how he left the family. It was thanks to my mum that we started having conversations again. She was such a gentle soul, never vindictive in any way, shape or form. She always wanted me to have a relationship with him.</p> <p>I was scared the first time I went to visit him in the US after my parents\u2019 divorce. I was becoming more aware of the magnitude of this man. Much to my relief, the visit was a success. My dad was charming and funny and warm. From that trip on, I remember us getting along better. </p> <p>I hesitated to enter the music business because of who Dad was. I would send him the odd cassette of me playing live, or song ideas I had recorded on a little Sony Walkman he had given me.</p> <p>He warmly encouraged me to continue playing, but sadly, he never really got to see my career unfold, as he passed when I was just 17. When I did finally become a professional musician a few years later, I felt like I understood him better.</p> <p>I try to remember my dad as fondly as possible. I strive for forgiveness and understanding in that area of my life, for the difficult times he put my mum and me through. I loved her more than anything and can\u2019t forget how poorly he treated her. But our relationship was getting better before he died. He was in a happier place. He wanted to reconnect, not just with me but with the rest of his family. He never got a chance to do so. Even now, almost 40 years after he died, I hold my father\u2019s memory dear.</p> <p><em>Julian Lennon is a musician and photographer and the founder of the <a href=\"https://whitefeatherfoundation.com/\" title=\"\">White Feather Foundation</a></em></p> <h2>Caitlyn Jenner <em>by Brandon Jenner</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee89c32158f97ee16af9a0beb5fef852ab19d03d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee89c32158f97ee16af9a0beb5fef852ab19d03d/0_120_3850_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Jenner with baby son Brandon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Now, we\u2019re making up for lost time\u2019: Bruce Jenner (as she then was) with baby Brandon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My father spent the first 65 years of her life trying to avoid answering the question \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And because of that, she didn\u2019t ask it often, either. And, though, I understand that she avoided the question because the answer would have laid bare too many struggles, it made my relationship with her challenging. People connect with each other through vulnerability, and you can only get someone to open up to you if you are willing to be vulnerable yourself. Because she was shielding something so important from herself, Dad remained distant for much of my life.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have many memories from before my parents split up and my father moved out. I was four at the time. They got divorced because my dad had decided to start transitioning to female. I, of course, was too young then to have any idea what was behind their decision.</p> <p>I do, however, remember a few details from my early childhood that only made sense much later. For instance, when I was very young, I used to love to fiddle with people\u2019s ears. Once when I reached out to touch my dad\u2019s ears, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t do that. I just had surgery.\u201d He pointed to a thin line of small black stitches behind his ear, grinned, and said: \u201cThey took my ear off, peeled my face back, and then stitched it back on.\u201d </p> <p>For the first few years after their divorce, my parents were amicable. Mom started dating David Foster, whom she later married. I never called him dad, but he was the one who lived with us, who told me to pick up my clothes and turn off the lights \u2013 all the typical dad things. So even though this is about Caitlyn, I could write just as easily about David. He was a wonderful father figure.</p> <p>A few years after my parents divorced, Dad apparently decided that it wasn\u2019t the right time to transition and had many of his surgeries reversed. After that, his relationship with my mother grew more hostile. She had worked hard to accept that the reason he couldn\u2019t be with her was because he was working towards transitioning. When he started dating Kris Jenner, whom he would go on to marry, that line of reasoning fell apart. It was tremendously painful. The effect of my parents\u2019 souring relationship was that I didn\u2019t see my father more than half a dozen times between ages eight and 25.</p> <p>Because of this, most of the memories I have of my dad are from the narrow slice of time before I was eight. I remember him betting my brother Brody and me $20 that he could beat us to the top of these insanely high giant sand dunes in Malibu and then just smoking us. He ran a flat-out decathlete sprint. He didn\u2019t even pretend to let us win.</p> <p>After Dad met and married Kris, family became a business for him, and I stayed away for most of my teenage years. I didn\u2019t want to be a part of their dynamic. When I was in my 20s and his daughters with Kris \u2013 Kendall and Kylie \u2013 were teenagers, Dad and I began to re-establish a relationship. He wasn\u2019t as needed around the house and, I think, was looking for someone to talk to. Although, to be honest, instead of talking, we did things. We worked on my car or flew radio-controlled planes in the park near his house. But even then, it always seemed Dad had his guard up.</p> <p>Once he decided to go through with the transition, I was the first of her children she confided in. As soon as Dad said it herself, I was so happy for her.</p> <p>As her son, I wish my dad had been able to transition sooner, not only because I think she would have been happier, but because I think we could have built a stronger relationship earlier. Now, I\u2019m making up for lost time. I speak to my dad almost every day, and every time, she asks me, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p> <p><em>Brandon Jenner is a singer and songwriter</em> </p> <h2>Jeff Bridges <em>by Isabelle Bridges Boesch</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ef5380327e347eac14124fcdfb48626518b7c4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ef5380327e347eac14124fcdfb48626518b7c4e/0_0_3157_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bridges poses for a portrait after being nominated in the Best Actor category for the 82nd Academy Awards for his role in \u201cCrazy Heart\u201d in Los Angeles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was like having the most imaginative friend in the world\u2019: Isabelle Bridges Boesch on her dad Jeff Bridges.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My dad came from a family of actors. His father, Lloyd, was an actor. His mother, Dorothy, was an actor. His brother Beau is an actor, too. He knows firsthand how weird and challenging it could be to have an actor as a parent, which means he is very good at being a famous actor father.</p> <p>When I was growing up, my dad was really hitting his stride. He made many of his greatest films, from <em>The Fabulous Baker Boys</em> to <em>The Fisher King</em> to <em>Fearless</em>, before I was 10 years old. He was often away shooting for weeks at a time, leaving my mother to look after me and my two sisters. She likes to say she takes care of the empire \u2013 and she does.</p> <p>But when my dad was at home, it was like having the greatest, most imaginative friend in the world. What makes him such a wonderful actor is the same thing that makes him a wonderful playmate: he\u2019s a great pretender. He relished opening up his rich inner life to share with me and my sisters, and he was always happy to be part of ours, too. My sisters and I loved to dress him up, put flowers in his hair \u2013 he\u2019s always had a nice head of hair \u2013 and decorate his face with makeup. When Dad was around, we\u2019d draw or paint or just play pretend for hours. He has such a playful spirit. The only time he ever brought his work home with him was the day he returned from shooting Blown Away still in makeup, his face appearing all bloodied and bruised. I think he wanted to scare us, but we just loved peeling off the stretchy plastic fake blood from his face. It was really satisfying.</p> <p>But, of course, he couldn\u2019t always be at home. When he was away, Dad made sure we stayed connected. He\u2019d call every night. He\u2019d say something like, \u201cIsabelle, when you\u2019re asleep tonight, you\u2019ll see a building. Go through the front door and climb up to the attic. What do you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see the branch of an oak tree by the window,\u201d I\u2019d reply. Then he\u2019d ask, \u201cDo you see the tree house nestled in the crook of the branch?\u201d I\u2019d laugh and say I did. \u201cLet\u2019s meet there tonight,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll jump on our horses and ride to the mountains.\u201d \u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d he\u2019d say. In the morning, he\u2019d call again, and we\u2019d go over the adventures we\u2019d had in our dreams the night before.</p> <p>I always knew my father was loving and sweet and playful, but it\u2019s still funny to me that he\u2019s become so closely identified with the Dude. By the time <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/the-big-lebowski-review-the-dude-jeff-bridges-coen-brothers\">The Big Lebowski</a></em> came out, I was in high school, and, just like a typical teenager, I had zero interest in my father\u2019s work. (I still haven\u2019t seen some of his films from that period.) What I remember most is that around that time, we were on vacation in Hawaii, and my dad was wearing those hideous Sun Jellies from the movie. They\u2019re one of the most well-known parts of his costume, but they were actually my dad\u2019s own shoes. Anyway, my sister and I were so embarrassed by those godawful jellies, we threw them into the ocean. Today, they\u2019d probably be worth a lot of money.</p> <p>Another funny thing about people conflating Dad with the Dude is that he\u2019s not really a laid-back guy. He gets anxious. He experiences stress. Before he goes onstage, he always says he doesn\u2019t want to do it, and afterward, he is critical of himself. Though he describes himself as \u201cBuddhish\u201d, he doesn\u2019t project Zen calm. He is, however, extremely present. Even more so now that he\u2019s older and a grandfather. I have two kids of my own, and he is very focused on being in their lives. We live in Oakland, but he and my mom visit often. And when he\u2019s not able to be with his grandkids, he calls to plan dream meetings with them, too.</p> <p><em>Daddy Daughter Day by Isabelle Bridges Boesch and Jeff Bridges (Penguin Random House) is due to be published in October</em></p> <h2>Samuel L Jackson <em>by Zoe Jackson</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c54b7c4d4bc823f3091e7cca1dea64cbd5158fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c54b7c4d4bc823f3091e7cca1dea64cbd5158fe/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel L.

He is completely different from his cool-guy persona. When I was 10 we would go to the comic store every week religiously. They even kept a pull box for my dad (the store pulls the new comics on a customer\u2019s list and keeps them behind the counter). Dad\u2019s pull box was full of weird and really violent comics that I wasn\u2019t allowed to read. He and I didn\u2019t start exchanging comic books until I got to college, and when I was there, whenever I went to the comic book store alone, I was sad. I wanted my dad to be there.</p> <p>Though I was largely shielded from it at as a child, my dad was struggling with addiction during much of my childhood. When I was eight, he entered rehab. He was gone for 60 days, which was a confusing time for me. I had no idea anything was wrong. I never saw him drunk that I know of. I just thought he was a dude who slept a lot.</p> <p>We moved to Los Angeles for my mum, LaTanya Richardson: she got a role in a shortlived TV series. But soon my dad\u2019s career really took off, and my mum stopped working as much to take care of me. It\u2019s funny that my father is the better-known actor, because my mum was the one who pushed him to act in the first place. They met in a teacher\u2019s office (They went to different colleges but the teacher taught at both places.) Mum was doing some makeup work. She said, \u201cYou need to be in my play. Do you act?\u201d Dad said, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t,\u201d and my mum replied, \u201cWell, you do now.\u201d And that\u2019s how it went, and how it has gone ever since. My mum turns the key and sends Dad out into the world.</p> <p>I do think it was very hard for my mum to give up her career to raise me for as long as she did, though. She\u2019s happy for my dad, of course, but it\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s a sadness there.</p> <p>I was 12 years old when <em>Pulp Fiction</em> came out. After that, my dad became cool. Or, he thought he did. And though much of the world agrees, he\u2019s still just a big nerd to me. He goes through phases. Once, he gave me a sweatshirt he got from working on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/17/django-unchained-review\">Django Unchained</a></em>. He said, \u201cI signed it for you!\u201d I was like, \u201cDad, thanks. Now I can\u2019t wear it!\u201d It\u2019s up to my mum and me to pull him back down to earth.

He named me after Ethan Edwards, his character in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-searchers\" title=\"\">The Searchers</a></em>, which many consider to be his best role. </p> <p>My father was tough, but very loving. He was old school. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. He didn\u2019t talk much, but he could make his few words very, very impactful and meaningful. Other actors fight for lines; my dad tried to remove as many words as possible. His friends called him Duke, his childhood nickname. It was the name of his dog, an Airedale. Dad used to deliver papers with Duke. The local firemen called the pair Big Duke and Little Duke. The name stuck. He told me, \u201cNow when someone calls me John, I don\u2019t even turn my head.\u201d</p> <p>In his free time, his life was centred on the ocean. We had a converted Second World War minesweeper called Wild Goose and every summer, we would sail up to British Columbia and Alaska. Every winter, we would take it down to Mexico.</p> <p>When he wasn\u2019t on the boat, Dad was working. So I was raised on movie sets. They were rugged in those days. Our family would stay either in a small rented house or in a little motel. I had a tutor three hours a day, but I learned a lot from my father, too. He never told me \u201cdo this\u201d or \u201cdo that\u201d, but led by example. You never wanted to disappoint him. </p> <p>Once when we were at a friend\u2019s ranch, he asked me to drive to the house in an old pick-up truck and grab some things for him. I was 12. I got the truck stuck and I had to go tell him. He was in the middle of a card game. He didn\u2019t get up or offer to help. It was clear that I was expected to figure out how to get the truck out on my own.</p> <p>Some of my proudest moments came from living up to my father\u2019s straight-ahead toughness. When we were in Cabo or La Paz, Mexico, we\u2019d anchor the boat far from the shore and swim in. It was about a 25-minute swim. I remember once, when I was seven or eight, swimming into a bunch of sea snakes and saying, \u201cHoly crap. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/24/snorkelling-grandmothers-uncover-large-population-of-venomous-sea-snakes-in-noumea\" title=\"\">sea snakes</a> here, Dad!\u201d He replied, \u201cYeah, just keep swimming, kid.\u201d</p> <p>Once we made it to shore, we walked around until our clothes dried. He gave me a big hug and said, \u201cGood job, Big Stuff.\u201d I was just so proud to have made it through, proud to be my father\u2019s son.</p> <p>My father died on 11 June 1979. I was 17. At the time, it was just him and me alone in the house; my mother had moved out. That day, he said he wasn\u2019t feeling well, so I drove him to the hospital. As we pulled up, there was a crowd of photographers waiting for him so we had to go through the back. I was worried, but I was also a naive teenager and thought he was going to be OK. He just always got through things. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but that was the last ride I would ever take with my dad.</p> <p><em>Ethan Wayne is the chairman of the <a href=\"https://johnwayne.org/\" title=\"\">John Wayne Cancer Foundation</a> and president of <a href=\"https://www.johnwayne.com/\" title=\"\">John Wayne Enterprises</a></em></p> <h2>Miles Davis <em>by Erin Davis</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a95b407e9c640e9c1fc17622582223e7657971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a95b407e9c640e9c1fc17622582223e7657971/0_58_612_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Davis with son Erin.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Play on: Miles Davis with son Erin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Erin Davis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People think of my dad as the prince of darkness (the name of his 1967 album), a moody performer who turned his back on the audience out of disregard for them. That wasn\u2019t him at all. But this wasn\u2019t something I truly realised until I stood onstage with him as part of his legendary band: Dad wasn\u2019t turning away from the audience; he was turning toward the band. It wasn\u2019t a sign of disrespect for those there to hear him; it was a sign of respect for those there to play. And I was lucky enough to be there to play.</p> <p>I knew he was a famous musician, but didn\u2019t quite understand how famous. As a kid, I was always telling him I wanted to be a musician. Finally, when I was 14, he asked if I wanted to go on the road with him in the summer. Of course, I said yes.</p> <p>I learned a lot, not only about music, but about my father, during those summer tours. As I stood in the wings, I saw that playing the music live was the most important thing to him. </p> <p>Those tours were the first sustained amount of time I spent with my father. What I discovered about him was how he could break down what was going on in any musical performance \u2013 and find something to take away from it. I remember once watching a heavy metal show on MTV, and when Slayer came on, I thought, \u201cDad\u2019s going to hate this.\u201d He watched for a bit and then said, \u201cHuh. That drummer is really laying it down, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Then he just walked away.</p> <p>He finally asked me onstage for a tour in 1990. He was giving me a chance and I was terrified of blowing it. I played electronic percussion, which was a genre my dad kind of invented. I didn\u2019t even get any rehearsals. I watched the guy who did it before me for a couple of shows, then I was just kind of on it, in the seat. It was nerve-racking for me, but at the same time, it felt wonderful to have my father turn toward me, to listen to me and to play with me as an equal.</p> <p><em>Erin Davis, along with his sister and cousin, is an executor of the Miles Davis estate</em></p> <p><em>To Me, He Was Just Dad by Joshua David Stein is published by Artisan at \u00a317.99.

      "bodyText": "John Lennon by Julian Lennon A lot of the happy memories of my father are from the late 1960s at Kenwood, the old Tudor house we had in Surrey, when I was a little boy. Without knowing it, I probably saw some of the greatest musicians in the world come and go through that house. I remember sitting on the roof of that house with my dad making a balsawood aeroplane. There was a great view from up there. As a kid, I thought my dad was pretty happy \u2013 with the family, the family home and his place in the world. Who could have predicted that everything was about to change? The Beatles had just released Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band. At the time, my dad had his famous psychedelic Rolls-Royce Phantom V, which I adored because it had a record player in the back. We also had a Honda Monkey bike, a mini motorcycle we used to ride around on. Ringo [Starr] lived down the road and my dad would take me to see him on the bike. At Kenwood, my father and I were close. So close, in fact, that though my first name is also John, I started to get called Julian or Jules since when my mum would shout, \u201cJohn, your dinner\u2019s ready!\u201d both my dad and I would react. Then suddenly my dad literally disappeared off the face of the planet. At least, that\u2019s how it seemed to me. He and Yoko Ono were deeply and publicly in love. And I felt as if my mum and I had been cast aside. Not everyone forgot about us, though. Paul wrote Hey Jules after dropping in to check how my mum and I were doing. (Obviously, the title of the song changed to Hey Jude). Maybe 10 years passed during which my dad and I barely spoke. I was very angry about how he left the family. It was thanks to my mum that we started having conversations again. She was such a gentle soul, never vindictive in any way, shape or form. She always wanted me to have a relationship with him. I was scared the first time I went to visit him in the US after my parents\u2019 divorce. I was becoming more aware of the magnitude of this man. Much to my relief, the visit was a success. My dad was charming and funny and warm. From that trip on, I remember us getting along better. I hesitated to enter the music business because of who Dad was. I would send him the odd cassette of me playing live, or song ideas I had recorded on a little Sony Walkman he had given me. He warmly encouraged me to continue playing, but sadly, he never really got to see my career unfold, as he passed when I was just 17. When I did finally become a professional musician a few years later, I felt like I understood him better. I try to remember my dad as fondly as possible. I strive for forgiveness and understanding in that area of my life, for the difficult times he put my mum and me through. I loved her more than anything and can\u2019t forget how poorly he treated her. But our relationship was getting better before he died. He was in a happier place. He wanted to reconnect, not just with me but with the rest of his family. He never got a chance to do so. Even now, almost 40 years after he died, I hold my father\u2019s memory dear. Julian Lennon is a musician and photographer and the founder of the White Feather Foundation Caitlyn Jenner by Brandon Jenner My father spent the first 65 years of her life trying to avoid answering the question \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And because of that, she didn\u2019t ask it often, either. And, though, I understand that she avoided the question because the answer would have laid bare too many struggles, it made my relationship with her challenging. People connect with each other through vulnerability, and you can only get someone to open up to you if you are willing to be vulnerable yourself. Because she was shielding something so important from herself, Dad remained distant for much of my life. I don\u2019t have many memories from before my parents split up and my father moved out. I was four at the time. They got divorced because my dad had decided to start transitioning to female. I, of course, was too young then to have any idea what was behind their decision. I do, however, remember a few details from my early childhood that only made sense much later. For instance, when I was very young, I used to love to fiddle with people\u2019s ears. Once when I reached out to touch my dad\u2019s ears, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t do that. I just had surgery.\u201d He pointed to a thin line of small black stitches behind his ear, grinned, and said: \u201cThey took my ear off, peeled my face back, and then stitched it back on.\u201d For the first few years after their divorce, my parents were amicable. Mom started dating David Foster, whom she later married. I never called him dad, but he was the one who lived with us, who told me to pick up my clothes and turn off the lights \u2013 all the typical dad things. So even though this is about Caitlyn, I could write just as easily about David. He was a wonderful father figure. A few years after my parents divorced, Dad apparently decided that it wasn\u2019t the right time to transition and had many of his surgeries reversed. After that, his relationship with my mother grew more hostile. She had worked hard to accept that the reason he couldn\u2019t be with her was because he was working towards transitioning. When he started dating Kris Jenner, whom he would go on to marry, that line of reasoning fell apart. It was tremendously painful. The effect of my parents\u2019 souring relationship was that I didn\u2019t see my father more than half a dozen times between ages eight and 25. Because of this, most of the memories I have of my dad are from the narrow slice of time before I was eight. I remember him betting my brother Brody and me $20 that he could beat us to the top of these insanely high giant sand dunes in Malibu and then just smoking us. He ran a flat-out decathlete sprint. He didn\u2019t even pretend to let us win. After Dad met and married Kris, family became a business for him, and I stayed away for most of my teenage years. I didn\u2019t want to be a part of their dynamic. When I was in my 20s and his daughters with Kris \u2013 Kendall and Kylie \u2013 were teenagers, Dad and I began to re-establish a relationship. He wasn\u2019t as needed around the house and, I think, was looking for someone to talk to. Although, to be honest, instead of talking, we did things. We worked on my car or flew radio-controlled planes in the park near his house. But even then, it always seemed Dad had his guard up. Once he decided to go through with the transition, I was the first of her children she confided in. As soon as Dad said it herself, I was so happy for her. As her son, I wish my dad had been able to transition sooner, not only because I think she would have been happier, but because I think we could have built a stronger relationship earlier. Now, I\u2019m making up for lost time. I speak to my dad almost every day, and every time, she asks me, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Brandon Jenner is a singer and songwriter Jeff Bridges by Isabelle Bridges Boesch My dad came from a family of actors. His father, Lloyd, was an actor. His mother, Dorothy, was an actor. His brother Beau is an actor, too. He knows firsthand how weird and challenging it could be to have an actor as a parent, which means he is very good at being a famous actor father. When I was growing up, my dad was really hitting his stride. He made many of his greatest films, from The Fabulous Baker Boys to The Fisher King to Fearless, before I was 10 years old. He was often away shooting for weeks at a time, leaving my mother to look after me and my two sisters. She likes to say she takes care of the empire \u2013 and she does. But when my dad was at home, it was like having the greatest, most imaginative friend in the world. What makes him such a wonderful actor is the same thing that makes him a wonderful playmate: he\u2019s a great pretender. He relished opening up his rich inner life to share with me and my sisters, and he was always happy to be part of ours, too. My sisters and I loved to dress him up, put flowers in his hair \u2013 he\u2019s always had a nice head of hair \u2013 and decorate his face with makeup. When Dad was around, we\u2019d draw or paint or just play pretend for hours. He has such a playful spirit. The only time he ever brought his work home with him was the day he returned from shooting Blown Away still in makeup, his face appearing all bloodied and bruised. I think he wanted to scare us, but we just loved peeling off the stretchy plastic fake blood from his face. It was really satisfying. But, of course, he couldn\u2019t always be at home. When he was away, Dad made sure we stayed connected. He\u2019d call every night. He\u2019d say something like, \u201cIsabelle, when you\u2019re asleep tonight, you\u2019ll see a building. Go through the front door and climb up to the attic. What do you see?\u201d \u201cI see the branch of an oak tree by the window,\u201d I\u2019d reply. Then he\u2019d ask, \u201cDo you see the tree house nestled in the crook of the branch?\u201d I\u2019d laugh and say I did. \u201cLet\u2019s meet there tonight,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll jump on our horses and ride to the mountains.\u201d \u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d he\u2019d say. In the morning, he\u2019d call again, and we\u2019d go over the adventures we\u2019d had in our dreams the night before. I always knew my father was loving and sweet and playful, but it\u2019s still funny to me that he\u2019s become so closely identified with the Dude. By the time The Big Lebowski came out, I was in high school, and, just like a typical teenager, I had zero interest in my father\u2019s work. (I still haven\u2019t seen some of his films from that period.) What I remember most is that around that time, we were on vacation in Hawaii, and my dad was wearing those hideous Sun Jellies from the movie. They\u2019re one of the most well-known parts of his costume, but they were actually my dad\u2019s own shoes. Anyway, my sister and I were so embarrassed by those godawful jellies, we threw them into the ocean. Today, they\u2019d probably be worth a lot of money. Another funny thing about people conflating Dad with the Dude is that he\u2019s not really a laid-back guy. He gets anxious. He experiences stress. Before he goes onstage, he always says he doesn\u2019t want to do it, and afterward, he is critical of himself. Though he describes himself as \u201cBuddhish\u201d, he doesn\u2019t project Zen calm. He is, however, extremely present. Even more so now that he\u2019s older and a grandfather. I have two kids of my own, and he is very focused on being in their lives. We live in Oakland, but he and my mom visit often. And when he\u2019s not able to be with his grandkids, he calls to plan dream meetings with them, too. Daddy Daughter Day by Isabelle Bridges Boesch and Jeff Bridges (Penguin Random House) is due to be published in October Samuel L Jackson by Zoe Jackson My father is a big nerd, in the best way possible. He is completely different from his cool-guy persona. When I was 10 we would go to the comic store every week religiously. They even kept a pull box for my dad (the store pulls the new comics on a customer\u2019s list and keeps them behind the counter). Dad\u2019s pull box was full of weird and really violent comics that I wasn\u2019t allowed to read. He and I didn\u2019t start exchanging comic books until I got to college, and when I was there, whenever I went to the comic book store alone, I was sad. I wanted my dad to be there. Though I was largely shielded from it at as a child, my dad was struggling with addiction during much of my childhood. When I was eight, he entered rehab. He was gone for 60 days, which was a confusing time for me. I had no idea anything was wrong. I never saw him drunk that I know of. I just thought he was a dude who slept a lot. We moved to Los Angeles for my mum, LaTanya Richardson: she got a role in a shortlived TV series. But soon my dad\u2019s career really took off, and my mum stopped working as much to take care of me. It\u2019s funny that my father is the better-known actor, because my mum was the one who pushed him to act in the first place. They met in a teacher\u2019s office (They went to different colleges but the teacher taught at both places.) Mum was doing some makeup work. She said, \u201cYou need to be in my play. Do you act?\u201d Dad said, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t,\u201d and my mum replied, \u201cWell, you do now.\u201d And that\u2019s how it went, and how it has gone ever since. My mum turns the key and sends Dad out into the world. I do think it was very hard for my mum to give up her career to raise me for as long as she did, though. She\u2019s happy for my dad, of course, but it\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s a sadness there. I was 12 years old when Pulp Fiction came out. After that, my dad became cool. Or, he thought he did. And though much of the world agrees, he\u2019s still just a big nerd to me. He goes through phases. Once, he gave me a sweatshirt he got from working on Django Unchained. He said, \u201cI signed it for you!\u201d I was like, \u201cDad, thanks. Now I can\u2019t wear it!\u201d It\u2019s up to my mum and me to pull him back down to earth. I mean, isn\u2019t that what family\u2019s for? Zoe Jackson is an Emmy Award\u2013nominated television producer and director John Wayne by Ethan Wayne I was born in 1962, at the height of my father\u2019s career. He named me after Ethan Edwards, his character in The Searchers, which many consider to be his best role. My father was tough, but very loving. He was old school. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. He didn\u2019t talk much, but he could make his few words very, very impactful and meaningful. Other actors fight for lines; my dad tried to remove as many words as possible. His friends called him Duke, his childhood nickname. It was the name of his dog, an Airedale. Dad used to deliver papers with Duke. The local firemen called the pair Big Duke and Little Duke. The name stuck. He told me, \u201cNow when someone calls me John, I don\u2019t even turn my head.\u201d In his free time, his life was centred on the ocean. We had a converted Second World War minesweeper called Wild Goose and every summer, we would sail up to British Columbia and Alaska. Every winter, we would take it down to Mexico. When he wasn\u2019t on the boat, Dad was working. So I was raised on movie sets. They were rugged in those days. Our family would stay either in a small rented house or in a little motel. I had a tutor three hours a day, but I learned a lot from my father, too. He never told me \u201cdo this\u201d or \u201cdo that\u201d, but led by example. You never wanted to disappoint him. Once when we were at a friend\u2019s ranch, he asked me to drive to the house in an old pick-up truck and grab some things for him. I was 12. I got the truck stuck and I had to go tell him. He was in the middle of a card game. He didn\u2019t get up or offer to help. It was clear that I was expected to figure out how to get the truck out on my own. Some of my proudest moments came from living up to my father\u2019s straight-ahead toughness. When we were in Cabo or La Paz, Mexico, we\u2019d anchor the boat far from the shore and swim in. It was about a 25-minute swim. I remember once, when I was seven or eight, swimming into a bunch of sea snakes and saying, \u201cHoly crap. There are sea snakes here, Dad!\u201d He replied, \u201cYeah, just keep swimming, kid.\u201d Once we made it to shore, we walked around until our clothes dried. He gave me a big hug and said, \u201cGood job, Big Stuff.\u201d I was just so proud to have made it through, proud to be my father\u2019s son. My father died on 11 June 1979. I was 17. At the time, it was just him and me alone in the house; my mother had moved out. That day, he said he wasn\u2019t feeling well, so I drove him to the hospital. As we pulled up, there was a crowd of photographers waiting for him so we had to go through the back. I was worried, but I was also a naive teenager and thought he was going to be OK. He just always got through things. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but that was the last ride I would ever take with my dad. Ethan Wayne is the chairman of the John Wayne Cancer Foundation and president of John Wayne Enterprises Miles Davis by Erin Davis People think of my dad as the prince of darkness (the name of his 1967 album), a moody performer who turned his back on the audience out of disregard for them. That wasn\u2019t him at all. But this wasn\u2019t something I truly realised until I stood onstage with him as part of his legendary band: Dad wasn\u2019t turning away from the audience; he was turning toward the band. It wasn\u2019t a sign of disrespect for those there to hear him; it was a sign of respect for those there to play. And I was lucky enough to be there to play. I knew he was a famous musician, but didn\u2019t quite understand how famous. As a kid, I was always telling him I wanted to be a musician. Finally, when I was 14, he asked if I wanted to go on the road with him in the summer. Of course, I said yes. I learned a lot, not only about music, but about my father, during those summer tours. As I stood in the wings, I saw that playing the music live was the most important thing to him. Those tours were the first sustained amount of time I spent with my father. What I discovered about him was how he could break down what was going on in any musical performance \u2013 and find something to take away from it. I remember once watching a heavy metal show on MTV, and when Slayer came on, I thought, \u201cDad\u2019s going to hate this.\u201d He watched for a bit and then said, \u201cHuh. That drummer is really laying it down, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Then he just walked away. He finally asked me onstage for a tour in 1990. He was giving me a chance and I was terrified of blowing it. I played electronic percussion, which was a genre my dad kind of invented. I didn\u2019t even get any rehearsals. I watched the guy who did it before me for a couple of shows, then I was just kind of on it, in the seat. It was nerve-racking for me, but at the same time, it felt wonderful to have my father turn toward me, to listen to me and to play with me as an equal.

      "body": "<p>Sure to be the boldest debut of the year, <em>How Much of These Hills </em><em>Is Gold</em> by American writer C Pam Zhang grapples with the legend of the wild west and mines brilliant new gems from a well-worn setting. Its protagonists are neither cocky white cowboys nor Native Americans but two destitute children of Chinese descent, struggling to survive after the deaths of their impoverished parents. The novel begins as a quest as they try to find the means to bury their father, but extends into an excavation of their family history as well as an account of their development as growing adolescents.</p> <p>The story is heavy with layers of trauma, starting with the grim humour of the children, Lucy and Sam, dragging around their own father\u2019s rotting corpse. It is a stirring setting in which nothing is ever truly safe or comfortable, not even the plain air, which is so hot it \u201cshivers, as if trying to lift off\u201d. Alongside Sam and Lucy\u2019s family story are the stories of the genocide and persecution of Native Americans, the colonisation of the west and the compulsive exploitation of the land by desperate settlers and greedy opportunists. It is a world so physically and morally rough that the young protagonists fetishise tiny details that represent beauty and purity, such as when Lucy notices a girl whose \u201cembroidered white dress\u2026 puffs from her tiny waist\u201d.</p> <p>On the one hand, the novel is in close touch with the entire tradition of wild west mythology and film and many of its surface details and set dressing are highly familiar. Buffalo and jackal lore, narrow-eyed untrustworthy locals, one-horse towns, wheeling birds of prey and sun-baked dust clog the prose with misery and menace. At the same time, the story feels completely original, flushed through with new and unexpected perspectives. Through Zhang\u2019s deep attention, the classic western is given a rich new shading as race, gender, sexual identity, poverty and pubescence come into play. The novel is thick with detail, metaphor and oblique allusion \u2013 so much so that the story has to fight through the language. But at its core is a chilling sense of the utter loneliness and isolation felt by Lucy and Sam.</p> <p><em>How Much of These Hills Is Gold</em> is an impressive debut. Though sometimes weighed down by the sheer heft of its language and atmospherics, it rewards patient reading. The prose carries an airless, uniquely pungent flavour. By the end, it has built into an epic, powerfully wrought journey, and it is refreshing to discover a new author of such grand scale, singular focus and blistering vision.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>How Much of These Hills Is Gold</em> by C Pam Zhang is published by Virago (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "Sure to be the boldest debut of the year, How Much of These Hills Is Gold by American writer C Pam Zhang grapples with the legend of the wild west and mines brilliant new gems from a well-worn setting. Its protagonists are neither cocky white cowboys nor Native Americans but two destitute children of Chinese descent, struggling to survive after the deaths of their impoverished parents. The novel begins as a quest as they try to find the means to bury their father, but extends into an excavation of their family history as well as an account of their development as growing adolescents. The story is heavy with layers of trauma, starting with the grim humour of the children, Lucy and Sam, dragging around their own father\u2019s rotting corpse. It is a stirring setting in which nothing is ever truly safe or comfortable, not even the plain air, which is so hot it \u201cshivers, as if trying to lift off\u201d. Alongside Sam and Lucy\u2019s family story are the stories of the genocide and persecution of Native Americans, the colonisation of the west and the compulsive exploitation of the land by desperate settlers and greedy opportunists. It is a world so physically and morally rough that the young protagonists fetishise tiny details that represent beauty and purity, such as when Lucy notices a girl whose \u201cembroidered white dress\u2026 puffs from her tiny waist\u201d. On the one hand, the novel is in close touch with the entire tradition of wild west mythology and film and many of its surface details and set dressing are highly familiar. Buffalo and jackal lore, narrow-eyed untrustworthy locals, one-horse towns, wheeling birds of prey and sun-baked dust clog the prose with misery and menace. At the same time, the story feels completely original, flushed through with new and unexpected perspectives. Through Zhang\u2019s deep attention, the classic western is given a rich new shading as race, gender, sexual identity, poverty and pubescence come into play. The novel is thick with detail, metaphor and oblique allusion \u2013 so much so that the story has to fight through the language. But at its core is a chilling sense of the utter loneliness and isolation felt by Lucy and Sam. How Much of These Hills Is Gold is an impressive debut. Though sometimes weighed down by the sheer heft of its language and atmospherics, it rewards patient reading. The prose carries an airless, uniquely pungent flavour. By the end, it has built into an epic, powerfully wrought journey, and it is refreshing to discover a new author of such grand scale, singular focus and blistering vision. \u2022 How Much of These Hills Is Gold by C Pam Zhang is published by Virago (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of doctors have said they are less likely to return to the frontline or increase their hours to fight Covid-19 because they fear their families will not be properly compensated if they die, the Guardian has learned. Doctors who are no longer eligible for full death-in-service benefits have complained to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that their families will be left not only grieving but in financial difficulty if they succumb to the virus. Dozens have said the concern has stopped them from shifting their hours and working patterns to help in the NHS battle against the outbreak. More than 350 respondents to a survey by the Doctors\u2019 Association UK (DAUK), a grassroots medics group, said loss of death-in-service benefits made them less likely to work in high-risk areas, increase their hours or return to service. Forty people responding to the survey indicated they had declined to change their hours and working patterns as a result of a lack of death-in-service benefit, which is typically worth more than two year\u2019s pay. Ten days ago Hancock called on more than 65,000 former NHS nurses and doctors to consider returning to aid \u201ca huge national effort to protect lives and protect our NHS\u201d. Thousands responded positively. Last week he said 2,660 doctors were among almost 12,000 recently retired NHS staff who were returning. The health secretary, who is isolating with \u201cmild\u201d symptoms of coronavirus, also announced a deal with the private sector to supply 700 additional doctors. But others are reluctant and say that if the death-in-service arrangements were changed they would feel more comfortable about coming back. The British Medical Association (BMA) has also raised the issue, and it could affect serving doctors who have opted out of the NHS pension scheme. At the weekend Adil El Tayar, 63, became the first known working NHS surgeon to succumb to coronavirus. He died on Wednesday at West Middlesex university hospital in London, his family said. He had been volunteering in A&amp;E departments in the Midlands.

      "body": "<p>The UK\u2019s biological security strategy, published in 2018 to address the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented, according to a former government chief scientific adviser.</p> <p>Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, said a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled.</p> <p>The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government. However, a 2019 parliamentary inquiry into biological security was postponed and then cancelled because MPs were focused on Brexit and then the December general election.</p> <p>Boyd said the government was aware of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/644968/UK_National_Risk_Register_2017.pdf\">many risks</a> with low likelihoods but potentially very high impacts on the nation, such as pandemics, severe storms and power blackouts. But he said these were assessed independently from one another, underplaying the total risk, which itself was rising due to climate change, population growth and the globalisation of travel.</p> <p>Looked at alone, a pandemic had appeared unlikely, he said. \u201cAs a result, getting sufficient resource just to write a decent biosecurity strategy was tough. Getting resource to properly underpin implementation of what it said was impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Boyd added: \u201cThe middle of a crisis may not be the best time to suggest why we should learn lessons \u2026 But many people are more likely to listen now. Certainly, nothing should distract us from getting ahead of Covid-19.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s biological security strategy, published in 2018 to address the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented, according to a former government chief scientific adviser. Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, said a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled. The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government. However, a 2019 parliamentary inquiry into biological security was postponed and then cancelled because MPs were focused on Brexit and then the December general election. Boyd said the government was aware of many risks with low likelihoods but potentially very high impacts on the nation, such as pandemics, severe storms and power blackouts. But he said these were assessed independently from one another, underplaying the total risk, which itself was rising due to climate change, population growth and the globalisation of travel. Looked at alone, a pandemic had appeared unlikely, he said. \u201cAs a result, getting sufficient resource just to write a decent biosecurity strategy was tough. Getting resource to properly underpin implementation of what it said was impossible.\u201d Boyd added: \u201cThe middle of a crisis may not be the best time to suggest why we should learn lessons \u2026 But many people are more likely to listen now. Certainly, nothing should distract us from getting ahead of Covid-19. My concern is that we should come out of this much wiser.\u201d The NHS is reported to have failed a government test of its ability to handle a pandemic, though the finding were not made public. Exercise Cygnus, a three-day dry run for a pandemic carried out in October 2016, examined how hospitals and other services would cope in a flu outbreak with a similar mortality rate to coronavirus. According to the Sunday Telegraph, ministers were told three years ago that Britain would be overwhelmed, suffering a lack of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment. Boyd said politicians found it tough to deliver large-scale preventive policies to a public unconcerned about major risks. \u201c[They] often talk the talk but find it hard to walk the walk of the changes needed. As they are currently structured, governments are hopelessly underpowered to implement the about-turn needed on policy.\u201d The 2018 biological security strategy, the UK\u2019s first, stated: \u201cThe UK is globally renowned for the quality of our preparedness planning [for] significant biological risks.\u201d It noted that the UK spends hundreds of millions of pounds a year on the issue. \u201cHowever, these efforts have not always been as well coordinated as they could have been and we have sometimes failed to approach these issues with an international as well as a domestic perspective,\u201d it said. As a result, \u201cwe may also fail to maximise the impact of our activities or to tackle issues as quickly as we need to\u201d. The strategy said the UK maintained \u201cappropriate stockpiles of clinical countermeasures for diseases of concern\u201d, made it a priority \u201cto protect first responders through ensuring that they are equipped and trained properly\u201d and had \u201ca strong public communications capability to ensure we are able to engage swiftly and clearly with the public about any action they might need to take\u201d. As well as committing to improving government coordination and data sharing, and the communication of risk to the public, the strategy said: \u201cWe will develop a UK government response plan for major international diseases to ensure that the government is fully prepared to respond as quickly.\u201d The UK was ranked second in the world in 2019 by the Global Health Security (GHS) Index, with the US first.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Fiona Maddocks</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Went to the NME awards at Brixton Academy<br></strong></em>Well, I had my experience of being you, Kitty. It was quite hard. The odd thing was that, once friends knew I was going to the <em>NME</em> awards, after expressing general shock and envy \u2013 everyone has heard of <em>New Musical Express</em>; it\u2019s been going since 1952 \u2013 they all asked only one question: what will you wear? </p> <p>This old chestnut recurs every time newcomers go to classical concerts or opera: do I have to dress up? What\u2019s the code? No one wants to feel silly, an outsider.</p> <p>I invited a knowledgable friend who has been a Mercury prize judge to go with me, thinking she would have all the answers. \u201cWhat do I wear?\u201d came the email back.</p> <p>I dressed as usual. The only addition was my \u201crock\u201d T-shirt \u2013 black, emblazoned with Beethoven\u2019s face and the message \u201cLudwig Lives\u201d. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bthvn2020.de/en/\" title=\"\">his anniversary year</a>, after all. It felt like a talisman\u2026 in fact, as it was so cold inside the Brixton Academy, I kept my coat on for all five hours and no one knew about my subversive garb.</p> <p> Can I just say: at classical concerts no one gives a damn what you wear.</p> <h2><strong>Kitty Empire</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Went to Mahler\u2019s Symphony No 2, Royal Festival Hall<br></strong></em>I did wonder about attire. I think nowadays it\u2019s less about the music on offer than the habitual clientele of the venue hosting the concert. The Festival Hall is quite a modern and democratic space, so dressing down is no scandal, whereas somewhere like the Royal Opera House might have most people rummaging through their drawers searching in vain for some ancestral pearls. One of the first things I learned as an <em>NME</em> freelancer was how to juggle my coat, a notepad, a pen and a full pint of beer while remaining standing up in a heaving throng. Tangentially, there\u2019s a US anthropologist called Wendy Fonarow who wrote <a href=\"https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Wendy-Fonarow/Empire-of-Dirt/15266033\" title=\"\">a book about behaviour at indie gigs</a>. Where you stick your Access All Areas pass says something about you, if I recall correctly. So, were you upstairs? Did you get a view of the moshpit? What did you make of all that, I wonder?</p> <p><strong>FM: </strong>Yes, I was upstairs at Brixton Academy, sitting down. Or standing up when an act came on. The acts were a long way away. It\u2019s disconcerting watching everything on screens. You\u2019ll know there was a ruckus with Slowthai [the rapper was marched off stage after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/13/slowthai-altercation-nme-awards-harass-katherine-ryan\" title=\"\">leering over host Kath</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/13/slowthai-altercation-nme-awards-harass-katherine-ryan\" title=\"\">erine Ryan</a>]. I saw him throw his mic into the moshpit in anger, but after he disappeared in the crowd it was impossible to see what was happening. He\u2019d seemed pretty angry <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B8e0i0OpbWC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=embed_video_watch_again\">from the word go</a>. Standard punk, but maybe there\u2019s more I should have picked up? He was the first number: Deal Wiv It. I was surprised he had his shirt off and trousers down so quickly. It takes a bit longer for a symphony orchestra.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"293a3a4624cbe71267cd930b89a13996b2791237\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/293a3a4624cbe71267cd930b89a13996b2791237/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rapper Slowthai and host Katherine Ryan at the NME awards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rapper Slowthai and host Katherine Ryan at the NME awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>KE: </strong>Ah, antics. Obnoxiousness is baked into the myth of rock\u2019n\u2019roll \u2013 and we\u2019re using \u201crock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d as a shorthand here, and including the punk/grime hybrid of Slowthai. Pop critics \u2013 me included \u2013 routinely tie ourselves in knots, alternately calling out and defending bad behaviour, or uncouth lyrics, or what have you, because \u201crebelliousness\u201d is both the fuel on which much pop music runs, but just as often a proxy for actual unsavouriness. Is an irritant speaking truth to power? Or are they just a misogynistic pillock?</p> <p>The performing arts, as we well know now, actively enables all sorts of outr\u00e9 behaviour. In this case, it sounds like Slowthai behaved like a berk over and above what the Beastie Boys might have called his \u201cLicense To Ill\u201d. I imagine the classical world must have its fair share of bullying and sexism, all papered over by discussions of \u201cgenius\u201d. </p> <p><strong>FM: </strong>How long have you got?</p> <p><strong>KE: </strong>Ha! Well, on to my gig. My initial thoughts about the Philharmonia doing Mahler\u2019s second symphony? There was an entire city on stage. 245 people in total. And two harps! It was fascinating enough solely from the point of view of economics \u2013 how on earth does the money work? Like a bumblebee seems too big for its wings, this sort of orchestral piece should be too big to stage. The vastness of the endeavour, so many parts pulling together, conducted by Jakub Hr\u016f\u0161a, a conductor straight out of central casting, was truly impressive. I loved that there were \u201csurprise\u201d brass instruments playing from the circle. The massed voices of the choir had a humbling dynamic range.</p> <p>I had boned up on Mahler, and could apply some basic biographical understanding as to why he was moved to write about death and rebirth. He had lost so many loved ones. Then there was the intriguing fact of his Jewish heritage, and a Catholic conversion that, it seems, was the cost of doing business in 19th-century Europe. So I was wondering about the religiosity of the piece, which actually felt almost modern, in that it seemed to be about the human spirit rather than just your basic fealty to God.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f5529e9aabbafe991ed8c7e8d64f3277423ffbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f5529e9aabbafe991ed8c7e8d64f3277423ffbe/0_295_9504_5702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jakub Hr\u016f\u0161a, \u2018a conductor straight from central casting\u2019, leads Mahler\u2019s Second Symphony at the Royal Festival Hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jakub Hr\u016f\u0161a, \u2018a conductor straight from central casting\u2019, leads Mahler\u2019s Second Symphony at the Royal Festival Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>FM: </strong>Only two harps? Never enough. You should try some Wagner. In the <em>Ring</em> he uses six.</p> <p>I\u2019m interested in how you found the whole business of sitting still in such a concentrated fashion? Mahler\u2019s Second is about as big as it gets: an hour and a half long, in five movements, without a break (except enough for a wriggle between movements). It\u2019s epic in reach, as you say. How do you write in depth about something on that scale where all that counts is the sound \u2013 the hardest thing to find words for? I\u2019m still working that one out.</p> <p>Most pop and rock tracks last a few minutes. Singing along, at least in the case of the <em>NME</em> gig\u2019s star act <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-1975\" title=\"\">the 1975</a> (winners of best British band, and my new passion) is actively encouraged. You\u2019d be escorted out in a symphony concert. Both have their place. I loved the atmosphere, but it\u2019s no more or less real than the intense silence of an audience listening to Mahler.</p> <p><strong>KE: </strong>Glad you liked the 1975, they are very clever boys. Sitting still for hours is not a problem. Being immersed and focused on the music at hand is a huge plus whether at classical or other sit-down gigs, or concerts where phones are locked away in Faraday pouches; clubbing, too, can be intense communion. I particularly loved how quiet a massive orchestra and a sold-out audience could be. You and I went to very different things, over and above the differences in our genres: one epic classical thing, one awards ceremony where the turnover and synapse-burn was even higher than usual.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"975ba8c35571a4793105cf63814b568e9df72de3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/975ba8c35571a4793105cf63814b568e9df72de3/0_333_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FKA twigs performs at the NME awards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FKA twigs performs at the NME awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>FM: </strong>Yes, what I particularly noticed at my gig was that it\u2019s the act, rather than the performance, that matters. <a href=\"https://www.yungbludofficial.com/\" title=\"\">Yungblud</a>, who won the best video award, stomped around during his track, all high energy and aggro in mini yellow tartan kilt. It was fantastically noisy, everyone had a great time, just because he was there. I couldn\u2019t judge how well he was singing, but that wasn\u2019t the point. Maybe not surprisingly, I found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fka-twigs\" title=\"\">FKA </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fka-twigs\" title=\"\">twigs</a> easier \u2013 she had an amplified piano and cello playing behind her for the track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84\" title=\"\">Cellophane</a> and the colours and breaks in her voice are immediately audible, part of the music. Her whole act looked as fabulous as opera.</p> <p><strong>KE: </strong>As for describing the music, which is, as you say, the very hardest thing, I think you want to identify aspects of the music that your reader will find pertinent, rather than go on and on floridly about what old <em>NME</em> writers might call \u201ccathedrals of sound\u201d. Similarly to you with the pop acts, I struggled with knowing whether the French horns were having a bad night or whether the oboe was on point. I particularly enjoyed the mezzo soprano, but I just personally like that bit of the sung spectrum. I think in both our fields, we rely on context, whether biographical, or historical, or some stated artistic aim, to frame the discussion of raw sound.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47d3b88f1b7c07d3a8a3f1dba99697bc8b6dfef1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47d3b88f1b7c07d3a8a3f1dba99697bc8b6dfef1/0_634_9504_5702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Philharmonia perform Mahler\u2019s Second at the Royal Festival Hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Philharmonia perform Mahler\u2019s Second at the Royal Festival Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>FM: </strong>Regarding the horn and oboe in the Mahler, you go to the heart of the matter. We could drown in the swirling waters of \u201chistorically informed performance\u201d (engagingly referred to as Hip). What sound did Mahler, on his mountain in upper Austria but working with musicians in Hamburg and Prague, want when he wrote it at the end of the 19th century? Viennese horns were mechanically different from Czech or German. The modern oboe was still coming into being. You don\u2019t need to know any of this to enjoy a performance, but it might explain any rustic strangeness.</p> <p>As far as highlights go, I can trade you a glimpse of Taylor Swift <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gR59Z5eOhk\" title=\"\">looking smart in half a blazer</a> (getting her best solo act in the world award) and AJ Tracey performing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Q40kOt9X0\" title=\"\">Ladbroke Grove</a>.</p> <p><strong>KE: </strong>So, do you feel any closer to pop now you have been dropped into its giddy spin cycle? I hope so. Experiencing Mahler\u2019s Second brought up a welter of thoughts about why we like what we like. Why do people hate jazz? I think it\u2019s because they don\u2019t hear the fracturedness, the urge towards freedom that strains against tidy metre, the boldness otherwise denied to African Americans in the 1920s. They just hear some busker be-bopping out of context in a shopping mall, and want to wrap that saxophone around the nearest lamppost. I have been that person, but grew up some time ago. There\u2019s an American popular song from the 1960s called Do You Hear What I Hear? \u2013 it\u2019s indirectly about the baby Jesus, but the central thought holds.

      "bodyText": "Fiona Maddocks Went to the NME awards at Brixton Academy Well, I had my experience of being you, Kitty. It was quite hard. The odd thing was that, once friends knew I was going to the NME awards, after expressing general shock and envy \u2013 everyone has heard of New Musical Express; it\u2019s been going since 1952 \u2013 they all asked only one question: what will you wear? This old chestnut recurs every time newcomers go to classical concerts or opera: do I have to dress up? What\u2019s the code? No one wants to feel silly, an outsider. I invited a knowledgable friend who has been a Mercury prize judge to go with me, thinking she would have all the answers. \u201cWhat do I wear?\u201d came the email back. I dressed as usual. The only addition was my \u201crock\u201d T-shirt \u2013 black, emblazoned with Beethoven\u2019s face and the message \u201cLudwig Lives\u201d. It\u2019s his anniversary year, after all. It felt like a talisman\u2026 in fact, as it was so cold inside the Brixton Academy, I kept my coat on for all five hours and no one knew about my subversive garb. Can I just say: at classical concerts no one gives a damn what you wear. Kitty Empire Went to Mahler\u2019s Symphony No 2, Royal Festival Hall I did wonder about attire. I think nowadays it\u2019s less about the music on offer than the habitual clientele of the venue hosting the concert. The Festival Hall is quite a modern and democratic space, so dressing down is no scandal, whereas somewhere like the Royal Opera House might have most people rummaging through their drawers searching in vain for some ancestral pearls. One of the first things I learned as an NME freelancer was how to juggle my coat, a notepad, a pen and a full pint of beer while remaining standing up in a heaving throng. Tangentially, there\u2019s a US anthropologist called Wendy Fonarow who wrote a book about behaviour at indie gigs. Where you stick your Access All Areas pass says something about you, if I recall correctly. So, were you upstairs? Did you get a view of the moshpit? What did you make of all that, I wonder? FM: Yes, I was upstairs at Brixton Academy, sitting down. Or standing up when an act came on. The acts were a long way away. It\u2019s disconcerting watching everything on screens. You\u2019ll know there was a ruckus with Slowthai [the rapper was marched off stage after leering over host Katherine Ryan]. I saw him throw his mic into the moshpit in anger, but after he disappeared in the crowd it was impossible to see what was happening. He\u2019d seemed pretty angry from the word go. Standard punk, but maybe there\u2019s more I should have picked up? He was the first number: Deal Wiv It. I was surprised he had his shirt off and trousers down so quickly. It takes a bit longer for a symphony orchestra. KE: Ah, antics. Obnoxiousness is baked into the myth of rock\u2019n\u2019roll \u2013 and we\u2019re using \u201crock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d as a shorthand here, and including the punk/grime hybrid of Slowthai. Pop critics \u2013 me included \u2013 routinely tie ourselves in knots, alternately calling out and defending bad behaviour, or uncouth lyrics, or what have you, because \u201crebelliousness\u201d is both the fuel on which much pop music runs, but just as often a proxy for actual unsavouriness. Is an irritant speaking truth to power? Or are they just a misogynistic pillock? The performing arts, as we well know now, actively enables all sorts of outr\u00e9 behaviour. In this case, it sounds like Slowthai behaved like a berk over and above what the Beastie Boys might have called his \u201cLicense To Ill\u201d. I imagine the classical world must have its fair share of bullying and sexism, all papered over by discussions of \u201cgenius\u201d. FM: How long have you got? KE: Ha! Well, on to my gig. My initial thoughts about the Philharmonia doing Mahler\u2019s second symphony? There was an entire city on stage. 245 people in total. And two harps! It was fascinating enough solely from the point of view of economics \u2013 how on earth does the money work? Like a bumblebee seems too big for its wings, this sort of orchestral piece should be too big to stage. The vastness of the endeavour, so many parts pulling together, conducted by Jakub Hr\u016f\u0161a, a conductor straight out of central casting, was truly impressive. I loved that there were \u201csurprise\u201d brass instruments playing from the circle. The massed voices of the choir had a humbling dynamic range. I had boned up on Mahler, and could apply some basic biographical understanding as to why he was moved to write about death and rebirth. He had lost so many loved ones. Then there was the intriguing fact of his Jewish heritage, and a Catholic conversion that, it seems, was the cost of doing business in 19th-century Europe. So I was wondering about the religiosity of the piece, which actually felt almost modern, in that it seemed to be about the human spirit rather than just your basic fealty to God. FM: Only two harps? Never enough. You should try some Wagner. In the Ring he uses six. I\u2019m interested in how you found the whole business of sitting still in such a concentrated fashion? Mahler\u2019s Second is about as big as it gets: an hour and a half long, in five movements, without a break (except enough for a wriggle between movements). It\u2019s epic in reach, as you say. How do you write in depth about something on that scale where all that counts is the sound \u2013 the hardest thing to find words for? I\u2019m still working that one out. Most pop and rock tracks last a few minutes. Singing along, at least in the case of the NME gig\u2019s star act the 1975 (winners of best British band, and my new passion) is actively encouraged. You\u2019d be escorted out in a symphony concert. Both have their place. I loved the atmosphere, but it\u2019s no more or less real than the intense silence of an audience listening to Mahler. KE: Glad you liked the 1975, they are very clever boys. Sitting still for hours is not a problem. Being immersed and focused on the music at hand is a huge plus whether at classical or other sit-down gigs, or concerts where phones are locked away in Faraday pouches; clubbing, too, can be intense communion. I particularly loved how quiet a massive orchestra and a sold-out audience could be. You and I went to very different things, over and above the differences in our genres: one epic classical thing, one awards ceremony where the turnover and synapse-burn was even higher than usual. FM: Yes, what I particularly noticed at my gig was that it\u2019s the act, rather than the performance, that matters. Yungblud, who won the best video award, stomped around during his track, all high energy and aggro in mini yellow tartan kilt. It was fantastically noisy, everyone had a great time, just because he was there. I couldn\u2019t judge how well he was singing, but that wasn\u2019t the point. Maybe not surprisingly, I found FKA twigs easier \u2013 she had an amplified piano and cello playing behind her for the track Cellophane and the colours and breaks in her voice are immediately audible, part of the music. Her whole act looked as fabulous as opera. KE: As for describing the music, which is, as you say, the very hardest thing, I think you want to identify aspects of the music that your reader will find pertinent, rather than go on and on floridly about what old NME writers might call \u201ccathedrals of sound\u201d. Similarly to you with the pop acts, I struggled with knowing whether the French horns were having a bad night or whether the oboe was on point. I particularly enjoyed the mezzo soprano, but I just personally like that bit of the sung spectrum. I think in both our fields, we rely on context, whether biographical, or historical, or some stated artistic aim, to frame the discussion of raw sound. FM: Regarding the horn and oboe in the Mahler, you go to the heart of the matter. We could drown in the swirling waters of \u201chistorically informed performance\u201d (engagingly referred to as Hip). What sound did Mahler, on his mountain in upper Austria but working with musicians in Hamburg and Prague, want when he wrote it at the end of the 19th century? Viennese horns were mechanically different from Czech or German. The modern oboe was still coming into being. You don\u2019t need to know any of this to enjoy a performance, but it might explain any rustic strangeness. As far as highlights go, I can trade you a glimpse of Taylor Swift looking smart in half a blazer (getting her best solo act in the world award) and AJ Tracey performing Ladbroke Grove. KE: So, do you feel any closer to pop now you have been dropped into its giddy spin cycle? I hope so. Experiencing Mahler\u2019s Second brought up a welter of thoughts about why we like what we like. Why do people hate jazz? I think it\u2019s because they don\u2019t hear the fracturedness, the urge towards freedom that strains against tidy metre, the boldness otherwise denied to African Americans in the 1920s. They just hear some busker be-bopping out of context in a shopping mall, and want to wrap that saxophone around the nearest lamppost. I have been that person, but grew up some time ago. There\u2019s an American popular song from the 1960s called Do You Hear What I Hear? \u2013 it\u2019s indirectly about the baby Jesus, but the central thought holds. A good critic will wear their learning lightly, but build a bridge of words from raw sound to a reader\u2019s brain. FM: Wearing learning lightly \u2013 ah, that\u2019s a minefield. And technical language \u2013 the stuff of sports reports \u2013 is another discussion. Do I write \u201cit modulated into a remote key\u201d or \u201cit sounded strange and moody\u201d?

      "body": "<p>In a family photograph taken by his father in 1903, nine-year-old Jacques Henri Lartigue stands on a path in the Bois de Boulogne, in front of his mother and grandmother. He is grinning mischievously and clutching a beloved Jumelle box camera that had recently been given to him by his father. In the next few years, Jacques will constantly record the world around him, photographing his bedroom, making portraits of uncles and cousins, and framing his older brother, Zissou, as he leaps into the air from a boat.</p> <p>Another 60 years will pass, however, before the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York hosts the first exhibition of his work, belatedly bestowing on Jacques Henri Lartigue the recognition he deserves as one of the great innovators of 20th-century photography.</p> <p>When the celebrated American photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/02/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">Richard Avedon</a> saw Jacques Henri Lartigue\u2019s work for the first time on the eve of the MoMA <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/2563\">show in 1963</a>, he wrote to his compatriot to express his gratitude: \u201cIt was one of the most moving experiences of my life\u2026 You brought me into your world and isn\u2019t that, after all, the purpose of art?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8fd5cd5dd535cdb7e4348d860eaac65b5990ef68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fd5cd5dd535cdb7e4348d860eaac65b5990ef68/0_0_1384_1762/785.jpg\" alt=\"Lartigue\u2019s older brother Zissou in the pool at Rouzat, 1911.\" width=\"785\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lartigue\u2019s older brother Zissou in the pool at Rouzat, 1911.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The world Lartigue created with his camera was a reflection of the one he was brought up in as a privileged, pampered boy in a family environment that was both bourgeois and carefree. His father Henri, a self-made businessman, insisted that neither Jacques nor Zissou attend school, instead recruiting private tutors whose main aim was to keep Henri\u2019s offspring amused. He once said: \u201cI have plenty of money. My children should learn how to spend it.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Lartigue\u2019s name would become synonymous with a certain kind of ritzy glamour and elegance, epitomised in his countless images of his lover, Renee Perle, whose sultry beauty captivated him. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he was known primarily as a society photographer, shooting the rich and beautiful in the resorts along the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, where he felt effortlessly at home. The life he lived seems to have been as gilded as the lifestyles of the film stars, models, socialites and playboys he photographed.</p> <p>In her new book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lartigue.html\">The Boy and the Belle \u00c9poque</a>, </em>Louise Baring concentrates on Lartigue\u2019s childhood and teenage years, the majority of the photographs included having been taken before he turned 18. She traces a formative journey that begins in the early 1900s, when the Lartigue family lived in opulence in Paris and their country retreat in the Auvergne, and continues until 1914, when the outbreak of the first world war signalled the end of the belle \u00e9poque.</p> <p>Lartigue\u2019s life during this period pertains to the arc of a classic French coming-of-age novel. He was an instinctively gifted, voraciously curious prodigy who found his creative medium as a child, and was sustained by it throughout his formative years and into his adult life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e10816ae48017ce8a9b62abfc9b3d35e667affd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e10816ae48017ce8a9b62abfc9b3d35e667affd5/0_0_1831_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simone Roussel, Rouzat, 1913.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lartigue\u2019s cousin Simone Roussel, Rouzat, 1913.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the start, it seems, Lartigue had one eye on posterity, creating photo-albums and journals of the things he witnessed. Aged 11, he photographed his bedroom from ground level, furniture and a mirror looming over his toy racing cars.</p> <p>More often, as the array of model racing cars suggests, he was drawn to movement, and, as a child, often photographed relatives and servants jumping off walls and over tables to his instructions. In one memorable image, he captured his cousin Simone taking a tumble from a homemade scooter. His most intriguing early subject, however, was Zissou, a daredevil and a dandy, who built and raced his own go-karts, tearing around the grounds of Chateau de Rouzat, the family\u2019s country retreat, in goggles and a tailored suit. Zissou was the eccentric action man, while Jacques, as Baring puts it, was \u201ca sensitive child who became a lifelong spectator\u201d.</p> <p>Later, he would photograph speeding racing cars in a blur of motion and beautiful socialite women framed like exotic creatures in closely cropped compositions. When these images were belatedly discovered and exhibited decades later, they attested to Lartigue\u2019s instinctive embrace of what later became known as the snapshot aesthetic, a term loosely applied to 60s iconoclasts such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/15/-sp-garry-winogrand-genius-american-street-photography\">Garry Winogrand</a> and Lee Friedlander, who disregarded the rules of formal composition. Back in the early 1900s, when Lartigue embraced blur and movement, his approach was so singular that it amounted to what Baring calls \u201ca new visual language of the 20th century\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2583594184712ee3d37a83efbd4f35421201be96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2583594184712ee3d37a83efbd4f35421201be96/0_0_4134_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna la Pradvina, Bois de Boulogne, 1911 by Lartigue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna la Pradvina, Bois de Boulogne, 1911.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 29 May 1910, Lartigue, then 15, began a new adventure in a new setting, arriving at the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in Paris with an unwieldy folding plate camera. His aim was \u201cto photograph the ladies in the most outrageous and beautiful hats\u201d. Back then, the Bois de Boulogne in early summer was an open-air promenade, where society women paraded their style. They often crossed paths on the All\u00e9e des Acacias with the more bohemian and even more fashionable women of the Parisian demimonde: actors, dancers, musical hall stars and \u201cgrand cocottes\u201d \u2013 courtesans like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liane_de_Pougy\">Liane de Pougy</a>, a friend of the novelist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colette\">Colette</a>, and \u00c9milienne d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, a great beauty who would later become Edward VII\u2019s lover.</p> <p>Although cold-shouldered in public by respectable members of Parisian high society, these demimondaines, writes Baring, \u201cset the style, deciding which couture creations would rise or fall in the coming season\u201d. Lartigue captured them all, often startling his exotic subjects with the loud click of his camera\u2019s shutter. The results are fascinating, a record of a time and place when this sartorial exhibitionism was simply another diversion in, as Colette scathingly put it, \u201cthe bustling lives of people with nothing to do\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a93409d618715692f65be05fb0e0d9c3db88bef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a93409d618715692f65be05fb0e0d9c3db88bef/0_0_1831_1292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lartigue\u2019s bedroom, 40 Rue Cortambert, 1906.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lartigue\u2019s bedroom, 40 Rue Cortambert, 1906.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At times, Lartigue inevitably comes across as a proto-paparazzo. More often, though, he captures vignettes that speak volumes about the elastic social mores of the belle \u00e9poque. His snatched portraits, for all the period detail they capture, seem, like his previous images of speed and movement, oddly contemporary. The blur, the often fantastical silhouettes, the sideways glances, the way he crops his images so that his subjects loom large \u2013 and even more exotic looking \u2013 in the frame, point to a singular sensibility that was at odds with traditional composition.</p> <p>Throughout this period, his love of speed and movement remained. He photographed the early French pioneers of flight, Gabriel Voisin and Louis Bl\u00e9riot, as they risked life and limb in an aerodrome near Paris. At the 1912 Grand Prix in Dieppe, he made one of his most famous early photographs, freeze-framing the rear of a Delage racing car as it sped past him at close range.

      "bodyText": "In a family photograph taken by his father in 1903, nine-year-old Jacques Henri Lartigue stands on a path in the Bois de Boulogne, in front of his mother and grandmother. He is grinning mischievously and clutching a beloved Jumelle box camera that had recently been given to him by his father. In the next few years, Jacques will constantly record the world around him, photographing his bedroom, making portraits of uncles and cousins, and framing his older brother, Zissou, as he leaps into the air from a boat. Another 60 years will pass, however, before the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York hosts the first exhibition of his work, belatedly bestowing on Jacques Henri Lartigue the recognition he deserves as one of the great innovators of 20th-century photography. When the celebrated American photographer Richard Avedon saw Jacques Henri Lartigue\u2019s work for the first time on the eve of the MoMA show in 1963, he wrote to his compatriot to express his gratitude: \u201cIt was one of the most moving experiences of my life\u2026 You brought me into your world and isn\u2019t that, after all, the purpose of art?\u201d The world Lartigue created with his camera was a reflection of the one he was brought up in as a privileged, pampered boy in a family environment that was both bourgeois and carefree. His father Henri, a self-made businessman, insisted that neither Jacques nor Zissou attend school, instead recruiting private tutors whose main aim was to keep Henri\u2019s offspring amused. He once said: \u201cI have plenty of money. My children should learn how to spend it.\u201d Later, Lartigue\u2019s name would become synonymous with a certain kind of ritzy glamour and elegance, epitomised in his countless images of his lover, Renee Perle, whose sultry beauty captivated him. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he was known primarily as a society photographer, shooting the rich and beautiful in the resorts along the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, where he felt effortlessly at home. The life he lived seems to have been as gilded as the lifestyles of the film stars, models, socialites and playboys he photographed. In her new book, The Boy and the Belle \u00c9poque, Louise Baring concentrates on Lartigue\u2019s childhood and teenage years, the majority of the photographs included having been taken before he turned 18. She traces a formative journey that begins in the early 1900s, when the Lartigue family lived in opulence in Paris and their country retreat in the Auvergne, and continues until 1914, when the outbreak of the first world war signalled the end of the belle \u00e9poque. Lartigue\u2019s life during this period pertains to the arc of a classic French coming-of-age novel. He was an instinctively gifted, voraciously curious prodigy who found his creative medium as a child, and was sustained by it throughout his formative years and into his adult life. From the start, it seems, Lartigue had one eye on posterity, creating photo-albums and journals of the things he witnessed. Aged 11, he photographed his bedroom from ground level, furniture and a mirror looming over his toy racing cars. More often, as the array of model racing cars suggests, he was drawn to movement, and, as a child, often photographed relatives and servants jumping off walls and over tables to his instructions. In one memorable image, he captured his cousin Simone taking a tumble from a homemade scooter. His most intriguing early subject, however, was Zissou, a daredevil and a dandy, who built and raced his own go-karts, tearing around the grounds of Chateau de Rouzat, the family\u2019s country retreat, in goggles and a tailored suit. Zissou was the eccentric action man, while Jacques, as Baring puts it, was \u201ca sensitive child who became a lifelong spectator\u201d. Later, he would photograph speeding racing cars in a blur of motion and beautiful socialite women framed like exotic creatures in closely cropped compositions. When these images were belatedly discovered and exhibited decades later, they attested to Lartigue\u2019s instinctive embrace of what later became known as the snapshot aesthetic, a term loosely applied to 60s iconoclasts such as Garry Winogrand and Lee Friedlander, who disregarded the rules of formal composition. Back in the early 1900s, when Lartigue embraced blur and movement, his approach was so singular that it amounted to what Baring calls \u201ca new visual language of the 20th century\u201d. On 29 May 1910, Lartigue, then 15, began a new adventure in a new setting, arriving at the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in Paris with an unwieldy folding plate camera. His aim was \u201cto photograph the ladies in the most outrageous and beautiful hats\u201d. Back then, the Bois de Boulogne in early summer was an open-air promenade, where society women paraded their style. They often crossed paths on the All\u00e9e des Acacias with the more bohemian and even more fashionable women of the Parisian demimonde: actors, dancers, musical hall stars and \u201cgrand cocottes\u201d \u2013 courtesans like Liane de Pougy, a friend of the novelist Colette, and \u00c9milienne d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, a great beauty who would later become Edward VII\u2019s lover. Although cold-shouldered in public by respectable members of Parisian high society, these demimondaines, writes Baring, \u201cset the style, deciding which couture creations would rise or fall in the coming season\u201d. Lartigue captured them all, often startling his exotic subjects with the loud click of his camera\u2019s shutter. The results are fascinating, a record of a time and place when this sartorial exhibitionism was simply another diversion in, as Colette scathingly put it, \u201cthe bustling lives of people with nothing to do\u201d. At times, Lartigue inevitably comes across as a proto-paparazzo. More often, though, he captures vignettes that speak volumes about the elastic social mores of the belle \u00e9poque. His snatched portraits, for all the period detail they capture, seem, like his previous images of speed and movement, oddly contemporary. The blur, the often fantastical silhouettes, the sideways glances, the way he crops his images so that his subjects loom large \u2013 and even more exotic looking \u2013 in the frame, point to a singular sensibility that was at odds with traditional composition. Throughout this period, his love of speed and movement remained. He photographed the early French pioneers of flight, Gabriel Voisin and Louis Bl\u00e9riot, as they risked life and limb in an aerodrome near Paris. At the 1912 Grand Prix in Dieppe, he made one of his most famous early photographs, freeze-framing the rear of a Delage racing car as it sped past him at close range. The driver clutches the wheel as observers on the other side of the track appear as leaning shadows, their blurred outlines evincing the sense of motion that Lartigue set out to capture. In retrospect, all those childhood days snapping Zissou on his go-karts and his cousins leaping through the air seem to lead to this defining moment. If Lartigue was a photographer of the age of speed and modernity, he was not a man of action when it came to the war, which, for the main part, seemed to pass him by as if happening elsewhere. As France ordered general mobilisation, he retreated with his family from Paris to the Auvergne and the sanctuary that was Chateau Rouzat. \u201cThe war inevitably made us unhappy,\u201d he wrote in a secret diary, \u201cbut it was happy all the same\u2026 I played sports and we still amused ourselves.\u201d There is a single image in the book that suggests the unfolding horror: a platoon of marching soldiers silhouetted against a grey sky as a spindly aeroplane flies overhead.

In February it was revealed that the National Audit Office had linked at least 69 suicides to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/07/dwp-benefit-related-suicide-numbers-not-true-figure-says-watchdog-nao\">workings of the benefits system</a>, and this number was probably an underestimate.</p> <p>Six weeks later, the fact that people in charge are suddenly speaking a language of solidarity and accepting that unemployment is a consequence of economics rather than character failure is something to behold.

But even these things could sooner or later revert to normal, with consequences that this crisis and its aftershocks will inevitably make worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/universal-basic-income-help-self-employed\">Universal basic income is the best way to help the self-employed | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When politics returns to normal, nobody on the left should kid themselves that resisting such backward steps will be easy. After all, we are talking not just about policies and systems, but also beliefs that are deeply entrenched in large chunks of the population, and which even this international tragedy might not shift. Notwithstanding a softening of people\u2019s views about the welfare state and support for increasing the minimum wage, recent research from the British social attitudes survey <a href=\"https://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/39284/bsa35_full-report.pdf\">suggested</a> that when it came to benefits and the needs they cover, we remained a fairly crabby, judgmental country. In 2018, 43% of us accepted the idea that the \u201cgenerosity of welfare benefits creates dependence\u201d. Only 20% of us agreed that unemployed people should receive higher benefits. The kicker, perhaps, was the fact that 56% of respondents agreed that \u201cmost unemployed people could find a job if they really wanted one\u201d, compared with just 17% who disagreed.</p> <p>Outside of major cities, I have heard these things so many times that they have often seemed as unremarkable as the weather. In many cases, they are a dysfunctional sign of the resentments and frustrations sown by insecurity and want. They have been repeatedly stoked by politicians \u2013 most obviously by Conservatives, though rifling through the news archives throws up such memorable headlines as \u201cGordon Brown to crack down on benefit cheats in Queen\u2019s speech\u201d (from 2008). </p> <p>But to some extent, people in Westminster were merely seizing on malign views already present in the<strong> </strong>culture. The most pitiful thing to see was the acceptance of these opinions by people whose experiences showed how misplaced they were. I remember going to the Cheshire town of Warrington eight years ago and, watched by press officers from the Department of Work and Pensions, interviewing a 27-year-old man who had just endured nine months of unemployment. He said he had been averaging 25 to 30 job applications a week, most of which had not even got a reply. \u201cI think I should have applied for more,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have tried more. When you\u2019re feeling down, you start blaming the world for your mistakes \u2026 You feel the world owes you. And it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>If millions of people are suddenly staring into the most uncertain future imaginable, and 500,000 people are suddenly applying for universal credit, will those ideas survive? Put another way, what will happen to the beliefs and prejudices that have defined so much of the last 10 to 15 years, encouraged by politicians chasing votes: mutual suspicion, a manic belief in \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d, and the very British tendency to focus your furies on the people down the street?</p> <p>In his capacity as a newspaper editor, the former chancellor George Osborne last week commissioned a special back page of London\u2019s Evening Standard emblazoned with the slogan \u201cLondon stands together\u201d. God knows, in times as dreadful as these our capital city could do with as much solidarity and mutual care as it can get. But I also wonder about the infamous <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/george-osbornes-speech-conservative-conference-full-text\">speech</a> he made in 2012, all cheap misanthropy and cynicism: \u201cWhere is the fairness, we ask, for the shift worker, leaving home in the dark hours of the early morning, who looks up at the closed blinds of their next-door neighbour sleeping off a life on benefits?\u201d While imploring the young and strong to stay in their homes in the interests of the old, infirm and vulnerable, we now want those same neighbours to be embracing their common humanity, and checking on each other\u2019s welfare. We had better hope they will.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The kicker, perhaps, was the fact that 56% of respondents agreed that \u201cmost unemployed people could find a job if they really wanted one\u201d, compared with just 17% who disagreed. Outside of major cities, I have heard these things so many times that they have often seemed as unremarkable as the weather. In many cases, they are a dysfunctional sign of the resentments and frustrations sown by insecurity and want. They have been repeatedly stoked by politicians \u2013 most obviously by Conservatives, though rifling through the news archives throws up such memorable headlines as \u201cGordon Brown to crack down on benefit cheats in Queen\u2019s speech\u201d (from 2008). But to some extent, people in Westminster were merely seizing on malign views already present in the culture. The most pitiful thing to see was the acceptance of these opinions by people whose experiences showed how misplaced they were. I remember going to the Cheshire town of Warrington eight years ago and, watched by press officers from the Department of Work and Pensions, interviewing a 27-year-old man who had just endured nine months of unemployment. He said he had been averaging 25 to 30 job applications a week, most of which had not even got a reply. \u201cI think I should have applied for more,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have tried more. When you\u2019re feeling down, you start blaming the world for your mistakes \u2026 You feel the world owes you. And it doesn\u2019t.\u201d If millions of people are suddenly staring into the most uncertain future imaginable, and 500,000 people are suddenly applying for universal credit, will those ideas survive? Put another way, what will happen to the beliefs and prejudices that have defined so much of the last 10 to 15 years, encouraged by politicians chasing votes: mutual suspicion, a manic belief in \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d, and the very British tendency to focus your furies on the people down the street? In his capacity as a newspaper editor, the former chancellor George Osborne last week commissioned a special back page of London\u2019s Evening Standard emblazoned with the slogan \u201cLondon stands together\u201d. God knows, in times as dreadful as these our capital city could do with as much solidarity and mutual care as it can get. But I also wonder about the infamous speech he made in 2012, all cheap misanthropy and cynicism: \u201cWhere is the fairness, we ask, for the shift worker, leaving home in the dark hours of the early morning, who looks up at the closed blinds of their next-door neighbour sleeping off a life on benefits?\u201d While imploring the young and strong to stay in their homes in the interests of the old, infirm and vulnerable, we now want those same neighbours to be embracing their common humanity, and checking on each other\u2019s welfare. We had better hope they will. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Europe is being ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-deaths-in-italy-pass-10000-with-889-new-fatalities\">10,000 deaths in Italy</a>. In the grimmest of league tables, Spain comes second. Normal life has been suspended across the continent and the hit to the economy is immense. France\u2019s output is running at two-thirds of what it was last year. Germany has abandoned fiscal rectitude and \u2013 along with the rest \u2013 adopted a \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach.</p> <p>Border controls have been erected to stop the flow of people even though this contravenes one of the founding principles of the single market. Rules on state aid to struggling companies have been relaxed. The European Central Bank has embarked on a gigantic asset purchase scheme in an attempt to flood the eurozone economy with cheap money.</p> <p>Jean Monnet, the driving force behind the creation of what was to become the European Union in the 1950s, said that Europe would be <a href=\"https://thewell-travelledpostcard.com/portfolio/europe-will-be-forged-in-crises-how-crisis-has-shaped-eu-integration/\">forged in cris</a><a href=\"https://thewell-travelledpostcard.com/portfolio/europe-will-be-forged-in-crises-how-crisis-has-shaped-eu-integration/\">es</a>, and Covid-19 clearly meets that criterion. The twin health-economic emergency is by far the worst crisis Europe has had to face since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957: worse than the oil shock of the mid-1970s, worse than the banking meltdown of 2008.</p> <p>That, though, was not the end of Monnet\u2019s observation. He went on to say that the sort of Europe that would be forged would depend on the \u201csolutions adopted for those crises\u201d. And, in that respect, the signs have not been good.</p> <p>If ever there was a time for the EU to act as one, for the richer countries to show solidarity with those less fortunate, then this is it. Yet when Italy pleaded for fellow countries to send it medical equipment such as masks, France and Germany not only failed to respond, they placed export bans (since lifted) on the export of the kit Italian hospitals were crying out for. In the end it was left to China to show EU how to respond to a country in dire need.</p> <p>Another problem for Italy is that because of its slow growth and high levels of public debt it has to pay a higher rate of interest on the money the government borrows than is the case for Germany and, when the hospitals in the cities of Lombardy started to fill up with Covid-19 cases, this gap \u2013 or spread \u2013 started to widen. It was therefore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\">deeply unhelpful for Christine Lagarde</a>, the president of the ECB, to say that it was not the job of her institution to \u201cclose bond spreads\u201d.</p> <p>Lagarde, to her credit, quickly recanted and the ECB is now doing its utmost to help Italy and the wider eurozone economy. But the crisis has highlighted the weaknesses of the eurozone: the lack of coordination between monetary policy run by the ECB from Frankfurt and fiscal policy under the control of member states; the lack of a sizeable, single budget; the absence of financial tools that would make a collective approach easier.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/eu-leaders-clash-over-economic-response-to-coronavirus-crisis\">virtual meeting of EU leaders</a> was supposed to come up with a joint approach to the crisis but was instead a complete car crash. One group of countries \u2013 including Italy, Spain and France \u2013 wanted the creation of corona bonds, which would be issued collectively by all eurozone countries.</p> <p>The thinking behind a corona bond is simple. By pooling risk, hard-pressed countries such as Italy and Spain would benefit from the reputation for financial probity of countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Of the money raised, the lion\u2019s share would go to the countries at greatest need and at lower rates of interest than they would have to pay if they were issuing their own national bonds.</p> <p>Yet even in these quite exceptional circumstances, corona bonds proved to be a non-starter. Germany thought Italy should ask for assistance through the European Stability Mechanism, where the money comes with strings attached. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said under no circumstances would he agree to common bonds.

      "bodyText": "Europe is being ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been more than 10,000 deaths in Italy. In the grimmest of league tables, Spain comes second. Normal life has been suspended across the continent and the hit to the economy is immense. France\u2019s output is running at two-thirds of what it was last year. Germany has abandoned fiscal rectitude and \u2013 along with the rest \u2013 adopted a \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach. Border controls have been erected to stop the flow of people even though this contravenes one of the founding principles of the single market. Rules on state aid to struggling companies have been relaxed. The European Central Bank has embarked on a gigantic asset purchase scheme in an attempt to flood the eurozone economy with cheap money. Jean Monnet, the driving force behind the creation of what was to become the European Union in the 1950s, said that Europe would be forged in crises, and Covid-19 clearly meets that criterion. The twin health-economic emergency is by far the worst crisis Europe has had to face since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957: worse than the oil shock of the mid-1970s, worse than the banking meltdown of 2008. That, though, was not the end of Monnet\u2019s observation. He went on to say that the sort of Europe that would be forged would depend on the \u201csolutions adopted for those crises\u201d. And, in that respect, the signs have not been good. If ever there was a time for the EU to act as one, for the richer countries to show solidarity with those less fortunate, then this is it. Yet when Italy pleaded for fellow countries to send it medical equipment such as masks, France and Germany not only failed to respond, they placed export bans (since lifted) on the export of the kit Italian hospitals were crying out for. In the end it was left to China to show EU how to respond to a country in dire need. Another problem for Italy is that because of its slow growth and high levels of public debt it has to pay a higher rate of interest on the money the government borrows than is the case for Germany and, when the hospitals in the cities of Lombardy started to fill up with Covid-19 cases, this gap \u2013 or spread \u2013 started to widen. It was therefore deeply unhelpful for Christine Lagarde, the president of the ECB, to say that it was not the job of her institution to \u201cclose bond spreads\u201d. Lagarde, to her credit, quickly recanted and the ECB is now doing its utmost to help Italy and the wider eurozone economy. But the crisis has highlighted the weaknesses of the eurozone: the lack of coordination between monetary policy run by the ECB from Frankfurt and fiscal policy under the control of member states; the lack of a sizeable, single budget; the absence of financial tools that would make a collective approach easier. Last week\u2019s virtual meeting of EU leaders was supposed to come up with a joint approach to the crisis but was instead a complete car crash. One group of countries \u2013 including Italy, Spain and France \u2013 wanted the creation of corona bonds, which would be issued collectively by all eurozone countries. The thinking behind a corona bond is simple. By pooling risk, hard-pressed countries such as Italy and Spain would benefit from the reputation for financial probity of countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Of the money raised, the lion\u2019s share would go to the countries at greatest need and at lower rates of interest than they would have to pay if they were issuing their own national bonds. Yet even in these quite exceptional circumstances, corona bonds proved to be a non-starter. Germany thought Italy should ask for assistance through the European Stability Mechanism, where the money comes with strings attached. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said under no circumstances would he agree to common bonds. For Germany, the Netherlands and a number of other northern European eurozone members, it is a question of moral hazard: the countries that are running big budget deficits will never change their ways if they think they can always borrow on the cheap. The Italians and the Spanish also dug their heels in, preferring for the meeting to end with no agreement rather than accept the stigma of conditionality. So, in time-honoured fashion, the can was kicked down the road, with eurozone finance ministers given a couple of weeks to come up with something. One possible solution would be to get round the moral hazard problem by making the corona bonds a one-off solution to a quite exceptional crisis. If, as is possible, the emergency is relatively short-lived, the Germans and the Dutch ought to be able to support the idea of corona bonds are for 2020 only. There is little doubt which side Monnet would be backing. This is not just about providing a lifeline to Italy, important though that is. Nor is it simply about avoiding the meltdown of already shaky Italian banks, which would have ripple effects across the eurozone. It is about political legitimacy and whether the EU goes forward or backwards.

Everywhere you saw women talking feverishly to each other, you knew it would be about this creepy boss, or that older guy.</p> <p><em>My Dark Vanessa</em> \u2013 about a 15-year-old schoolgirl, Vanessa, who has a sexual relationship her 42-year-old teacher, Jacob Strane \u2013 animates this process of re-evaluation, albeit within an extreme case. Kate Elizabeth Russell resists the (now sometimes shrill) insistence on black and white in sexual dealings \u2013 instead inhabiting the mind of a vulnerable teenager, offering insight into how black might feel like white, how abuse might be taken for romance \u2013 and how this lie could be desperately clung to into adulthood. <em>My Dark Vanessa</em> reveals a slow journey towards a different understanding.</p> <p>It\u2019s been billed as \u201cthe most controversial book of the year\u201d, yet it strikes me as a level-headed portrait of how complicated such experiences may feel. Russell acknowledges that teenage girls can have sexual desire and a certain kind of power \u2013 <em>and</em> that the psychological manipulation of these can itself be one of the most powerful weapons of the abuser.</p> <p>The novel has its own penumbra of hype: a seven-figure advance, an accusation of plagiarism that got it dropped from Oprah Winfrey\u2019s book club \u2013 and, grimly, resulted in Russell reluctantly revealing it was partly based on her own experiences. There\u2019s a bitter irony in Russell writing a book about a woman who doesn\u2019t want to come forward about abuse, and being forced to expose her trauma herself.</p> <p>As a work of fiction, <em>My Dark Vanessa</em> is absolutely gripping \u2013 especially in the first half where Vanessa is a lonely Maine schoolgirl with a burgeoning crush on her English teacher. Written in the first person without hindsight, it\u2019s a brilliant depiction of how grooming feels from the inside. You see exactly why she was attracted to this older man: he feeds the girl\u2019s teenage sense of being painfully different by constantly telling her she\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d, they are both rare \u201cdark romantics\u201d, and that by driving him wild, it is <em>she</em> that has power over <em>him</em>.</p> <p>Russell allows an erotic charge to crackle in her telling, even as wild warning bells go off on nearly every page. There are many moments that also send a spiral of nausea through the stomach, moments Vanessa can\u2019t quite comprehend but that leap horribly off the page to an adult reader: when Strane buys her cutesy pyjamas, groans \u201cI\u2019m going to ruin you\u201d in her lap, or asks her to call him \u201cDaddy\u201d.</p> <p>These chapters are interspersed with the 32-year-old Vanessa \u2013 disappointed by life, downbeat and numbing with weed and booze \u2013 obsessively following new allegations against Strane by another former pupil. But Vanessa clings to the belief that with her, it wasn\u2019t abuse but a grand romance. The title is a quote from Nabokov\u2019s novel <em>Pale Fire</em>, but the book is in dialogue with <em>Lolita</em> \u2013 though here, it is the Lolita figure herself who insists it\u2019s a love story.</p> <p>Even when acknowledging Strane\u2019s grooming, the adult Vanessa is defensive: \u201cwhy is everyone so scared to admit how good that can feel? To be groomed is to be loved and handled like a precious, delicate thing.\u201d But where she sees her refusal to be a victim as strength, the reader sees only deluded self-preservation.</p> <p>The novel loses its urgency a little in the second half, as Vanessa flounders through adulthood. Russell presents events in a way that cleverly allows us to see wrongness even as her narrator insists on rightness, rather than delving deep psychologically. But it\u2019s a darkly compelling story, and surely destined to find an audience worthy of that advance.</p> <p><em>\u2022 My Dark Vanessa</em> by Kate Elizabeth Russell is published by HarperCollins (\u00a312.99).

There are many moments that also send a spiral of nausea through the stomach, moments Vanessa can\u2019t quite comprehend but that leap horribly off the page to an adult reader: when Strane buys her cutesy pyjamas, groans \u201cI\u2019m going to ruin you\u201d in her lap, or asks her to call him \u201cDaddy\u201d. These chapters are interspersed with the 32-year-old Vanessa \u2013 disappointed by life, downbeat and numbing with weed and booze \u2013 obsessively following new allegations against Strane by another former pupil. But Vanessa clings to the belief that with her, it wasn\u2019t abuse but a grand romance. The title is a quote from Nabokov\u2019s novel Pale Fire, but the book is in dialogue with Lolita \u2013 though here, it is the Lolita figure herself who insists it\u2019s a love story. Even when acknowledging Strane\u2019s grooming, the adult Vanessa is defensive: \u201cwhy is everyone so scared to admit how good that can feel? To be groomed is to be loved and handled like a precious, delicate thing.\u201d But where she sees her refusal to be a victim as strength, the reader sees only deluded self-preservation. The novel loses its urgency a little in the second half, as Vanessa flounders through adulthood. Russell presents events in a way that cleverly allows us to see wrongness even as her narrator insists on rightness, rather than delving deep psychologically. But it\u2019s a darkly compelling story, and surely destined to find an audience worthy of that advance. \u2022 My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell is published by HarperCollins (\u00a312.99).

      "body": "<p>Gardens have been the anchor and mainstay of my life, the most enduring source of fascination and pleasure. I started young. My father is a besotted plantsman and after my parents divorced in the early 1980s he spent custody weekends taking me and my younger sister to every open garden within 50 miles of the M25. We whiled away wet Saturdays in the hothouses at <a href=\"https://www.kew.org/\" title=\"\">Kew</a>, trying to persuade the butterflies to land on our fingers. I learned my first botanical name at <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/gardens/wisley\" title=\"\">RHS Wisley</a> one winter afternoon, lured by the rich fragrance emitting from a nondescript shrub with tiny clusters of shell-pink flowers \u2013 Daphne odora \u2018Warblington\u2019, a name that has lodged with me ever since.</p> <p>I was an anxious and not very happy child, and I loved the spell of self-forgetfulness that happens in a garden \u2013 the sense of being wholly absorbed, lifted out of time. The places I was most drawn to were shaggy, a little wild around the edges. I agreed with Frances Hodgson Burnett\u2019s manifesto in <em>The Secret Garden</em>: a garden loses all its magic if it becomes too spick and span. It must feel half-forgotten, sunk in slumber. You have to be able to lose yourself, to forget the outside world; to feel, as Burnett put it, hundreds of miles from anyone, but not lonely at all.</p> <p>One of our favourite places was <a href=\"https://www.parhaminsussex.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Parham</a>, an Elizabethan garden in Sussex, where there were tiny formal pools in the corner of each walled enclosure, carpeted in luminous green duckweed. We went to <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sissinghurst-castle-garden\" title=\"\">Sissinghurst</a> almost every spring, driving through Kentish lanes ripe with apple blossom. We\u2019d start in the tower, where Vita Sackville-West had created the most enviable of studies, before wandering down the nut walk and into the orchard, along curved paths mown into a tangled meadow that spilled to the banks of the moat. The past hung heavy on the air. Sometimes it felt as if whole centuries had slipped away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b657cf0824ce70ee2e72162f6cb2544c25a7e42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b657cf0824ce70ee2e72162f6cb2544c25a7e42/0_437_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"our garden in Cambridge in 2018/19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Learning names meant beds and borders weren\u2019t just a blur\u2019: our garden in Cambridge in 2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Laing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My father always carried a small black notebook in which he made neat lists of plant names, pouncing on any unusual form or colour. Learning names meant beds and borders were no longer a harlequin blur, and they also served as a potent source of fascination in their own right. I loved old varieties in particular, hoarding away lists of antique roses or apples popular in 16th century orchards. Winter Queening, Catshead, Golden Harvey, Green Custard, Old Pearmain\u2026 a spell of language that opened up a portal in time.</p> <p>As a teenager, my sister was obsessed with the queer artist and filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/derek-jarman\" title=\"\">Derek Jarman</a>. She collected his books, which was how I first got my hands on <em>Modern Nature</em>, his account of building his improbable, exuberant garden in the shingle at Dungeness. I loved how Jarman approached gardening: freely, haphazardly, working with whatever came to hand, incorporating driftwood and stones and plonking in old roses to take their chances with the vicious wind. Unlike most gardeners, he didn\u2019t go in for fences or walls, writing proudly, \u201cMy garden\u2019s boundaries are the horizon.\u201d</p> <p>He was captivated by the deep history of plants, the folklore that entwines itself around herbs and weeds. His garden was explicitly laid out as a pharmacopoeia, a medicine chest drawn from medieval apothecaries, and <em>Modern Nature</em> is riddled with bright snatches from the herbals of Gerard and Culpeper. It\u2019s hard to express the lure that knowledge held for me. Some of his quotings I still have by heart, reciting them automatically every time I see the plant in question. \u201cI, borage, bring courage.\u201d \u201c<em>Rosa mundi</em>, rose of the world.\u201d</p> <p>It took a few false starts, but I did eventually find a way of incorporating plants into my working life, at least for a while. After a brief dalliance with an English degree and a spell living outdoors as an environmental activist, I decided in 1998 to start a degree in herbal medicine. The training took five years. Many of our courses were the same as in a standard medicine degree, but there were witchier modules, too, in materia medica, botany and the art of dispensing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef8ee5b6c03d83f76232dcf164f4d86a7bb55dad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef8ee5b6c03d83f76232dcf164f4d86a7bb55dad/0_0_4200_2521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My garden\u2019s boundaries are the horizon\u2019: Derek Jarman\u2019s garden on the beach at Dungeness in Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My garden\u2019s boundaries are the horizon\u2019: Derek Jarman\u2019s garden on the beach at Dungeness in Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I did my clinical training at an old manor house deep in the Sussex Weald. It was set in a magnificent garden, once immaculate, but now tumbling back into wildness. One of its more unusual components was a poison garden, full of the so-called Schedule III herbs that only a trained practitioner can dispense, among them belladonna, lily of the valley and henbane. The swimming pool had been drained and angelica and globe artichoke towered over the neglected beds. After we\u2019d finished seeing patients in the training clinic, we\u2019d go on herb walks, talking about properties and contraindications in the dusty afternoon sun.</p> <p>I thought I had a reasonable knowledge of plants, but it turned out I didn\u2019t know the first thing. Studying botany is above all an education of the eye, a practice of close observation. I learned how to recognise different families, and then how to identify species, to separate pennyroyal from peppermint, to know a lamium from a nettle. For years I didn\u2019t go on a country walk without a copy of <em>The</em> <em>Wild Flowers of Britain and Northern Europe</em>, known as \u201cFitter, Fitter and Blamey\u201d for its co-authors. The first time I saw fumitory I cried out in joy. I\u2019d been looking at Marjorie Blamey\u2019s meticulous drawing of it, sketching a copy in the hand-drawn materia medica I was assembling. Suddenly there it was, at the edge of a ploughed field, precise and emphatic.</p> <p>But it turned out I liked studying botany more than I liked seeing patients. After a few years practising as a herbalist, I shifted into journalism. My 30s were overwhelmingly urban. I lived in a succession of rented flats in Brighton and New York, and though I still loved plants, gardens receded in my life. It was only when I was with my father that I\u2019d speak in botanical nomenclature, that hard-won tongue so suited to the pedant. Each year we\u2019d go to Northumberland and walk around the Gertrude Jekyll garden at <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lindisfarne-castle\" title=\"\">Lindisfarne Castle</a> or the beautifully named <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lyveden\" title=\"\">Lyveden New Bield</a>, quibbling over Latin names, a pursuit that would drive my long-suffering sister to fury.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da95c625d9a6833c60d67e2849ebe06f068087b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da95c625d9a6833c60d67e2849ebe06f068087b0/0_179_2816_1690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flutter by: a European Comma on Echinacea purpurea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flutter by: a European Comma on Echinacea purpurea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elaine Stavert/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t until I was nearly 40 that I finally acquired a garden of my own. My main motivation for moving to Cambridge was that I was able to afford to rent a tiny terraced house with a handkerchief of outdoor space, half of which was occupied by a giant holly. A quick inspection revealed that the soil was infested with ground elder. It was distinctly unpromising, but for the first time in years I could use my old trowel, inherited from my grandfather, another gifted gardener. My father came over and together we dug it clear, and planted peonies, cistus and irises. To my amazement it flourished. Within a year it was an eye-popping jungle.</p> <p>It\u2019s frustrating, gardening in a rented house. When I cleaned the rank old pond, the management company responded by telling me I\u2019d have to fill it in when I left. It still felt worthwhile to leave it more fertile and abundant than when I\u2019d arrived. Tending it was also an antidote to the transient, insecure feeling that too often accompanies renting. Bedded in, rooted: so many of our words to do with being at home are actually drawn from plants.</p> <p>That garden was also how I met my future husband. Ian lived a few streets north. We had friends in common and we quickly identified a shared interest in gardening. He was married to the writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jennydiski\" title=\"\">Jenny Diski</a>, and when she was diagnosed with cancer a couple of years later his own beautiful plot became increasingly neglected. When we got together after she had died, it was riddled with couchgrass and full of old shrubs that had long since exceeded their allotted space.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t working, but like the fictional secret garden, it pulsed with potential. The house was on a terrace built for Victorian railway workers. The garden was narrow and long, running down to the Cambridge-to-Ely line. Jenny\u2019s writing shed stood at the halfway mark and Ian had built a library right at the end. The fences were covered in a tangle of old roses, and there were treasures like daylilies and hellebores hidden in the overgrown beds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d5db17b9a640f36289bd094456825672a93d366\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d5db17b9a640f36289bd094456825672a93d366/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018In these times, the garden is what\u2019s keeping me sane\u2019: the pond in Olivia\u2019s back garden\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In these times, the garden is what\u2019s keeping me sane\u2019: the pond in Olivia\u2019s back garden</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Laing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Slowly, we took out every plant that wasn\u2019t pulling its weight, creating instead herbaceous borders full of old-fashioned cottage-garden plants, some of them carefully transplanted from my old garden. The palette had been limited to white and blue. I introduced hotter colours, squeezing in flamboyant salvias and dahlias with alluring names: Arabian Nights, Wizard of Oz, Bora Bora, Hollyhill Spider Woman. Ian is the garden steward of the college where he works, which meant we were occasionally presented with a glut of snapdragons or cosmos. We put in a greenhouse and extended the growing season in both directions, planting helenium, rudbeckia and tagetes for splashes of rust and sulphur in the autumn, and hundreds of violets and snowdrops for February cheer.</p> <p>I\u2019d gone plant-mad again. Even in the winter, I was busy dreaming up plans for the next year, keeping stacks of seed catalogues by the bed. We put a pond in and the next week it was magically filled with fish, apparently from eggs laid on lily leaves. We let the lawn grow and seeded it with the meadow herbs I once had in my dispensary: selfheal, yarrow, marshmallow. The garden was starting to have the right feel, the right kind of humming wildness. A fox moved in, followed by a family of hedgehogs. Ian\u2019s list of butterflies doubled, then tripled.</p> <p>I\u2019m so grateful for all that work now. Ian and I are in self-isolation and in these plague times, the garden is what\u2019s keeping me sane. Outside, it\u2019s possible to forget the frightening news for an hour or two. A garden is rooted in time, but it\u2019s always also about now. Right now: the bee; right now: the wallflowers flaming into bloom. Even the worst worries seem magically to drop away as you flow from task to task, attending to problems as they arise. There\u2019s no need to finish, no final iteration to be reached. The pursuit of perfection is endless and ongoing. Mistakes will be made, but there\u2019s always the possibility that next year the shady border can finally be righted, the roses adequately pruned. It\u2019s not that I never lose my temper planting tulips or trying to yank out golden rod, or obsess over slugs feasting on the delphiniums. All the same, I\u2019ve never found an activity as soothing or as wholly absorbing. It\u2019s like being immersed in a deep, silent pool.</p> <p>As Derek Jarman points out in <em>Modern Nature</em>, the word \u201cparadise\u201d is related to the Persian for garden, an enclosed green space. During the coronavirus crisis, gardeners around the world have turned to Instagram to share their paradises, making what is often a private source of solace a communal resource. I follow dozens of them and nothing has made me feel so connected or rooted as looking at these green bulletins, snapshots from an otherwise very troubled and terrifying world. Today, I saw daffodils emerging from the flood water in Monty Don\u2019s garden, cactuses on my friend Matt\u2019s morning dog walk in LA, snub noses of tulips emerging from the soil in the East Village and children planting vegetable seeds in yogurt pots in northern California. Whatever else happens, spring is certainly on the way.</p> <p>Gardeners might be rooted in the present, but they dream of the future, too. I thought we\u2019d stay in Cambridge forever, but the problem is that it\u2019s too small. There\u2019s no room for fruit trees and we can\u2019t cram another dahlia into the beds. And so we\u2019re off again, assuming we\u2019re ever allowed out of quarantine, to a walled garden in Suffolk. It was home for 50 years to a garden designer, who transformed it into a series of contained rooms. The centrepiece is a venerable, stooped mulberry, planted in 1601. Apparently the pond was full of fish, but a passing otter recently stole them all, leaving their beheaded corpses lined up on the path. I\u2019m taking that as a good omen.</p> <p>When we first visited, the air was heavy with the scent of daphne and wintersweet. By the time we move, fingers crossed, the irises will be in flower, and one day soon we\u2019ll be eating our own figs. Rumour has it one of the trees came from a cutting brought from Sissinghurst by a girlfriend of Vita Sackville-West. That\u2019s the thing about gardens. They tether you in place, they root you in time, they never stand still and they\u2019re always surprising.</p> <p><em>Olivia Laing\u2019s collected essays, Funny Weather: Art in an Emergency, will be published on 16 April (Pan Macmillan \u00a320).

The garden was starting to have the right feel, the right kind of humming wildness. A fox moved in, followed by a family of hedgehogs. Ian\u2019s list of butterflies doubled, then tripled. I\u2019m so grateful for all that work now. Ian and I are in self-isolation and in these plague times, the garden is what\u2019s keeping me sane. Outside, it\u2019s possible to forget the frightening news for an hour or two. A garden is rooted in time, but it\u2019s always also about now. Right now: the bee; right now: the wallflowers flaming into bloom. Even the worst worries seem magically to drop away as you flow from task to task, attending to problems as they arise. There\u2019s no need to finish, no final iteration to be reached. The pursuit of perfection is endless and ongoing. Mistakes will be made, but there\u2019s always the possibility that next year the shady border can finally be righted, the roses adequately pruned. It\u2019s not that I never lose my temper planting tulips or trying to yank out golden rod, or obsess over slugs feasting on the delphiniums. All the same, I\u2019ve never found an activity as soothing or as wholly absorbing. It\u2019s like being immersed in a deep, silent pool. As Derek Jarman points out in Modern Nature, the word \u201cparadise\u201d is related to the Persian for garden, an enclosed green space. During the coronavirus crisis, gardeners around the world have turned to Instagram to share their paradises, making what is often a private source of solace a communal resource. I follow dozens of them and nothing has made me feel so connected or rooted as looking at these green bulletins, snapshots from an otherwise very troubled and terrifying world. Today, I saw daffodils emerging from the flood water in Monty Don\u2019s garden, cactuses on my friend Matt\u2019s morning dog walk in LA, snub noses of tulips emerging from the soil in the East Village and children planting vegetable seeds in yogurt pots in northern California. Whatever else happens, spring is certainly on the way. Gardeners might be rooted in the present, but they dream of the future, too. I thought we\u2019d stay in Cambridge forever, but the problem is that it\u2019s too small. There\u2019s no room for fruit trees and we can\u2019t cram another dahlia into the beds. And so we\u2019re off again, assuming we\u2019re ever allowed out of quarantine, to a walled garden in Suffolk. It was home for 50 years to a garden designer, who transformed it into a series of contained rooms. The centrepiece is a venerable, stooped mulberry, planted in 1601. Apparently the pond was full of fish, but a passing otter recently stole them all, leaving their beheaded corpses lined up on the path. I\u2019m taking that as a good omen. When we first visited, the air was heavy with the scent of daphne and wintersweet. By the time we move, fingers crossed, the irises will be in flower, and one day soon we\u2019ll be eating our own figs. Rumour has it one of the trees came from a cutting brought from Sissinghurst by a girlfriend of Vita Sackville-West. That\u2019s the thing about gardens. They tether you in place, they root you in time, they never stand still and they\u2019re always surprising.

The \u201ceconomy\u201d the bankers and billionaires are eager to restart had been growing rapidly. But most of its gains had gone into corporate profits, as shown by the meteoric rise of the stock market.

While it\u2019s true that we can\u2019t save every human life at any cost, and at some point may have to end the lockdown of America and accept some additional coronavirus casualties, we need to keep in mind whom we are talking about. The trade-off average Americans might make between getting back to work and exposing themselves to the virus is likely to be quite different from the trade-off bankers and billionaires make, especially if average Americans have enough income support to get through the crisis. Four months of extra unemployment benefits may not be enough. The richest nation in the world surely has enough resources to keep its people safe at home for as long as it takes.

Despite the exhortations to other employers to get their employees to work from home, until Sunday there was no clear policy about who in the federal public service should work from home, causing consternation from the union that covers public servants. \u201cThe prime minister and the APSC must follow their own advice and allow the public sector to work from home, wherever possible. It is just baffling that there is one rule for private business and another for the public sector,\u201d the CPSU national secretary, Melissa Donnelly, said earlier on Sunday. On Sunday evening the commonwealth public service commissioner, Peter Woolcott, released new advice making it clear that federal public servants should work from home where possible. Woolcott said the updated guidance made it clear that, wherever practicable, public servants should work from home, subject to the decisions of agency heads. He said it was up to departmental and agency heads, but working from home was \u201cthe priority\u201d. Woolcott also stressed that every public servant who can work, should work. \u201cThe government considers the APS to be an essential service which needs to keep working in order to keep Australians safe, and ensure that services are delivered for the Australian people,\u201d he said. \u201cAgency heads have always had the flexibility for employees to work at home subject to operational requirements. But current circumstances mean as soon as practicable agency heads should facilitate their staff working from home where possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are extraordinary times. A time where the Australian Public Service is essential to keep Australians safe, and to deliver services for the Australian people. Our focus is on both employees\u2019 health and wellbeing, and importantly the continued delivery of critical public services.\u201d He said APS staff would be deployed to where needs were greatest and that agency heads would be asked to facilitate movement of staff between agencies urgently to perform critical functions. The CPSU said the Australian Taxation office had been on the verge of moving the majority of its staff to remote working last week, but had put the plan on hold after \u201cmixed messages\u201d from the prime minister, including that \u201canyone with a job is an essential service\u201d. Defence and the ATO are understood to have run large-scale trials of remote working but have been waiting for an APSC-wide directive before implementing them. Tensions had been simmering between the union and the government after departmental heads appeared reluctant to allow working from home without a government policy. One message from the Department of Social Security to all staff last week said: \u201cThere has been no direction from Government for the APS, as an essential service, to move to a broader working from home stance.\u201d However, DSS said short-term home-based working arrangements were in place for people who may be more vulnerable and to assist meeting social distancing requirements. Some departments such as Treasury and Finance already have high levels of people working from home, but other policy departments were still requiring attendance at the office. The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, had also expressed concern about the slow move to remote working. The ACT had 77 Covid-19 cases as of Sunday. Asked about the federal public service on ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said: \u201c If they can work from home, they should work from home. \u201cBut there is a lot of work that needs to be done right now by the federal public service to support the government\u2019s efforts in relation to protecting people\u2019s health.\u201d He declined to elaborate on which public servants would be permitted to work from home. \u201cThis is going to be done through an orderly fashion based on the appropriate advice. I\u2019m not going to provide a directive through Insiders, as much as you would want me to do so,\u201d he said. The new directive reveals the APSC has established an APS Workforce Management Taskforce to manage the mobility of the workforce across agencies. Woolcott said the taskforce was in the early stages of identifying the critical gaps in capacity across the public service. In the short term, the key priority is to increase capacity in areas that are critical to the delivery of government services. The redeployment comes on top of recruitment of an extra 5,000 workers at Centrelink, which the CPSU believes will be filled by 4,500 private sector workers, including labour hire, and just 500 casuals recruited to the public service.",

      "body": "<h2>Mark Kermode<br><em><strong>Chief film critic for the Observer since 2013</strong></em></h2> <p>\u201cEvery now and then, in the middle of Tuesday afternoon, when you\u2019ve seen a run of really bad films \u2013 <em>Mighty Pups</em>, say, followed by some terrible Michael Bay movie \u2013 and you\u2019re scuttling from one screening room to another, and it\u2019s raining, and you\u2019ve got a deadline, and you\u2019ve been up since 5am, and you think: \u2018Ohhh, life is so hard!\u2019 But then you go: \u2018Hang on a minute\u2026\u2019\u201d Mark Kermode takes a breath and reflects on his professional fortunes. \u201cWhen I went to the school careers office, they told me I should probably work in an insurance office. Instead,\u201d \u2013 he draws the next six words out for emphasis \u2013 \u201cI watch films for a living. Which is astonishing to me. I should never ever complain about the job that I have, because I have the best job in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Kermode got the job as the<em> Observer</em>\u2019s chief film critic in 2013, taking over from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/01/philip-french-tributes-mark-kermode-clive-james-claire-tomalin\" title=\"\">the late, great Philip French</a>, who was retiring after 50 years in the role. Prior to that, he had written for <em>Time Out</em>, <em>NME</em> and <em>Fangoria</em>, as well as broadcasting about film for the BBC and Channel 4. Each new gig delighted him, but when the <em>Observer</em> first got in touch in 2003, asking him to fill in while French was away, Kermode recalls being \u201ccompletely overwhelmed\u201d by the opportunity. (Aptly, given his love of horror films, his first review was of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jun/08/features.review\" title=\"\">the Japanese chiller </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jun/08/features.review\" title=\"\">Dark Water</a></em>.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every week I am filled with the absolute belief that what I\u2019ve written is the stupidest thing anyone has ever written</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Every Monday and Tuesday, in normal times, Kermode travels to London from the New Forest, where he lives with his wife, the film studies professor Linda Ruth Williams, and watches eight or nine films in Soho\u2019s screening rooms. He takes notes as he watches \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t use a light-up pen or any of that nonsense, I just taught myself to write in the dark\u201d \u2013 jotting down things that particularly strike him, \u201clike the composition of a shot, or a particular line, or the use of a piece of music, or a striking juxtaposition of scenes\u201d.</p> <p>Agreeing on his film of the week with his editor at the <em>Observer</em>, he gets his notes in order on the train home and writes his column on Wednesday morning. Kermode admits to finding writing \u201cthe most stressful thing on Earth\u201d. After filing at 1pm, \u201cI worry away at it for the rest of the afternoon while subbing queries come in. And then it goes off on Thursday and I am filled with the belief that what I\u2019ve written is the stupidest thing anyone has ever written ever and it will bring the newspaper to its knees. Then it comes out on Sunday and it starts all over again.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of this, Kermode\u2019s love of film criticism runs deep. As a kid, growing up in Hertfordshire, he used to keep notes of all the films he watched. Now, in his home office crammed with movie memorabilia, books and DVDs, he is adamant the form remains as vital and relevant as ever in the social media age.</p> <p>He welcomes one significant change. \u201cThere have always been brilliant female film critics, but I think people finally started to realise that the fact that a room full of the same ageing white blokes wasn\u2019t doing anybody any good.\u201d His <em>Observer</em> deputies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/wendy-ide\" title=\"\">Wendy Ide</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simran-hans\" title=\"\">Simran Hans</a> are, he says, brilliant. \u201cWorking with them makes me constantly up my game.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The career moment I\u2019ll never forget</strong><br>\u201cThe Sunday that the first review I wrote for the <em>Observer</em> came out, I remember sitting with the paper open on the kitchen table, just looking at it going: \u201cI\u2019ve arrived.\u201d I thought to myself, look, I\u2019m in the <em>Observer</em>, I must know what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Laura Cumming<br><em><strong>Art critic for the Observer since 1990</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a91b23d22dace6f5d3269ba349e1db173c7b4b8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a91b23d22dace6f5d3269ba349e1db173c7b4b8a/0_0_4854_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Cumming at home in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Cumming at home in London, in front of a painting by her father.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt seems to me it comes in three stages,\u201d says Laura Cumming of the process of reviewing art for the <em>Observer New Review</em>. \u201cFirst, there\u2019s the exhilaration of seeing the show. Then there\u2019s the torture of thinking it through; and finally the torture is relieved by the writing.\u201d</p> <p>Cumming has been working through these stages on an almost weekly basis for more than 20 years. Born in Edinburgh to artist parents, she studied English literature at university and started out as a producer and presenter for the BBC. Her deeply held interest in art was channelled first through radio shows on painting and then through writing for the <em>New Statesman</em> and the <em>Guardian</em> before she became the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s art critic in 1999.</p> <p>Over the years, Cumming has taken great pleasure in witnessing artists embrace \u201cfilm and video and performance and installation and ballet, and every other field that has come into art to enrich it\u201d \u2013 and she still feels exhilarated every time she goes to a gallery. \u201cThe prospect of each new show,\u201d she says, \u201cis like virgin snow.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Thank God for deadlines. I love the clarity they impose on your thought</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She prepares by poring over the catalogue and soaking up everything else she can find about the artist, from books to online video clips. Then she goes to a critics\u2019 preview, usually on the weekend before her review comes out. Making notes and sketches with pen and paper, she also uses her phone to \u201cphotograph astonishing details that I know I will never see again \u2013 I\u2019ve got billions of them stored away\u201d.</p> <p>Occasionally, she\u2019ll catch herself saying out loud things like \u201cshocking, shocking\u201d or \u201cfor God\u2019s sake!\u201d, but there\u2019s rarely anyone around to hear it, because, as she acknowledges: \u201cWe see exhibitions when the galleries are completely empty, which is of course both an enormous privilege and an unreality.\u201d</p> <p>Back home, in south London, she commits her notes to laptop and lets it sit, usually overnight, while she wrestles with \u201cthe thinking bit, which is the torture\u201d. Then comes the release. \u201cI write in our bedroom in the loft \u2013 I don\u2019t have a study,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I write a lot in bed, because I don\u2019t really have a desk either.\u201d The words come slowly. Reviewing a Jackson Pollock retrospective early in her career, she spent eight hours writing and rewriting the first paragraph. \u201cSo thank God for deadlines,\u201d she says. \u201cI love deadlines. I love the clarity they impose on your thought.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s striking about her home in Clapham, which I visited before the coronavirus outbreak, is how little art there is on the walls. She has some reproductions of prints, notably \u201ca blow-up of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/26/velazquez-las-meninas-everything-is-happening-extract-michael-jacobs\" title=\"\">Las Meninas</a></em> [by Vel\u00e1zquez] on a big card, which I love looking at\u201d, but otherwise it\u2019s mainly work by her parents \u2013 her father James\u2019s geometrical paintings (an example is in the photograph above), her mother Betty\u2019s tapestries. \u201cI don\u2019t collect art,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not acquisitive. I\u2019m much happier seeing it in its natural state in the wild, in the gallery, rather than in my house.\u201d</p> <p>There are things that dismay her about her field. \u201cOne big change in the past couple of decades,\u201d she says, \u201chas been the crowning of curators \u2013 sometimes you are following a curator\u2019s mind rather than an artist\u2019s.\u201d She is suspicious of the commercial workings of the art world and tries to steer clear of curators, artists and publicists when seeing shows. \u201cOur job,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cis to be critics, not courtiers.\u201d</p> <p>For all that, reviewing for the <em>Observer</em> is a high point of Cumming\u2019s week, which is also taken up by authoring books (<em>On Chapel Sands</em>, her 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/23/on-chapel-sands-laura-cumming-extract-memoir-mother\" title=\"\">memoir-through-photography about her mother</a> has been shortlisted for many awards). Despite the torturous moments that precede the writing, \u201cit is not agonising,\u201d she insists. \u201cIt is an absolute privilege and a total joy.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The career moment I\u2019ll never forget</strong><br>\u201cIn 2006, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/oct/22/art\" title=\"\">the Vel\u00e1zquez exhibition at the National Gallery</a>, I came upon one of the paintings laid out on a table while conservators were trying to work out whether or not a fleck of paint had come off the surface. It was a scene like <em><a href=\"https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/the-collection/artworks/the-anatomy-lesson-of-dr-nicolaes-tulp-146/\" title=\"\">The Anatomy Lesson of Doctor Nicolaes Tulp</a></em>, with low lights over the painting and people in white gloves carefully examining whether or not they\u2019d lost a dot of light on the hem of an infanta\u2019s gown. They hadn\u2019t, as it turned out, but to be in the room and be able to see what they were looking at in such close-up was extraordinary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Bidisha<br><em><strong>Observer dance critic since 2019</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4e5e0a792a3f4b71746afea5cbd49070cb6a2361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e5e0a792a3f4b71746afea5cbd49070cb6a2361/0_0_3455_4523/764.jpg\" alt=\"Bidisha in her garden.\" width=\"764\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bidisha in her garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bidisha has written about books, art, film and music since she was a teenager, but when she became a regular dance critic last year, a role she shares with the critic Sarah Crompton, she almost couldn\u2019t figure out how to handle it. \u201cEvery single person I spoke to said: \u2018Don\u2019t you realise it\u2019s absolutely the dream job?\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd I realised that my feeling was actually just sheer disbelief that I get paid to do something that doesn\u2019t feel like work at all.\u201d</p> <p>The role fits seamlessly with her wider career as a journalist, writer and film-maker \u2013 and her natural night-owl tendencies. \u201cI get home at 11, so if you finish by two that\u2019s just a normal bedtime,\u201d she says. \u201cThe most fun thing is coming home, making the decaf coffee, and then sitting at the computer. The street\u2019s really quiet; your thoughts are really clear.\u201d</p> <p>Her pre-virus morning routine may prompt howls of jealousy in those working nine to five: she usually sleeps till 10.30. \u201cThat\u2019s the norm \u2013 but I get most done in the evenings, I\u2019m most awake then.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I love to people-watch beforehand \u2013 dance audiences are the most fabulously dressed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bidisha also finds it rather helpful to have to go out a few nights a week. \u201cI love to work from home because you just get so much more done. But we\u2019re living in a time of increasing atomisation, where we watch films on our laptops, we watch TV on our laptops, we read at home, so being pulled out is incredibly valuable.\u201d</p> <p>Plus writing about dance has a fruitful impact on her own creative practice of making short films: \u201cYou learn so much about how to present something dramatic from dance. It\u2019s teaching me a lot about lighting and music and costume, about editing and storytelling.\u201d</p> <p>If she\u2019s reviewing in the evening, Bidisha will spend the day catching up with life admin before heading to the theatre for 7pm. \u201cI love to people-watch beforehand \u2013 dance audiences are the most fabulously dressed,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She\u2019ll take \u201cvery complete\u201d notes during the performance, so that almost the whole review is in her notebook by the end. Writing it up involves topping and tailing with context and interpretation. \u201cBut I\u2019m very, very against obscurantism,\u201d she says vehemently.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of critics fall into the trap of saying \u2018Well, this Beethoven was nothing like when I saw it in New York in 1974\u2019. It\u2019s a form of willy-measuring, and I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p> <p>Bidisha\u2019s approach is simply to describe the movement. \u201cPeople think you need a special kind of vocabulary for dance, which you don\u2019t at all. You don\u2019t have to find a story; just sit back and enjoy it. And that\u2019s what I try to do.\u201d</p> <p>But for all the joy, criticism is still a job. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped going with friends because they\u2019re a bad influence! We always wound up having two martinis and dinner at 11. Now I eat enough at five so I\u2019m full during the performance, then have hot skimmed milk when I get home if I\u2019m peckish.\u201d</p> <p>She also tries to leave as quickly as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not a night out, so I just want to pack up the stuff, and beat the rush for the exit.\u201d That means that she \u2013 and the other critics, usually sat on the ends of the row \u2013 scoot out without applauding. \u201cAnd it\u2019s because we\u2019re cynical, jaded hacks,\u201d she admits. \u201cHow many times can you possibly clap for a thing?\u201d <br><strong>Interview by Holly Williams</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Rowan Moore<br><em><strong>Observer architecture critic since 2010</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7d57fa3679249d07696c507a96716cc408203aa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d57fa3679249d07696c507a96716cc408203aa9/0_736_4676_2806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rowan Moore at home in east London, in the extension, by 6a architects, designed for his late wife.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rowan Moore at home in east London, in the extension, by 6a architects, designed for his late wife.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before Rowan Moore became a full-time architecture critic, he worked on the other side of the fence, training as an architect and co-running his own practice until 1994. Though he went on to edit <em>Blueprint</em> magazine and review for the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> and <em>Evening </em><em>Standard</em> \u2013 as well as heading up the Architecture Foundation from 2002 to 2008 \u2013 his early experience helped him appreciate the difficulties of the profession from the inside. \u201cAlthough I criticise architects,\u201d he says, \u201cI think to put up a building that has some kind of intention to it, that realises an idea, is a hugely impressive achievement.\u201d</p> <p>Moore, who joined the <em>Observer</em> in 2010, considers it his job to weigh up \u201cbroader issues around architecture as well as architecture itself\u201d. Instead of simply writing about \u201ca single work by a master of the art form\u201d, he\u2019ll think carefully about the people who move through the building, the area in which it stands, and the social, political and economic factors that shaped it.</p> <p>One unusual aspect of his job is that \u2013 unlike other forms of criticism that, in normal times, depend on a weekly schedule of releases \u2013 it\u2019s not always clear what he\u2019ll write about. Sometimes, in the absence of a new building or exhibition to assess, \u201cit\u2019s a case of making your own story\u201d, he says. Lately, this has meant taking aim at Tory planning policies or surveying architectural responses to the climate crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just wander around with my laptop and write wherever I fancy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another difference is that Moore\u2019s job often involves speaking to the people whose work he\u2019s critiquing. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in writing about buildings as magical objects that just appear one day, because they\u2019re always there for a reason, or many reasons,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I talk to people \u2013 clients as well as architects \u2013 and ask them what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d</p> <p>He jots all this down in a notebook and snaps details with his phone, before heading home to write \u2013 ideally over a couple of days so he can take a fresh look at his copy before filing. Having previously worked on daily newspapers with fast turnarounds, Moore finds it \u201ca fantastic luxury on the <em>Observer</em> to be able to take more time over articles\u201d.</p> <p>He\u2019s susceptible to the odd bit of procrastination \u2013 \u201cI distract myself by looking at football results and the news\u201d \u2013 but when it comes to writing Moore doesn\u2019t seem at all precious. \u201cI can write with noise in the background,\u201d he says, and at home in Whitechapel, east London, \u201cI just wander around with my laptop and write wherever I fancy.\u201d</p> <p>There is plenty of space to wander around in: his home consists of two smallish 1830s terraced houses joined together, with dividing walls removed on the ground floor so that the kitchen opens into a spacious living room with a huge desert-scape by his painter friend Jock McFadyen on the wall.</p> <p>At the back is a long, gently sloping extension which was added to accommodate Moore\u2019s late wife, who was diagnosed with MS in her mid-30s. By 2011, she was using a wheelchair and no longer able to access the bedroom and bathroom upstairs. \u201cThe extension was about giving her everything she needed without any steps,\u201d says Moore.</p> <p>It was also about \u201cenhancing the house rather than the opposite\u201d. When architects design for disability, \u201cthere\u2019s still a bit of an attitude that if you\u2019re fixing somebody\u2019s practical problem, they should be grateful for it,\u201d says Moore, \u201ceven if it\u2019s really ugly and messes up the house.\u201d With this extension, which slopes gracefully down to a bedroom and bathroom, opening on to a garden with decked pathways amid sumac and eucalyptus trees, Moore and his wife, who died in 2017, were challenging that view.</p> <p>In its joyful layering of different periods, the house repudiates one of Moore\u2019s pet hates in architecture. \u201cWhen I started out in the 80s, the dominant narrative was: modern architects have messed everything up,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNow lots of people get the idea that modern design can do something for you. But it\u2019s the opposition of modern and old that I find very unhelpful.\u201d</p> <p>Though he expresses strong views in his columns, and mostly regrets \u201cthe ones when I was too nice \u2013 when I tried too hard to be positive in a situation where it wasn\u2019t warranted\u201d, Moore doesn\u2019t regard himself as a \u201cfinal arbiter\u201d on any given project. \u201cI have a viewpoint that I think has a validity, because I know about this subject and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at buildings,\u201d he says. \u201cBut whatever I write, it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all \u2013 it\u2019s a contribution to an ongoing process of understanding architecture.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The career moment I\u2019ll never forget</strong><br>In 1986, after finishing university, he went to Los Angeles to write some magazine articles, which put him in contact with Frank Gehry and other interesting architects. \u201cThe climate in Britain at that time was extremely suspicious of new architecture, so it was really exciting and encouraging to go to California, where there was a very positive view and really interesting things going on. It gave me a lot of faith that new buildings could be good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Susannah Clapp<br><em><strong>Theatre critic for the Observer since 1997</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd77ce7e1efb13ae3a69ed913602df6caeb8cfed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd77ce7e1efb13ae3a69ed913602df6caeb8cfed/0_0_4788_3591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susannah Clapp at her home in King\u2019s Cross, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susannah Clapp at her home in King\u2019s Cross, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSideways,\u201d is how Susannah Clapp describes her route into writing about theatre. In 1994, after years of working in and around the publishing industry \u2013 she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/london-review-of-books-at-40-susannah-clapp\" title=\"\">helped found the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/london-review-of-books-at-40-susannah-clapp\" title=\"\">London Review of Books</a></em> and wrote a biography of the writer Bruce Chatwin \u2013 she was asked to review plays for the BBC Radio 3 arts programme <em>Night Waves</em>, a gig that involved dashing straight from the theatre to deliver a \u201cmatch report\u201d on the latest stage action. Moving into print, Clapp reviewed for the <em>New Statesman</em> before becoming chief theatre critic for the <em>Observer</em> in 1997.</p> <p>Having spent so much time focusing on the written word, \u201cit was exciting to work in something which also required you to think about how things <em>looked</em>,\u201d she recalls. \u201cTheatre involves so many different reactions \u2013 acoustic, visual, working out how people\u2019s gestures influence or interrupt what they say \u2013 all of which is instantaneous and can\u2019t be captured instantaneously in a book.\u201d</p> <p>One of her aims, starting out, was to avoid writing literary reviews \u201cwhich suggested that plays were composed of cut-out text walking around the stage\u201d. Instead, she wanted \u201cto write about [characters] as if you\u2019re writing about an enhanced group of friends, or enemies, a hyperactive piece of life, and I suppose that\u2019s joy of it \u2013 that, at its best, theatre either takes you out of your life or further into it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always think about the first thing I\u2019d say to describe a play to a friend</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fact that \u201cthere are so many different things going on at the same time\u201d on the stage is endlessly compelling. \u201cEven if you\u2019re squirming with boredom or frustration, you can isolate an element of design, or the one actor who elevates it \u2013 and if it\u2019s simply a travesty, that in itself is interesting.\u201d</p> <p>For her <em>Observer</em> column, Clapp usually reviews three plays per week. This involves a considerable amount of pre-planning \u2013 she keeps a \u201clong, obsessive list\u201d of forthcoming openings around the country. Even when the week ahead has been finalised, she can never be quite sure, until she\u2019s seen them all, which of the three plays will be her lead review. As a result, \u201cthe major part of the writing always gets done at the last minute\u201d.</p> <p>She makes notes in the theatre, \u201cbut they\u2019re often unreadable because I don\u2019t have very good handwriting\u201d, she says. \u201cQuite often, I forget to turn over the page and I find that I\u2019ve written my already indecipherable scrawl on top of something else \u2013 but I hope that the act of writing fixes it in my mind.\u201d She tries to identify her \u201cline\u201d on the play in the same night \u2013 \u201cjust simply, whether I liked it or not. And what is the first thing I would say about this if I were describing it to a friend?\u201d</p> <p>There are a number of small but niggling dilemmas that accompany a theatre critic through her week. The hours are odd \u2013 you\u2019re starting work when others are clocking off \u2013 and the timing of dinner is often fraught. \u201cDo you eat beforehand and risk getting sleepy? On the other hand, if you go hungry, and there\u2019s a play with a lot of eating in it, it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s odd, too, rubbing shoulders with fellow critics night after night \u2013 \u201cwe share a vocabulary, we share a task, though we\u2019re not exactly colleagues\u201d \u2013 while having to resist discussing the play at hand, lest it sway your opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the most male profession I\u2019ve ever worked in \u2013 much more male and, of course, white than broadcasting or publishing or literary journalism. It\u2019s changing now, but very slowly.\u201d</p> <p>Home is a flat overlooking a square near King\u2019s Cross, London. Here Clapp does most of her writing in her front room, which is lined with play texts, theatrical biographies and reference books, though she sometimes works in a cafe or library. \u201cI am a big believer in walking as writing (or vice versa),\u201d she says. \u201cIf I get stuck, I charge around the square and often find a sentence slips into place. I work out what I think more easily on the hoof \u2013 going to or from the theatre, or emptying the rubbish \u2013 than when stooped over my desk.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The career moment I\u2019ll never forget</strong><br>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/oct/29/theatre\" title=\"\">Punchdrunk\u2019s site-specific production of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/oct/29/theatre\" title=\"\">Faust</a></em> in a warehouse in Wapping \u2013 a meticulously created Edward Hopper world with bubbling test tubes and stinky herbs and extraordinarily fragrant pine forests.

      "bodyText": "Mark Kermode Chief film critic for the Observer since 2013 \u201cEvery now and then, in the middle of Tuesday afternoon, when you\u2019ve seen a run of really bad films \u2013 Mighty Pups, say, followed by some terrible Michael Bay movie \u2013 and you\u2019re scuttling from one screening room to another, and it\u2019s raining, and you\u2019ve got a deadline, and you\u2019ve been up since 5am, and you think: \u2018Ohhh, life is so hard!\u2019 But then you go: \u2018Hang on a minute\u2026\u2019\u201d Mark Kermode takes a breath and reflects on his professional fortunes. \u201cWhen I went to the school careers office, they told me I should probably work in an insurance office. Instead,\u201d \u2013 he draws the next six words out for emphasis \u2013 \u201cI watch films for a living. Which is astonishing to me. I should never ever complain about the job that I have, because I have the best job in the world.\u201d Kermode got the job as the Observer\u2019s chief film critic in 2013, taking over from the late, great Philip French, who was retiring after 50 years in the role. Prior to that, he had written for Time Out, NME and Fangoria, as well as broadcasting about film for the BBC and Channel 4. Each new gig delighted him, but when the Observer first got in touch in 2003, asking him to fill in while French was away, Kermode recalls being \u201ccompletely overwhelmed\u201d by the opportunity. (Aptly, given his love of horror films, his first review was of the Japanese chiller Dark Water.) Every Monday and Tuesday, in normal times, Kermode travels to London from the New Forest, where he lives with his wife, the film studies professor Linda Ruth Williams, and watches eight or nine films in Soho\u2019s screening rooms. He takes notes as he watches \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t use a light-up pen or any of that nonsense, I just taught myself to write in the dark\u201d \u2013 jotting down things that particularly strike him, \u201clike the composition of a shot, or a particular line, or the use of a piece of music, or a striking juxtaposition of scenes\u201d. Agreeing on his film of the week with his editor at the Observer, he gets his notes in order on the train home and writes his column on Wednesday morning. Kermode admits to finding writing \u201cthe most stressful thing on Earth\u201d. After filing at 1pm, \u201cI worry away at it for the rest of the afternoon while subbing queries come in. And then it goes off on Thursday and I am filled with the belief that what I\u2019ve written is the stupidest thing anyone has ever written ever and it will bring the newspaper to its knees. Then it comes out on Sunday and it starts all over again.\u201d In spite of this, Kermode\u2019s love of film criticism runs deep. As a kid, growing up in Hertfordshire, he used to keep notes of all the films he watched. Now, in his home office crammed with movie memorabilia, books and DVDs, he is adamant the form remains as vital and relevant as ever in the social media age. He welcomes one significant change. \u201cThere have always been brilliant female film critics, but I think people finally started to realise that the fact that a room full of the same ageing white blokes wasn\u2019t doing anybody any good.\u201d His Observer deputies Wendy Ide and Simran Hans are, he says, brilliant. \u201cWorking with them makes me constantly up my game.\u201d The career moment I\u2019ll never forget \u201cThe Sunday that the first review I wrote for the Observer came out, I remember sitting with the paper open on the kitchen table, just looking at it going: \u201cI\u2019ve arrived.\u201d I thought to myself, look, I\u2019m in the Observer, I must know what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Laura Cumming Art critic for the Observer since 1990 \u201cIt seems to me it comes in three stages,\u201d says Laura Cumming of the process of reviewing art for the Observer New Review. \u201cFirst, there\u2019s the exhilaration of seeing the show. Then there\u2019s the torture of thinking it through; and finally the torture is relieved by the writing.\u201d Cumming has been working through these stages on an almost weekly basis for more than 20 years. Born in Edinburgh to artist parents, she studied English literature at university and started out as a producer and presenter for the BBC. Her deeply held interest in art was channelled first through radio shows on painting and then through writing for the New Statesman and the Guardian before she became the Observer\u2019s art critic in 1999. Over the years, Cumming has taken great pleasure in witnessing artists embrace \u201cfilm and video and performance and installation and ballet, and every other field that has come into art to enrich it\u201d \u2013 and she still feels exhilarated every time she goes to a gallery. \u201cThe prospect of each new show,\u201d she says, \u201cis like virgin snow.\u201d She prepares by poring over the catalogue and soaking up everything else she can find about the artist, from books to online video clips. Then she goes to a critics\u2019 preview, usually on the weekend before her review comes out. Making notes and sketches with pen and paper, she also uses her phone to \u201cphotograph astonishing details that I know I will never see again \u2013 I\u2019ve got billions of them stored away\u201d. Occasionally, she\u2019ll catch herself saying out loud things like \u201cshocking, shocking\u201d or \u201cfor God\u2019s sake!\u201d, but there\u2019s rarely anyone around to hear it, because, as she acknowledges: \u201cWe see exhibitions when the galleries are completely empty, which is of course both an enormous privilege and an unreality.\u201d Back home, in south London, she commits her notes to laptop and lets it sit, usually overnight, while she wrestles with \u201cthe thinking bit, which is the torture\u201d. Then comes the release. \u201cI write in our bedroom in the loft \u2013 I don\u2019t have a study,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I write a lot in bed, because I don\u2019t really have a desk either.\u201d The words come slowly. Reviewing a Jackson Pollock retrospective early in her career, she spent eight hours writing and rewriting the first paragraph. \u201cSo thank God for deadlines,\u201d she says. \u201cI love deadlines. I love the clarity they impose on your thought.\u201d What\u2019s striking about her home in Clapham, which I visited before the coronavirus outbreak, is how little art there is on the walls. She has some reproductions of prints, notably \u201ca blow-up of Las Meninas [by Vel\u00e1zquez] on a big card, which I love looking at\u201d, but otherwise it\u2019s mainly work by her parents \u2013 her father James\u2019s geometrical paintings (an example is in the photograph above), her mother Betty\u2019s tapestries. \u201cI don\u2019t collect art,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not acquisitive. I\u2019m much happier seeing it in its natural state in the wild, in the gallery, rather than in my house.\u201d There are things that dismay her about her field. \u201cOne big change in the past couple of decades,\u201d she says, \u201chas been the crowning of curators \u2013 sometimes you are following a curator\u2019s mind rather than an artist\u2019s.\u201d She is suspicious of the commercial workings of the art world and tries to steer clear of curators, artists and publicists when seeing shows. \u201cOur job,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cis to be critics, not courtiers.\u201d For all that, reviewing for the Observer is a high point of Cumming\u2019s week, which is also taken up by authoring books (On Chapel Sands, her 2019 memoir-through-photography about her mother has been shortlisted for many awards). Despite the torturous moments that precede the writing, \u201cit is not agonising,\u201d she insists. \u201cIt is an absolute privilege and a total joy.\u201d The career moment I\u2019ll never forget \u201cIn 2006, before the Vel\u00e1zquez exhibition at the National Gallery, I came upon one of the paintings laid out on a table while conservators were trying to work out whether or not a fleck of paint had come off the surface. It was a scene like The Anatomy Lesson of Doctor Nicolaes Tulp, with low lights over the painting and people in white gloves carefully examining whether or not they\u2019d lost a dot of light on the hem of an infanta\u2019s gown. They hadn\u2019t, as it turned out, but to be in the room and be able to see what they were looking at in such close-up was extraordinary.\u201d Bidisha Observer dance critic since 2019 Bidisha has written about books, art, film and music since she was a teenager, but when she became a regular dance critic last year, a role she shares with the critic Sarah Crompton, she almost couldn\u2019t figure out how to handle it. \u201cEvery single person I spoke to said: \u2018Don\u2019t you realise it\u2019s absolutely the dream job?\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd I realised that my feeling was actually just sheer disbelief that I get paid to do something that doesn\u2019t feel like work at all.\u201d The role fits seamlessly with her wider career as a journalist, writer and film-maker \u2013 and her natural night-owl tendencies. \u201cI get home at 11, so if you finish by two that\u2019s just a normal bedtime,\u201d she says. \u201cThe most fun thing is coming home, making the decaf coffee, and then sitting at the computer. The street\u2019s really quiet; your thoughts are really clear.\u201d Her pre-virus morning routine may prompt howls of jealousy in those working nine to five: she usually sleeps till 10.30. \u201cThat\u2019s the norm \u2013 but I get most done in the evenings, I\u2019m most awake then.\u201d Bidisha also finds it rather helpful to have to go out a few nights a week. \u201cI love to work from home because you just get so much more done. But we\u2019re living in a time of increasing atomisation, where we watch films on our laptops, we watch TV on our laptops, we read at home, so being pulled out is incredibly valuable.\u201d Plus writing about dance has a fruitful impact on her own creative practice of making short films: \u201cYou learn so much about how to present something dramatic from dance. It\u2019s teaching me a lot about lighting and music and costume, about editing and storytelling.\u201d If she\u2019s reviewing in the evening, Bidisha will spend the day catching up with life admin before heading to the theatre for 7pm. \u201cI love to people-watch beforehand \u2013 dance audiences are the most fabulously dressed,\u201d she says. She\u2019ll take \u201cvery complete\u201d notes during the performance, so that almost the whole review is in her notebook by the end. Writing it up involves topping and tailing with context and interpretation. \u201cBut I\u2019m very, very against obscurantism,\u201d she says vehemently. \u201cA lot of critics fall into the trap of saying \u2018Well, this Beethoven was nothing like when I saw it in New York in 1974\u2019. It\u2019s a form of willy-measuring, and I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d Bidisha\u2019s approach is simply to describe the movement. \u201cPeople think you need a special kind of vocabulary for dance, which you don\u2019t at all. You don\u2019t have to find a story; just sit back and enjoy it. And that\u2019s what I try to do.\u201d But for all the joy, criticism is still a job. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped going with friends because they\u2019re a bad influence! We always wound up having two martinis and dinner at 11. Now I eat enough at five so I\u2019m full during the performance, then have hot skimmed milk when I get home if I\u2019m peckish.\u201d She also tries to leave as quickly as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not a night out, so I just want to pack up the stuff, and beat the rush for the exit.\u201d That means that she \u2013 and the other critics, usually sat on the ends of the row \u2013 scoot out without applauding. \u201cAnd it\u2019s because we\u2019re cynical, jaded hacks,\u201d she admits. \u201cHow many times can you possibly clap for a thing?\u201d Interview by Holly Williams Rowan Moore Observer architecture critic since 2010 Before Rowan Moore became a full-time architecture critic, he worked on the other side of the fence, training as an architect and co-running his own practice until 1994. Though he went on to edit Blueprint magazine and review for the Daily Telegraph and Evening Standard \u2013 as well as heading up the Architecture Foundation from 2002 to 2008 \u2013 his early experience helped him appreciate the difficulties of the profession from the inside. \u201cAlthough I criticise architects,\u201d he says, \u201cI think to put up a building that has some kind of intention to it, that realises an idea, is a hugely impressive achievement.\u201d Moore, who joined the Observer in 2010, considers it his job to weigh up \u201cbroader issues around architecture as well as architecture itself\u201d. Instead of simply writing about \u201ca single work by a master of the art form\u201d, he\u2019ll think carefully about the people who move through the building, the area in which it stands, and the social, political and economic factors that shaped it. One unusual aspect of his job is that \u2013 unlike other forms of criticism that, in normal times, depend on a weekly schedule of releases \u2013 it\u2019s not always clear what he\u2019ll write about. Sometimes, in the absence of a new building or exhibition to assess, \u201cit\u2019s a case of making your own story\u201d, he says. Lately, this has meant taking aim at Tory planning policies or surveying architectural responses to the climate crisis. Another difference is that Moore\u2019s job often involves speaking to the people whose work he\u2019s critiquing. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in writing about buildings as magical objects that just appear one day, because they\u2019re always there for a reason, or many reasons,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I talk to people \u2013 clients as well as architects \u2013 and ask them what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d He jots all this down in a notebook and snaps details with his phone, before heading home to write \u2013 ideally over a couple of days so he can take a fresh look at his copy before filing. Having previously worked on daily newspapers with fast turnarounds, Moore finds it \u201ca fantastic luxury on the Observer to be able to take more time over articles\u201d. He\u2019s susceptible to the odd bit of procrastination \u2013 \u201cI distract myself by looking at football results and the news\u201d \u2013 but when it comes to writing Moore doesn\u2019t seem at all precious. \u201cI can write with noise in the background,\u201d he says, and at home in Whitechapel, east London, \u201cI just wander around with my laptop and write wherever I fancy.\u201d There is plenty of space to wander around in: his home consists of two smallish 1830s terraced houses joined together, with dividing walls removed on the ground floor so that the kitchen opens into a spacious living room with a huge desert-scape by his painter friend Jock McFadyen on the wall. At the back is a long, gently sloping extension which was added to accommodate Moore\u2019s late wife, who was diagnosed with MS in her mid-30s. By 2011, she was using a wheelchair and no longer able to access the bedroom and bathroom upstairs. \u201cThe extension was about giving her everything she needed without any steps,\u201d says Moore. It was also about \u201cenhancing the house rather than the opposite\u201d. When architects design for disability, \u201cthere\u2019s still a bit of an attitude that if you\u2019re fixing somebody\u2019s practical problem, they should be grateful for it,\u201d says Moore, \u201ceven if it\u2019s really ugly and messes up the house.\u201d With this extension, which slopes gracefully down to a bedroom and bathroom, opening on to a garden with decked pathways amid sumac and eucalyptus trees, Moore and his wife, who died in 2017, were challenging that view. In its joyful layering of different periods, the house repudiates one of Moore\u2019s pet hates in architecture. \u201cWhen I started out in the 80s, the dominant narrative was: modern architects have messed everything up,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNow lots of people get the idea that modern design can do something for you. But it\u2019s the opposition of modern and old that I find very unhelpful.\u201d Though he expresses strong views in his columns, and mostly regrets \u201cthe ones when I was too nice \u2013 when I tried too hard to be positive in a situation where it wasn\u2019t warranted\u201d, Moore doesn\u2019t regard himself as a \u201cfinal arbiter\u201d on any given project. \u201cI have a viewpoint that I think has a validity, because I know about this subject and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at buildings,\u201d he says. \u201cBut whatever I write, it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all \u2013 it\u2019s a contribution to an ongoing process of understanding architecture.\u201d The career moment I\u2019ll never forget In 1986, after finishing university, he went to Los Angeles to write some magazine articles, which put him in contact with Frank Gehry and other interesting architects. \u201cThe climate in Britain at that time was extremely suspicious of new architecture, so it was really exciting and encouraging to go to California, where there was a very positive view and really interesting things going on. It gave me a lot of faith that new buildings could be good.\u201d Susannah Clapp Theatre critic for the Observer since 1997 \u201cSideways,\u201d is how Susannah Clapp describes her route into writing about theatre. In 1994, after years of working in and around the publishing industry \u2013 she helped found the London Review of Books and wrote a biography of the writer Bruce Chatwin \u2013 she was asked to review plays for the BBC Radio 3 arts programme Night Waves, a gig that involved dashing straight from the theatre to deliver a \u201cmatch report\u201d on the latest stage action. Moving into print, Clapp reviewed for the New Statesman before becoming chief theatre critic for the Observer in 1997. Having spent so much time focusing on the written word, \u201cit was exciting to work in something which also required you to think about how things looked,\u201d she recalls. \u201cTheatre involves so many different reactions \u2013 acoustic, visual, working out how people\u2019s gestures influence or interrupt what they say \u2013 all of which is instantaneous and can\u2019t be captured instantaneously in a book.\u201d One of her aims, starting out, was to avoid writing literary reviews \u201cwhich suggested that plays were composed of cut-out text walking around the stage\u201d. Instead, she wanted \u201cto write about [characters] as if you\u2019re writing about an enhanced group of friends, or enemies, a hyperactive piece of life, and I suppose that\u2019s joy of it \u2013 that, at its best, theatre either takes you out of your life or further into it.\u201d The fact that \u201cthere are so many different things going on at the same time\u201d on the stage is endlessly compelling. \u201cEven if you\u2019re squirming with boredom or frustration, you can isolate an element of design, or the one actor who elevates it \u2013 and if it\u2019s simply a travesty, that in itself is interesting.\u201d For her Observer column, Clapp usually reviews three plays per week. This involves a considerable amount of pre-planning \u2013 she keeps a \u201clong, obsessive list\u201d of forthcoming openings around the country. Even when the week ahead has been finalised, she can never be quite sure, until she\u2019s seen them all, which of the three plays will be her lead review. As a result, \u201cthe major part of the writing always gets done at the last minute\u201d. She makes notes in the theatre, \u201cbut they\u2019re often unreadable because I don\u2019t have very good handwriting\u201d, she says. \u201cQuite often, I forget to turn over the page and I find that I\u2019ve written my already indecipherable scrawl on top of something else \u2013 but I hope that the act of writing fixes it in my mind.\u201d She tries to identify her \u201cline\u201d on the play in the same night \u2013 \u201cjust simply, whether I liked it or not. And what is the first thing I would say about this if I were describing it to a friend?\u201d There are a number of small but niggling dilemmas that accompany a theatre critic through her week. The hours are odd \u2013 you\u2019re starting work when others are clocking off \u2013 and the timing of dinner is often fraught. \u201cDo you eat beforehand and risk getting sleepy? On the other hand, if you go hungry, and there\u2019s a play with a lot of eating in it, it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d It\u2019s odd, too, rubbing shoulders with fellow critics night after night \u2013 \u201cwe share a vocabulary, we share a task, though we\u2019re not exactly colleagues\u201d \u2013 while having to resist discussing the play at hand, lest it sway your opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the most male profession I\u2019ve ever worked in \u2013 much more male and, of course, white than broadcasting or publishing or literary journalism. It\u2019s changing now, but very slowly.\u201d Home is a flat overlooking a square near King\u2019s Cross, London. Here Clapp does most of her writing in her front room, which is lined with play texts, theatrical biographies and reference books, though she sometimes works in a cafe or library. \u201cI am a big believer in walking as writing (or vice versa),\u201d she says. \u201cIf I get stuck, I charge around the square and often find a sentence slips into place. I work out what I think more easily on the hoof \u2013 going to or from the theatre, or emptying the rubbish \u2013 than when stooped over my desk.\u201d The career moment I\u2019ll never forget \u201cPunchdrunk\u2019s site-specific production of Faust in a warehouse in Wapping \u2013 a meticulously created Edward Hopper world with bubbling test tubes and stinky herbs and extraordinarily fragrant pine forests. When I came out, I felt that my eyes and my body had been dismantled and put back together, and I looked at what I saw in a different way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As Donald Trump has pushed his shock policy reversal to try to soon get many Americans to go back to work, despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, he has been supported by a wide array of rightwing figures, business groups and conservative politicians. Some of those conservatives have taken the president\u2019s concerns over the dire health of the US economy a step further \u2013 suggesting that the inevitable deaths of many people to the virus might be an acceptable cost of doing business in the face of a shocking economic collapse that saw more than 3 million new people register for unemployment. \u201cMy message: let\u2019s get back to work, let\u2019s get back to living, let\u2019s be smart about it, and those of us who are 70-plus, we\u2019ll take care of ourselves,\u201d Dan Patrick, the Texas lieutenant governor, said last week on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News show. \u201cDon\u2019t sacrifice the country,\u201d Patrick continued. Patrick even suggested many older Americans would happily risk their lives for the sake of the economy. \u201cNo one reached out to me and said: \u2018As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren?\u2019\u201d Patrick also said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s the exchange, I\u2019m all in. That doesn\u2019t make me noble or brave or anything like that, I just think there are lots of grandparents out there in this country like me.\u201d The extreme rightwing media figure Glenn Beck shared the sentiment. \u201cI would rather have my children stay home and all of us who are over 50 go in and keep this economy going and working, even if we all get sick, I would rather die than kill the country. \u2019Cause it\u2019s not the economy that\u2019s dying, it\u2019s the country,\u201d Beck said on an episode of his program on Blaze TV. The Republican Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson also questioned whether the economic impact of physical distancing was worth it, appearing to rate the coronavirus threat as less than fatal car accidents. \u201cWe don\u2019t shut down our economy because tens of thousands of people die on the highways. It\u2019s a risk we accept so we can move about. We don\u2019t shut down our economies because tens of thousands of people die from the common flu.\u201d Johnson also said \u201cgetting coronavirus is not a death sentence except for maybe no more than 3.4% of our population, [and] I think probably far less\u201d. The rightwing Federalist magazine has also run stories urging Trump to get the economy going again and attacked Democrats \u2013 not the US president \u2013 for their reactions to the crisis. One article peddled the idea that \u201ca handful of Democratic activists created alarming, but bogus data sets to scare local and state officials into making rash, economy-killing mandates\u201d. Elsewhere business lobbying groups are also lobbying against economic shutdowns. The Tampa Bay Times reported that the Florida chamber of commerce has lobbied the Republican state governor, urging him not to take drastic measures that might shut down the state\u2019s economy. \u201cI don\u2019t think the data says we need to do a statewide shutdown,\u201d Mark Wilson, the chamber\u2019s CEO, told the paper. It is true that conservatives are not alone in their desire to stimulate the languishing economy. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, a longtime Trump foe, echoed the White House\u2019s desire to relaunch business. \u201cI take total responsibility for shutting off the economy in terms of essential workers but we also have to start to plan the pivot back to economic functionality,\u201d he told journalists in the state capital, Albany. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop the economy forever.\u201d But, Cuomo said on Tuesday that economic rebound should not be accompanied by death. \u201cIf you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it\u2019s no contest,\u201d he said. \u201cNo American is going to say, accelerate the economy at the cost of human life, because no American is going to say how much a life is worth.\u201d",

He\u2019s been helping friends and family \u2013 some of whom have been unable to work in bars and restaurants, or as domestic workers or caregivers \u2013 navigate the complex public benefit rules, reminding them that community health clinics and state health programs that aren\u2019t funded by the federal government are safe to use.</p> <p>The economic fallout from the pandemic could leave many immigrants in need of public assistance now, more than ever, Chao noted.

But she worries about her father, who still suffers from health complications after being stabbed in the stomach years ago, who has refused to see the doctor recently. \u201cHe\u2019s so afraid of seeking medical care for the virus, or for anything else,\u201d she said, tearing up. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my parents will fall sick.\u201d</p> <p>In an open <a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/ghjp/documents/final_covid-19_letter_from_public_health_and_legal_experts.pdf\">letter</a> to Mike Pence and other leaders, nearly 800 public health and legal experts urged officials to make healthcare facilities immigration enforcement-free zones.

But the president has encouraged a partisan divide on the coronavirus threat, analysts said, pitting state governors against each other and setting off bidding wars for medical equipment.</p> <p>While states and localities have primary responsibilities for public health under the American system of federalism, the president has an important role in focusing the national attention on the emergency and channeling the massive resources of the federal government to the states most in need, said Lawrence O Gostin, a professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>\u201cThis is something that\u2019s really unprecedented and clearly American federalism is not well equipped to do it. You need every oar to work together. We have fragmentation, name-calling and wildly different responses,\u201d Gostin said.</p> <p>Because past disasters were locally confined, states were able to help each other, by sending firefighters to combat wildfires in California, by sending first responders to help in New York after September 11, or by accepting refugees from Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>\u201cThis is almost like we have a hurricane,\u201d Maryland\u2019s governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican who has moved aggressively on coronavirus, said on the radio show of the former New Jersey governor on Thursday. \u201cBut it\u2019s hitting every single state in the country at the same time, and it\u2019s been hitting them for 21 days, at least in our state.\u201d</p> <p>Citizens judge the viral threat according to their politics, polling indicates. More Democrats than Republicans have told pollsters they were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about coronavirus by a <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ET_VgpgUcAEJ_7k.jpg\">20-point margin</a>. A poll <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/27/21195940/coronavirus-fox-news-poll-republicans-trump\">released</a> on Friday showed that viewers of conservative Fox News, which spent weeks downplaying and dismissing the virus, were much less likely to take the pandemic seriously.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that states can decide particular local issues on a wide range of things allows for such variation,\u201d said Pastor. \u201cThat\u2019s, of course, kind of stupid, in the context of the pandemic, because when one state has lax standards, then you wind up maintaining the infection in another location.\u201d</p> <p>The partisan divide over the pandemic probably stems in part from personal experience, with the worst-hit states so far, including New York, California and Washington, being coastal with large cities and a lot of Democrats. As of Thursday, counties that voted for Trump in 2016 accounted for 45% of the US population but just 19% of all US coronavirus deaths, according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1243201775869530113\">analysis</a> by Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6c8675a3baf0b8f9bfc80054d3cfd3e4170059b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6c8675a3baf0b8f9bfc80054d3cfd3e4170059b/0_136_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Desolate streets are seen in Dayton, Ohio, on Tuesday.

States with Republican governors, meanwhile, have been less eager to ask businesses to close, and more likely to downplay the threat. \u201cGo to the grocery stores. For crying out loud, go to the grocery stores,\u201d Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia told residents on 16 March. \u201cIf you want to go to Bob Evans and eat, go to Bob Evans and eat.\u201d The night before, Oklahoma\u2019s Governor Kevin Stitt tweeted a picture of himself and his two sons at a restaurant, boasting: \u201cIt\u2019s packed tonight.\u201d The tweet was later deleted. The divergence in state responses to coronavirus does not cleanly split along the red-blue line, with Republican governors in states such as Ohio and Maryland among the most proactive in responding to the threat, said University of Southern California professor Manuel Pastor. \u201cIt\u2019s more like the rational states versus the Trump Republican states,\u201d Pastor said. All partisan disagreements in the United States in 2020 seem to emanate from or end with Donald Trump. But the president has encouraged a partisan divide on the coronavirus threat, analysts said, pitting state governors against each other and setting off bidding wars for medical equipment. While states and localities have primary responsibilities for public health under the American system of federalism, the president has an important role in focusing the national attention on the emergency and channeling the massive resources of the federal government to the states most in need, said Lawrence O Gostin, a professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s really unprecedented and clearly American federalism is not well equipped to do it. You need every oar to work together. We have fragmentation, name-calling and wildly different responses,\u201d Gostin said. Because past disasters were locally confined, states were able to help each other, by sending firefighters to combat wildfires in California, by sending first responders to help in New York after September 11, or by accepting refugees from Hurricane Katrina. \u201cThis is almost like we have a hurricane,\u201d Maryland\u2019s governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican who has moved aggressively on coronavirus, said on the radio show of the former New Jersey governor on Thursday. \u201cBut it\u2019s hitting every single state in the country at the same time, and it\u2019s been hitting them for 21 days, at least in our state.\u201d Citizens judge the viral threat according to their politics, polling indicates. More Democrats than Republicans have told pollsters they were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about coronavirus by a 20-point margin. A poll released on Friday showed that viewers of conservative Fox News, which spent weeks downplaying and dismissing the virus, were much less likely to take the pandemic seriously. \u201cThe idea that states can decide particular local issues on a wide range of things allows for such variation,\u201d said Pastor. \u201cThat\u2019s, of course, kind of stupid, in the context of the pandemic, because when one state has lax standards, then you wind up maintaining the infection in another location.\u201d The partisan divide over the pandemic probably stems in part from personal experience, with the worst-hit states so far, including New York, California and Washington, being coastal with large cities and a lot of Democrats. As of Thursday, counties that voted for Trump in 2016 accounted for 45% of the US population but just 19% of all US coronavirus deaths, according to analysis by Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. That picture is likely to change in the coming weeks, however. Governors in some non-coastal states have taken aggressive action against the virus, including Kentucky\u2019s Andrew Beshear, a Democrat, and Ohio\u2019s Mike DeWine, a Republican. While Kentucky was quick to set up lab testing for the virus and declared a state of emergency on 6 March, the governor nextdoor, Republican Bill Lee of Tennessee, waited a week longer to declare a state of emergency. In Ohio, DeWine became one of the first governors in the country to order bars and restaurants to close and limit large gatherings, while the Democratic governor of neighboring Michigan was slower to issue restrictions. As of last week, Ohio had recorded 351 cases, compared with 1,035 for Michigan \u2013 although variations in testing obscure the picture. \u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to talk about a Covid epidemic in the United States,\u201d said Gostin. \u201cWe\u2019d have to say it\u2019s Covid epidemics. Because the epidemics will vary state by state, and the response will vary state by state.\u201d It is \u201ccrucially urgent\u201d for the Trump administration to coordinate aid for the states and for the president to use his bully pulpit to focus the national attention, said Gostin. \u201cThat should have been happening several weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer we wait without having a properly coordinated national approach the worse the disaster will unfold in the United States.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "For those of us lucky enough to be home safe and healthy during the coronavirus pandemic, group video platforms are making a heroic rise from last resort to daily routine. For me, they\u2019ve actually resulted in a busier social life than pre-coronavirus days. As I made it through week three of the #StayHome life, I tried five of the most popular. Here\u2019s my ranking, from worst to best. 5 Bunch What is it? A group video and games app that allows eight people. Price: Free, extra for more games. The experience: I tried this out with a couple of friends I have kept in touch with for five years across the various continents we\u2019ve lived on. Colorful and splashy, it includes trivia, a drawing game, a billiards game and something called Mars Dash. It\u2019s possible we\u2019re all getting bleary-eyed and dull in our self-isolation, but my normally intelligent friends found the trivia, notably the obscure questions about the Cincinnati Reds, to be exceptionally difficult. The billiards game, meanwhile, is awkward to play and almost as boring as the real thing. The app has a lot of bells and whistles \u2013 when you win a game, it sticks a crown on your head. But having to download some of the games the first time you play slows you down, and in these trying times, who has that kind of energy? In the end, the three of us just used it as a normal video chat and had a much better time. Worth it? Perhaps when you\u2019ve exhausted the other options. Rating: 2/5 4 FaceTime What is it? A mobile app native to iPhones, iPads and Mac desktops. Allows up to 32 people. Price: Free (as long as you\u2019re on the Apple train). The experience: I was today years old when I learned you can FaceTime with 32 people, and honestly, I\u2019m shocked. I have never been able to successfully FaceTime with more than three or four people, and I find it to be a perennial letdown. In fact, I sustained a long-distance relationship for one and a half years with my now husband on FaceTime, and it was probably the thing we fought about the most (try looking at the words \u201cpoor connection\u201d and not making them a metaphor). FaceTime is handy because it comes pre-installed if you have an iPhone, and you can use it internationally over a data connection, like WhatsApp. But I still think it\u2019s best when there are only two people on the call. Worth it? If you\u2019re an Apple person, yes. If not, don\u2019t buy an iPhone for this feature. Rating: 3/5 3 Google Hangouts What is it? A video platform that allows 25 people and can be accessed through an app, Gmail or other Google accounts. Price: Free. The experience: I have spent a lot of my life on Google Hangouts, probably because it\u2019s easy to access through Gmail, and I have my email open pretty much all the time. I\u2019ve used it in the quarantine era to workshop short stories with my fiction writing group and it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing \u2013 connectivity issues seem to be the norm, and you\u2019re almost always looking at one big face, rather than a grid, which doesn\u2019t make it easy if you\u2019re doing more collaborative activities. My pro tip for Google Hangouts is: open it in a pop-out window (there\u2019s a button to do so) rather than viewing it inside your inbox, so you\u2019re not checking email while spending quality time with your loved ones, which I swear I didn\u2019t do. Worth it? Why not? It\u2019s free and you probably already have it! Rating: 3/5 2 Houseparty What is it? According to my college-going brother-in-law, this video app with integrated games used to be cool, stopped being cool, and then became cool in the last few weeks again. It allows up to eight people. Price: Free, extra for more games. The experience: I first tried Houseparty when my family used it to celebrate a birthday. It\u2019s fairly easy to use after everyone signs up, though we found the interface a bit difficult to navigate at first, which meant we accidentally left \u201cparties\u201d and missed several rounds of a game. But once we got the hang of it we had a pretty chill time playing Heads Up! (which is like Apples to Apples), trivia, Quick Draw (akin to Pictionary) and Chips and Guac (sort of like Cards Against Humanity). This app, however, is definitely geared towards millennials and Gen-Z. For example, references to Lil Uzi Vert and the term \u201cdank\u201d were lost on some of our older players, and there are definitely some not-kid-friendly cards. At one point my eight-year-old niece was challenged to complete a song lyric. The right answer was Hennessy, which she chose. Good for her, but as far as alcoholic brand awareness goes, not ideal! Worth it? Yes, but treat it like an actual house party (the beer pong kind) because it\u2019s not for everyone. Rating: 4/5 1 Zoom What is it? Often used in business settings, Zoom allows up to 100 people on a call, and up to 500 if you pay for the expanded version.

In Bulgaria, the leader of the opposition Socialist party, Kornelia Ninova, lamented the suspension of parliament during the state of emergency as \u201cthe first step towards dictatorship\u201d. In Poland, the government has insisted it will go ahead with presidential elections on 10 May despite the pandemic. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the Polish parliament passed an amendment to the electoral code allowing senior citizens and anyone in quarantine to use postal voting. The opposition has called for a postponement, saying it will be impossible to campaign during a pandemic. Amid the political manoeuvring, the region is nervously awaiting the inevitable rise in cases and hoping the early lockdowns will help avoid Italian-style carnage. One positive is that like elsewhere, people have come together like never before to support beleaguered medics. \u201cI\u2019ve never received this many messages of warmth and gratitude and this amount of love throughout my career,\u201d said the doctor in Budapest, who has been working for several decades. \u201cI feel like this time our work is really appreciated.\u201d Additional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi and Martin Dimitrov \u2022 This article was amended on 31 March 2020, to add information about the Czech Republic testing widely for coronavirus.",

So anyone who doesn\u2019t need to be out of their home should be in the home. This is radical. The vast majority of Australians have done the right thing in the last week.

I should say at the outset that we are not Italy, we are not the United States, we are not Spain. We have one of the highest rates of testing per head of population in the world and one of the lowest positive test rates, so we think, unlike countries unfortunately like Italy, Iran and even the US, that when they detected significant outbreaks they probably had much, much larger outbreaks in the community that were undetected.</p> \n   <p>We feel reasonably confident that we are detecting a significant majority of the cases in Australia.

And by allowing the ability to consult a number of patients in the comfort of their own room, in their own home, in their own isolation, will allow a significant reduction in the amount of PPE required by doctors, nurses and all other frontline healthcare workers that will be taking part in telehealth.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T05:48:56.052Z\">at 6.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8031188f0878a2a48ac4d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T05:26:26.124Z\">6.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the past 24 hours Victorian police say they have conducted 1,430 checks that people are complying with quarantine rules.</p> \n  <p>That included 139 checks on returned travellers.

Next Saturday, New Zealand nationals will also be offered access to this flight.</p> \n  <p>People on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2712912542154556/\">Australians stranded in Nepal</a> Facebook page say they fear they will be trapped in the country because they cannot afford a ticket, or reach Kathmandu in time for the flight.</p> \n  <p>Michael Bonner, an Australian aid worker with Three Angels Nepal, a non-government organisation, said between 80 and 100 people turned up at the embassy at 9am Saturday local time hoping to organise a ticket home. He said many more were stranded in the Himalayas and other parts of the country and unable to reach Kathmandu in time because roads were closed.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a couple of hundred people who will make this flight and another couple of hundred stranded as the situation in the country deteriorates,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>He called on the government to delay the flight to give more Australians time to reach the capital.</p> \n  <p>In response to concerns expressed on the Facebook page, the Australian ambassador to Nepal, Pete Budd, said he understood people were frustrated, and the embassy had tried to achieve economies of scale by securing the largest possible aircraft.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMany Australians have been stretched financially having paid for bookings that were subsequently cancelled. The disinclination of insurers to cover cancellations due to Covid-19 or reluctance of airlines to offer refunds in a timely manner is not helping,\u201d Budd wrote.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe reality is that aircraft entering Nepal are not permitted to carry passengers. In all likelihood, once arrived in Sydney, the aircraft will also have to return to Doha empty. This adds to the cost. In the event there are future flights, if there are future flights, they are only likely to be more expensive.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor those Australians disinclined to pay the airfare, or those who are too financially stretched despite their best efforts to seek support from friends and family in Australia, my only advice at this point would be to find a safe place to settle.

Hospitality and entertainment businesses went dark a fortnight ago and retail slammed down the shutters last week. Hundreds of thousands of people have applied for unemployment benefits in a matter of days.</p> \n  <p>And many of those businesses that haven\u2019t already closed are screaming for government action to shut them down because staying open with no customers is rapidly sending them broke.</p> \n  <p>Soon, the fact that so much consumer spending has been ripped out of the economy will ripple through to other sectors such as the finance industry, which employs a large number of people, causing yet more job losses.</p> \n  <p>People who have been stood down do not have money to pay the rent or bills.<br>Businesses that have closed their doors do not have money to pay their landlords.<br>A wage subsidy could help solve the first problem.<br><br>After ruling out the idea, Cormann has now shifted ground somewhat. But what he actually promised was not a direct subsidy but \u201csignificantly enhanced income support through business\u201d.</p> \n  <p>And, pressed by host David Speers on whether this would be dependent on \u201ca requirement to keep staff employed\u201d, the best Cormann could manage was that \u201cthat would be the intention\u201d.</p> \n  <p>From Cormann\u2019s answers, it appears the government is intent on trying to shove more money through the funnel of the business tax system, in the hope that some of it reaches the pockets of workers.</p> \n  <p>This obsession with using the business tax system to push money into the economy was visible from the government\u2019s very first stimulus package, unveiled less than three weeks ago but long since rendered irrelevant by events.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s a very indirect way of getting money into people\u2019s pockets, and it\u2019s entirely unclear how it can help those who\u2019ve already been laid off. Let\u2019s hope it works.</p> \n  <p>Cormann dodged the question of what to do about preventing people from being evicted because they can\u2019t pay the rent \u2013 a question that has repeatedly been considered by the \u201cnational cabinet\u201d of state and federal leaders without anything being done.</p> \n  <p>On commercial rents, Cormann\u2019s evasions continued when asked whether billionaire retailer Solomon Lew was doing the right thing by refusing to pay his landlords. Unfortunately, Speers didn\u2019t follow up by pointing out that many other retailers and hospitality businesses are doing exactly the same as Lew.</p> \n  <p>And arguing about whether or not businesses should pay their rent is ultimately pointless. If they don\u2019t have the cash \u2013 and many don\u2019t \u2013 they won\u2019t because they can\u2019t.</p> \n  <p>Yes, these are hard problems to solve.

A moratorium on evictions from rental properties for the next six months on the basis of \u201cfinancial stress\u201d. People who are over 70, people with chronic illness over 60 and Indigenous people over 50 are strongly advised to stay home. Some new public areas \u2013 public playgrounds, outside gyms and skateparks \u2013 will be closed from tomorrow, and group boot camps will no longer be allowed. One-on-one personal training sessions are still permitted. New \u201cstrong advice\u201d for individuals is that people should stay home unless shopping for essentials; for medical care or compassionate needs; to exercise in compliance with the new two-person rules; to go to \u201cwork and education if you cannot work or learn remotely\u201d. 1,600 Australians arriving home from overseas have gone into mandatory quarantine in hotels today. Earlier today Morrison announced a $1.1bn package for health and family violence services, including $669m to expand Medicare-subsidised telehealth. Morrison also flagged a wage guarantee, which will include people who have already lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, but has yet to announce details of the policy. Two states recorded coronavirus-related deaths overnight. A 75-year-old woman died at Caboolture hospital after returning to Queensland from the Ruby Princess cruise ship. A man in his 80s also died in Victoria. It brings Australia\u2019s death toll from the virus to 16. New Zealand suffered its first coronavirus-related death, a woman in her 70s on the west coast of South Island. Thanks as always for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. You can also follow our international live blog here. Here\u2019s Katharine Murphy\u2019s wrap-up after this afternoon\u2019s national cabinet: Now to some important news: the heads of both the National Rugby League and Rugby Australia will meet on Monday to work out a way forward through the Covid-19 crisis. Like the rest of the world, Australia\u2019s major sporting codes have gone into hibernation and with no broadcast revenue or a firm timeline on a return, many clubs are staring down potentially devastating financial consequences. At Rugby Australia\u2019s annual general meeting tomorrow, potential large player wage cuts and staff layoffs will be discussed, while AAP reports that the Australian Rugby League Commission chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, will tell clubs and the players he is still hopeful the season can resume by 1 July. AAP reports that player representatives from all 16 clubs also spoke with V\u2019landys and the NRL chief, Todd Greenberg, on Sunday, along with the South Sydney CEO, Blake Solly, and Brisbane counterpart Paul White. It\u2019s expected the players\u2019 pay cut for the remainder of the year will sit around 75%, after they have already been paid the first five months of their annual salary in full. There are still some questions coming out of that (much briefer than usual) press conference with Scott Morrison. Although he\u2019s been clear on the reasons we should stay home, there seem to be some inconsistencies. Hairdressers and barbers, for example, appear to still be able to operate. And if people should only leave their homes for essential reasons, but can still meet in groups of two, can people who live alone still visit one another? Morrison made clear it would be up to the various states to enforce these rules, and no doubt we\u2019ll hear more from state premiers on it tomorrow. Expect the states with the largest outbreaks \u2013 New South Wales and Victoria \u2013 to take the hardest line. Here\u2019s the key points that have come out of today\u2019s national cabinet press conference: Only two people should now gather in public spaces and \u201cother areas of gathering\u201d, but it will be up to states to enforce that limit. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said households could still gather together, but individual people can only meet with one other person. National cabinet resolved there should be a moratorium on evictions from rental properties for the next six months on the basis of \u201cfinancial stress\u201d. Morrison encouraged tenants and landlords, \u201cparticularly\u201d in commercial properties, to work out arrangements in cases of financial stress. Some new public areas \u2013 public playgrounds, outside gyms and skateparks \u2013 will be closed from tomorrow, and group boot camps will no longer be allowed. One-on-one personal training sessions are still permitted. New \u201cstrong advice\u201d for individuals is that people should stay home unless shopping for essentials; for medical care or compassionate needs; to exercise in compliance with the new two person rules; to go to \u201cwork and education if you cannot work or learn remotely\u201d. People who are over 70, people with chronic illness over 60 and Indigenous people over 50 are strongly advised to stay home. Morrison says vulnerable or elderly people who need help with shopping or other needs should try to access \u201csupport through their community or others and I\u2019m sure they could even ring their local MP\u201d. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, suggested the rate of infection in Australia was lower than predicted and there was \u201cevidence that the public health measures that we are putting in place and the social distancing measures are likely to be having some early effect\u201d. Morrison continues and flags possible future closures of retail outlets: When you are going out for shopping, you should be going for just stuff you need and do it and get home. It is not a time for browsing. It is not a time for catching up with friends or bumping into people and having a long conversation. No, you can\u2019t do that any more. That is what we have to stop doing. That is why we are trying to keep as much of these sorts of things open for people as possible so they can get what they need. But as time goes on the national cabinet will continue to look at a lot of these businesses and may have to make further decisions in these areas and in some cases that may not be too far from now. Asked why shopping centres remain open, Morrison says people should only shop for things \u201cthat you actually need\u201d. He uses the example of jigsaw puzzles. I will give you an example. Our kids are at home now, as are most kids, and Jenny went out yesterday and bought them a whole bunch of jigsaw puzzles. I can assure you over the next few months we will consider those jigsaw puzzles absolutely essential. It is important that parents and families and households can get the things that they need to completely change the way they are going to live for the next six months at least, and so what we have done is sought to be practical about these issues. I mean, people are buying sporting equipment at the moment \u2013 gym mats and things like that \u2013 so they can exercise at home. These are things they are going to need. Asked how people over 70 can access essentials such as groceries if the advice is for them to stay home, Morrison says it \u201cis not a strict rule\u201d. He also suggests they could ring their local MP for support if necessary. It is there for their own protection and so what we are encouraging elderly residents to do is to stay home as much as is practicable. Should they need support then I\u2019m sure they can get support through their community or others and I\u2019m sure they could even ring their local MP and I\u2019m sure their local MP would want to help them in any way they could at either a state or federal level, because I have seen that already happening through many of our electorate offices, but I\u2019m sure they could get support through our community. On gatherings, Morrison said a \u201chousehold\u201d can be together inside the home or outside. Otherwise, you can be \u201cwith one other person maximum\u201d. He says previous announcements about the number of people allowed at weddings and funerals will remain in place. Brendan Murphy continues: It is very simple. We need to all stay home unless we are going out to shop, to do personal exercise, to go to medical appointments, or to go to work or study if you can\u2019t work from home. So anyone who doesn\u2019t need to be out of their home should be in the home. This is radical. The vast majority of Australians have done the right thing in the last week. We have seen huge evidence of that but we have also seen some very silly behaviour of people who haven\u2019t complied with that, particularly outdoors and sometimes indoors. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, is now speaking. He says Australia\u2019s rate of infection is \u201cmuch less than some people might have predicted some time ago without mitigation\u201d. So there is evidence that the public health measures that we are putting in place and the social distancing measures are likely to be having some early effect. I should say at the outset that we are not Italy, we are not the United States, we are not Spain. We have one of the highest rates of testing per head of population in the world and one of the lowest positive test rates, so we think, unlike countries unfortunately like Italy, Iran and even the US, that when they detected significant outbreaks they probably had much, much larger outbreaks in the community that were undetected. We feel reasonably confident that we are detecting a significant majority of the cases in Australia. That means that we can get on top of cases when they are detected. The prime minister says following national cabinet that there will be a moratorium on evictions for the next six months on the basis of \u201cfinancial stress\u201d. If they are unable to meet their commitments and so there would be a moratorium on evictions for the next six months under those rental arrangements. Now there is a lot more work to be done here and my message to tenants, particularly commercial tenants, and commercial landlords, is a very straightforward one \u2013 we need you to sit down, talk to each other and work this out, about looking at the businesses which have been closed, businesses that may have had a significant reduction in their revenues, and we need landlords and tenants to sit down and come up with arrangements that enable them to get through this crisis. Morrison says the \u201cstrong advice\u201d of national cabinet is for people aged over 70 to stay at home. \u201cThis is not a compulsion, this is strong advice \u2013 that people aged 70 and over should stay at home and self-isolate for their own protection. To the maximum extent practical. \u201cThese arrangements should also apply to those with chronic illness, over 60 and Indigenous persons over the age of 50.\u201d For individuals, Morrison says \u201cthe strong advice\u201d is people should stay home unless: shopping for essentials for medical care or compassionate needs to exercise \u201cin compliance with the public gathering rules that I have already outlined\u201d And \u201cfor work and education if you cannot work or learn remotely\u201d Further bans on outside gatherings: In addition, public areas \u2013 public playgrounds, outside gyms and skateparks \u2013 will be closed as from tomorrow and boot camps will be reduced to two, which doesn\u2019t really make it a boot camp, that makes it a private session with your trainer for those who are accessing those services. Morrison says only two people should gather in public spaces and \u201cother areas of gathering\u201d but it will be up to states to enforce that limit. The government\u2019s new Covid-19 coronavirus app has 482,000 downloads, he says. I want to encourage every Australian, if you have a phone, you need the app. Go on there and make sure you download that app and go on the internet browser and get access to that WhatsApp service so you can get the messages you need to support the decisions for you and your family. Morrison says 1,600 people have gone into mandatory quarantine today. \u201cI know this is a terrible inconvenience for you but it is necessary to save lives and we thank you for your cooperation this evening,\u201d he says. Morrison begins the press conference by acknowledging that it has been a \u201chard week\u201d for Australians, but says that the rate of increase has been falling. Towards this time last week the daily rate of increase was up around 30% and today\u2019s increase is around 9%. There are no guarantees about how that goes forward. We need to continue to do the things that we have committed ourselves to do to save lives and save livelihoods and I want to thank Australians for their strong support and growing support for the measures that are necessary to do just that. Scott Morrison is speaking now. My colleague Matilda Boseley has the latest on the more than 200 Australian cruise ship passengers currently stranded in Italy. They have been told they will be flown to Perth on Sunday evening, but those who test positive to Covid-19 will not be allowed on the plane. The Australian Public Service commissioner has updated work guidelines for public servants. They\u2019re now told working from home \u201cis a priority, wherever this is practicable\u201d. Public servants had previously expressed concern that they were still being asked to work from offices, despite the government urging as many people as possible to work from home to help slow the Covid-19 outbreak. Private hospital nurses in Perth are threatening industrial action if forced to treat suspected coronavirus patients from a German cruise ship, AAP reports. Up to 55 people feared to be infected on board the Artania liner in Fremantle are set to be transferred to private hospitals in Perth for treatment. Hollywood, Bethesda, Mount and Waikiki hospitals are all understood to have been called upon. The premier, Mark McGowan, negotiated the plan with the federal government to reduce the impact on the state\u2019s public health system. But doctors and nurses have slammed the arrangement, saying coronavirus patients should be kept in public hospitals. The Australian Nursing Federation on Sunday said nurses felt they lacked the training, equipment or confidence to treat the patients. \u201cThe ANF will back nurses completely with the full force of all existing occupational safety and health laws if they are confronted with an unsafe working environment,\u201d the ANF WA state secretary, Mark Olsen, said in a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t care what deals the state or federal governments make, we will not allow nurses, doctors or their patients to be put in harm\u2019s way.\u201d But Bethesda hospital said it would not be part of the initial passenger intake. \u201cBethesda at this stage is not taking any passengers from the Artania,\u201d a spokesperson told AAP. Remember Naomi Wolf? The US author who got involved in a protracted stoush with Australia\u2019s energy minister, Angus Taylor, over ... honestly I don\u2019t even remember what over. Anyway, she\u2019s decided to weigh in on Australian politics again, this time suggesting the decision to suspend parliament until August constitutes a \u201ccoup\u201d. A lot of people are spending a lot of time replying to her on this, including the ABC election analyst Antony Green who, it has to be said, has not explicitly stated that it is not a coup. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will hold a press conference at 6.30pm. A group of medical professionals who the New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, slammed this morning for not going into mandatory quarantine after they arrived back in Australia in the early hours of this morning have told the Sydney Morning Herald they \u201cfollowed lawful direction at every point\u201d. The 33 medical professionals were among a group of 77 medical professionals who were returning from a health convention on board a cruise that was unable to berth in South America. Hazzard said this morning he was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d they had not followed instructions to enter mandatory quarantine in a hotel. But some of the doctors have told the Herald it was due to \u201cconfusion and misunderstanding\u201d between health officials and police. NSW Health has deployed more than 350 physiotherapists with previous experience in intensive care to help cope with the rising number of cases in the state. NSW\u2019s chief allied health officer, Andrew Davison, said the physiotherapists have been \u201cupskilled\u201d over the weekend via virtual training. They will help wean patients off much-needed ventilators, and improve patient positioning to \u201coptimise oxygenation and patient outcomes\u201d. \u201cPhysiotherapists, and all allied health clinicians, are an essential part of the multidisciplinary team and the collaborative response to treat and support patients with Covid-19,\u201d Davison said in a statement issued this afternoon. The NSW government previously announced a $2.3bn stimulus package, including $700m for the state\u2019s health department, to increase capacity in public hospitals, particularly within ICUs and emergency departments. While we have a bit of time before national cabinet breaks up, have a read of this piece by my colleague Amy Remeikis on a refugee who was denied the right to board a flight from Indonesia to Australia because of his visa status. Amir, a young Iranian refugee on an Australian safe haven visa, has been sent back to Turkey amid the coronavirus crisis, despite being granted permission to leave Australia to visit his mother in early February. A shot of the care pack issued to new arrivals before their mandatory quarantine. People are still being fed, of course. Spurrier says she is \u201cthrilled\u201d South Australia only recorded 12 new cases of the virus overnight. She cautions that it is only one day\u2019s worth of data, but is \u201ccertainly better than being told it was another 30 or 40\u201d. We have really put in place in South Australia measures that we have never seen before in the state. We have basically closed borders and we are now requesting anybody who is coming in internationally to be quarantined in hotels and that is being policed. [We are also] feeling the pain, closing a large number of all businesses, particularly restaurants and hotels and the like. We have even stopped AFL matches. South Australia has announced school closures in a number of towns in the wine growing region of the Barossa Valley after what the state\u2019s chief public health officer, Nicola Spurrier, called a \u201ccluster\u201d of positive cases in the region. Spurrier is speaking now, and has reported 12 new cases of Covid-19 in the state, bringing the total in South Australia to 299. There are six cases in ICU, four of which are critical. Spurrier has asked people living in a number of towns in that area not to leave if they can, and said other people in the state should \u201crethink\u201d travel to the Barossa Valley if they can. \u201cWe want to basically reduce as much travel in and out while my team is able to get on top of this cluster,\u201d she said. She said school closures in the area would not be permanent. \u201cAs many people know, I\u2019m an advocate of keeping schools open where we don\u2019t have evidence of transmission but this is a different circumstance and I think it is an indication that when we do need to recommend school closures, we will recommend them,\u201d she said. The head of the Australian Medical Association, Tony Bartone, has welcomed the government\u2019s commitment to expanding Medicare-covered health care, saying it will ease the burden on Australia\u2019s already stretched supplies of personal protective equipment. It\u2019s an important announcement because what it does is three things. Not only does it allow the usual access to care, to continual care, especially for those patients with chronic and complex disease, that have chronic managements plans, that need that access, but all the other members of the community that, for one reason or another, are not able to access the general practice or the other consulting rooms during this time because they\u2019re in self-isolation, or because indeed they are in a vulnerable group and fear being exposed to the risk of contracting Covid-19. But the third, most important reason for this is that it will significantly reduce the demands on personal protective equipment \u2013 PPE. We know PPE is in very much short supply. It\u2019s very scarce. And by allowing the ability to consult a number of patients in the comfort of their own room, in their own home, in their own isolation, will allow a significant reduction in the amount of PPE required by doctors, nurses and all other frontline healthcare workers that will be taking part in telehealth. In the past 24 hours Victorian police say they have conducted 1,430 checks that people are complying with quarantine rules. That included 139 checks on returned travellers. Of those, 11 were not at home. Police say they\u2019ve also checked 614 businesses, 210 \u201cpopulous places\u201d and 467 \u201cnon-essential services and businesses\u201d. \u201cAt this time, no one has been charged with refusing or failing to comply with the direction however a number of warnings were given to people found at populous gatherings,\u201d Victorian police say. As I mentioned, about 3,000 people are expected to arrive in Sydney today. That\u2019s not counting the rest of the country, of course. Those people will be put up in hotels for an enforced 14-day quarantine. A few people are tweeting about what that process has been like so far, including Dr Sharon Schembri who has just returned from the US. There\u2019s been reports around of long wait times, but Schembri writes that overall the process was handled well. Took a while to load those busses and geographically we travelled towards the city. Took hours for each bus to be unloaded one at a time. Finally, we arrived, five star quarantine! Again police (uniformed and not uniformed) along with army personnel facilitated the process Instead of checking into the hotel, a police officer took our name, flight, contact details. Another officer ushered us to the elevators, sending us to our allocated 25th floor, where we were met me with another two officers who opted to give myself and my son connecting rooms First meal has now been delivered and we have been informed that healthcare professionals will be monitoring us for symptoms. Multiple times we have been informed we are not to leave the room for any reason otherwise we will be penalised. So here we are for 14 days. I wonder how you\u2019d feel if you returned home a little earlier and had shelled out money for an Airbnb to quarantine in? (I don\u2019t wonder. I know a bunch of people who are filthy that they\u2019ve missed out on a fortnight stay in a five-star hotel.) Good afternoon. This is Michael McGowan, taking over from Josh Taylor for the evening shift. There\u2019s been no shortage of coronavirus-related news today, and with national cabinet meeting this afternoon we could have a busy night ahead. To recap, today we\u2019ve heard: The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced a $1.1bn package for health and family violence services, including $669m to expand Medicare-subsidised telehealth. Morrison also flagged a wage guarantee, which will include people who have already lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, but has yet to announce details of the policy. Two states recorded coronavirus-related deaths overnight. A 75-year-old woman died at Caboolture hospital after returning to Queensland from the Ruby Princess cruise ship. A man in his 80s also died in Victoria. It brings Australia\u2019s death toll from the virus to 16. New Zealand suffered its first coronavirus-related death, a woman in her 70s on the west coast of South Island. Sunday marks the first day that Australians returning from overseas will be forced to quarantine in hotels. About 3,000 people are expected to arrive in Sydney today. Thanks for keeping me company as we head into the evening. So I\u2019m told Atlassian helped the government build its WhatsApp information sharing capability alongside Facebook because the company was keen to get information out as quickly as possible. One of the company\u2019s founders, Mike Cannon-Brookes, has said the company will not be paid any money for any of the work that went into it. Here\u2019s a chart on the age range of people who tested positive for coronavirus in NSW and the likely source of the transmission. Just a clarification on the Ruby Princess numbers, NSW Health sent out a correction that there are 189 confirmed coronavirus cases in New South Wales from the cruise ship. They accidentally included the 26 cases from people outside of the state who were on that cruise ship but then went home before testing positive. That means it is still correct to say there are 215 cases from that cruise ship in total. Some of the more than 400 Australians stranded in Peru have pleaded with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to help them escape on government-sponsored repatriation flights. Some are expected to leave on a commercial charter in the next 24 hours \u2013 although this is not certain \u2013 and it may be months before others are able to leave a country under a military-enforced lockdown. The oldest Australian stranded in Peru is 96, the youngest six months. One is pregnant, another is in hospital with a deteriorating medical condition. Another is living in an abandoned building with little food. An open letter written by Gus Higgins on behalf of the group has pleaded with the Australian government to launch government-sponsored repatriation flights, as other countries, such as Germany, Israel, Canada, Ireland and the US have done. \u201cWe have watched other governments act. We see foreigners leave each day through the repatriation efforts of their respective governments. Despite being told we are a \u2018top priority\u2019, honestly, honourable prime minister, we certainly do not feel so. \u201cWe request immediate repatriation that is accessible for all Australians stranded in Peru.\u201d The borders are shut in Peru until at least 12 April. Most commercial airlines now no longer operating, with the country in lockdown under military law. A commercial charter, organised by Chimu Adventures with Australian government assistance, will fly about 260 Australians out of Peru, likely on Sunday. The over-subscribed flight will retrieve passengers from Cusco and Lima. However, many Australians stuck in Peru could not afford the $5,000 being asked for an economy class seat on the flight or missed out on booking, while others are in remote parts of the locked-down country where all internal movement has been banned, putting airports out of reach. ABC is reporting that people arriving at Sydney airport are waiting between two and three hours on buses to be ferried from the airport to one of two hotels \u2013 the Ibis and the Novotel \u2013 where they\u2019ll be forced to quarantine for 14 days. This is the first day of the new regime, and it\u2019s expected around 3,000 people will be sent to hotels from Sydney airport today. Ahh, Richmond. And another update on the state and territory totals we have for confirmed coronavirus cases so far today: New South Wales: 1,791 (+174) Victoria: 769 (+84) Queensland: 656 (+31) ACT: 77 (+6) WA: 312 (+33) There are 16 deaths from people who tested positive for coronavirus reported so far. Western Australia has reported 33 confirmed new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total to 312 in the state. The WA government is also going to bring in new legislation next week to fine people $1,000 (and $5,000 for business) for not complying with self-isolation and gathering directives. NSW Health has advised there are now 215 cases of coronavirus from passengers on the Ruby Princess, up from 172. There are now 59 confirmed cases in NSW from the Ovation of the Seas, and 23 cases from the second cruise of the Voyager of the Seas. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has welcomed the announced funding for telehealth. \u201cThe reason we have been pushing so hard for the telehealth expansion is because GPs on the frontline battling Covid-19 know that it will make a real difference in limiting the spread of the virus,\u201d president Dr Harry Nespolon said. Nespolon said telehealth doesn\u2019t mean doctors have to use Skype or Zoom or other video conferencing for their consultations, and the Medicare Benefits Scheme item covers phone calls, too. \u201cWe need to be technologically agnostic and not have the public or GPs think that this item is limited to video consultations; an old-fashioned phone will do just fine.\u201d A quick update on international developments: More than 30,000 people have died after contracting Covid-19, from more than 660,700 confirmed cases. The coronavirus death toll in France has passed the grim milestone of 2,000 deaths, with more than 38,000 cases, and the US has reported more than 120,000 cases. New Zealand reported its first death on Sunday. Spain, Northern Ireland and Timor-Leste are among countries to introduce new waves of restrictions. The US president, Donald Trump, earlier proposed an enforced regional quarantine on the state of New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, prompting an angry rebuke from the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo. Trump later said quarantine would not be necessary and he had asked the CDC to instead issue a serious travel warning for the areas. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 yesterday, has warned British households that the virus epidemic will get worse before it gets better. The Zandam cruise ship, which has hundreds of passengers on board including at least 130 with flu-like symptoms, has been granted passage through the Panama Canal. Four people on the ship have died and two of those with symptoms have been diagnosed with Covid-19. And Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, the wife of the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, said she has recovered from Covid-19. Her husband and their three children have been in isolation and haven\u2019t shown symptoms. NSW Health says a a staff member at Long Bay hospital has been diagnosed with Covid-19. Contact tracing is being undertaken with staff and patients, and those identified as close contacts are being placed in isolation and will undergo testing. Additionally, 245 passengers from the Roald Amundsen and Scenic Eclipse cruises who arrived on Friday night were screened for Covid-19 at the airport and were required to isolate for 14 days. This was before the new hotel isolation orders for every single arrival came into effect, but Nine newspapers reported 33 of those ordered into hotel quarantine by NSW Police attempted to depart on domestic flights. A total of 27 of those are believed to have left on those flights. There are three confirmed cases at Normanhurst West public school \u2013 two teachers and a student. Close contacts have been isolated and the school has been reopened. I\u2019ll hand back to my colleague Josh Taylor now but will be back with you later this afternoon. Following Scott Morrison\u2019s announcement of a $1bn boost to health and family violence services this morning, advocates say the package falls short of what\u2019s needed. As part of the package Morrison announced $150m for domestic violence services, but Renee Carr, the executive director of campaign group Fair Agenda, says more is needed. Critically, this package also doesn\u2019t reverse the dangerous cuts to vital work like WESNET\u2019s Safe Phones program or the work of the National FVPLS Forum \u2013 which means critical functions currently in place for women\u2019s safety will be ended in coming months; when their work will be absolutely vital in dealing with this escalating emergency. These cuts are unconscionable and must be immediately reversed. We already know that demand for service has jumped even in the early days of this pandemic. The risks facing women experiencing abuse and violence will be an escalating emergency during this crisis. It\u2019s vital that services are resourced to support everyone who needs them during this time. The mayors of Sydney\u2019s beachside suburbs are carefully monitoring crowds in their council areas today, in the hope that people will stay away and they will not be forced to shut down parks and public gardens as well as the beaches. Beaches in Randwick, Waverley and Woollahra, including the iconic Bondi Beach, have been shut indefinitely after large crowds gathered and ignored social distancing rules. Police have also had to break up parties in the beachside suburb, which is a magnet to backpackers and young people. The Waverley mayor, Paula Masselos, said she was hoping it would not be necessary to shut parks and public gardens as well, but it would depend on whether people respected the social distancing rules today. \u201cWe want to keep them open as much as possible for the sake of mental health of people, but if people are not doing the right thing we may need to close them,\u201d she said. Masselos said it was not feasible to try to control numbers on beaches as some councillors had suggested. \u201cI asked the general manager to look at options for keeping them open, including having a corridor to access the beaches, but it\u2019s just not possible,\u201d Masselos said. The Liberal councillor and former mayor Sally Betts has suggested using witches hats to divide the beach into areas and regulate numbers. Waverley was forced to shut the tiny Mackenzies beach after crowds gathered there, following the shutdowns of other beaches. Randwick has been forced to shut all of its beaches as well and Woollahra has shut the harbour beaches. Northern Beaches council closed the northside beaches last weekend but is endeavouring to keep them open where possible. The Inner west mayor, Darcy Byrne, has also urged people to follow social distancing in parks, saying crowded parks may need to be closed. This Twitter thread from Shiraz Maher, an expert on Islamic radicalisation from the UK, on his experience with the Covid-19 virus as an otherwise healthy 38-year-old is quite harrowing. Australians stranded on board the Costa Victoria cruise ship, docked in Civitavecchia, Italy, have been told to pack their bags and prepare for a chartered flight home. Passengers have posted on social media that they received a call to their cabin in the middle of the night, asking them to be packed and ready to go by 6am Italian time (3pm AEDT). Others have been told a flight has been arranged by Costa Cruises to deliver them from Rome to Perth. \u201cWe got woken up with a call to have our bags packed and out the door by 6am and we\u2019ll be departing by 9. When we asked \u2018where are we going\u2019 they said to the airport for a late afternoon flight. Why wouldn\u2019t the Australian ambassador know of this plan and communicate it to us?\u201d one passenger posted on Facebook. There are more than 300 Australians on board the ship. Without official confirmation from the Australian embassy in Rome or Dfat, passengers are unsure what to expect. Some Australians from the Costa Luminosa, which docked in Savona last week, said there were plenty of rumours of a charter flight. Instead, passengers were placed on buses and driven to Rome to self-isolate for two weeks in a hotel. For days, those on board the Costa Victoria have feared they will face the same fate, forced to spend more time in the country worst hit by the virus. Both the Costa Victoria and Luminosa have had confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board. Victoria passengers have been in strict lockdown for days and confirmed to their cabins. Guardian Australia has contacted Dfat. The shadow minister for industrial relations, Tony Burke, says any wage subsidy announced by the government should be conditional on keeping people in work, and large enough \u201cto give a real incentive to employers to keep people in their jobs\u201d. \u201cWe want people to keep their relationship with their employer,\u201d he says. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, is speaking in Sydney now. He\u2019s calling for the government to go ahead with changes to income support including lowering the threshold at which couples can receive income support if one person loses their job. We\u2019re expecting to hear more on this from the government in the coming days, but Labor wants the government to \u201curgently\u201d implement a wage subsidy. More state updates, this time from Victoria. The total number of coronavirus cases in Victoria is now 769, the state\u2019s health department has confirmed. That\u2019s an increase of 84 from yesterday. Victoria has now recorded four deaths related to the virus. Like Queensland, the state also recorded another death overnight \u2013 a man in his 80s died in a Melbourne hospital. The total number of cases includes 419 men and 346 women, with people aged from 3 to 88. There are 21 confirmed cases that may have been acquired through community transmission and more than 39,000 Victorians have been tested. Currently 26 people are in hospital, including four patients in intensive care, and 193 people have recovered. Thank you to the Tasmanians patiently explaining what their premier meant when he asked people not to travel between their home and shack earlier. It is apparently a reference to holiday homes dotted all over the state. \u201cUltimate permanent campsites, essentially, to the point that they are generational,\u201d reader Dean Sparkes tells me. So there you are. The Australian tennis star John Millman may have dodged the coronavirus, but he\u2019s still resigned to not playing again this year. Millman fears the global nature of his sport will leave it almost impossible for the respective men\u2019s and women\u2019s tours to reset again in 2020. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be pretty unified in terms of our recovery process before the tour can resume,\u201d Millman told AAP. \u201cMaybe the tournament location has got the Covid-19 situation under wraps and then manage to contain it, but if someone\u2019s flying in from South America, say, and their country hasn\u2019t got a hold of it, then the tournament can\u2019t exist. \u201cYou can\u2019t have the tournament going when only certain players can get there. I think that\u2019s where the problems lie. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we have to have a vaccine or the virus has to run its course before there\u2019ll be any let-up there.\u201d The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has updated media on the number of new Covid-19 cases in that state. She says there were 31 new cases overnight, bringing the total in Queensland to 656. She also confirms that a 75-year-old woman died overnight at Caboolture hospital. The woman was a passenger on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Once again, I my extend condolences to her family members and as I said the other day, we know that we will continue to see these incidents that are happening and I think everyone needs to realise that this person has a family and friends and loved ones and it is indeed a tragedy. The Waverley councillor responsible for Bondi Beach in Sydney\u2019s east, John Wakefield, has called on the NSW government to do more to deal with hotspots of Covid-19 associated with backpacker facilities. Waverley council area has the largest number of Covid-19 cases in NSW \u2013 132 cases on Friday \u2013 and most have been among backpackers who have arrived from overseas and people who have come in contact with them. \u201cBackpacker facilities need to be locked down and every person there tested,\u201d Wakefield said. He said there were two clusters of 20-plus cases that were largely associated with two large backpacker premises. \u201cWe need to put a ring around these and then test everyone,\u201d Wakefield said. \u201cIt would probably only involve about 500 people. Maybe we should consider putting them into quarantine, rather than having them in dormitories where social distancing is difficult.\u201d He said many backpackers were living in dorms with four or more beds per room. Wakefield said it was wrong to expect council to bear the brunt of policing social distancing and that more help was needed from the state government. Randwick mayor Danny Said warned a similar situation could occur in Coogee, which also has several big backpacker hostels. \u201cWe\u2019re having a close look at it. Some of these places have 6-10 people to a room, so social distancing is very difficult,\u201d he said. Said called on the state government \u201chelp us out\u201d and to cisider whether its possible to provide testing and quarantine facilities for backpackers. Now to Tasmania, where the premier, Peter Gutwein, has confirmed the number of positive coronavirus cases in the state is now at 62. The state has taken a hard line on travellers entering the state. All non-essential travellers who arrive in Tasmania after midnight on Sunday will be placed into quarantine in a government facility. Tasmania will not be immune from the impacts. There will be, at some stage, community transmission. That is going to occur. I expect also, unfortunately, that there will be deaths. Let\u2019s be clear. People will die, unfortunately, as a result of this, and we need to ready ourselves for that. Gutwein also says the government does not want \u201cto see people traversing between their home and their shack\u201d. Which, I don\u2019t know, might need a Tasmanian to explain that one. We also heard quite a strong response earlier from the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, to reports that 33 medical professionals who returned to Australia last night did not go into the mandatory hotel quarantine announced by the government on Friday. They were among a group of 77 medical professionals who were returning from a health convention on board a cruise that was unable to berth in South America. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said he understood the mandatory hotel quarantine hadn\u2019t been served on those medical professionals and they\u2019re unlikely to face fines. But that didn\u2019t stop Hazzard giving them a strong serve. I actually don\u2019t know what to say about those doctors. They should know better ... It was bitterly disappointing that they chose to ignore what is a safety measure for themselves and for others. They are the people you would expect to know better than anyone else. Yes, bitterly disappointing. Stephen-Smith says there are six people in hospital with Covid-19 in the ACT, including two in ICU. There are two cases of possible community transition which are currently under investigation. \u201cIt is too early to say whether either of those is an early indication of community transmission in our community,\u201d she says. Good afternoon everyone. The ACT health minister, Rachel Stephen-Smith, is giving an update on the number of cases in the nation\u2019s capital. We\u2019ve already heard there are six new cases, which brings the total in the territory to 77. The new cases include four males and two females aged between 19 and 82. Three of the new cases are linked to overseas travel and two are linked to other confirmed cases. It is still unknown how the sixth case was contracted, but Stephen-Smith says there is still \u201cno clear evidence of community transmission\u201d. \u201cBut we have been saying for some time we expect this to change,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact it is inevitable this will change.\u201d I\u2019m heading on a break for a bit, but my colleague Michael McGowan will take you through the next hour. The ACT government has announced six more Covid-19 cases, three of which are from overseas travel and one a close contact of a confirmed case. That brings the territory up to 77 in total. A total of 4,230 tests have been conducted. The people being isolated after arriving back in Australia are currently being put in five-star hotels, Fuller says. They\u2019re provided food and drink and health support. They won\u2019t have any physical contact with hotel workers, who have PPE. There are also extra precautions being put in place, such as disinfecting the buses they are brought to the hotel in, and having only 12 people at a time on the buses. Police have handed out 11 tickets so far to people flouting the new rules, Fuller says. He has also urged local governments to plan to shut beaches and parks well ahead of time if it\u2019s going to be a hot day and people may be tempted to congregate there. \u201cLocal governments have an important role. You manage the beaches and the parks. If there is a 30C day coming, you need to close the beach three or four days out. You need to prepare, you need to plan for these things. It is no longer worth waiting for the day.\u201d The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, says around 3,300 Australians are expected to return via Sydney airport today who will go into isolation in hotels for 14 days, after being processed by border force officers and seen by health officials. So far 1,000 people have returned since the new isolation rules came into force, and 30 of those have gone into high-level isolation either due to feeling unwell or having symptoms that could potentially be coronavirus. Just a quick update on the state totals which we have been provided over the past hour: New South Wales: 1,791 (+174) Victoria: 769 (+84) Queensland: 656 (+31) Victoria and Queensland both reported deaths overnight, bringing the national total to 16. Hazzard urges people to be decent to each other, saying there had been reports of vital equipment being stolen from hospitals. \u201cI am mortified to hear that in some of our hospitals people are actually stealing hand cleaner and other items that will keep our frontline staff safe. I\u2019ve even heard reports of hand cleaner containers being ripped off the wall in hospitals.\u201d The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, says there are now 1,791 confirmed cases in NSW, up 174 in the past 24 hours. This is slightly down on yesterday\u2019s figures. There have now been over 91,000 tests in the state. There are 24 cases in intensive care units in NSW. More information on the Queensland numbers for today, from the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. There were 31 new cases overnight, for a total of 656 in the state. As we said before, a 75-year-old woman who had been on the Ruby Princess cruise ship has died in Caboolture after testing positive for coronavirus. The premier\u2019s press conference is being held in the Royal International Convention Centre at the RNA showgrounds, which had been used during the Spanish flu epidemic a century ago. Palaszczuk said this and a number of other venues in Brisbane could be used for overflow from hospitals arising from coronavirus. Morrison says national cabinet is meeting this afternoon, and he indicates that if further measures are agreed upon, there will be a press conference in the early evening. Will authorities in Australia be able to access phone data to contact-trace like the UK? Morrison says there are no plans for that. \u201cWhat I want to be clear about is the policies and measures that we will put in place for Australia will be right for Australia,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go and cut and paste measures from other places, which have completely different societies.\u201d It is worth mentioning, the South Australian police have already said they have used metadata for contact-tracing earlier this year. The other states we have asked have said they have no plans to use phone data for contact-tracing at this stage. Is it a break from national cabinet if NSW and Victoria go further in closing down schools and retail in the next few days? Morrison says no. \u201cIt has been very clear that some states may have to take further measures sooner than other states. That is not a breakaway from the national cabinet. That is actually the national cabinet working,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is a demonstration of the way the states can work together and so as much as some states can find themselves in a position to do a few more things, it should not be the view that these states who are not doing those things are not doing enough.\u201d Morrison is again asked whether he will release the government\u2019s modelling of the amount of cases and deaths they are projecting we may see in Australia. There is a long answer about how we can\u2019t compare our situation with the UK and other parts of the world (including that we are testing more and our positive result rate is lower), but he again doesn\u2019t say whether the government will release the modelling. Morrison is asked who the income support will apply to. He says it hasn\u2019t been finalised, so he won\u2019t go into the details because it isn\u2019t fair on Australians. \u201cThese are not simple things to do when you are talking about rolling out income support to millions of people.\u201d He says the principle is that the package will support people who have lost their job through recent closures that have already happened (so retrospectively), but further detail on the starting point will come out when it is announced later in the week. \u201cWe want to be sure that when we do it, we have covered the majority of the ground that needs to be covered to enable the program to be successfully implemented in partnership with the businesses, which will extend beyond what has been the level of coverage we have had to date.\u201d Scott Morrison says the income support package will be bigger than the previous two packages: \u201cThe next stage, which will be given bigger than anything you have so far seen, will go broader than that and ensure that we are working together with companies to keep people connected to companies. This is part of the hibernation strategy of ensuring we keep people connected with their businesses and with their jobs so that on the other side of this, Australia can bounce back stronger.\u201d A 75-year-old woman has reportedly died at Caboolture hospital, after returning to Queensland from the Ruby Princess. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state has risen by 31 to 656. There are three press conferences going on at the moment \u2013 federal, Queensland and Victoria. We will bring you all the relevant information from the state ones when we can. Via AAP: New Zealand has suffered its first coronavirus-related death, a woman in her 70s on the west coast of South Island. The woman, who had underlying health conditions, was mis-diagnosed with influenza on admittance to hospital. New Zealand health officials confirmed 63 new cases on Sunday, a promising drop from the increase of the previous two days, leaving the country\u2019s overall tally of coronavirus cases at 514. The ABC is reporting a Melbourne man in his 80s has died in hospital, bringing the number of deaths in Victoria to four and the national total to 15. The health minister, Greg Hunt, says there will be universal telehealth from tomorrow. Those who are self-isolating will be able to call their GP, nurse, mental health practitioner or allied health professional. Morrison also flagged that, as has been widely reported, the government will bring in income support. \u201cWe will also be moving to provide further income support, the treasurer and I have been working together with Treasury and other officials night and day over recent days to ensure we can provide further boosted income support across the Australian economy,\u201d he says. As the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said earlier, they are trying to make it sound different to the UK model, which they had ruled out two days ago. \u201cWe are being very careful to ensure that income support can be delivered in a way that gets it to people as quickly as possible using the existing systems we have. \u201cWhen we do these things it is not a matter of just cutting and pasting ideas from other places. We need to have solutions that will work in Australia.\u201d This is the summary of the announcement from the prime minister today: $669m for telehealth so people can get support from GPs and health advice from home $74m for mental health support $150m for domestic violence services, including 1800 RESPECT and Mensline $200m for emergency relief support including Foodbank, Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare and other charities Morrison says thanks to Atlassian and Facebook, Australians can now go to WhatsApp to find information on coronavirus from the government. A new iOS app has also been launched today for Apple iPhones. My cursory glance at the app suggests it is a replica of the health department website, and it looks OK. I\u2019ll have a deeper look when this press conference is over. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is making the announcement around the $1.1bn support for health, mental health and domestic violence services that we flagged earlier. Morrison says the rate of increase in cases has gone from around 25% to 30% per day a week ago to around 13% to 15% today. In Australia, we can be thankful that the mild disputes between the federal government and the states over the best response to coronavirus are nothing compared to what\u2019s happening in the US at the moment. In addition to the fights between the states and the Trump administration over PPE, Trump\u2019s suggestion that New York could be quarantined for two weeks has been met with anger from the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo. \u201cIt would be chaos and mayhem. If we start walling off areas all across the country it would just be totally bizarre, counterproductive, anti-American, anti-social,\u201d Cuomo said. For the most part in Australia, it is the states (NSW and Victoria) pushing for a stronger lock down. The Australian government is working on getting hundreds of Australians stranded in Nepal back to Australia on a commercial flight that will cost nearly $3,000 per person. An email sent to Australians in Nepal from the embassy, seen by Guardian Australia, has revealed the Kathmandu to Sydney direct flight is currently being negotiated with an air carrier and will likely depart on April 1. The cost of the flight will be $US1800 (AU$2919) for economy and US$2300 (AU$3730) for business class. So far 175 passengers have registered, and 100 seats remain. Next Saturday, New Zealand nationals will also be offered access to this flight. People on the Australians stranded in Nepal Facebook page say they fear they will be trapped in the country because they cannot afford a ticket, or reach Kathmandu in time for the flight. Michael Bonner, an Australian aid worker with Three Angels Nepal, a non-government organisation, said between 80 and 100 people turned up at the embassy at 9am Saturday local time hoping to organise a ticket home. He said many more were stranded in the Himalayas and other parts of the country and unable to reach Kathmandu in time because roads were closed. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a couple of hundred people who will make this flight and another couple of hundred stranded as the situation in the country deteriorates,\u201d he said. He called on the government to delay the flight to give more Australians time to reach the capital. In response to concerns expressed on the Facebook page, the Australian ambassador to Nepal, Pete Budd, said he understood people were frustrated, and the embassy had tried to achieve economies of scale by securing the largest possible aircraft. \u201cMany Australians have been stretched financially having paid for bookings that were subsequently cancelled. The disinclination of insurers to cover cancellations due to Covid-19 or reluctance of airlines to offer refunds in a timely manner is not helping,\u201d Budd wrote. \u201cThe reality is that aircraft entering Nepal are not permitted to carry passengers. In all likelihood, once arrived in Sydney, the aircraft will also have to return to Doha empty. This adds to the cost. In the event there are future flights, if there are future flights, they are only likely to be more expensive. \u201cFor those Australians disinclined to pay the airfare, or those who are too financially stretched despite their best efforts to seek support from friends and family in Australia, my only advice at this point would be to find a safe place to settle. This may have to be for an extended period.\u201d An infant who tested positive for coronavirus in Chicago has died, the New York Times is reporting. Finance minister Mathias Cormann\u2019s remarks on Insiders that the government is \u201cnot going to start shutting down businesses because we are under political pressure\u201d have more than a touch of unreality about them. When it comes to doing what is needed to make sure we have an economy that can spring back into action once the coronavirus crisis has passed, the government has consistently been too slow to take action, and the actions have been too small and too narrowly focused. Its inability to deal with the twin wages and rents crisis is a key problem. Businesses are already shutting down. Hospitality and entertainment businesses went dark a fortnight ago and retail slammed down the shutters last week. Hundreds of thousands of people have applied for unemployment benefits in a matter of days. And many of those businesses that haven\u2019t already closed are screaming for government action to shut them down because staying open with no customers is rapidly sending them broke. Soon, the fact that so much consumer spending has been ripped out of the economy will ripple through to other sectors such as the finance industry, which employs a large number of people, causing yet more job losses. People who have been stood down do not have money to pay the rent or bills. Businesses that have closed their doors do not have money to pay their landlords. A wage subsidy could help solve the first problem. After ruling out the idea, Cormann has now shifted ground somewhat. But what he actually promised was not a direct subsidy but \u201csignificantly enhanced income support through business\u201d. And, pressed by host David Speers on whether this would be dependent on \u201ca requirement to keep staff employed\u201d, the best Cormann could manage was that \u201cthat would be the intention\u201d. From Cormann\u2019s answers, it appears the government is intent on trying to shove more money through the funnel of the business tax system, in the hope that some of it reaches the pockets of workers. This obsession with using the business tax system to push money into the economy was visible from the government\u2019s very first stimulus package, unveiled less than three weeks ago but long since rendered irrelevant by events. It\u2019s a very indirect way of getting money into people\u2019s pockets, and it\u2019s entirely unclear how it can help those who\u2019ve already been laid off. Let\u2019s hope it works. Cormann dodged the question of what to do about preventing people from being evicted because they can\u2019t pay the rent \u2013 a question that has repeatedly been considered by the \u201cnational cabinet\u201d of state and federal leaders without anything being done. On commercial rents, Cormann\u2019s evasions continued when asked whether billionaire retailer Solomon Lew was doing the right thing by refusing to pay his landlords. Unfortunately, Speers didn\u2019t follow up by pointing out that many other retailers and hospitality businesses are doing exactly the same as Lew. And arguing about whether or not businesses should pay their rent is ultimately pointless. If they don\u2019t have the cash \u2013 and many don\u2019t \u2013 they won\u2019t because they can\u2019t. Yes, these are hard problems to solve. But calling them \u201ccomplicated\u201d, which seems to be the Canberra consensus, won\u2019t make them any less urgent. Here\u2019s more on the announcement we are expecting from the prime minister in under an hour. This is what people returning to Australia now face: being put on a bus with supplies and ferried off to a hotel for 14 days of quarantine. On public servants still being forced to go to work, Cormann, says he is \u201cnot going to provide a directive\u201d on working from home on Insiders, but says if they can work from home they should. \u201cBut there is a lot of work that needs to be done right now by the federal public service to support the government\u2019s efforts in relation to protecting people\u2019s health.\u201d Should more businesses be closed to stop the spread, as NSW and Victoria are considering? Cormann says \u201cwe\u2019re not going to start shutting down businesses because we are under the political pressure. In the end, it is a war on two fronts, and shutting the economy down when there is no advice to do so would also have health consequences as well as social, and obvious economic consequences. So we\u2019ve got to continue to make sensible decisions here.\u201d He suggests it is not as simple as shutting down the whole economy and stopping coronavirus. It could start up again once the economy re-opens. On rental assistance for households, Cormann says it is mainly a state and territory issue that is being worked through national cabinet, but he says they want something fair and equitable to ensure sustainability for six months, at least. So not really sure what that would entail, yet. Cormann says the idea of Australia going into hibernation to get through the coronvirus pandemic is about \u201cspreading the pain\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on helping bring down the costs, helping defer costs where that is appropriate. Working with the banks, working with state and territory governments around some of the things that we can do ourselves in our capacity as landlords for businesses in some of the properties that are owned by government. \u201cThe idea here is to spread the pain as fairly and as equitably as possible to as many business as possible to be there on the other side when we expect a very strong recovery.\u201d Cormann won\u2019t say if it will be 70% or 80% of wages. He says it will be fair and equitable, but won\u2019t say what it means for the hundreds of thousands already put out of work. \u201cWe are working as fast as we can,\u201d he says. He confirms the government will ease partner income restrictions for people seeking welfare that currently mean if your partner earns $48K per year you can\u2019t get welfare, but he won\u2019t say what level it will be raised to. Mathias Cormann is asked whether he is still ruling out a UK-style wage subsidy system that he said \u201cwouldn\u2019t work\u201d in Australia just two days ago. Cormann says it will be done \u201cin an Australian way\u201d and in a way \u201cthat actually is going to be able to be delivered, using our existing systems and our existing architecture\u201d. When asked whether employee wages will be subsidised if employers keep staff on, Cormann says it will be \u201cincome support through business\u201d, through the tax and welfare systems. He says the government is still working through it. Insiders has produced this very useful segment on how Australia is tracking so far. Finance minister Mathias Cormann is about to be on ABC\u2019s Insiders program. I\u2019ll bring you updates from that interview, depending on what he says. Greg Jericho on whether we can expect the economy to bounce back quickly after the pandemic: In this instance we need to consider the virus and the response of governments around the world. The global economy is only as strong as the weakest link. And right now the US, led by Donald Trump, is in a pitiful state. NSW planning and public spaces minister Rob Stokes has told Nine newspapers that he is prepared to shut parks and other public spaces in the state if people are flouting the rules regarding social distancing. The Botanic Gardens in Melbourne have been closed already, and Stokes is now considering following his Victorian counterpart. A warm day in Melbourne yesterday saw people flock to beaches in St Kilda, which the Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton described as \u201creally crap\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to Sunday\u2019s live coverage of Australian news related to the coronavirus pandemic, I\u2019m Josh Taylor. As of 8.30am Sunday, there are over 3,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia, and over 640,000 cases globally. There have been 14 deaths of people confirmed to have coronavirus in Australia, and almost 30,000 deaths globally. At 11am AEDT this morning we are expecting an announcement from the prime minister Scott Morrison, for $1bn in funding for support services including Medicare-subsidised telehealth services, domestic violence support, and mental health services as well as a boost for charities. A third stimulus package is not tipped to be announced until mid-week, but there are reports that the government is now considering a wage subsidy similar to the UK in order for companies affected by the pandemic to keep workers on. My colleague Katharine Murphy reports this morning that the third stimulus announcement is likely to be sequenced with further restrictions to enforce social distancing. Overnight in the US, president Donald Trump hinted New York could be quarantined for two weeks. You can find out more of what happened overnight here.",

Hancock, who is in isolation after testing positive for Covid-19, said the government was committed to doing \u201cwhatever is needed\u201d for social care and the NHS, including allowing workers from both sectors free parking in council-owned spaces. \u201cWhilst many people are now staying at home, I know that is not an option for most of you as your work caring for others cannot be done from home,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will do all we can to make your lives easier during this period, including, for example, making parking on council-owned on-street spaces and car parks free for those who work in social care. \u201cWe are committed to doing whatever is needed; that promise applies just as much to social care as it does for the NHS.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The British Horseracing Authority\u2019s overall plan to steer the sport and <br>industry through the coronavirus pandemic became much clearer in the space of a couple of hours on Friday evening. First, the sport\u2019s ruling body announced plans to strip around \u00a31m from its monthly \u00a33m budget, while shortly afterwards the trainer Ralph Beckett tweeted the text of a letter sent to stakeholders by Brant Dunshea, the BHA\u2019s chief regulatory officer, which included a statement that the Authority\u2019s Resumption of Racing Group \u201cis planning for a resumption from the 1st of May\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/17/talking-horses-grand-national-the-latest-racing-domino-to-topple\">All British racing was suspended on 17 March</a> after a short-lived attempt to run meetings behind closed doors. The country has since moved into strict lockdown amid increasingly severe controls on commercial activity, movement and social distancing, in anticipation of an expected peak in Covid-19 cases in two to three weeks\u2019 time. As a result, many in the sport have assumed that the initial suspension of racing until 30 April would inevitably be extended.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/apr/03/joy-of-six-grand-national\">From the archive: The Joy of Six \u2014 Great Grand National moments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Dunshea\u2019s letter makes clear, however, the BHA is keeping all options open for now. Two hundred of its 260 employees have now stopped work and salaries have been cut across the board, but the 60 staff still at work are focused on how an industry that supports tens of thousands of livelihoods will eventually stir back into life.</p> <p>\u201cWe are already anticipating that the initial return to racing is likely to be phased and almost certainly behind closed doors,\u201d Dunshea says. \u201cThis reflects the likelihood that any easing of the Covid-19 situation, and any associated restrictions and pressures on medical services, will also happen progressively.</p> <p>\u201cWith that in mind, we also expect any return to racing to begin, at least initially, with Flat racing, principally for reasons of safety and to minimise demands on emergency services.\u201d</p> <p>Dunshea adds that while some \u201cJumpers Bumpers\u201d cards may be added to the schedule at some stage, jumps trainers should \u201cjudge whether horses can/should be turned out or kept in training\u201d.</p> <p>The immediate suspension of racing earlier this month left freelancers \u201cincluding almost all jockeys and their valets\u201d without an income overnight, and while last week\u2019s announcement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-government-set-to-pay-self-employed-workers-80-of-earnings\">government support for self-employed workers</a> was welcomed by Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys\u2019 Association, he also warned of an \u201cacute, short-term need\u201d until payments arrive in June.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/australian-horse-racing-and-harness-racing-to-continue-despite-coronavirus-scare\">Australian horse racing and harness racing to continue despite coronavirus scare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trainers, too, will know that owners and horses will begin to drift away if racecourses remain idle for weeks on end. There are no sales for breeders to sell horses, and no one would be buying in any case.</p> <p>Without racing, the sport\u2019s economy begins to seize up, as prize money stops circulating around the system. In terms of revenue from the betting Levy alone, every month without racing costs the sport between \u00a36m and \u00a37m. Unfolding events and government advice will ultimately determine whether 1 May is a realistic date for racing to return in some form, but Dunshea and his team at the BHA can only attempt to ensure that the sport has a plan in place if it is needed. If or when it becomes certain that 1 May is impossible, the date will move, but the essentials of the planning for an eventual resumption will be the same.</p> <p>For trainers and jockeys, it cannot come soon enough. But the immense nature of the task facing the BHA\u2019s planners should not be underestimated. Even if government guidelines are sufficiently relaxed by June to allow racing behind closed doors, it would be all but impossible to guarantee that no more than 500 people would attend a Derby at Epsom, where most of the annual crowd of 100,000 do not pay for admission in the first place. Royal Ascot, meanwhile, could well need more than 500 people on the ground to function at all, and it is, in any case, a social event as much as a race meeting. If the Queen and the procession are missing, is it really Royal Ascot at all?</p> <p>Above all, planners will need to decide what to sacrifice and what to squeeze in over what remains of the Flat season, always knowing that someone, somewhere \u2013 trainers and owners included - will disagree with every decision. Could the Derby replace the Leger at Doncaster in September? How to allocate fixtures when some courses might go to the wall without racing? There are thousands of questions and the best answers could change with events from one day to the next.</p> <p>A return on 1 May could well be unrealistic, but over 250 years, horse racing has grown to become an immensely complicated network of inter-dependent professions, businesses and individuals. At a moment of national crisis, all are in as much need as everyone else of some reassurance of better times ahead.</p>",

First, the sport\u2019s ruling body announced plans to strip around \u00a31m from its monthly \u00a33m budget, while shortly afterwards the trainer Ralph Beckett tweeted the text of a letter sent to stakeholders by Brant Dunshea, the BHA\u2019s chief regulatory officer, which included a statement that the Authority\u2019s Resumption of Racing Group \u201cis planning for a resumption from the 1st of May\u201d. All British racing was suspended on 17 March after a short-lived attempt to run meetings behind closed doors. The country has since moved into strict lockdown amid increasingly severe controls on commercial activity, movement and social distancing, in anticipation of an expected peak in Covid-19 cases in two to three weeks\u2019 time. As a result, many in the sport have assumed that the initial suspension of racing until 30 April would inevitably be extended. As Dunshea\u2019s letter makes clear, however, the BHA is keeping all options open for now. Two hundred of its 260 employees have now stopped work and salaries have been cut across the board, but the 60 staff still at work are focused on how an industry that supports tens of thousands of livelihoods will eventually stir back into life. \u201cWe are already anticipating that the initial return to racing is likely to be phased and almost certainly behind closed doors,\u201d Dunshea says. \u201cThis reflects the likelihood that any easing of the Covid-19 situation, and any associated restrictions and pressures on medical services, will also happen progressively. \u201cWith that in mind, we also expect any return to racing to begin, at least initially, with Flat racing, principally for reasons of safety and to minimise demands on emergency services.\u201d Dunshea adds that while some \u201cJumpers Bumpers\u201d cards may be added to the schedule at some stage, jumps trainers should \u201cjudge whether horses can/should be turned out or kept in training\u201d. The immediate suspension of racing earlier this month left freelancers \u201cincluding almost all jockeys and their valets\u201d without an income overnight, and while last week\u2019s announcement of government support for self-employed workers was welcomed by Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys\u2019 Association, he also warned of an \u201cacute, short-term need\u201d until payments arrive in June. Trainers, too, will know that owners and horses will begin to drift away if racecourses remain idle for weeks on end. There are no sales for breeders to sell horses, and no one would be buying in any case. Without racing, the sport\u2019s economy begins to seize up, as prize money stops circulating around the system. In terms of revenue from the betting Levy alone, every month without racing costs the sport between \u00a36m and \u00a37m. Unfolding events and government advice will ultimately determine whether 1 May is a realistic date for racing to return in some form, but Dunshea and his team at the BHA can only attempt to ensure that the sport has a plan in place if it is needed. If or when it becomes certain that 1 May is impossible, the date will move, but the essentials of the planning for an eventual resumption will be the same. For trainers and jockeys, it cannot come soon enough. But the immense nature of the task facing the BHA\u2019s planners should not be underestimated. Even if government guidelines are sufficiently relaxed by June to allow racing behind closed doors, it would be all but impossible to guarantee that no more than 500 people would attend a Derby at Epsom, where most of the annual crowd of 100,000 do not pay for admission in the first place. Royal Ascot, meanwhile, could well need more than 500 people on the ground to function at all, and it is, in any case, a social event as much as a race meeting. If the Queen and the procession are missing, is it really Royal Ascot at all? Above all, planners will need to decide what to sacrifice and what to squeeze in over what remains of the Flat season, always knowing that someone, somewhere \u2013 trainers and owners included - will disagree with every decision. Could the Derby replace the Leger at Doncaster in September? How to allocate fixtures when some courses might go to the wall without racing? There are thousands of questions and the best answers could change with events from one day to the next. A return on 1 May could well be unrealistic, but over 250 years, horse racing has grown to become an immensely complicated network of inter-dependent professions, businesses and individuals. At a moment of national crisis, all are in as much need as everyone else of some reassurance of better times ahead.",

Twitter rumours that the virus first jumped species here in the UK after a certain Wetherspoon\u2019s regular had sex with a Wetherspoon\u2019s Steak &amp; Kidney Pudding \u2122 \u00ae in the toilets at the William Withering in Wellington are similarly imaginary.</p> <p>But even as a diehard Remoaner, I have some sympathy for the Wetherspoon\u2019s project. In many areas of the country, Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s cheerful outlets are the only plug for the yawning social chasms left by his friends the Conservatives\u2019 gradual closure of various community hubs over the past decade. And they are warm. And dry.</p> <p>Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s booze palaces are pie-and-a-pint flophouses for the daytime diaspora of the austerity era, where inexpensively nourished customers are hypnotised by bespoke and quite brilliant regionally specific carpet designs and beguiling guest ales, before being seduced by slogan-strewn anti-EU beermats while at their most mentally pliable.</p> <p>One can hardly blame Tim Wetherspoon for making the scientifically unverified claim, on <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-wetherspoons-boss-says-over-the-top-to-shut-pubs-11960778\">Sky News on Friday 20 March</a>, that there had \u201cbeen hardly any transmission in pubs\u201d. If, like me, you have contentedly spent entire days in Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s premises, you will know they are magical environments where the laws of science are routinely defied, leaving customers unsure of how they got home, which kind of pie they ate, or even of who they are. And Tim Wetherspoon himself fronted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/10/wetherspoon-tim-martin-brexit-leave-agm-corporate-governance\">factually fluid Brexit campaign</a>, endorsed and abetted by our current prime minister, that eschewed evidence and experts as if they were the sort of things only traitors valued.</p> <p>But experts are suddenly back in fashion with a vengeance, emerging blinking from the hidden priest holes of the academic institutions that sheltered them during the public book-burnings of the Brexit campaign, waving their statistics and their strategies like prayer flags. Help us, experts! We are sorry!!</p> <p>In a strange synchronicity, the people who encouraged distrust in experts are quietly disappeared. Michael Gove is rarely seen, and the results of recent wastewater tests in London, which suggest cocaine use in the capital has fallen by a third, can be attributed solely to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\u2019s absence from Notting Hill street corners.</p> <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg is also silenced, presumably in case he suggests the victims of Covid-19 had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/rees-mogg-keeps-low-profile-after-grenfell-comments-outrage\">brought their suffering</a> on themselves, by not having the common sense to stay inside their country mansions eating only food foraged from their private estates by their personal servants and their hounds.</p> <p>Our prime minister, Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl\u2019s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ 88%-lies Get-Brexit-Done Bung-a-Bob-for-Big-Ben\u2019s-Bongs Cocaine-Event Spiritual-Worth Three-Men-and-a-Dog Whatever-It-Takes Johnson, however, is still afoot.</p> <p>But Turds is rarely seen these days without being flanked by the mitigatingly solemn countenances of informed experts, his public performance mode of flippant and deliberate dishonesty suddenly forced into an ill-fitting rubber mask of knowledgeable concern, like the wolf in <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> pretending to be the grandmother by pulling the bedcovers up over his snout and speaking in a high voice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Covid-19 doesn\u2019t just call the Brexit campaign\u2019s bluff.

Starmer could share the blame for the pandemic\u2019s mismanagement, sparing Turds. It\u2019s a trick as transparent as the warm pat on the back David Cameron gave to the slaughtered lamb of Nick Clegg in the Downing Street rose garden 10 years ago, before spinning him round to use as a human shield in the ensuing hail of press-corps machine-gun fire.</p> <p>Is it any wonder that the British public haven\u2019t taken the social distancing advice of this gang of twats seriously when the whole thrust of their campaign this past half decade was that experts are not to be trusted, and that Blitz-spirit Britain could prosper whatever so-called facts were flung at it? But Covid-19 doesn\u2019t just call the Brexit campaign\u2019s bluff. It questions everything about the way we have allowed our society to be run.</p> <p>And as I write this, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/homeless-travelodge-residents-turned-out-on-to-street-coronavirus\">homeless people housed in Travelodges</a> have just been thrown out into the officially unsafe streets, and we don\u2019t know if kids whose only square meals come from their schools are even eatinge.</p> <p>I don\u2019t consider myself as someone with a significant network of friends, because I spent the past three decades pursuing antisocial evening entertainment work, and because I am arrogant and ill-tempered. But suddenly I find myself in the middle of a massive and mutually supportive email conversation between dozens of like-minded self-employed misfits worldwide, most of whom now have no obvious means of support.</p> <p>The secondhand bookseller touched me the most, who plies his wares from Word on the Water, a barge floating on the canal behind King\u2019s Cross station. He has headed north, unwaged and building a mail-order website, up the River Stort to an uncertain future, like Arrietty making her escape in a floating teapot. He writes: \u201cCapitalism itself is looking like the shiny-suited boyfriend that didn\u2019t bring a bottle.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u201cHURRY UP PLEASE IT\u2019S TIME<br>HURRY UP PLEASE IT\u2019S TIME<br>Goonight Johnson.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhen the government closed the pubs, I said \u2013 I didn\u2019t mince my words, I said to them myself, HURRY UP PLEASE IT\u2019S TIME.\u201d MS Toilets, The Wetherspoonland, 1922 A public health official friend tells me her colleagues now call the Covid-19 virus \u201cWetherspoon\u2019s Mumps\u201d, a darkly comic response to Wetherspoon boss Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s initial resistance to closing his pubs for the safety of his customers. It isn\u2019t for civilians to criticise the black humour our brave health professionals deploy to combat the traumatic stress of the war on the coronavirus, especially as I made up the phrase \u201cWetherspoon\u2019s Mumps\u201d myself out of my own head. Twitter rumours that the virus first jumped species here in the UK after a certain Wetherspoon\u2019s regular had sex with a Wetherspoon\u2019s Steak &amp; Kidney Pudding \u2122 \u00ae in the toilets at the William Withering in Wellington are similarly imaginary. But even as a diehard Remoaner, I have some sympathy for the Wetherspoon\u2019s project. In many areas of the country, Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s cheerful outlets are the only plug for the yawning social chasms left by his friends the Conservatives\u2019 gradual closure of various community hubs over the past decade. And they are warm. And dry. Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s booze palaces are pie-and-a-pint flophouses for the daytime diaspora of the austerity era, where inexpensively nourished customers are hypnotised by bespoke and quite brilliant regionally specific carpet designs and beguiling guest ales, before being seduced by slogan-strewn anti-EU beermats while at their most mentally pliable. One can hardly blame Tim Wetherspoon for making the scientifically unverified claim, on Sky News on Friday 20 March, that there had \u201cbeen hardly any transmission in pubs\u201d. If, like me, you have contentedly spent entire days in Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s premises, you will know they are magical environments where the laws of science are routinely defied, leaving customers unsure of how they got home, which kind of pie they ate, or even of who they are. And Tim Wetherspoon himself fronted a factually fluid Brexit campaign, endorsed and abetted by our current prime minister, that eschewed evidence and experts as if they were the sort of things only traitors valued. But experts are suddenly back in fashion with a vengeance, emerging blinking from the hidden priest holes of the academic institutions that sheltered them during the public book-burnings of the Brexit campaign, waving their statistics and their strategies like prayer flags. Help us, experts! We are sorry!! In a strange synchronicity, the people who encouraged distrust in experts are quietly disappeared. Michael Gove is rarely seen, and the results of recent wastewater tests in London, which suggest cocaine use in the capital has fallen by a third, can be attributed solely to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\u2019s absence from Notting Hill street corners. Jacob Rees-Mogg is also silenced, presumably in case he suggests the victims of Covid-19 had brought their suffering on themselves, by not having the common sense to stay inside their country mansions eating only food foraged from their private estates by their personal servants and their hounds. Our prime minister, Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl\u2019s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ 88%-lies Get-Brexit-Done Bung-a-Bob-for-Big-Ben\u2019s-Bongs Cocaine-Event Spiritual-Worth Three-Men-and-a-Dog Whatever-It-Takes Johnson, however, is still afoot. But Turds is rarely seen these days without being flanked by the mitigatingly solemn countenances of informed experts, his public performance mode of flippant and deliberate dishonesty suddenly forced into an ill-fitting rubber mask of knowledgeable concern, like the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood pretending to be the grandmother by pulling the bedcovers up over his snout and speaking in a high voice. You don\u2019t have to be able to go outside your front door to see that senior Conservatives\u2019 offer of a \u201cCovid coalition\u201d with Labour is a trap for Keir Starmer, the Conservatives\u2019 Labour leader of choice, and the Little Red Riding Hood of this lupine ruse. Starmer could share the blame for the pandemic\u2019s mismanagement, sparing Turds. It\u2019s a trick as transparent as the warm pat on the back David Cameron gave to the slaughtered lamb of Nick Clegg in the Downing Street rose garden 10 years ago, before spinning him round to use as a human shield in the ensuing hail of press-corps machine-gun fire. Is it any wonder that the British public haven\u2019t taken the social distancing advice of this gang of twats seriously when the whole thrust of their campaign this past half decade was that experts are not to be trusted, and that Blitz-spirit Britain could prosper whatever so-called facts were flung at it? But Covid-19 doesn\u2019t just call the Brexit campaign\u2019s bluff. It questions everything about the way we have allowed our society to be run. And as I write this, homeless people housed in Travelodges have just been thrown out into the officially unsafe streets, and we don\u2019t know if kids whose only square meals come from their schools are even eatinge. I don\u2019t consider myself as someone with a significant network of friends, because I spent the past three decades pursuing antisocial evening entertainment work, and because I am arrogant and ill-tempered. But suddenly I find myself in the middle of a massive and mutually supportive email conversation between dozens of like-minded self-employed misfits worldwide, most of whom now have no obvious means of support. The secondhand bookseller touched me the most, who plies his wares from Word on the Water, a barge floating on the canal behind King\u2019s Cross station. He has headed north, unwaged and building a mail-order website, up the River Stort to an uncertain future, like Arrietty making her escape in a floating teapot. He writes: \u201cCapitalism itself is looking like the shiny-suited boyfriend that didn\u2019t bring a bottle.\u201d \u201cHURRY UP PLEASE IT\u2019S TIME HURRY UP PLEASE IT\u2019S TIME Goonight Johnson. Goonight Gove. Goonight Raab. Goonight. Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight. Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.\u201d",

He has starred in TV productions on both sides of the Atlantic, including Line of Duty, Jericho and The Walking Dead. Save Me Too, the second series of the TV drama he wrote, created and stars in, will be on Sky Atlantic and Now TV from 1 April. 1. Music The Peterson Brothers The Peterson Brothers\u2019 sound is a mashup of blues, funk, jazz and soul. I had the opportunity to meet them and hear them up close, and they\u2019re fantastic live. They\u2019re very credible, accomplished musicians who are making a sound I don\u2019t think anyone else is. Sometimes they\u2019re heavy on the blues guitar and other times it\u2019s just straight-up funk. They can\u2019t be older than in their mid-to-late 20s, but they seem to have been around for ever and have played with everyone including BB King. I\u2019m late to finding out about them but I do like them very much. 2. TV Detectorists, BBC Four I am really missing home at the moment. By home, I mean London. At this time of uncertainty, I find myself craving the deeply familiar. I think that\u2019s why my TV habits in the last few weeks have become very UK-centric. Detectorists is so beautifully pitched and so marvellously executed by everyone involved, especially Mackenzie Crook and Toby Jones. It could not have been made anywhere else but home. It is hysterically funny and poignant and quietly depicts its male characters particularly in a compassionate and refreshing way. Also, who knew Essex was that bloody lush? 3.

      "body": "<p>In 1596, William Shakespeare\u2019s 11-year-old son Hamnet died in Stratford-upon-Avon. Four or so years later, Shakespeare wrote the play considered by many to be his greatest work, giving its tragic hero a variation of his dead son\u2019s name. Almost four centuries later still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/12/maggie-o-farrell-secrets-spent-life-hiding-brushes-with-death\" title=\"\">Maggie O\u2019Farrell</a> was studying <em>Hamlet</em> at school and learned of the boy Hamnet, whose life has been little more than a footnote in his father\u2019s biography. The seed of curiosity planted 30 years ago has grown into her finest novel yet; a reimagining of Hamnet\u2019s death and the long-lasting ripples it sent through his family.</p> <p>But the title is slightly misleading. Though the novel opens with Hamnet, its central character and beating heart is the boy\u2019s mother, whom O\u2019Farrell calls Agnes. Names are significant in this book; when Agnes eventually sees the version of her son\u2019s name on a London playbill, she feels he has been stolen from her a second time. Meanwhile, the most famous character in the novel goes unnamed; he is variously \u201cher husband\u201d, \u201cthe father\u201d, \u201cthe Latin tutor\u201d. He is allowed very little direct speech. This deliberate omission frees the narrative of all the freight of association that his name carries; even Stratford is rarely mentioned explicitly, with the author instead naming individual streets and houses to root her story in its location.</p> <p>All this has the effect of focusing the attention on the everyday, domestic life of this family, who could be any family. Indeed, in their small local sphere it is Agnes who is the celebrity, known in the town for being unconventional, free-spirited, a gifted herbalist who trails rumours of other, stranger gifts. O\u2019Farrell\u2019s Agnes is a woman whose origins merge into a particularly English kind of folklore \u2013 \u201cThere used to be a story in these parts about a girl who lived at the edge of a forest\u201d \u2013 harking back to a deep connection between humans and landscape, with echoes of tales such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/16/poetry.simonarmitage\" title=\"\"><em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em></a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere were creatures in there who resembled humans \u2013 wood-dwellers, they were called \u2013 who walked and talked, but had never set foot outside the forest, had lived all their lives in its leafish light, its encircling branches, its wet and tangled interior.\u201d</p> <p>Agnes herself is, in the eyes of her neighbours, a creature descended from myth; they regard her with a mixture of awe and wariness. When the young Latin tutor engaged to teach her half-brothers first spies her from the window of the schoolroom, striding out of the forest with a kestrel on her wrist, he thinks she is a boy. O\u2019Farrell\u2019s great skill throughout the book is to treat obviously \u201cShakespearean\u201d themes, such as this kind of gender-blurring or the affinity between boy and girl twins, with subtlety, making them almost tangential when they occur in the playwright\u2019s own life. Hamnet and his twin sister, Judith, have a trick they play on people: \u201cto exchange places and clothes, leading people to believe that each was the other\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a755a2533e10f73ec40d06ec349cb63cad901bef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a755a2533e10f73ec40d06ec349cb63cad901bef/0_211_2627_1576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of William Shakespeare reciting his play Hamlet to his family.

      "body": "<p> The boxing promoter Eddie Hearn is telling the world what it wants to hear, live on national television. It is early on a Monday morning. Hearn is in the Hearn family offices, a converted pile outside Brentwood, rural Essex, that was once the Hearn family home, pre-conversion.</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He is talking directly to camera, speaking live to a news anchor down the line.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody knows this is a monstrous fight. It makes perfect sense. How could it <em>not</em> make perfect sense?\u201d</p> <p>It is 24 hours after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tyson-fury\" title=\"\">Tyson Fury</a> boxed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/deontay-wilder\" title=\"\">Deontay Wilder</a> in a big-money Las Vegas brawl. Fury won, convincingly. Now the news channels are asking about the heavyweight division\u2019s <em>other</em> premium fighter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anthony-joshua\" title=\"\">Anthony Joshua</a>, who happens to be Hearn\u2019s marquee client. Will Joshua fight Fury now? Can Hearn make it happen?</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s have it right,\u201d Hearn says.</p> <p>Here he is, a salesman in his element, a heavyweight chatterbox dangling a deal.</p> <p>\u201cWe have an opportunity to make an event,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just the biggest event in British boxing history, but one of the biggest sporting events\u201d \u2013 pause \u2013 \u201c<em>of all time</em>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can\u2019t say that I\u00a0don\u2019t enjoy the limelight. It\u2019s a big part of what I do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hearn is not a man to tone down the hyperbole. Nor does he turn down the opportunity to talk. \u201cI\u2019ll do every interview in the line,\u201d he says, of his commitment to promotion, \u201cand I\u2019ll get to the end and it\u2019s some geezer from\u2026 \u2018Frank\u2019s Boxing Hour\u2019?\u201d He doesn\u2019t have it in him to turn requests down, he says, even when the requests come from amateur YouTubers. But, you know, all publicity is good publicity. After big fights, news channels clamour for Hearn\u2019s take, not just because he is a grade-A gabber \u2013 which he is, a truly exceptional gabber \u2013 but because his interviews get <em>traction</em>, particularly when they\u2019re chopped up and shared across social media.</p> <p>Almost a million people follow Hearn on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EddieHearn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Twitter</a>, where he delivers lines with the charm and swagger of a star performer. Some 350,000 people follow an Eddie Hearn fan account that reduces his soundbites to memes. Thanks in part to his social media persona \u2013 performative, nearly always delighted at something, game for a laugh \u2013 but also to the recent resurgence of the heavyweight division as a popular spectacle, Hearn has shot comet-like over the threshold of boxing and into the public consciousness, and established himself as one of the loudest voices in sports. These days, he turns up, almost miraculously, everywhere: on the news, at weigh-ins, on a talkshow, at press conferences, on your partner\u2019s Instagram feed (telling jokes, <em>from quarantine)</em>. He can come across as a combination of businessman and comedian \u2013 a mostly serious man with a side-hustle in laughs. His company, Matchroom Boxing, promotes more than 90 boxers, including several world champions. But of late it has seemed as though Hearn has become more famous than most of his clients.</p> <p>Hearn refers to himself as \u201ca travelling salesman\u201d \u2013 his schedule, these days, is not carbon efficient \u2013 though really he\u2019d like to be remembered for being an outstanding man of business. Some people see him like that. Others think of him as a kind of Essex wide boy, a chancer, ready to pull the wool over your eyes.</p> <p>The latter take is simplistic. Hearn has sold out events at Wembley and Madison Square Garden. He was the first promoter to make a $1bn streaming deal, with the on-demand service DAZN, and the only boxing promoter to have organised a big-money event in the Middle East (still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/07/they-want-the-money-the-real-reason-boxing-is-going-to-saudi-arabia\" title=\"\">controversial</a>). He excels at twisting negotiations to benefit the boxers he promotes, particularly their wallets, and subsequently his own, and he is expert at conjuring stories to pitch fights to audiences, especially to those who are only casually interested in boxing. \u201cI love to sell,\u201d he says. \u201cI love to make money. But it\u2019s not just about that. It\u2019s about the achievement of making a breakthrough.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d81b8b718f0008b7275d3d64e57b8b55d8bc0e9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d81b8b718f0008b7275d3d64e57b8b55d8bc0e9b/0_105_4410_2647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Belting up: Anthony Joshua celebrates regaining his heavyweight titles flanked by Eddie and Barry Hearn, Clash on the Dunes, December 2019, Diriyah, Saudi Arabia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Belting up: Anthony Joshua celebrates regaining his heavyweight titles flanked by Eddie and Barry Hearn, Clash on the Dunes, December 2019, Diriyah, Saudi Arabia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On days like today, the days after big fights, Hearn is dramatically busy. The machine must whir into action; a narrative must be shaped. (\u201cNarratives are <em>the</em> most important thing in selling a live sporting event!\u201d) When we meet, he has only recently returned from Dubai (family holiday; he took meetings), and he\u2019ll soon fly to Dallas (work). This morning, he has accepted several interview requests \u2013 never say no! \u2013 though he has rejected one, an exception, from <em>Good Morning Britain</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThey asked me to come on with Fury\u2019s dad,\u201d Hearn says. He is incredulous. \u201cI mean, fucking <em>hell</em>! These people are so naff. It\u2019s like they literally just want to get you having a row.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve come to ask Hearn about all of this. How he has become a near-permanent fixture in the public eye. How he has transformed from chatty sports promoter into mainstream celebrity, invited on to morning chat shows and cult-followed on Twitter. How he has become more famous than many of his clients, even though <em>they</em> employ <em>him</em> to promote <em>them</em>. I want to ask why he thinks this has all happened. Whether or not it\u2019s been part of some grand plan.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t, because Eddie\u2019s dad Barry has turned up wanting to know when Eddie will be finished with all the interviews.</p> <p>\u201cYou like the look of my office?\u201d the promoter Barry Hearn says.</p> <p>Barry\u2019s office is the nicest at Hearn HQ, which is why Eddie decided to film his interviews there.</p> <p>Eddie shrugs. \u201cWe needed to do some work.\u201d</p> <p>Barry is still technically Eddie\u2019s boss. Matchroom Boxing is a subsidiary of Matchroom Sport, a firm Barry set up in the 1980s and which he still runs. It was Matchroom Sport that gave snooker its big mainstream break, and who later promoted Chris Eubank and Frank Bruno. Eddie still defers to Barry, even though Barry, who is 71, is slowly beginning to cool it with the business stuff, and Eddie, who is 40, is really just getting going.</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate that I\u2019m working for my son these days,\u201d Barry says.</p> <p>He looks at the crowd following Eddie around \u2013 the camera crews, Eddie\u2019s PR guys, me \u2013 then launches into the role of embarrassing dad.</p> <p>\u201cWhen he was younger,\u201d Barry says, \u201che used to tell the birds that he <em>owned</em> this house.\u201d</p> <p>There is laughter, not from Eddie. Eddie is wincing at the memory, like, <em>\u201cCome on, Dad\u201d</em>. Barry is all smiles. When he eventually scoots off, an aide thanks him for letting them use his office. Barry grins. Then, without missing a beat, he says: \u201cThere\u2019ll be an invoice coming, you know.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3461ee3b9a84a6ed36c9d0fdad1582f3c775ca8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3461ee3b9a84a6ed36c9d0fdad1582f3c775ca8f/84_140_2393_2991/800.jpg\" alt=\"The making of Matchroom: Frank Bruno.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The making of Matchroom: Frank Bruno.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Monty Fresco/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>When Hearn was</strong></em> growing up, he and his dad were relentlessly competitive, and, without prompting, their relationship colours the span of our conversation. \u201cWe sparred at 15,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cWe beat the life out of each other in the ring.\u201d Barry came from a Dagenham council estate and made good. Eddie went to a private school and lived in a stately home. \u201cHe was petrified that I would become all the things he\u2019d hated growing up,\u201d Hearn says. \u201cThe only kid at school with money. The kid at school who\u2019s a bit flash and brash.\u201d Barry still calls Eddie \u201csilver spoon\u201d. \u201cHe was so obsessed with that. With the worry of me being, you know, <em>that</em> kid.\u201d</p> <p>To instil a work ethic, Barry would make Eddie do odd jobs: he shined Barry\u2019s shoes, he cleaned Barry\u2019s car. \u201cHe made me his hobby,\u201d Hearn says. \u201cHis little project. \u2018I\u2019m going to build you in a way where you\u2019re going to be dangerous. You\u2019re going to be good at what you do.\u2019\u201d At one point, Barry had Eddie rifling through the Yellow Pages, so he could cold-call businesses with sponsorship offers. Eddie was still a kid. (The younger Hearn now uses similar tactics with his own kids, two daughters, though he is less exacting.) By 15, Eddie was selling double glazing over the phone. By his early 20s he\u2019d worked at a sports management company, representing golfers, then found his way back to the family business, where he\u2019d belonged all along.</p> <p>When Hearn was selling windows, cold-calling people in their homes (\u201cThe most unbelievable schooling for selling!\u201d), Hearn could take the rejections, of which there were many, one after the other \u2013 they made the wins sweeter. What he couldn\u2019t accept was people always reacting to him as though he\u2019d only made it because of his dad.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of it was just a chip on my shoulder of growing up as Barry Hearn\u2019s son,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you come from money, people automatically resent you. They think you get opportunities that other people haven\u2019t. True! But you play the hand you\u2019re dealt with.\u201d</p> <p>At one point, Hearn mentions he feels \u201cmanufactured\u201d. I say it sounds like Barry wanted to create another Barry.</p> <p>\u201cI think secretly what he\u2019s most proud of is that I work as hard as him,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a responsibility, that I have to continue the legacy.\u201d</p> <p>Then he adds something odd.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing I\u2019m jealous of is that I never got to make it from nothing. I believe I would have, but I never got the chance. He\u2019s 71 and he still can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s achieved because of where he came from. But I grew up here\u201d \u2013 he points around the office \u2013 \u201cyou know what I mean? So, although I\u2019m grateful, it\u2019s kind of like I didn\u2019t get that opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>This seems ridiculous to me, to complain about not being given the opportunity to grow up <em>less</em> privileged. I ask him why that\u2019s a problem.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I would have liked to have achieved. That\u2019s the one criticism I will always get\u2026\u201d That he got a head start. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so driven to take this to levels beyond anything he could have ever done. How can I be a success if I just maintain the market position? Or don\u2019t show international growth? Or don\u2019t produce the numbers he could never have produced? That\u2019s the competitive instinct between us. It\u2019s like, \u2018Come on then, son. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019re made of.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dab94276c84ba2103606be95f1ad38696305d71f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dab94276c84ba2103606be95f1ad38696305d71f/0_550_4912_6140/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dad and me sparred when I was 15.

Again, I know I had a head start, but he never got a US TV deal. He never sold out Wembley. He never did a big site deal with the Middle East and got tens of millions out of them.\u201d</p> <p>Hearn wants to be bigger than his dad. Be greater. \u201cHis mentality,\u201d Hearn says, \u201cwas always like, he couldn\u2019t believe how well it was going. It was like, \u2018Fuck, whatever you do, don\u2019t rock the ship. Don\u2019t fuck it up!\u2019\u201d That\u2019s not Hearn\u2019s approach. \u201cI\u2019m saying, \u2018How do we go international? Into different markets?\u2019 That\u2019s the strategy for us. People say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re not interested in UK boxing any more.\u2019 I am! But I\u2019m not going to restrict myself to one market.\u201d</p> <p>Hearn puts on shows in the US, the UK, central Europe and the Middle East (a hard sell to human rights organisations, but, in his thinking: who is he to tell a boxer he can\u2019t fight somewhere when it means them turning down \u201cthe kind of money that secures generational wealth\u201d?) \u201cWe\u2019ve built a business and we\u2019ve built reserves and we\u2019ve built wealth to a point where nothing can hurt us,\u201d Hearn says. \u201cThe best money to have is \u2018fuck-you\u2019 money, which means you can\u2019t hurt. If I lose a fight\u201d \u2013 if a fight is cancelled, due to a pandemic, say \u2013 \u201cor a broadcast deal, we\u2019re OK, you know? We could walk away tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>I ask whether he really would.</p> <p>He says no.</p> <p>Then I ask him if it\u2019s because he enjoys the limelight.</p> <p>\u201cI used to,\u201d he says. \u201cI <em>used</em> to enjoy it. I think it\u2019s become, it sounds a bit arrogant, but it\u2019s become a little bit intrusive. I\u2019m a showman. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t enjoy the limelight. I guess I do. But I do notice now that\u2026\u201d It\u2019s tough for him to go out with his family without getting bothered, he says. People point at him. People stop him in the street. He prefers not to get the tube now, because inevitably one person will recognise him and before long the whole carriage knows who he is. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of what you do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways. All these celebrities who say, \u2018Oh, you know, I\u2019m getting <em>terrible</em> comments on social media.\u2019 Well, you signed up for it! I\u2019ve put myself in front of the camera. I waffle all day. People are going to be opinionated.\u201d He\u2019s stopped using social media as much as he used to for the same reason \u2013 people get on his back, for all the wrong reasons, he says. And they are not always gracious. \u201cIt\u2019s the Twitter thing.\u201d He means the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoContextHearn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">fan account</a>, the one that reduces him to memes. \u201cIt\u2019s made it 10 times worse.\u201d</p> <p>Worse?</p> <p>\u201cWorse! Because they don\u2019t even know who I am. I\u2019m just that guy off Twitter. I can\u2019t knock it\u2026\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, I say.</p> <p>\u201cIt is, but it used to be a sports fan, right? Now it\u2019s someone\u2019s wife or girlfriend whose husband sent them a clip of me. \u2018Oh, that\u2019s <em>that</em> fucking guy.\u2019 So it\u2019s funny in a way. But it\u2019s, like, draining.\u201d</p> <p>I say that this is part of his new celebrity status.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t look at it like that,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like to call myself a celebrity. I don\u2019t want to be a celebrity. I really don\u2019t. I want to be a businessman.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t part of the plan to become well-known?</p> <p>\u201cNo, never,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a plan to be vocal. To have a voice. But now I\u2019m getting approached to do TV shows with terrestrial broadcasters and it\u2019s, like, hang on a minute, my job is to promote my client, right? I don\u2019t want to be the star. I want to be the mouthpiece to make <em>them</em> a star.\u201d He is musing. \u201cIf I can drive a bigger fan base to the sport by being a little bit of a celebrity, that\u2019s fine. But if I\u2019m a fighter, and I\u2019m starting to think, \u2018Fucking hell, this guy\u2019s bigger than me\u2026\u2019 That\u2019s never been the aim. That\u2019s never been the plan.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Relentless is a word me and my dad use a lot: relentless is a word I prefer to greatness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em><strong>Hearn has a catch-all</strong></em> approach to the press: \u201cUse me and abuse me.\u201d (He also likes to say: \u201cI\u2019m the guy they wheel out.\u201d) But, more and more, the press he does has to be the right kind. \u201cI want to be someone respected for changing the sport,\u201d he says. \u201cNot, \u2018Oh, he was the guy on the\u2026\u2019 I\u2019m conscious of that.

He says no, but then he launches into a whole spiel about it. \u201cI worry about not winning,\u201d he says. \u201cNot winning as in not being the best, you know? Not being number one.\u201d Hearn sets targets every year, and every year the targets get higher, \u201cand the fear of failure for me is not achieving those goals. It\u2019s about how big we can be, how slick we can be.\u201d</p> <p>Hearn is incredibly self-critical. When people tell him he\u2019s done a good job, he won\u2019t believe it. \u201cIt\u2019s sad in a way,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m probably not enjoying things the way I should. But it keeps me wanting more.\u201d He\u2019s rarely happy; small mistakes consume him. \u201cThe only way you can achieve greatness is to be a perfectionist in everything you do,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not striving for the perfect performance, or the perfect product, or whatever it is, how do you really achieve greatness?\u201d</p> <p>Hearn talks a lot about greatness. I ask him if he wants to be remembered for being great. At first he says no, that he just wants to be remembered. But then he realises that just being remembered probably isn\u2019t enough. \u201cRespect,\u201d he says. \u201cRespect is a good word.\u201d Then he changes his mind again. \u201cProbably the best thing would be, \u2018He didn\u2019t stop. He was relentless.\u2019 That\u2019s a word me and my dad use a lot: <em>relentless</em>. Relentless is a word I prefer to greatness. Greatness is an opinion. Relentless doesn\u2019t have to be an opinion. It can be fact.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The boxing promoter Eddie Hearn is telling the world what it wants to hear, live on national television. It is early on a Monday morning. Hearn is in the Hearn family offices, a converted pile outside Brentwood, rural Essex, that was once the Hearn family home, pre-conversion. \u201cLook,\u201d he says. He is talking directly to camera, speaking live to a news anchor down the line. \u201cEverybody knows this is a monstrous fight. It makes perfect sense. How could it not make perfect sense?\u201d It is 24 hours after Tyson Fury boxed Deontay Wilder in a big-money Las Vegas brawl. Fury won, convincingly. Now the news channels are asking about the heavyweight division\u2019s other premium fighter, Anthony Joshua, who happens to be Hearn\u2019s marquee client. Will Joshua fight Fury now? Can Hearn make it happen? \u201cLet\u2019s have it right,\u201d Hearn says. Here he is, a salesman in his element, a heavyweight chatterbox dangling a deal. \u201cWe have an opportunity to make an event,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just the biggest event in British boxing history, but one of the biggest sporting events\u201d \u2013 pause \u2013 \u201cof all time.\u201d Hearn is not a man to tone down the hyperbole. Nor does he turn down the opportunity to talk. \u201cI\u2019ll do every interview in the line,\u201d he says, of his commitment to promotion, \u201cand I\u2019ll get to the end and it\u2019s some geezer from\u2026 \u2018Frank\u2019s Boxing Hour\u2019?\u201d He doesn\u2019t have it in him to turn requests down, he says, even when the requests come from amateur YouTubers. But, you know, all publicity is good publicity. After big fights, news channels clamour for Hearn\u2019s take, not just because he is a grade-A gabber \u2013 which he is, a truly exceptional gabber \u2013 but because his interviews get traction, particularly when they\u2019re chopped up and shared across social media. Almost a million people follow Hearn on Twitter, where he delivers lines with the charm and swagger of a star performer. Some 350,000 people follow an Eddie Hearn fan account that reduces his soundbites to memes. Thanks in part to his social media persona \u2013 performative, nearly always delighted at something, game for a laugh \u2013 but also to the recent resurgence of the heavyweight division as a popular spectacle, Hearn has shot comet-like over the threshold of boxing and into the public consciousness, and established himself as one of the loudest voices in sports. These days, he turns up, almost miraculously, everywhere: on the news, at weigh-ins, on a talkshow, at press conferences, on your partner\u2019s Instagram feed (telling jokes, from quarantine). He can come across as a combination of businessman and comedian \u2013 a mostly serious man with a side-hustle in laughs. His company, Matchroom Boxing, promotes more than 90 boxers, including several world champions. But of late it has seemed as though Hearn has become more famous than most of his clients. Hearn refers to himself as \u201ca travelling salesman\u201d \u2013 his schedule, these days, is not carbon efficient \u2013 though really he\u2019d like to be remembered for being an outstanding man of business. Some people see him like that. Others think of him as a kind of Essex wide boy, a chancer, ready to pull the wool over your eyes. The latter take is simplistic. Hearn has sold out events at Wembley and Madison Square Garden. He was the first promoter to make a $1bn streaming deal, with the on-demand service DAZN, and the only boxing promoter to have organised a big-money event in the Middle East (still controversial). He excels at twisting negotiations to benefit the boxers he promotes, particularly their wallets, and subsequently his own, and he is expert at conjuring stories to pitch fights to audiences, especially to those who are only casually interested in boxing. \u201cI love to sell,\u201d he says. \u201cI love to make money. But it\u2019s not just about that. It\u2019s about the achievement of making a breakthrough.\u201d On days like today, the days after big fights, Hearn is dramatically busy. The machine must whir into action; a narrative must be shaped. (\u201cNarratives are the most important thing in selling a live sporting event!\u201d) When we meet, he has only recently returned from Dubai (family holiday; he took meetings), and he\u2019ll soon fly to Dallas (work). This morning, he has accepted several interview requests \u2013 never say no! \u2013 though he has rejected one, an exception, from Good Morning Britain. \u201cThey asked me to come on with Fury\u2019s dad,\u201d Hearn says. He is incredulous. \u201cI mean, fucking hell! These people are so naff. It\u2019s like they literally just want to get you having a row.\u201d I\u2019ve come to ask Hearn about all of this. How he has become a near-permanent fixture in the public eye. How he has transformed from chatty sports promoter into mainstream celebrity, invited on to morning chat shows and cult-followed on Twitter. How he has become more famous than many of his clients, even though they employ him to promote them. I want to ask why he thinks this has all happened. Whether or not it\u2019s been part of some grand plan. But I can\u2019t, because Eddie\u2019s dad Barry has turned up wanting to know when Eddie will be finished with all the interviews. \u201cYou like the look of my office?\u201d the promoter Barry Hearn says. Barry\u2019s office is the nicest at Hearn HQ, which is why Eddie decided to film his interviews there. Eddie shrugs. \u201cWe needed to do some work.\u201d Barry is still technically Eddie\u2019s boss. Matchroom Boxing is a subsidiary of Matchroom Sport, a firm Barry set up in the 1980s and which he still runs. It was Matchroom Sport that gave snooker its big mainstream break, and who later promoted Chris Eubank and Frank Bruno. Eddie still defers to Barry, even though Barry, who is 71, is slowly beginning to cool it with the business stuff, and Eddie, who is 40, is really just getting going. \u201cI appreciate that I\u2019m working for my son these days,\u201d Barry says. He looks at the crowd following Eddie around \u2013 the camera crews, Eddie\u2019s PR guys, me \u2013 then launches into the role of embarrassing dad. \u201cWhen he was younger,\u201d Barry says, \u201che used to tell the birds that he owned this house.\u201d There is laughter, not from Eddie. Eddie is wincing at the memory, like, \u201cCome on, Dad\u201d. Barry is all smiles. When he eventually scoots off, an aide thanks him for letting them use his office. Barry grins. Then, without missing a beat, he says: \u201cThere\u2019ll be an invoice coming, you know.\u201d When Hearn was growing up, he and his dad were relentlessly competitive, and, without prompting, their relationship colours the span of our conversation. \u201cWe sparred at 15,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cWe beat the life out of each other in the ring.\u201d Barry came from a Dagenham council estate and made good. Eddie went to a private school and lived in a stately home. \u201cHe was petrified that I would become all the things he\u2019d hated growing up,\u201d Hearn says. \u201cThe only kid at school with money. The kid at school who\u2019s a bit flash and brash.\u201d Barry still calls Eddie \u201csilver spoon\u201d. \u201cHe was so obsessed with that. With the worry of me being, you know, that kid.\u201d To instil a work ethic, Barry would make Eddie do odd jobs: he shined Barry\u2019s shoes, he cleaned Barry\u2019s car. \u201cHe made me his hobby,\u201d Hearn says. \u201cHis little project. \u2018I\u2019m going to build you in a way where you\u2019re going to be dangerous. You\u2019re going to be good at what you do.\u2019\u201d At one point, Barry had Eddie rifling through the Yellow Pages, so he could cold-call businesses with sponsorship offers. Eddie was still a kid. (The younger Hearn now uses similar tactics with his own kids, two daughters, though he is less exacting.) By 15, Eddie was selling double glazing over the phone. By his early 20s he\u2019d worked at a sports management company, representing golfers, then found his way back to the family business, where he\u2019d belonged all along. When Hearn was selling windows, cold-calling people in their homes (\u201cThe most unbelievable schooling for selling!\u201d), Hearn could take the rejections, of which there were many, one after the other \u2013 they made the wins sweeter. What he couldn\u2019t accept was people always reacting to him as though he\u2019d only made it because of his dad. \u201cI think a lot of it was just a chip on my shoulder of growing up as Barry Hearn\u2019s son,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you come from money, people automatically resent you. They think you get opportunities that other people haven\u2019t. True! But you play the hand you\u2019re dealt with.\u201d At one point, Hearn mentions he feels \u201cmanufactured\u201d. I say it sounds like Barry wanted to create another Barry. \u201cI think secretly what he\u2019s most proud of is that I work as hard as him,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a responsibility, that I have to continue the legacy.\u201d Then he adds something odd. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m jealous of is that I never got to make it from nothing. I believe I would have, but I never got the chance. He\u2019s 71 and he still can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s achieved because of where he came from. But I grew up here\u201d \u2013 he points around the office \u2013 \u201cyou know what I mean? So, although I\u2019m grateful, it\u2019s kind of like I didn\u2019t get that opportunity.\u201d This seems ridiculous to me, to complain about not being given the opportunity to grow up less privileged. I ask him why that\u2019s a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I would have liked to have achieved. That\u2019s the one criticism I will always get\u2026\u201d That he got a head start. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so driven to take this to levels beyond anything he could have ever done. How can I be a success if I just maintain the market position? Or don\u2019t show international growth? Or don\u2019t produce the numbers he could never have produced? That\u2019s the competitive instinct between us. It\u2019s like, \u2018Come on then, son. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019re made of.\u2019\u201d I ask if he\u2019s constantly trying to prove himself to his dad. \u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d he says. \u201cSubconsciously.\u201d Do you ever think you will? \u201cI think I have!\u201d he says. \u201cHe would never have expected me to achieve what we\u2019ve achieved, because he couldn\u2019t do it. Again, I know I had a head start, but he never got a US TV deal. He never sold out Wembley. He never did a big site deal with the Middle East and got tens of millions out of them.\u201d Hearn wants to be bigger than his dad. Be greater. \u201cHis mentality,\u201d Hearn says, \u201cwas always like, he couldn\u2019t believe how well it was going. It was like, \u2018Fuck, whatever you do, don\u2019t rock the ship. Don\u2019t fuck it up!\u2019\u201d That\u2019s not Hearn\u2019s approach. \u201cI\u2019m saying, \u2018How do we go international? Into different markets?\u2019 That\u2019s the strategy for us. People say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re not interested in UK boxing any more.\u2019 I am! But I\u2019m not going to restrict myself to one market.\u201d Hearn puts on shows in the US, the UK, central Europe and the Middle East (a hard sell to human rights organisations, but, in his thinking: who is he to tell a boxer he can\u2019t fight somewhere when it means them turning down \u201cthe kind of money that secures generational wealth\u201d?) \u201cWe\u2019ve built a business and we\u2019ve built reserves and we\u2019ve built wealth to a point where nothing can hurt us,\u201d Hearn says. \u201cThe best money to have is \u2018fuck-you\u2019 money, which means you can\u2019t hurt. If I lose a fight\u201d \u2013 if a fight is cancelled, due to a pandemic, say \u2013 \u201cor a broadcast deal, we\u2019re OK, you know? We could walk away tomorrow.\u201d I ask whether he really would. He says no. Then I ask him if it\u2019s because he enjoys the limelight. \u201cI used to,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to enjoy it. I think it\u2019s become, it sounds a bit arrogant, but it\u2019s become a little bit intrusive. I\u2019m a showman. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t enjoy the limelight. I guess I do. But I do notice now that\u2026\u201d It\u2019s tough for him to go out with his family without getting bothered, he says. People point at him. People stop him in the street. He prefers not to get the tube now, because inevitably one person will recognise him and before long the whole carriage knows who he is. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of what you do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways. All these celebrities who say, \u2018Oh, you know, I\u2019m getting terrible comments on social media.\u2019 Well, you signed up for it! I\u2019ve put myself in front of the camera. I waffle all day. People are going to be opinionated.\u201d He\u2019s stopped using social media as much as he used to for the same reason \u2013 people get on his back, for all the wrong reasons, he says. And they are not always gracious. \u201cIt\u2019s the Twitter thing.\u201d He means the fan account, the one that reduces him to memes. \u201cIt\u2019s made it 10 times worse.\u201d Worse? \u201cWorse! Because they don\u2019t even know who I am. I\u2019m just that guy off Twitter. I can\u2019t knock it\u2026\u201d It\u2019s funny, I say. \u201cIt is, but it used to be a sports fan, right? Now it\u2019s someone\u2019s wife or girlfriend whose husband sent them a clip of me. \u2018Oh, that\u2019s that fucking guy.\u2019 So it\u2019s funny in a way. But it\u2019s, like, draining.\u201d I say that this is part of his new celebrity status. \u201cI don\u2019t look at it like that,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like to call myself a celebrity. I don\u2019t want to be a celebrity. I really don\u2019t. I want to be a businessman.\u201d It wasn\u2019t part of the plan to become well-known? \u201cNo, never,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a plan to be vocal. To have a voice. But now I\u2019m getting approached to do TV shows with terrestrial broadcasters and it\u2019s, like, hang on a minute, my job is to promote my client, right? I don\u2019t want to be the star. I want to be the mouthpiece to make them a star.\u201d He is musing. \u201cIf I can drive a bigger fan base to the sport by being a little bit of a celebrity, that\u2019s fine. But if I\u2019m a fighter, and I\u2019m starting to think, \u2018Fucking hell, this guy\u2019s bigger than me\u2026\u2019 That\u2019s never been the aim. That\u2019s never been the plan.\u201d Hearn has a catch-all approach to the press: \u201cUse me and abuse me.\u201d (He also likes to say: \u201cI\u2019m the guy they wheel out.\u201d) But, more and more, the press he does has to be the right kind. \u201cI want to be someone respected for changing the sport,\u201d he says. \u201cNot, \u2018Oh, he was the guy on the\u2026\u2019 I\u2019m conscious of that. I don\u2019t want to be\u2026 jokey.\u201d He\u2019s considering this, how much to give of himself. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve turned down adverts with major brands!\u201d Does he worry about failure? He says no, but then he launches into a whole spiel about it. \u201cI worry about not winning,\u201d he says. \u201cNot winning as in not being the best, you know? Not being number one.\u201d Hearn sets targets every year, and every year the targets get higher, \u201cand the fear of failure for me is not achieving those goals. It\u2019s about how big we can be, how slick we can be.\u201d Hearn is incredibly self-critical. When people tell him he\u2019s done a good job, he won\u2019t believe it. \u201cIt\u2019s sad in a way,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m probably not enjoying things the way I should. But it keeps me wanting more.\u201d He\u2019s rarely happy; small mistakes consume him. \u201cThe only way you can achieve greatness is to be a perfectionist in everything you do,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not striving for the perfect performance, or the perfect product, or whatever it is, how do you really achieve greatness?\u201d Hearn talks a lot about greatness. I ask him if he wants to be remembered for being great. At first he says no, that he just wants to be remembered. But then he realises that just being remembered probably isn\u2019t enough. \u201cRespect,\u201d he says. \u201cRespect is a good word.\u201d Then he changes his mind again. \u201cProbably the best thing would be, \u2018He didn\u2019t stop. He was relentless.\u2019 That\u2019s a word me and my dad use a lot: relentless. Relentless is a word I prefer to greatness. Greatness is an opinion. Relentless doesn\u2019t have to be an opinion. It can be fact.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LamornaAsh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Lamorna Ash</a> has a hunch about seasickness: a conviction that there could be more than one reason why a person might feel suddenly queasy up on deck. \u201cA fisherman told me that his cousin never used to suffer from seasickness at all,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then he had kids, and suddenly he did. I thought this was fascinating. It made me wonder whether seasickness isn\u2019t somehow connected to things that tie you to the land. Could it be that the more of those things there are, the more likely you are to suffer from it? Perhaps it functions a bit like homesickness in that way.\u201d Struck by her own fancifulness, she flashes me a smile. \u201cWell, anyway\u2026 I like that as a way of thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p>When she was 22 and studying for a master\u2019s degree in social anthropology at University College London, seasickness was briefly Ash\u2019s closest companion. Having decided to devote her thesis to the way that fishing shapes a community, she moved to Newlyn in Cornwall \u2013 which is where she met Don, the skipper of a rusty old trawler called the Filadelfia. Would Don consider taking her out in his boat, so that she might stand, as it were, in \u201cthe same wellies\u201d as his crew? Somewhat to her amazement \u2013 women are supposed to bring bad luck at sea \u2013 he said that he would, and so it was that one evening in 2017 she found herself rounding Land\u2019s End just as the sun was about to set, her stomach a tight knot of nerves, her eyes already red from the salt-licked wind. \u201cI\u2019m someone who doesn\u2019t think too hard about things before I do them,\u201d she says. \u201cI seem not to be very cautious; I get overexcited. But that day, yes, I was nervous. I was very scared of seasickness. Not so much of being sick itself, but of it being so bad that I would be useless and they would have to take me home. I didn\u2019t want to do anything to jeopardise their trip; I knew that would cost them a lot of money.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1be8a8b0e114b9bc24f5606c1fd633a65fe0a2c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1be8a8b0e114b9bc24f5606c1fd633a65fe0a2c1/0_2509_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"don the skipper of the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don, skipper of the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, she was sick, but only once. \u201cYou start yawning,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re going to go, and you don\u2019t want the men to see because it\u2019s such a sign of weakness.\u201d Most of the time, however, she was able to manage her constant, raging nausea with a combination of seasickness pills and hard work; among other things, she learned to gut every kind of fish, holding the gasping, flapping creatures tight in her hands even as she struggled properly to stand upright. Life on a trawler is hard, the days long and tough and extremely cold, and thanks to this she found that she was always hungry for the vast meals the crew cooked and ate down below, sickness or no sickness.</p> <p>As for the things that tied <em>her</em> to the land \u2013 her parents, her friends \u2013 she learned not to think of them. It embarrasses her now to remember the moment when, not long after they had set sail, she asked Don for the Filadelfia\u2019s wifi code. (\u201cDo you know how much that costs at sea?\u201d he told her, with a laugh.) Her phone useless in the pocket of her oilskins, she found that time deepened at sea. She learned to speak a new language, one at once both more reticent than the English spoken on land and yet, in some ways, more open, too. In the wheelhouse, talking to Don or one of the other men while they were on watch \u2013 on a trawler, you\u2019re potentially only ever seconds from catastrophe; hit an old anchor or some submarine cables, and the vessel can easily capsize \u2013 she learned to listen to the long, meditative gaps between sentences, spaces that allowed words to \u201cexpand and drift\u201d in ways that rendered them altogether more meaningful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8230c988221e5362fe8654a67e167d6447659fc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8230c988221e5362fe8654a67e167d6447659fc2/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"lamorna ash on board the newlyn trawler\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filadelfia freedom: Lamorna Ash on board the Newlyn trawler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did the world of the Filadelfia feel very male? Was it unnerving to sleep in her bunk \u2013 its size and shape made her think of a coffin \u2013 alongside all those snoring, hairy, briny men? \u201cI didn\u2019t especially experience it like that, no,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were older than me; they\u2019re family guys, and their women are very strong. The biggest fishing family in Newlyn, the Stevensons, has a matriarch at the head of it. I never felt unsafe, though now and then I would ask one of them: <em>would you say that to a man? </em>But I did want to prove myself a bit. I was never going just to sit there and make notes and take photographs.\u201d Ash studied English at Oxford, and Don made her think of Singleton, the old sailor on Joseph Conrad\u2019s Narcissus: the men who could understand Singleton\u2019s silences were, she recalled, those mariners who \u201cknew how to exist beyond the pale of life\u201d. Staring out into the blue-black, she realised on that first night aboard the Filadelfia that she and its crew had now themselves moved beyond the pale: a confined, almost monastic existence, and yet an unencumbered, roaming one, too \u2013 and so began what she thinks of today as the richest and most vast experience of her life so far.</p> <p>Ash\u2019s eight-day stint on the Filadelfia forms the spine of her first book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dark-salt-clear-9781526600011.html\">Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town</a></em>; artfully, she returns to it again and again, to the point where you come to believe she must always have known she would one day put the experience between hard covers. But this was, she insists, never her plan. Her thesis complete, she was interning at the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> when a publisher spotted a piece she had written about a trip she took on another trawler, the Crystal Sea \u2013 that publisher asked to meet her, and duly gave her a book deal (she now works for an educational charity). And in person, it\u2019s impossible not to take her at her word. I\u2019m amazed and slightly shocked when she reveals that she spent, in total, just three and a half months in Newlyn; something about her book \u2013 the intimacy of the encounters it describes; the epic quality of her account of life on the Filadelfia \u2013 leads you to imagine that she must have lived there for a year at least, and possibly much longer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6504536601f017d1f867c4c60f86fdf6a3a5ba6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6504536601f017d1f867c4c60f86fdf6a3a5ba6f/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"catch of the day on the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catch of the day on the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She and I meet in Penzance. She has been in Newlyn all weekend, seeing old friends and mooching around, and when I get off the train on a bright Monday afternoon, she pitches up in a long coat and with a ravishing new pixie haircut looking like someone who is slightly drunk on fresh air. For both of us, London and Covid-19 suddenly seem very far away. We can breathe. St Michael\u2019s Mount casts its usual spell out in the bay (24 hours later, the National Trust will announce that it is now closed to the public). <a href=\"https://jubileepool.co.uk/\">The Jubilee Pool</a>, Penzance\u2019s celebrated art deco saltwater lido, looks strangely inviting even in mid-March. The people, mostly retired, that we pass as we walk along the promenade are unhurried and smiling.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s important not to take things at face value. Ash has a family connection to this part of Cornwall; she spent her childhood holidays in Lelant, near St Ives, where her mother\u2019s side of the family has lived for generations. But if those times were idyllic \u2013 her mother, a former actor who once appeared in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/poldark\">Poldark</a></em>, was always encouraging her to let her imagination run wild as they walked on the beach \u2013 Cornwall has, of course, a darker side: chiaroscuro shades that she learned to see (\u201canother way of looking\u201d) more clearly during her time in Newlyn.</p> <p>Though the town is one of the most profitable fishing ports in Britain, it is also poor. In 2015, the mean gross annual salary in Penzance, of which Newlyn is a part (the two merge almost seamlessly together nowadays), was \u00a326,788, compared with \u00a334,265 in the rest of the country. Penzance is literally the end of the line, as anyone who has travelled there by train will know, and Newlyn sits at the far side of a county that in 2017 had the 10th highest numbers of homeless people in the country, and the third highest suicide rate in the UK. Cornwall is the only county poor enough to have qualified for EU emergency funding \u2013 a sad fact that did very little to change its implacable determination to vote for Brexit (the <a href=\"https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/brexit/\">leave vote in the county</a> was 56.5%).</p> <p>In Newlyn, Ash carefully points out the sights to me. Here is the fish market, where she once spent a morning unpacking catch after catch, her fingers so cold she could not feel them (stored in ice, the lemon sole were the hardest to break apart); here is the Swordfish Inn, AKA the Swordy, where she used to drink with her new fishermen friends (it was once ranked second in a TV documentary entitled <em>The Toughest Pubs in Britain</em>); and here is the little house where she lodged with a couple she came to think of as her guardian angels, Denise and Lofty (Denise worked in a fishmongers; Lofty is a ship chandler). Finally, we go past Newlyn\u2019s lifeboat station and out on to the pontoons in the harbour to look at the boats. The creaking Filadelfia has, she says, finally given up the ghost, but there are two trawlers here that look just like it: rough, industrial vessels with huge derricks from which their nets drag. In her book, she likens these boats to prehistoric birds with skeletal wings, and as we gaze at them, clanking and inhospitable, it isn\u2019t hard to see why.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cd714045c9f1d5c66c86f123a013e6770242672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cd714045c9f1d5c66c86f123a013e6770242672/0_0_6500_4338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the swordfish inn at newlyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Swordfish Inn, Newlyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Hawkins Photography/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newlyn has the largest number of vessels in its administration of any port in the UK, 88% of which are \u201c10 metres and under\u201d inshore fishing boats \u2013 and the harbour looks busy to me, if not exactly bustling. And yet, as Ash writes in <em>Dark, Salt, Clear</em>, over the years \u201cthe pontoons\u2019 leaves have become sparser \u2013 a deciduous tree living a perpetual winter\u201d. The number of fishing vessels nationally has fallen by 29% since 1996. The money needed to buy and maintain a boat, and the cost of fuel, grows ever higher; combined with expensive struggles over quotas, these things have worked to put off a new generation from following their parents into the industry (though a trawler man can earn a good living, depending on the type of boat he has, and how good the fishing is in his waters). Does she feel Newlyn could survive a future without fishing? She shakes her head. \u201cYou know what they say: for every man at sea, there are three people [connected to the industry] on land. The guys I was with in the pub last night: one was a filleter, one works at the auctions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The men take a misanthropic pleasure in telling you how awful it is. But it\u2019s also addictive. They can\u2019t give it up</p> <footer> <cite>Lamorna Ash</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The men\u2019s relationship with their work, as she learned over the course of many late-night conversations, is complicated. They\u2019re extremely proud of what they do; their sense of identity is entirely bound up with it. But many of them seem to hate it, too. \u201cThey take a kind of misanthropic pleasure in telling you how awful it is,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s also addictive, I think. They can\u2019t give it up.\u201d She understands this: \u201cEven now, I still love to go on to the AIS system [the automatic identification system that tracks the movements of boats out at sea] on my laptop.\u201d Do the men want their children to follow them into fishing? \u201cIt\u2019s a mixture. A lot don\u2019t. There is a sense of it being a hard life, but there\u2019s also sadness when a boat that has been in a family for generations suddenly isn\u2019t any more. It can be heart-wrenching [for a young person] to say: I can\u2019t live here, I can\u2019t do what my dad did, my education will take me elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cI met a guy who, when he was 12, used to run off on a boat. \u2018See you in a week, Mum,\u2019 he would say, once it was too late for her to do anything about it. It was a brilliant escape, a rite of passage. The older men were heroes for him, and he wanted to be like them. Fishing comes with many frustrations. The men hate throwing fish off the boat [to stay within EU quotas], and there have been low points when there was very little money in it. It\u2019s very precarious. What if you can\u2019t go out? You\u2019re dependent on the weather, especially if you\u2019re a small boat: a crabber, say. But on the other hand, there are not many industries where you can rise up so high.\u201d Is being a skipper a bit like being a king? Or a God? She laughs. \u201cYes, maybe it is.\u201d</p> <p>Brexit is mentioned only rarely in her book; its politics are deliberately oblique. But the subject came up a lot while she was in Newlyn. The first trawler she went on, the Crystal Sea, was part of the Brexit flotilla that sailed into London in 2016 (organised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/15/no-deal-brexit-buccaneers-make-waves-on-the-tyne-nigel-farage\">Fishing for Leave</a>, it sailed from Ramsgate to Westminster, demanding that Britain take back control of its waters; under the common fisheries policy, European fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds up to 12 nautical miles from the coasts of member states). \u201cIts crew spoke about \u2018our seas\u2019, which always felt bonkers to me. Fish migrate, and when you\u2019re out there\u2026 the sea is vast. It feels as though it belongs to everyone. But we had good debates. They were kind of vital for me. They made me see that arguments about waters are very complicated; I stopped assuming that a certain point of view was right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d3f002a81b17fbd769f00cc8b558f370327d8eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d3f002a81b17fbd769f00cc8b558f370327d8eb/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"seaview from the deck of the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from the deck\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the fishermen aren\u2019t dumb; they\u2019re not, by her telling, particularly hopeful that Brexit, even now it is agreed, will necessarily work to their benefit. After all, the fishing industry makes up only about 0.05% of the UK\u2019s GDP, and employs fewer than 12,000 people. \u201cI think they\u2019re preparing for disappointment,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have the sense that they are always sold down the river. Politicians use them for a cause, and then they drop them. It\u2019s a long way [from London] down here, and you feel that rage a lot: their awareness that the debate is never about their place.\u201d What about the money the EU has long pumped into Cornwall? (It received some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/13/cornwall-council-eu-cornish-embassy-brussels-brexit\">\u00a380m a year in EU funding</a>, money that went into jobs, training and local infrastructure.) Did she ever point this out to them? \u201cYes, but they just ignore certain things. It\u2019s territorial for them.\u201d</p> <p>And what about her? In what ways did her experiences at sea change her? She isn\u2019t, she says, a particularly squeamish person; apart from when she was dealing with rays, a fish that seemed to be somehow more fiercely alive than the sole and the monkfish, and which could only be killed with a stab to the heart, she didn\u2019t mind the gutting and the filleting. She was learning new skills, and there was something so unexpectedly beautiful, she thinks, even about their arrabbiata-sauce coloured insides: \u201cThe brilliant thing is that every time I have fish now, I think about the supply chain. It has made me more appreciative, knowing that men are out there, risking their lives.\u201d Most people are, she thinks, very distant from their shrink-wrapped food: far <em>too</em> distant: \u201cI have the sense, living in London, of so rarely being involved in <em>real</em> things.\u201d</p> <p>Her time in Newlyn also taught her to think, both as a city person and one determined to be more green, in a more nuanced way about the environmental issues around fishing. \u201cPeople say we have got to get rid of the trawlers, because of the damage they do to the seabed. But I know that doing so will affect the lives of a whole community \u2013 though it\u2019s a relief when you hear about the smaller boats: there is a future that could be greener.\u201d British people need to start eating more hake, she thinks: \u201cWe catch so much of it.\u201d (The fishermen of St Ives, incidentally, refer to themselves as Hakes, while the Newlyn men, with whom they are fiercely rivalrous, like to call the north coasters the Scaly Backs.)</p> <p>But she does not want to romanticise. As her book makes plain, fishing takes its effects on mental health; some men come to have issues with alcohol (though it is strictly forbidden at sea), and depression is a problem, too. \u201cI hope that I show the limits of close community, as well as its benefits,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had my own problems with depression in the past, and it was good to talk to the fishermen about their mental health. I recognised the disassociation they sometimes felt \u2013 it\u2019s how they survive \u2013 and how scary it can sometimes be.\u201d A fisherman\u2019s life is one of extremes: his sense of jeopardy swiftly replaced by one of celebration when he arrives home safely and hits the pub. As one of the men, Nathan, once told her: when a fisherman is at home, he\u2019s always counting the days until he leaves; and when he\u2019s at sea, he\u2019s always counting the days until he\u2019ll be back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40b52a42a434efc60157ecd40aed91f5a1cc097e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b52a42a434efc60157ecd40aed91f5a1cc097e/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"on board the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On board the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On her last night on the Filadelfia, Don cooked (how on earth did he do it?) one of the best meals she has ever eaten \u2013 a huge roast dinner of potatoes, mashed swede, Yorkshire puddings, cauliflower cheese, parsnips and beef \u2013 after which the crew, in spite of their bloated bellies, landed the best catch of their trip, the derricks moaning loudly as they pulled up the immense haul of prized turbot and cuttlefish (\u201clike waiting for lottery numbers to come up,\u201d Ash thought, as she waited to see what the nets had brought). But after this, the mood changed. No one slept much on that last night.</p> <p>Fishermen call it \u201cchannelling\u201d: when thoughts of home, and all the people in it, swim through your mind all night, waking you repeatedly. One of the men tells her that the term is drawn from the word \u201cchannel\u201d in its spiritual sense: the conveying of a spirit from another world to this one. (The link between these two worlds is the boat.) And she came to understand that it\u2019s a necessary process. The next morning, as the Filadelfia approached the harbour and a mobile phone signal was once again possible, the boat became simply another place of work rather than, as it was just moments before, the only world that mattered. And now it was the land that seemed suddenly mysterious: a single, unbroken entity she had found herself unable to imagine while she was at sea. Arrival was at once both exhilarating, and anticlimactic. Only when she came face to face with Lofty again did she realise how rancid she smelled \u2013 and how little her stench had mattered to her until that moment.</p> <p>Ash\u2019s book comes into the world garlanded with praise. William Dalrymple has called her a new star of nonfiction: \u201cprecise, perceptive, humane and sensitive\u201d. What will she do next? Does she have a plan? What, for her, could ever top Newlyn? \u201cI always have lots of plans,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to go to Texas for a year, and write about my family on my father\u2019s side: my grandfather was from Dallas, and after the war he set up the Marxist Leninist Society of London. For me, Cornwall is very blue, and I want to look at redness\u2026\u201d She thinks for a moment. \u201cOr perhaps I\u2019ll do a PhD about coastal communities. I need to wait for the pull.\u201d In the meantime, though, of one thing she is certain: that she must go back to using an old-fashioned \u201cbrick\u201d phone. \u201cI enjoyed listening to the men at sea. Out there, I realised how our phones are stopping us from listening, and I want to get back really to listening to people.\u201d Her eyes, which today are precisely the same colour as the English channel, meet my own, and hold them for a long minute.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town </em>is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a316.99).

      "bodyText": "Lamorna Ash has a hunch about seasickness: a conviction that there could be more than one reason why a person might feel suddenly queasy up on deck. \u201cA fisherman told me that his cousin never used to suffer from seasickness at all,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then he had kids, and suddenly he did. I thought this was fascinating. It made me wonder whether seasickness isn\u2019t somehow connected to things that tie you to the land. Could it be that the more of those things there are, the more likely you are to suffer from it? Perhaps it functions a bit like homesickness in that way.\u201d Struck by her own fancifulness, she flashes me a smile. \u201cWell, anyway\u2026 I like that as a way of thinking about it.\u201d When she was 22 and studying for a master\u2019s degree in social anthropology at University College London, seasickness was briefly Ash\u2019s closest companion. Having decided to devote her thesis to the way that fishing shapes a community, she moved to Newlyn in Cornwall \u2013 which is where she met Don, the skipper of a rusty old trawler called the Filadelfia. Would Don consider taking her out in his boat, so that she might stand, as it were, in \u201cthe same wellies\u201d as his crew? Somewhat to her amazement \u2013 women are supposed to bring bad luck at sea \u2013 he said that he would, and so it was that one evening in 2017 she found herself rounding Land\u2019s End just as the sun was about to set, her stomach a tight knot of nerves, her eyes already red from the salt-licked wind. \u201cI\u2019m someone who doesn\u2019t think too hard about things before I do them,\u201d she says. \u201cI seem not to be very cautious; I get overexcited. But that day, yes, I was nervous. I was very scared of seasickness. Not so much of being sick itself, but of it being so bad that I would be useless and they would have to take me home. I didn\u2019t want to do anything to jeopardise their trip; I knew that would cost them a lot of money.\u201d In the end, she was sick, but only once. \u201cYou start yawning,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re going to go, and you don\u2019t want the men to see because it\u2019s such a sign of weakness.\u201d Most of the time, however, she was able to manage her constant, raging nausea with a combination of seasickness pills and hard work; among other things, she learned to gut every kind of fish, holding the gasping, flapping creatures tight in her hands even as she struggled properly to stand upright. Life on a trawler is hard, the days long and tough and extremely cold, and thanks to this she found that she was always hungry for the vast meals the crew cooked and ate down below, sickness or no sickness. As for the things that tied her to the land \u2013 her parents, her friends \u2013 she learned not to think of them. It embarrasses her now to remember the moment when, not long after they had set sail, she asked Don for the Filadelfia\u2019s wifi code. (\u201cDo you know how much that costs at sea?\u201d he told her, with a laugh.) Her phone useless in the pocket of her oilskins, she found that time deepened at sea. She learned to speak a new language, one at once both more reticent than the English spoken on land and yet, in some ways, more open, too. In the wheelhouse, talking to Don or one of the other men while they were on watch \u2013 on a trawler, you\u2019re potentially only ever seconds from catastrophe; hit an old anchor or some submarine cables, and the vessel can easily capsize \u2013 she learned to listen to the long, meditative gaps between sentences, spaces that allowed words to \u201cexpand and drift\u201d in ways that rendered them altogether more meaningful. Did the world of the Filadelfia feel very male? Was it unnerving to sleep in her bunk \u2013 its size and shape made her think of a coffin \u2013 alongside all those snoring, hairy, briny men? \u201cI didn\u2019t especially experience it like that, no,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were older than me; they\u2019re family guys, and their women are very strong. The biggest fishing family in Newlyn, the Stevensons, has a matriarch at the head of it. I never felt unsafe, though now and then I would ask one of them: would you say that to a man? But I did want to prove myself a bit. I was never going just to sit there and make notes and take photographs.\u201d Ash studied English at Oxford, and Don made her think of Singleton, the old sailor on Joseph Conrad\u2019s Narcissus: the men who could understand Singleton\u2019s silences were, she recalled, those mariners who \u201cknew how to exist beyond the pale of life\u201d. Staring out into the blue-black, she realised on that first night aboard the Filadelfia that she and its crew had now themselves moved beyond the pale: a confined, almost monastic existence, and yet an unencumbered, roaming one, too \u2013 and so began what she thinks of today as the richest and most vast experience of her life so far. Ash\u2019s eight-day stint on the Filadelfia forms the spine of her first book, Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town; artfully, she returns to it again and again, to the point where you come to believe she must always have known she would one day put the experience between hard covers. But this was, she insists, never her plan. Her thesis complete, she was interning at the Times Literary Supplement when a publisher spotted a piece she had written about a trip she took on another trawler, the Crystal Sea \u2013 that publisher asked to meet her, and duly gave her a book deal (she now works for an educational charity). And in person, it\u2019s impossible not to take her at her word. I\u2019m amazed and slightly shocked when she reveals that she spent, in total, just three and a half months in Newlyn; something about her book \u2013 the intimacy of the encounters it describes; the epic quality of her account of life on the Filadelfia \u2013 leads you to imagine that she must have lived there for a year at least, and possibly much longer. She and I meet in Penzance. She has been in Newlyn all weekend, seeing old friends and mooching around, and when I get off the train on a bright Monday afternoon, she pitches up in a long coat and with a ravishing new pixie haircut looking like someone who is slightly drunk on fresh air. For both of us, London and Covid-19 suddenly seem very far away. We can breathe. St Michael\u2019s Mount casts its usual spell out in the bay (24 hours later, the National Trust will announce that it is now closed to the public). The Jubilee Pool, Penzance\u2019s celebrated art deco saltwater lido, looks strangely inviting even in mid-March. The people, mostly retired, that we pass as we walk along the promenade are unhurried and smiling. Still, it\u2019s important not to take things at face value. Ash has a family connection to this part of Cornwall; she spent her childhood holidays in Lelant, near St Ives, where her mother\u2019s side of the family has lived for generations. But if those times were idyllic \u2013 her mother, a former actor who once appeared in Poldark, was always encouraging her to let her imagination run wild as they walked on the beach \u2013 Cornwall has, of course, a darker side: chiaroscuro shades that she learned to see (\u201canother way of looking\u201d) more clearly during her time in Newlyn. Though the town is one of the most profitable fishing ports in Britain, it is also poor. In 2015, the mean gross annual salary in Penzance, of which Newlyn is a part (the two merge almost seamlessly together nowadays), was \u00a326,788, compared with \u00a334,265 in the rest of the country. Penzance is literally the end of the line, as anyone who has travelled there by train will know, and Newlyn sits at the far side of a county that in 2017 had the 10th highest numbers of homeless people in the country, and the third highest suicide rate in the UK. Cornwall is the only county poor enough to have qualified for EU emergency funding \u2013 a sad fact that did very little to change its implacable determination to vote for Brexit (the leave vote in the county was 56.5%). In Newlyn, Ash carefully points out the sights to me. Here is the fish market, where she once spent a morning unpacking catch after catch, her fingers so cold she could not feel them (stored in ice, the lemon sole were the hardest to break apart); here is the Swordfish Inn, AKA the Swordy, where she used to drink with her new fishermen friends (it was once ranked second in a TV documentary entitled The Toughest Pubs in Britain); and here is the little house where she lodged with a couple she came to think of as her guardian angels, Denise and Lofty (Denise worked in a fishmongers; Lofty is a ship chandler). Finally, we go past Newlyn\u2019s lifeboat station and out on to the pontoons in the harbour to look at the boats. The creaking Filadelfia has, she says, finally given up the ghost, but there are two trawlers here that look just like it: rough, industrial vessels with huge derricks from which their nets drag. In her book, she likens these boats to prehistoric birds with skeletal wings, and as we gaze at them, clanking and inhospitable, it isn\u2019t hard to see why. Newlyn has the largest number of vessels in its administration of any port in the UK, 88% of which are \u201c10 metres and under\u201d inshore fishing boats \u2013 and the harbour looks busy to me, if not exactly bustling. And yet, as Ash writes in Dark, Salt, Clear, over the years \u201cthe pontoons\u2019 leaves have become sparser \u2013 a deciduous tree living a perpetual winter\u201d. The number of fishing vessels nationally has fallen by 29% since 1996. The money needed to buy and maintain a boat, and the cost of fuel, grows ever higher; combined with expensive struggles over quotas, these things have worked to put off a new generation from following their parents into the industry (though a trawler man can earn a good living, depending on the type of boat he has, and how good the fishing is in his waters). Does she feel Newlyn could survive a future without fishing? She shakes her head. \u201cYou know what they say: for every man at sea, there are three people [connected to the industry] on land. The guys I was with in the pub last night: one was a filleter, one works at the auctions.\u201d The men\u2019s relationship with their work, as she learned over the course of many late-night conversations, is complicated. They\u2019re extremely proud of what they do; their sense of identity is entirely bound up with it. But many of them seem to hate it, too. \u201cThey take a kind of misanthropic pleasure in telling you how awful it is,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s also addictive, I think. They can\u2019t give it up.\u201d She understands this: \u201cEven now, I still love to go on to the AIS system [the automatic identification system that tracks the movements of boats out at sea] on my laptop.\u201d Do the men want their children to follow them into fishing? \u201cIt\u2019s a mixture. A lot don\u2019t. There is a sense of it being a hard life, but there\u2019s also sadness when a boat that has been in a family for generations suddenly isn\u2019t any more. It can be heart-wrenching [for a young person] to say: I can\u2019t live here, I can\u2019t do what my dad did, my education will take me elsewhere. \u201cI met a guy who, when he was 12, used to run off on a boat. \u2018See you in a week, Mum,\u2019 he would say, once it was too late for her to do anything about it. It was a brilliant escape, a rite of passage. The older men were heroes for him, and he wanted to be like them. Fishing comes with many frustrations. The men hate throwing fish off the boat [to stay within EU quotas], and there have been low points when there was very little money in it. It\u2019s very precarious. What if you can\u2019t go out? You\u2019re dependent on the weather, especially if you\u2019re a small boat: a crabber, say. But on the other hand, there are not many industries where you can rise up so high.\u201d Is being a skipper a bit like being a king? Or a God? She laughs. \u201cYes, maybe it is.\u201d Brexit is mentioned only rarely in her book; its politics are deliberately oblique. But the subject came up a lot while she was in Newlyn. The first trawler she went on, the Crystal Sea, was part of the Brexit flotilla that sailed into London in 2016 (organised by Fishing for Leave, it sailed from Ramsgate to Westminster, demanding that Britain take back control of its waters; under the common fisheries policy, European fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds up to 12 nautical miles from the coasts of member states). \u201cIts crew spoke about \u2018our seas\u2019, which always felt bonkers to me. Fish migrate, and when you\u2019re out there\u2026 the sea is vast. It feels as though it belongs to everyone. But we had good debates. They were kind of vital for me. They made me see that arguments about waters are very complicated; I stopped assuming that a certain point of view was right.\u201d But the fishermen aren\u2019t dumb; they\u2019re not, by her telling, particularly hopeful that Brexit, even now it is agreed, will necessarily work to their benefit. After all, the fishing industry makes up only about 0.05% of the UK\u2019s GDP, and employs fewer than 12,000 people. \u201cI think they\u2019re preparing for disappointment,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have the sense that they are always sold down the river. Politicians use them for a cause, and then they drop them. It\u2019s a long way [from London] down here, and you feel that rage a lot: their awareness that the debate is never about their place.\u201d What about the money the EU has long pumped into Cornwall? (It received some \u00a380m a year in EU funding, money that went into jobs, training and local infrastructure.) Did she ever point this out to them? \u201cYes, but they just ignore certain things. It\u2019s territorial for them.\u201d And what about her? In what ways did her experiences at sea change her? She isn\u2019t, she says, a particularly squeamish person; apart from when she was dealing with rays, a fish that seemed to be somehow more fiercely alive than the sole and the monkfish, and which could only be killed with a stab to the heart, she didn\u2019t mind the gutting and the filleting. She was learning new skills, and there was something so unexpectedly beautiful, she thinks, even about their arrabbiata-sauce coloured insides: \u201cThe brilliant thing is that every time I have fish now, I think about the supply chain. It has made me more appreciative, knowing that men are out there, risking their lives.\u201d Most people are, she thinks, very distant from their shrink-wrapped food: far too distant: \u201cI have the sense, living in London, of so rarely being involved in real things.\u201d Her time in Newlyn also taught her to think, both as a city person and one determined to be more green, in a more nuanced way about the environmental issues around fishing. \u201cPeople say we have got to get rid of the trawlers, because of the damage they do to the seabed. But I know that doing so will affect the lives of a whole community \u2013 though it\u2019s a relief when you hear about the smaller boats: there is a future that could be greener.\u201d British people need to start eating more hake, she thinks: \u201cWe catch so much of it.\u201d (The fishermen of St Ives, incidentally, refer to themselves as Hakes, while the Newlyn men, with whom they are fiercely rivalrous, like to call the north coasters the Scaly Backs.) But she does not want to romanticise. As her book makes plain, fishing takes its effects on mental health; some men come to have issues with alcohol (though it is strictly forbidden at sea), and depression is a problem, too. \u201cI hope that I show the limits of close community, as well as its benefits,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had my own problems with depression in the past, and it was good to talk to the fishermen about their mental health. I recognised the disassociation they sometimes felt \u2013 it\u2019s how they survive \u2013 and how scary it can sometimes be.\u201d A fisherman\u2019s life is one of extremes: his sense of jeopardy swiftly replaced by one of celebration when he arrives home safely and hits the pub. As one of the men, Nathan, once told her: when a fisherman is at home, he\u2019s always counting the days until he leaves; and when he\u2019s at sea, he\u2019s always counting the days until he\u2019ll be back. On her last night on the Filadelfia, Don cooked (how on earth did he do it?) one of the best meals she has ever eaten \u2013 a huge roast dinner of potatoes, mashed swede, Yorkshire puddings, cauliflower cheese, parsnips and beef \u2013 after which the crew, in spite of their bloated bellies, landed the best catch of their trip, the derricks moaning loudly as they pulled up the immense haul of prized turbot and cuttlefish (\u201clike waiting for lottery numbers to come up,\u201d Ash thought, as she waited to see what the nets had brought). But after this, the mood changed. No one slept much on that last night. Fishermen call it \u201cchannelling\u201d: when thoughts of home, and all the people in it, swim through your mind all night, waking you repeatedly. One of the men tells her that the term is drawn from the word \u201cchannel\u201d in its spiritual sense: the conveying of a spirit from another world to this one. (The link between these two worlds is the boat.) And she came to understand that it\u2019s a necessary process. The next morning, as the Filadelfia approached the harbour and a mobile phone signal was once again possible, the boat became simply another place of work rather than, as it was just moments before, the only world that mattered. And now it was the land that seemed suddenly mysterious: a single, unbroken entity she had found herself unable to imagine while she was at sea. Arrival was at once both exhilarating, and anticlimactic. Only when she came face to face with Lofty again did she realise how rancid she smelled \u2013 and how little her stench had mattered to her until that moment. Ash\u2019s book comes into the world garlanded with praise. William Dalrymple has called her a new star of nonfiction: \u201cprecise, perceptive, humane and sensitive\u201d. What will she do next? Does she have a plan? What, for her, could ever top Newlyn? \u201cI always have lots of plans,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to go to Texas for a year, and write about my family on my father\u2019s side: my grandfather was from Dallas, and after the war he set up the Marxist Leninist Society of London. For me, Cornwall is very blue, and I want to look at redness\u2026\u201d She thinks for a moment. \u201cOr perhaps I\u2019ll do a PhD about coastal communities. I need to wait for the pull.\u201d In the meantime, though, of one thing she is certain: that she must go back to using an old-fashioned \u201cbrick\u201d phone. \u201cI enjoyed listening to the men at sea. Out there, I realised how our phones are stopping us from listening, and I want to get back really to listening to people.\u201d Her eyes, which today are precisely the same colour as the English channel, meet my own, and hold them for a long minute.

      "bodyText": "Only by implementing carefully controlled programmes that use two very different Covid-19 test kits will it be possible to predict how the disease will affect the country, researchers have revealed. Scientists emphasised the need to understand, as quickly as possible, where and when new cases of infection were appearing. At the same time, it was vital to pinpoint individuals who had already been infected, possibly without realising it, so that scientists could understand the disease\u2019s behaviour over the coming months. Two different tests would be able to achieve these separate goals. To locate those in the first category \u2013 the newly infected \u2013 medical staff need to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which can find viral particles on a person. The test locates a particular coronavirus gene sequence and creates multiple copies that can then be easily detected. To identify those who have already been infected and who should now be immune from reinfection, doctors need to use a test that shows antibodies generated in response to a past infection of Covid-19 . Andrew Preston, of Bath University, said that the PCR test was in itself very effective for detecting the virus but that that efficacy was dependent on how well healthcare workers took samples from patients, from the nose and the back of the throat. \u201cIf a virus is not picked up on the swab, the result will be negative. Thus, how effectively the swab is taken, and the amount of virus present at the sampling sites, will determine whether the virus is detected from an infected person,\u201d he said. More testing is to be carried out, after Michael Gove\u2019s announcement that healthcare workers in England will be tested from this weekend, starting with critical care doctors and nurses. However, there is a shortage of PCR machines, of staff trained to use them and, most worryingly, of reagents needed to run them. That will limit the uptake of the tests. The PCR test will be used as the disease continues to spread this year, but over the next few months we will see the introduction of antibody tests. The government has announced that it is buying 3.5m of these tests, which are now being evaluated at Oxford University. \u201cTesting people across the country to find if they have been infected by Covid-19 will tell us precisely how the disease is behaving,\u201d said Professor Adam Finn, of Bristol University. \u201cThis will create certainty about where we stand and about the measures we need to take to limit the spread of the virus. At present we are in the dark. That should stop once we get the antibody test up and running.\u201d",

He says: \u201cIt was four years\u2019 work, I wanted to make a museum-sized statement and, ironically, the gallery delayed it a few months so it would get a longer slot. I\u2019m gutted it closed, but I spoke to my neighbour who is a postman, and his situation is infinitely worse.

Hans Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery, believes galleries must take the lead. He says: \u201cIt will be our collective role to support artists at this time.

The museum is as silent as the isolation in which the artist tries to work, uncertain of any future as the virus rages without vaccine. Art now waits upon science. The four Tates closed first. \u201cIt is strange and sad to think of them occupied by art, but empty of the audiences they serve,\u201d reflects Frances Morris, the director of Tate Modern. \u201cTo shut such recently opened shows as Warhol and McQueen is distressing; so much work had gone into Tate Modern\u2019s 20th anniversary.\u201d The National Gallery\u2019s Titian, years in the planning, closed after just a few days. The exhibition reunited what director Gabriele Finaldi calls \u201cpossibly the most important cycle of pictures ever painted\u201d, adding: \u201cBut how can we think of that, before humanity?\u201d Art\u2019s cyclical certainties are over too. Next year\u2019s Venice Biennale hangs in the balance. Its lively homespun equivalent in Glasgow, just about to open, is now delayed for a year. At least the artists\u2019 contracts are being honoured, as they are in our public galleries. In New York, some staff at the Guggenheim have expressed fears they will not be paid and the Metropolitan Museum has told staff it can only guarantee pay until April. The earliest effects of Covid-19 predictably centred on money, not art. The great selling shop of Art Basel Hong Kong was instantly cancelled, and replaced with online viewing rooms.

      "bodyText": "Fears that many of Britain\u2019s high street shops will be forced to close down permanently despite the government\u2019s emergency support were fuelled yesterday after a string of retailers said the coronavirus outbreak could make their businesses unviable. As the Restaurant Group said it would shut the majority of its Tex-Mex Chiquito restaurants for good, Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M threatened landlords that it would walk away from its 300-plus store leases if sales fail to match pre-coronavirus levels once the pandemic passes. Analysts said the likelihood that ministers would need to extend shop closures through the vital Easter trading period would push more retailers into handing back the keys to their shops. Business groups warned that without extra government support, including an extension of the business rates holiday to the end of the year, financial pressures were growing on town and city centre shop owners. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said he was worried that town high streets were especially vulnerable to an extended shutdown. \u201cMy biggest concern is about secondary high streets [smaller retail areas] and those in towns that were already facing huge difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is going to need to act quickly to extend the business rates holiday to save retailers from going under, and many other service business threatened by the current shutdown.\u201d A survey by analyst Retail Economicsof 2,000 consumers, due to be published next week, found that two-thirds of shoppers said they had switched to purchasing products online that they have always previously purchased in-store. Britain\u2019s high streets have become blighted by shop closures over the last three years in response to rising costs and the increasing volume of sales over the internet. A total of 143,100 jobs were lost in 2019, up by more than a fifth on 2018\u2019s 117,400 job losses, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR). Retail casualties include Mothercare and Bonmarch\u00e9, which filed for administration, while Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group and Debenhams were among the firms to shed loss-making stores following deals with creditors. Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard Research, said: \u201cI fear for the independent sector, which is dominated by family-run businesses that are often subsistence operations. \u201cTheir ability to survive with no income is going to be challenging when they have little working capital reserves and are based in small towns.\u201d Springboard\u2019s latest retail monitor found that footfall across all destinations dropped by 70.1% last week on the same week last year. The drop in footfall on the previous week was 60%. H&amp;M, which has expanded rapidly in recent years and ranks as an anchor on many high streets, wrote to landlords last week asking them to agree to terms that could see the retailer break a store lease with one month\u2019s notice if trading conditions did not return to pre-outbreak levels. In a separate letter, seen by industry magazine Retail Week, the fashion retailer also pushed landlords to agree to a variety of rent-free periods , a reduction in service charges to reflect drops in footfall and a change to paying rents monthly in arrears. The letter said: \u201cIn all of the above scenarios, H&amp;M is to have the right to close stores immediately without being in breach of the keep open clause\u201d and \u201cpersonal concessions are to remain and fixed rents will not be payable\u201d. A spokesman for Usdaw, the shopworkers\u2019 union, said a shift to online shopping, which was likely to be accelerated by the Covid-19 outbreak, meant the government needed to go further than a business rates holiday and bring forward reforms that shifted the tax burden to online operators. \u201cThere needs to be a rebalancing between bricks and mortar shops and online operations, or we will see fewer shops opening up again after the lockdown has eased,\u201d he said. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said rent demands by landlords could leave childcare provision \u201cin tatters\u201d. Access to childcare will be crucial to allowing other workers to return to employment, but Leitch warned the pandemic risks causing permanent damage to an industry that was already struggling to meet costs. While help is available to them through business rate holidays and government scheme to pay the wages of staff, many have reported that they still face demands for rent. Meanwhile, largely self-employed childminders face waiting until June for financial help. Childcare places had already been declining. More than 500 nurseries, pre-schools and childminders closed every month on average between April 2018 and March 2019, according to Ofsted figures. The government is honouring funding for free childcare places. However, childcare providers have long relied on private feepayers to make the sums add up.",

The vast majority (78%) of midwifery leaders who responded to the survey said routine face-to-face antenatal and postnatal visits had ended, with a further 9% restricting face-to-face postnatal visits. A number of NHS trusts have suspended home births as the crisis has escalated, amid reports that a growing number of pregnant women are seeking to avoid giving birth in hospital due to pressures on the health service and the perceived risks of exposure to Covid-19. Private Midwives, a UK-based nationwide private midwifery service, said the number of inquiries it has received about home births has doubled in the past few weeks. The Homerton hospital in Hackney, east London, said last week it could no longer offer home births because it could not rely on the London Ambulance Service to provide backup.

      "body": "<p>Detailed insight into the profile and outcome for patients placed in intensive care after being infected with Covid-19 has been revealed in a new report.</p> \n<p>Data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) showed that of 165 patients treated in critical care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since the end of February, 79 died, while 86 survived and were discharged. The figures were taken from an audit of 775 people who have been or are in critical care with the disease, across 285 intensive care units. The remaining 610 patients continue to receive intensive care. </p> \n<p>While early data may not be indicative of the outcome for all patients, the potentially high death rate raises questions about how effective critical care will be in saving the lives of people struck down by the disease. As a top priority, the NHS is opening field hospitals in London, Birmingham and Manchester, which will incorporate some of the biggest critical care units ever seen in Britain.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe truth is that quite a lot of these individuals [in critical care] are going to die anyway and there is a fear that we are just ventilating them for the sake of it, for the sake of doing something for them, even though it won\u2019t be effective. That\u2019s a worry,\u201d one doctor said.</p> \n<p>The report also found that though the majority of those who have died from coronavirus across the UK were over 70, nine of the 79 who died in intensive care were aged between 16 and 49, as were 28 of the 86 who survived.</p> \n<p>The audit suggested that men are at much higher risk from the virus \u2013 seven in ten of all ICU patients were male, while 30% of men in critical care were under 60, compared to just 15% of women.

      "bodyText": "Detailed insight into the profile and outcome for patients placed in intensive care after being infected with Covid-19 has been revealed in a new report. Data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) showed that of 165 patients treated in critical care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since the end of February, 79 died, while 86 survived and were discharged. The figures were taken from an audit of 775 people who have been or are in critical care with the disease, across 285 intensive care units. The remaining 610 patients continue to receive intensive care. While early data may not be indicative of the outcome for all patients, the potentially high death rate raises questions about how effective critical care will be in saving the lives of people struck down by the disease. As a top priority, the NHS is opening field hospitals in London, Birmingham and Manchester, which will incorporate some of the biggest critical care units ever seen in Britain. \u201cThe truth is that quite a lot of these individuals [in critical care] are going to die anyway and there is a fear that we are just ventilating them for the sake of it, for the sake of doing something for them, even though it won\u2019t be effective. That\u2019s a worry,\u201d one doctor said. The report also found that though the majority of those who have died from coronavirus across the UK were over 70, nine of the 79 who died in intensive care were aged between 16 and 49, as were 28 of the 86 who survived. The audit suggested that men are at much higher risk from the virus \u2013 seven in ten of all ICU patients were male, while 30% of men in critical care were under 60, compared to just 15% of women. Excess weight also appears to be a significant risk factor; over 70% of patients were overweight, obese or clinically obese on the body mass index scale. The grim statistics were made public as a Tory MP who works in the NHS said that frontline health service staff who had no symptoms of Covid-19 but who might still be infected should be included among those to be tested to prevent the crisis getting worse. The former health minister Dan Poulter, who works as a psychiatrist in wards with many cases of the virus, says widespread testing could be a \u201cgame-changer\u201d that would prevent staff who are asymptomatic carriers of the virus from passing it on to patients in hospital for other reasons. Widespread testing of those who are self-isolating with mild symptoms would also allow them to get back to work if they tested negative. Writing in the Observer, Poulter says: \u201cNHS staff sickness levels are already high, and they are only going to increase as the Covid-19 outbreak intensifies. \u201cMany of us are also worried that we may be infected, yet asymptomatic (showing no symptoms) and therefore could be a potential risk to our patients, colleagues and families. That is the last thing that we would want, but we simply do not know. \u201cWidespread NHS staff testing would be a game-changer and would help NHS clinicians to both protect our patients and return to the front line faster.\u201d He says a lack of testing so far is causing medical staff to stay away from work with relatively minor symptoms which are probably not Covid-19 related, such as a sore throat, for fear they may have the virus. If they were to test negative they could return to work. Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, said on Friday that extra testing would be carried out on NHS staff from this weekend. But he made it clear that this would initially be directed only at key NHS staff and care workers who were self-isolating. Many doctors, nurses and other staff want it extended to all frontline staff. Poulter suggests also that the government should be asking senior doctors for advice on how the pandemic will play out in hospitals, rather than relying only on experts who work away from the frontline. \u201cWe have many such clinicians already in senior leadership roles in hospitals throughout the country,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s time to better utilise their knowledge and experience.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 March 2020.

There couldn\u2019t be a more vivid illustration that this is an equal-opportunity virus that couldn\u2019t care less about your status.

The prime minister himself has been particularly wanting in this respect. He urged people to stay away from at-risk relatives only then to tell reporters that he would be going to see his mother on Mother\u2019s Day. Only on Monday did government messaging start to achieve the necessary clarity when Mr Johnson gave his television address, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/24/boris-johnsons-covid-19-address-is-one-of-most-watched-tv-programmes-ever\">one watched live</a> by 27 million people, ordering the national lockdown.

More significantly, there has been serious criticism of the government\u2019s shifts in approach, and some fierce complaint from doctors and nurses about shortages of vital resources, especially protective equipment for health workers dealing with the infected and testing kits for frontline staff.

This is accompanied by a desire for national solidarity, that yearning made manifest on Thursday night when so many people stood at their doors and windows to clap their salutations and thanks to NHS workers. The urge to pull together has also been demonstrated by the 700,000 applications to join the new NHS volunteers organisation.</p> <p>Shrewd opposition politicians understand this mood and grasp that the public are likely to react badly to anything that smells of petty point-scoring. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, had every right to articulate legitimate anxieties about allowing construction projects to continue in the capital, but he was careful to use his voice in a tempered way.

The surge in approval enjoyed by Gordon Brown during the initial phases of the financial crisis faded away as national debate turned to issues about his stewardship of the financial system over the previous decade. There will one day be a great reckoning about the coronavirus, its origins, its spread and how it was tackled. Why wasn\u2019t Britain better prepared for a pandemic? Was the health service inadequately staffed and equipped? Did the government initially underestimate the virulence of the disease and what that meant for the NHS? Was the prime minister too slow to order the lockdown and other critical steps? These are some of the questions that will preoccupy the inevitable inquiry the other side of this crisis.

There has been widespread outrage over the spycam epidemic. In 2018, almost 6,800 cases of hidden camera crimes were reported to the supreme prosecutors\u2019 office.

All their lives, Koreans are exposed to competition \u2013 constantly being tested, evaluated and scored over their actions and academic achievements. It\u2019s super-competitive.\u201d</p> <p>For most South Koreans, success means having the right \u201cspecs\u201d or specifications: everyone is judged in terms of their family background, level of education, job title, wealth and appearance. \u201cIf you went to a great school, or you have a nice body that you worked hard to cultivate, or if you have an expensive foreign car \u2013 these are all different forms of specs,\u201d says Michael Hurt, a sociologist at the University of Seoul.</p> <p>For women in particular, having the right specs means being attractive and excelling at homemaking. But, says Shin Gi-wook, professor of sociology at Stanford University, the natural consequences of such a highly competitive society are jealousy and bullying: \u201cThose who are more successful than others easily become the centre of gossip and rumours,\u201d he says. In Sulli and Goo\u2019s cases, the public shaming they experienced can be seen as a more extreme example of the scrutiny and criticism all Korean women are subjected to.</p> <p>Sulli, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was among the few K-pop stars who supported the nation\u2019s feminist \u201cno bra\u201d movement, daring to challenge Korean society\u2019s strict female dress codes. For this, as well as for her past relationship with Choiza, a fellow musician 14 years her senior, which began when she was 19, Sulli became the target of online abuse \u2013 K-pop stars are expected to stay single for years and not date during their teens.</p> <p>Sulli tried to address her detractors by appearing on a TV talk show about the cyber-bullying that celebrities face, telling viewers, \u201cMy life is actually empty. I feel like I\u2019m lying to everyone by pretending to be happy on the outside.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ce0a8f6cf034612cd1e087b497f6d5a05a1efe7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ce0a8f6cf034612cd1e087b497f6d5a05a1efe7/0_297_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fallen idol: Jung Joon-young arrives in court in central Seoul in March 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fallen idol: Jung Joon-young arrives in court in central Seoul in March 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo many celebrities have taken their lives because of this kind of criticism,\u201d says one Korean jewellery designer who asked not to be named, and who says he knew Sulli for many years. He explains that another K-pop star he works with once received a bloody dagger in the mail \u201cwith real blood\u201d and that receiving angry threats and letters was normal for many K-pop idols.</p> <p>Like Sulli, Goo had been the target of severe online bullying since late 2018, when she entered a court battle against Choi Jong-bum, an ex-boyfriend who she claimed had threatened to release a sex video allegedly filmed without her consent. Choi was later acquitted and although the video was never released, Goo suffered from the events and her all-important K-pop image was badly damaged.</p> <p>\u201cKorean celebrities who take their lives tend to be women, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accident,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cI think there\u2019s a kind of precariousness that female stars have to live with that men don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly true that male K-pop stars don\u2019t have to worry about wearing the wrong suit, for instance, while, for female stars, the risks of deviating even slightly from strict expectations about appearance are dire. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman your career can always end in an instant,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cYou can be a top star but they\u2019ll come after you with pitchforks. These women are stars, yet society is stacked against them. When police are coming at you, turning a victim into victimiser, it seems like a man can attack a female idol who has top lawyers and a big entertainment company behind her and <em>still</em> he has more protection.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Back at </strong></em><em><strong>the Seoul academy,</strong></em> Kim Tae-heon, 21, waits for his audition. Kim grew up in South Gyeongsang province in the rural southern region of the country. He moved to Seoul to attend the school two years ago and spends up to nine hours every day practising his singing, dancing and acting skills at the academy.</p> <p>\u201cBesides the obvious performance skills, you need a strong, stable mind to be able to do this,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people disappear along the way \u2013 at least six out of 10 will give up when they realise there are so many others who are better at this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97b7cf32e0c45eb237650e64c722226da47dfeb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97b7cf32e0c45eb237650e64c722226da47dfeb4/0_235_6983_4190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dirty pictures: women protest against \u2018spy-cam porn\u2019 in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dirty pictures: women protest against \u2018spy-cam porn\u2019 in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Jones/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Kim, despite the intense competition, there is nothing else he could see himself doing. \u201cSince I was young, I\u2019ve always enjoyed being onstage. At school I would volunteer to sing or dance in front of others. It\u2019s my joy in life.\u201d</p> <p>According to the academy\u2019s founder, 386 former students \u2013 including Hye Bin from Momoland and Song Min-ho from Winner \u2013 have been recruited by major K-pop firms over the past five years. However, he admits the success rate is still very low. \u201cOnly 5-10% of our students make it past auditions . . .I find the ones who are successful are the ones who practise all day. I see them at the academy all the time.\u201d</p> <p>He says that around 40% of current students live outside Seoul. Many travel for hours every week by train or bus to get to and from the school, where they pay up to KRW600,000 (\u00a3400) a month for the opportunity to become an idol. According to him, this work ethic is the backbone of K-pop \u201cThe reason K-pop became so successful was because of its intense training system\u2026 And if these companies want to continue innovating the industry, they need to upgrade the training system,\u201d he says. \u201cThese days, training is even longer and harder. But most of the better entertainment companies try to make this process as enjoyable as they can for trainees.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a35088c292b35324b739cbeef9fb717161b2eed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a35088c292b35324b739cbeef9fb717161b2eed8/0_0_4816_2891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feeling the pressure: a shrine to Kim Jong-hyun, 27, a member of SHINee, who took his own life in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feeling the pressure: a shrine to Kim Jong-hyun, 27, a member of SHINee, who took his own life in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Choi Hyuk/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even for those who graduate to stardom, the hard work doesn\u2019t end. Kevin Lee realised this while working behind the scenes with BTS. \u201cWhen we went to dance practice for their shows, they\u2019d always be arriving straight from their tours in other countries,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as they get back they would go to practise for seven hours a day. They don\u2019t rest, they work hard and that\u2019s why they are able to achieve this level of success.\u201d</p> <p>While some criticism regarding K-pop\u2019s gruelling training process is valid, the founder of the academy says South Koreans study just as much to pass <em>suneung</em>, the country\u2019s national university entrance exam, and work as hard at entering other careers, such as the civil service and legal professions.</p> <p>\u201cK-pop is portrayed as this factory-like industry, but I question this view, because everyone in Korea is forced to study for years. If anything, people who are training to become idols are training for something they actually want to become,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are living every day with a purpose and with a dream. And there\u2019s freedom in that.\u201d</p> <p>Many, however, see things differently. The demanding nature of the industry can mean signing contracts that can leave stars feeling trapped. According to K-pop star Prince Mak, contracts can lock you in for up to 15 years, and the term doesn\u2019t begin to count down until you are deemed a success, which can lock you in for years beyond the top line, while you are trained.</p> <p>The financial rewards are also limited. Prince Mak told SBS PopAsia radio that K-pop stars don\u2019t earn very much. The most common profit ratios are either 80% to the company and 20% to the artist, or 90% to the company and 10% to the artist. If you are in a group, the figures are worse still because the money is split between band members.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can be a top star, but they\u2019ll come after you with pitchforks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most stars are obliged to repay the cost of their training to their record companies. So, while to their fans, it looks as if many K-pop stars are wealthy and independent, many are contractually bound employees with little personal freedom. Add to that the pressures of maintaining impossibly high standards of appearance and behaviour, and the tragedies of Sulli and Goo begin to seem less like a surprise.</p> <p>In the wake of their deaths, the South Korean government discussed passing a new bill that would introduce cyber-bullying education at schools and workplaces. However, many believe policy alone is no solution, and the cause goes straight to the heart of societal expectations.</p> <p>\u201cK-pop has gone international and it brings pride to the country, but there\u2019s this cultural programme of gender and social norms that\u2019s impossible to win,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cYou\u2019d have to really thread a needle in a particular and perfect way, and I think that\u2019s the thing about these K-pop stars going out into the spotlight\u2026 They can\u2019t really win.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by David Lee</em></p>",

It\u2019s an industry worth $5bn; BTS alone sold more albums than Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande last year. But something is very wrong inside K-pop, and it points to a deeper malaise throughout South Korea. There has been a spate of suicides and high-profile sex scandals involving K-pop stars in recent times. At the height of their fame, these men and women seem to have buckled under the strain, unable to live up to the demands placed on them to be polished, picture-perfect ambassadors of this effervescent pop music. Kim Jong-hyun, 27, a member of SHINee, took his own life in 2017 after speaking about the intense pressures brought on by success. In March 2019, several male K-pop stars, including Seungri, a member of boyband Big Bang, Choi Jong-hoon, a former member of FT Island, and singer-songwriter Jung Joon-young were implicated in a spycam sexual abuse scandal, after Jung shared videos of women in a group chat. The case resulted in five- and six-year prison sentences for them respectively for their roles in gang raping drunk, unconscious women. Allegations also arose over Seungri\u2019s ties to Burning Sun, a nightclub he founded where date-rape and sexual assault allegedly took place.

For this, as well as for her past relationship with Choiza, a fellow musician 14 years her senior, which began when she was 19, Sulli became the target of online abuse \u2013 K-pop stars are expected to stay single for years and not date during their teens. Sulli tried to address her detractors by appearing on a TV talk show about the cyber-bullying that celebrities face, telling viewers, \u201cMy life is actually empty. I feel like I\u2019m lying to everyone by pretending to be happy on the outside.\u201d \u201cSo many celebrities have taken their lives because of this kind of criticism,\u201d says one Korean jewellery designer who asked not to be named, and who says he knew Sulli for many years. He explains that another K-pop star he works with once received a bloody dagger in the mail \u201cwith real blood\u201d and that receiving angry threats and letters was normal for many K-pop idols. Like Sulli, Goo had been the target of severe online bullying since late 2018, when she entered a court battle against Choi Jong-bum, an ex-boyfriend who she claimed had threatened to release a sex video allegedly filmed without her consent. Choi was later acquitted and although the video was never released, Goo suffered from the events and her all-important K-pop image was badly damaged. \u201cKorean celebrities who take their lives tend to be women, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accident,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cI think there\u2019s a kind of precariousness that female stars have to live with that men don\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s certainly true that male K-pop stars don\u2019t have to worry about wearing the wrong suit, for instance, while, for female stars, the risks of deviating even slightly from strict expectations about appearance are dire. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman your career can always end in an instant,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cYou can be a top star but they\u2019ll come after you with pitchforks. These women are stars, yet society is stacked against them. When police are coming at you, turning a victim into victimiser, it seems like a man can attack a female idol who has top lawyers and a big entertainment company behind her and still he has more protection.\u201d Back at the Seoul academy, Kim Tae-heon, 21, waits for his audition. Kim grew up in South Gyeongsang province in the rural southern region of the country. He moved to Seoul to attend the school two years ago and spends up to nine hours every day practising his singing, dancing and acting skills at the academy. \u201cBesides the obvious performance skills, you need a strong, stable mind to be able to do this,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people disappear along the way \u2013 at least six out of 10 will give up when they realise there are so many others who are better at this.\u201d For Kim, despite the intense competition, there is nothing else he could see himself doing. \u201cSince I was young, I\u2019ve always enjoyed being onstage. At school I would volunteer to sing or dance in front of others. It\u2019s my joy in life.\u201d According to the academy\u2019s founder, 386 former students \u2013 including Hye Bin from Momoland and Song Min-ho from Winner \u2013 have been recruited by major K-pop firms over the past five years. However, he admits the success rate is still very low. \u201cOnly 5-10% of our students make it past auditions . . .I find the ones who are successful are the ones who practise all day. I see them at the academy all the time.\u201d He says that around 40% of current students live outside Seoul. Many travel for hours every week by train or bus to get to and from the school, where they pay up to KRW600,000 (\u00a3400) a month for the opportunity to become an idol. According to him, this work ethic is the backbone of K-pop \u201cThe reason K-pop became so successful was because of its intense training system\u2026 And if these companies want to continue innovating the industry, they need to upgrade the training system,\u201d he says. \u201cThese days, training is even longer and harder. But most of the better entertainment companies try to make this process as enjoyable as they can for trainees.\u201d Even for those who graduate to stardom, the hard work doesn\u2019t end. Kevin Lee realised this while working behind the scenes with BTS. \u201cWhen we went to dance practice for their shows, they\u2019d always be arriving straight from their tours in other countries,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as they get back they would go to practise for seven hours a day. They don\u2019t rest, they work hard and that\u2019s why they are able to achieve this level of success.\u201d While some criticism regarding K-pop\u2019s gruelling training process is valid, the founder of the academy says South Koreans study just as much to pass suneung, the country\u2019s national university entrance exam, and work as hard at entering other careers, such as the civil service and legal professions. \u201cK-pop is portrayed as this factory-like industry, but I question this view, because everyone in Korea is forced to study for years. If anything, people who are training to become idols are training for something they actually want to become,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are living every day with a purpose and with a dream. And there\u2019s freedom in that.\u201d Many, however, see things differently. The demanding nature of the industry can mean signing contracts that can leave stars feeling trapped. According to K-pop star Prince Mak, contracts can lock you in for up to 15 years, and the term doesn\u2019t begin to count down until you are deemed a success, which can lock you in for years beyond the top line, while you are trained. The financial rewards are also limited. Prince Mak told SBS PopAsia radio that K-pop stars don\u2019t earn very much. The most common profit ratios are either 80% to the company and 20% to the artist, or 90% to the company and 10% to the artist. If you are in a group, the figures are worse still because the money is split between band members. Most stars are obliged to repay the cost of their training to their record companies. So, while to their fans, it looks as if many K-pop stars are wealthy and independent, many are contractually bound employees with little personal freedom. Add to that the pressures of maintaining impossibly high standards of appearance and behaviour, and the tragedies of Sulli and Goo begin to seem less like a surprise. In the wake of their deaths, the South Korean government discussed passing a new bill that would introduce cyber-bullying education at schools and workplaces. However, many believe policy alone is no solution, and the cause goes straight to the heart of societal expectations. \u201cK-pop has gone international and it brings pride to the country, but there\u2019s this cultural programme of gender and social norms that\u2019s impossible to win,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cYou\u2019d have to really thread a needle in a particular and perfect way, and I think that\u2019s the thing about these K-pop stars going out into the spotlight\u2026 They can\u2019t really win.\u201d Additional reporting by David Lee",

      "body": "<p>Barely three weeks since Hachette <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/06/woody-allen-memoir-hachette-books\">cancelled Woody Allen\u2019s memoir</a>, the book has been published elsewhere, and confirms that Stephen King, among many others, was right to worry about its suppression. The only person who stood to benefit from the silencing of Woody Allen was Woody Allen.</p> <p>How, without this protracted attempt at self-exculpation, could it have been so clearly established that Allen is, as previously alleged, a man from whom girls and women would be well advised \u2013 unless they actually enjoy being objectified \u2013 to recoil? If we will never know exactly what happened between Allen and his daughter Dylan, whose <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/18/entertainment/dylan-farrow-woody-allen-interview/index.html\">accusations </a>of abuse he has consistently denied, we can readily convict him, courtesy of this homemade indictment, of learning as little as Donald Trump from campaigners he calls \u201c#MeToo zealots\u201d.</p> <p>And maybe, without his filming memories, some actresses might only have suspected that Allen was not merely directing them but perving as he went along. Christina Ricci? \u201cPlenty desirable.\u201d Scarlett Johansson: \u201cSexually radioactive.\u201d As for L\u00e9a Seydoux, \u201cmaybe she could play a love-starved lonely housewife and I could play her personal trainer\u201d. Only joking? After he, aged 42, cast 17-year-old Stacey Nelkin in <em>Annie Hall</em>, and \u201cI marvelled as usual at her contours\u201d, the two had a relationship (\u201cjumped into the percales\u201d).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Without his memoirs some actresses might only have suspected Allen was not only directing but perving as he went along</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As much as one sympathises with Ronan Farrow, the unmasker of Harvey Weinstein and estranged son of Allen, when he discovered that his own publisher had quietly acquired the Allen autobiography, the new book surely complements, with its queasy deficiencies, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/20/catch-and-kill-ronan-farrow-review\">Catch and Kill</a>, </em>Farrow\u2019s exposure of gendered predation in the film industry. As for Allen\u2019s reputation, the film-maker seems likely to prove more effective than any reporter to date, in showing himself not just to be a sexist adventurer but weirdly proud of it.</p> <p>Hachette\u2019s staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/05/hachette-woody-allen-memoir-protest-ronan-farrow\">protested</a>, in sympathy with Dylan Farrow, against publishing Allen\u2019s book. They could not have anticipated its potential to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/if-youve-run-out-of-toilet-paper-woody-allens-memoir-is-also-made-of-paper/2020/03/27/7ab70f18-6d66-11ea-a3ec-70d7479d83f0_story.html\">alienate</a>. If the book\u2019s main purpose is to depict him as a blameless creative and doting father, wronged by a scheming ex-partner, he seems only marginally less determined that readers marvel that he enjoyed what he describes as \u201cromantic adventures\u201d with countless lovely, often strikingly younger women. Some are lucky enough to be distinguished by name \u2013 Mariel Hemingway, Farrow, \u201cthe three Keaton sisters\u201d. Others can be generically dealt with: \u201cI have had brief dalliances with centrefolds.\u201d</p> <p>For Allen, you gather, sexual mores have yet to progress beyond the 60s offer of free love and undiluted patriarchy, when men like him \u201ccould stroll on the Kings Road and pick up the most adorable birds in their miniskirts\u201d. Other instructive synonyms for women include: \u201cdelectable bohemian little kumquats\u201d; \u201clittle amuse-bouche\u201d; \u201cwillowy lingerie models\u201d; \u201ccute little bluestockings\u201d; \u201cstacked miracles\u201d; \u201cdynamite blondes\u201d. Older women, or ones he dislikes, are, it follows, frigid, mad, ugly, or \u2013 ugh \u2013 too keen on sex. One ex-wife, writes this unlikely moralist, \u201cnever met a mattress she didn\u2019t like and had a cottontail\u2019s libido\u201d.</p> <p>Whoever was kind enough to leave intact these reminders to follow Allen\u2019s example and never watch another of his films has surely performed a more valuable service, at least for his despised #MeToo zealots, than his non-publication. Unmemoired, Allen might yet have been considered capable of distinguishing female characters, in his better work, from their all-important rating on the Allen fuckability scale.</p> <p>One excuse for bringing sex into ostensibly improving outings with his partner\u2019s daughter, Soon-Yi, with the pornographic evidence left where her family \u2013 and his cleaner \u2013 might find it, is that he and Farrow weren\u2019t having sex. \u201cI was very ripe for the plucking.\u201d He and young Soon-Yi, he boasts, lest her estranged family struggle to visualise communion between a 55-year-old and a 21-year-old, \u201ccouldn\u2019t keep our hands off each other\u201d.</p> <p>Now they have, he says, a perfect marriage. One of those dreamy May-Methuselah partnerships where she takes care of the domestic stuff, while senior fantasises about stars he\u2019d like to shag, though not without \u2019er indoors-style tributes to Mrs Allen. \u201cIn a concentration camp,\u201d he jests, Soon-Yi \u201cafter two days would have the Gestapo bringing her breakfast in bed\u201d.</p> <p>If, for years, Allen\u2019s creepiness was in plain sight, what with Soon-Yi, the recollections of Mariel Hemingway, and his weakness for <a href=\"https://www.mic.com/articles/185578/heres-a-chart-showing-the-age-gaps-between-romantic-partners-in-woody-allens-movies\">father-daughter age </a>romances, on and off screen, it is still startling to discover no sign of awareness, after his lifetime\u2019s therapy, of anything transgressive. On the contrary, reviewing his relationships, Allen regrets only not responding earlier to \u201cred flags\u201d, warning of troublesome women ahead.</p> <p>With one wife, it was her messy bedroom. With Farrow, subjected here to extensive character assassination, he tries to convince us that she, from a troubled \u2013 red flag! \u2013 family, is therefore dodgier than he, with his purloined daughter, enthusiasm for teens, and now, just sayin\u2019 line in slurs. Was there ever any \u201ccanoodling\u201d, he faux-artlessly asks, between Mia Farrow and the judge (helpfully deceased) who stopped his visitation rights? Meaning, I think, did she barter sex for an advantageous child protection verdict? \u201cI tend to be naive in such matters.\u201d Since he never witnessed violence, Allen makes do with secondhand allegations, such as a scene when Mia threw a phone (in an earlier account, a chair) at Soon-Yi.</p> <p>You can see why Ronan Farrow, before Hachette cancelled, asked that Allen\u2019s book be factchecked, as his own book had been. But again, uncorroborated malice can erase trust as a more legalistic approach might not. Allen\u2019s reputation outlived, just about, the hostilities with Mia, Ronan and Dylan Farrow. It may not survive his own book.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Barely three weeks since Hachette cancelled Woody Allen\u2019s memoir, the book has been published elsewhere, and confirms that Stephen King, among many others, was right to worry about its suppression. The only person who stood to benefit from the silencing of Woody Allen was Woody Allen. How, without this protracted attempt at self-exculpation, could it have been so clearly established that Allen is, as previously alleged, a man from whom girls and women would be well advised \u2013 unless they actually enjoy being objectified \u2013 to recoil? If we will never know exactly what happened between Allen and his daughter Dylan, whose accusations of abuse he has consistently denied, we can readily convict him, courtesy of this homemade indictment, of learning as little as Donald Trump from campaigners he calls \u201c#MeToo zealots\u201d. And maybe, without his filming memories, some actresses might only have suspected that Allen was not merely directing them but perving as he went along. Christina Ricci? \u201cPlenty desirable.\u201d Scarlett Johansson: \u201cSexually radioactive.\u201d As for L\u00e9a Seydoux, \u201cmaybe she could play a love-starved lonely housewife and I could play her personal trainer\u201d. Only joking? After he, aged 42, cast 17-year-old Stacey Nelkin in Annie Hall, and \u201cI marvelled as usual at her contours\u201d, the two had a relationship (\u201cjumped into the percales\u201d). As much as one sympathises with Ronan Farrow, the unmasker of Harvey Weinstein and estranged son of Allen, when he discovered that his own publisher had quietly acquired the Allen autobiography, the new book surely complements, with its queasy deficiencies, Catch and Kill, Farrow\u2019s exposure of gendered predation in the film industry. As for Allen\u2019s reputation, the film-maker seems likely to prove more effective than any reporter to date, in showing himself not just to be a sexist adventurer but weirdly proud of it. Hachette\u2019s staff protested, in sympathy with Dylan Farrow, against publishing Allen\u2019s book. They could not have anticipated its potential to alienate. If the book\u2019s main purpose is to depict him as a blameless creative and doting father, wronged by a scheming ex-partner, he seems only marginally less determined that readers marvel that he enjoyed what he describes as \u201cromantic adventures\u201d with countless lovely, often strikingly younger women. Some are lucky enough to be distinguished by name \u2013 Mariel Hemingway, Farrow, \u201cthe three Keaton sisters\u201d. Others can be generically dealt with: \u201cI have had brief dalliances with centrefolds.\u201d For Allen, you gather, sexual mores have yet to progress beyond the 60s offer of free love and undiluted patriarchy, when men like him \u201ccould stroll on the Kings Road and pick up the most adorable birds in their miniskirts\u201d. Other instructive synonyms for women include: \u201cdelectable bohemian little kumquats\u201d; \u201clittle amuse-bouche\u201d; \u201cwillowy lingerie models\u201d; \u201ccute little bluestockings\u201d; \u201cstacked miracles\u201d; \u201cdynamite blondes\u201d. Older women, or ones he dislikes, are, it follows, frigid, mad, ugly, or \u2013 ugh \u2013 too keen on sex. One ex-wife, writes this unlikely moralist, \u201cnever met a mattress she didn\u2019t like and had a cottontail\u2019s libido\u201d. Whoever was kind enough to leave intact these reminders to follow Allen\u2019s example and never watch another of his films has surely performed a more valuable service, at least for his despised #MeToo zealots, than his non-publication. Unmemoired, Allen might yet have been considered capable of distinguishing female characters, in his better work, from their all-important rating on the Allen fuckability scale. One excuse for bringing sex into ostensibly improving outings with his partner\u2019s daughter, Soon-Yi, with the pornographic evidence left where her family \u2013 and his cleaner \u2013 might find it, is that he and Farrow weren\u2019t having sex. \u201cI was very ripe for the plucking.\u201d He and young Soon-Yi, he boasts, lest her estranged family struggle to visualise communion between a 55-year-old and a 21-year-old, \u201ccouldn\u2019t keep our hands off each other\u201d. Now they have, he says, a perfect marriage. One of those dreamy May-Methuselah partnerships where she takes care of the domestic stuff, while senior fantasises about stars he\u2019d like to shag, though not without \u2019er indoors-style tributes to Mrs Allen. \u201cIn a concentration camp,\u201d he jests, Soon-Yi \u201cafter two days would have the Gestapo bringing her breakfast in bed\u201d. If, for years, Allen\u2019s creepiness was in plain sight, what with Soon-Yi, the recollections of Mariel Hemingway, and his weakness for father-daughter age romances, on and off screen, it is still startling to discover no sign of awareness, after his lifetime\u2019s therapy, of anything transgressive. On the contrary, reviewing his relationships, Allen regrets only not responding earlier to \u201cred flags\u201d, warning of troublesome women ahead. With one wife, it was her messy bedroom. With Farrow, subjected here to extensive character assassination, he tries to convince us that she, from a troubled \u2013 red flag! \u2013 family, is therefore dodgier than he, with his purloined daughter, enthusiasm for teens, and now, just sayin\u2019 line in slurs. Was there ever any \u201ccanoodling\u201d, he faux-artlessly asks, between Mia Farrow and the judge (helpfully deceased) who stopped his visitation rights? Meaning, I think, did she barter sex for an advantageous child protection verdict? \u201cI tend to be naive in such matters.\u201d Since he never witnessed violence, Allen makes do with secondhand allegations, such as a scene when Mia threw a phone (in an earlier account, a chair) at Soon-Yi. You can see why Ronan Farrow, before Hachette cancelled, asked that Allen\u2019s book be factchecked, as his own book had been. But again, uncorroborated malice can erase trust as a more legalistic approach might not. Allen\u2019s reputation outlived, just about, the hostilities with Mia, Ronan and Dylan Farrow. It may not survive his own book. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>I met Matthew Macfadyen on one of those days in ancient history, a couple of weeks ago, when we were still not quite sure whether to make silly jokes about elbow-touching greetings, or to fear for civilisation\u2019s immediate future. In many ways, Macfadyen is the archetypal actor for this kind of moment, a master of shifting and ambiguous tone, whose frequent bursts of laughter often threaten to turn hollow. One of the many joys of his portrayal of the bullied and bullying son-in-law Tom Wambsgans in the HBO show <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/02/succession-review-brilliant-dissection-mega-rich-family-jesse-armstrong\">Succession</a></em> \u2013 arguably the defining contribution to the defining TV drama of our times \u2013 is his winning ability to switch from empathy to psychopathy in a heartbeat.</p> <p>Next month, Macfadyen will bring all of that gift for nuance to the three-part ITV drama <em>Quiz</em>, in which he plays <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ingram\">Major Charles Ingram</a>, the \u201ccoughing major\u201d who was convicted of cheating his way to the top prize on <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em> in 2001. The show, an adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/12/quiz-review-exploration-of-the-thin-line-between-courtroom-and-showbusiness\">West End play by James Graham</a>, has been directed for television by Stephen Frears. Macfadyen\u2019s major takes the hot seat across from Michael Sheen, who adds Chris Tarrant to his repertoire of uncanny impersonations.</p> <p>If I\u2019m honest I hadn\u2019t really expected to enjoy the miniseries, which I watched in preview. I felt I knew the story of the major, who was eventually convicted of the deception, along with his wife Diana and their coughing accomplice Tecwen Whittock, in a widely publicised court case, but I was wrong. Graham\u2019s script and Frears\u2019s direction \u2013 but above all Macfadyen\u2019s characterisation \u2013 brings unexpected humanity as well as fabulous observational comedy to the events. It takes you back to a curious time when the whole nation was in thrall to the quiz show \u2013 audience figures peaked at 19 million \u2013 which was the first of a string of British TV formats to be sold to the American networks. Major Ingram emerges as a fall guy to the feverish obsessions of a different era. His million-pound appearance came the day before 9/11.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHRXtJoNL28\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHRXtJoNL28?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHRXtJoNL28\">Watch a trailer for ITV miniseries Quiz</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Macfadyen was sent the script when he was filming the last episode of the second season of <em>Succession</em> onboard a superyacht off the coast of Croatia. \u201cI\u2019d known about the story,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I thought I knew more about it than I did. And I knew that Sian Clifford was playing the wife \u2013 and I was a big fan of hers from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/fleabag\">Fleabag</a></em> \u2013 and Stephen Frears, of course, and it was quite different from Tom Wambsgans so I immediately said yes.\u201d</p> <p>One of the things that makes the drama so watchable is that it maintains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami\">some reasonable doubt</a> about the scam itself right to the end.</p> <p>Even Macfadyen wasn\u2019t quite sure what to think. \u201cSian and I kept sort of grabbing each other during filming going: \u2018They did it! Guilty! Yeah.\u2019 Then, five minutes later: \u2018No, no, no, they didn\u2019t!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In some senses, I suggest, Ingram adds to Macfadyen\u2019s gift for playing that kind of contemporary everyman who finds himself suddenly in the midst of events way beyond his control.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think we all are like that, really. We are all living by the seat of our pants to greater and lesser degrees. Even majors in the British army.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a51fc429b6ab7326e993fd30921b7d1a822f2860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a51fc429b6ab7326e993fd30921b7d1a822f2860/0_126_2897_1737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Sarah Snook, Matthew Macfadyen, Hiam Abbass, Alan Ruck, and J Smith-Cameron in Succession.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Sarah Snook, Matthew Macfadyen, Hiam Abbass, Alan Ruck, and J Smith-Cameron in Succession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Kramer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I later speak to James Graham, who wrote the script, he describes his idea of it as \u201c<em>Mission Impossible</em>, but set in a village in Wiltshire\u201d; it gave him the licence to explore a curious middle-England mix of reserve and wild-eyed obsession. He and the producers and Frears knew they had to persuade Macfadyen to take the role. \u201cComing from the theatre, I\u2019d known Matthew as one of our great stage actors, but vastly underappreciated,\u201d Graham says. \u201cBut then like everyone else, seeing him appear, or emerge, in <em>Succession</em> was a revelation. That is the most extraordinary performance, both buffoonish and terrifying simultaneously.\u201d</p> <p>Macfadyen finds a way to play the major as both a quite conventional military man and a genuine enigma. \u201cThe real Ingram has been lampooned to a degree that I think is out of proportion to his alleged crime,\u201d Graham says. \u201cI think Matthew is perfect because he does have this dashing aura of a Hollywood star, but also looks and feels incredibly nice. You just like him, everyone does.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting talking with Macfadyen it is hard to disagree with that impression. Nothing he says is quite in earnest, and he has a habit of laughing at your lamest joke. You can\u2019t help thinking some of this is performance, but then feel guilty for doubting his sincerity.</p> <p>Macfadyen is married to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/feb/17/keeley-hawes-we-all-need-to-be-more-positive-thriller-suspense-traitors\">Keeley Hawes</a>, who he met when they made <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/spooks\">Spooks</a></em> together. They have two children in their teens, along with a 19-year-old son from Hawes\u2019s first marriage. The thought of actors off stage and at home, particularly when they are married to other actors, is always intriguing. Both he and Hawes can convincingly inhabit any shade of emotion. How do their arguments go?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ingram is a very particular kind of Englishman, self-effacing and traditional, a wearer of slacks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He laughs. \u201cI am really not good without a script. I\u2019m an absolutely hopeless fibber in real life. But even when I\u2019m acting I never feel I am inhabiting any emotion. You are just doing what the character does.\u201d</p> <p>He insists that he and Hawes are not competitive with each other, but both of them are in a rich run of TV success: Hawes with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/07/the-durrells-review-corfu-brits-keeley-hawes-final-series\">The Durrells</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/23/it-makes-you-go-oh-my-god-how-line-of-duty-broke-the-laws-of-police-shows\">Line of Duty</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/26/bodyguard-review-jed-mercurios-latest-thriller-is-as-dark-and-moreish-as-we-hoped\">The Bodyguard</a></em>, he with <em>Any Human Heart</em>, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/oct/14/ripper-street-a-ridiculously-underrated-victorian-thriller\">Ripper Street</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/04/howards-end-review-no-rollicking-finale-just-wit-and-humanity\">Howards End</a></em>, as well as <em>Succession</em>.</p> <p>He puts it down mostly to a determination to keep working.</p> <p>\u201cI think the trick is keep doing good work while you wait for those roles where everything comes together,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Keeley had that with <em>Line of Duty</em>. And perhaps me with <em>Succession</em>.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"495dea0734b9f98d6e23fb26fc3d5d749d90e8ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/495dea0734b9f98d6e23fb26fc3d5d749d90e8ba/0_0_5100_3400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen as Charles Ingram and Sian Clifford as his wife Diana in the ITV miniseries Quiz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen as Charles Ingram and Sian Clifford as his wife Diana in the ITV miniseries Quiz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In that philosophy, I suggest, he no doubt found a kindred spirit in Stephen Frears, who once told me he had made his remarkably varied directorial career by following the principle of simply always doing the best script that came through his letterbox.</p> <p>\u201cI think so. I mean, if you\u2019re lucky enough to get sent things and they sort of blow your hair back then, great. Quite often though my immediate thought is \u2018Well, I wouldn\u2019t cast myself as this\u2019. Or, you know, \u2018Why didn\u2019t they ask Damian Lewis?\u2019 But then there are some parts you think: \u2018Yeah I know what makes him tick.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And that was the case with Charles Ingram?</p> <p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s a very particular kind of Englishman, self-effacing and traditional, a wearer of slacks.\u201d</p> <p>And apparently fantastically corruptible?</p> <p>\u201cWell that\u2019s the thing, was he? The tabloid narrative was that Diana, his wife, was the sort of controller, the Lady Macbeth, but who knows? A posh cheat? We rush to know and we rush to condemn. But maybe we always need to look a bit harder.\u201d</p> <p>Macfadyen did not find it hard to remain agnostic. \u201cYou are just playing incremental moments, so you can\u2019t add a wash of guilt or innocence anyway. Now and again Stephen would say, \u2018Let\u2019s turn the dial a bit one way on their culpability and then not so much\u2019 \u2013 just so he had options in the cutting room.\u201d</p> <p>It is a tribute to Macfadyen\u2019s skills that he could make every gradation of those reactions believable. I asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/04/lucy-prebble-interview-litvinenko-very-expensive-poison-old-vic-enron-succession\">Lucy Prebble</a>, one of the scriptwriting team on <em>Succession</em>, what it was like to write with his character in mind. \u201cI remember once half-joking [to Matthew] on set about a particular take: \u2018Yes, but Tom would feel 7% less shame,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe next take, on the monitor, there it was, not eight, not six, but 7% less shame. And completely true. It is the most exciting thing for a writer, because it gives you a completely open field in creating. It\u2019s what they mean when they say of an actor that there\u2019s nothing they can\u2019t do. There is nothing Matthew can\u2019t do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1002979be6226f4614b3a46d1377e820ab2720f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1002979be6226f4614b3a46d1377e820ab2720f/0_0_3456_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen as Tom and Nicholas Braun as cousin Greg in Succession.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen as Tom and Nicholas Braun as cousin Greg in Succession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/Kobal/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Macfadyen discovered he might have that talent quite early. His mother trained as an actor and later taught drama. They did a bit of am-dram together, including <em>Oh! What a Lovely War</em>, and whenever there was mention of a school play, he recalls, \u201cmy heart was immediately banging away\u201d.</p> <p>His upbringing also supplied those elements of dislocation and hyper-observation that seem at the heart of his best performances. Macfadyen\u2019s father was a physicist who became an engineer in the oil industry. They lived in places as varied as Great Yarmouth, Aberdeen, London and Jakarta. \u201cThere was a lot of me standing next to a teacher announcing \u2018Say hello to Matthew, children\u2019,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He saw it as an adventure rather than any kind of trauma. \u201cMum and Dad were always excited by new places, so my brother and I were excited too,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He was something of a prodigy, accepted at Rada at 17, and then into Declan Donnellan\u2019s acclaimed Cheek By Jowl touring company at 21. He credits the latter in particular with opening his eyes to that magic potential of \u201creally standing in someone else\u2019s shoes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDeclan is a big proponent of the idea that everything that feeds you as an actor comes from outside,\u201d he says. \u201cThe audience pays not for you to feel things, but for you to see things. You are not summoning emotions, it is all out there in front of you.\u201d</p> <p>He and Donnellan have remained friends. When I speak to the director, he recalls how he had never had such a young actor in the company before; Macfadyen starred in productions of <em>The Duchess of Malfi</em> and <em>Much Ado</em> that took them all over the world together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3327be8e3c2135a3295134845a354a7c418444b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3327be8e3c2135a3295134845a354a7c418444b8/189_0_1617_1618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen as Prince Hal and Michael Gambon as Falstaff in Henry IV Parts I and II at the Olivier theatre, London, 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen as Prince Hal and Michael Gambon as Falstaff in Henry IV Parts I and II at the Olivier theatre, London, 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Norrington/NIGEL NORRINGTON</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe thing that young actors often don\u2019t realise,\u201d Donnellan says, \u201cis that if you want to get on, the first thing you need to look after is the group. Looking after me me me, on stage or off, never pays out. You have to give full attention to who you are acting with. Matthew always understood that.\u201d</p> <p>He stresses one other thing that has always struck him as unusual in his experience. \u201cMatthew always had an extraordinarily close relationship with his parents, both father and mother. They were around, somehow, when we were in Rio one time. I remember once we were rehearsing and his dad came and they sat in the cafe at the next table and I was so impressed by how easy they were with each other. I\u2019ve never forgotten that.\u201d</p> <p>Donnellan is, like everyone, addicted to <em>Succession</em>. \u201cWhat is really wonderful about the series, is how they all are about the vacuousness of all that wealth,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes you want to go down on your knees and thank God that you are not rich.\u201d</p> <p>It seems a telling coincidence that the cast of <em>Succession</em> did their first read-through of the script on the day of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. It felt something like an omen, for their tale of power and its discontents. \u201cEveryone, all the Americans, kept telling us, you know, the election will be fine, he can\u2019t win,\u201d Macfadyen recalls. \u201cThen we went to the producer Adam McKay\u2019s apartment that evening to watch the results come in. There was that truly terrible moment when it became clear what was going to happen. And everyone went a bit quiet and disappeared into their phones.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9TKHvvaMfE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l9TKHvvaMfE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9TKHvvaMfE\">Watch a trailer for the second series of Succession</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Since that night, it has often appeared that something of the barely credible character of Trump\u2019s America has been feeding directly into the two seasons of <em>Succession</em> almost by osmosis. No comic excess or private humiliation seems beyond either drama. \u201cI hope so,\u201d Macfadyen says. \u201cThere does sometimes seem some feedback. Like a horrible loop of shit, you might say.\u201d</p> <p>The Roy family in the drama seem most directly based on the Murdoch dynasty, but in the nastier moments of their familial struggles they also seem to reference Trump and his dreadful sons. It captures what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/13/successions-brian-cox-i-was-touched-up-by-princess-margaret\">Brian Cox</a>, speaking of his patriarchal role as Logan Roy, has called elsewhere, \u201cthe horrible last gasp of the alpha male in America\u201d, the extended death throes of all that concentrated wealth, which still exerts its global influence. \u201cIt is the Bible salesman arriving in a private jet,\u201d Macfadyen says, \u201cand people queuing up to say: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll buy one of those off you\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Among the divides in our world just now, it sometimes feels like the most significant is between those who think the worst can\u2019t happen and those who understand that it can. <em>Succession</em> is cast in the no man\u2019s land between those attitudes. Critics of the series suggest that it is hard to sympathise with any of the characters. The genius of it, it seems to me, is that however loathsome and cynical they are, you can still sympathise with all of them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like all of us, Tom is in a film of his own making called Tom Wambsgans, his trials and tribulations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Macfadyen says. \u201cThe Roy children are all terrified. There is an awful absence of love from the father that has taken away all of their confidence. They can never talk about their feelings, though they want to.\u201d</p> <p>On the very edge of that orbit are Tom and his sidekick, cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun), who understands even less of the vicious world in which they find themselves. The pair of them have become a kind of contemporary Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, tragically unsure of their roles, but scheming like everyone else.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, however badly they behave,\u201d Macfadyen says, \u201cthey still think they are heroic, or doing their best under very difficult circumstances. Like all of us, Tom is in a film of his own making called Tom Wambsgans, his trials and tribulations.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the collective angst comes from the way the series is filmed.</p> <p>\u201cWe shoot these great long scenes, often with three cameras. And you are never sure whether the camera is on you. It feels like a play and it is liberating because you are forced to listen all the time, like you would in real life. I think we are much more affected by other people than anything inside us. That is the great thing about playing Tom \u2013 he is a totally different person with everyone he is with.\u201d</p> <p>He never knows what to feel?</p> <p>\u201cExcept a sort of panicky ambivalence always.\u201d</p> <p>Again, that seems to capture a quite contemporary sense\u2026</p> <p>\u201cYes, I think we know life is quite scary but our vanity tells us we are in control \u2013 of our bank accounts and our careers and our relationships \u2013 until one day we are not.\u201d He pauses for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s like, you know, my father died in November, quite suddenly, and when that happens the world tilts and changes for you. Everything goes off, somehow. And it\u2019s like a lot of the world is like that now.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/13/successions-brian-cox-i-was-touched-up-by-princess-margaret\">Succession\u2019s Brian Cox: \u2018I was touched up by Princess Margaret\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When we speak Macfadyen is due to head out to begin six months\u2019 work, mostly in New York, filming series three of <em>Succession</em>, though no doubt by now some of that schedule has been changed along with everything else.

Maybe. I am in that situation that perhaps we are all in, that the more I read about almost anything the less informed I feel. So I keep reading.

It was a disciplined portrayal that gradually thawed as the episodes went by, taking Quinn from stern, focused operative to questioning outlier. The series introduced Macfadyen to his wife, Keeley Hawes: they\u2019ve been married since 2004.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvHX_jOS-6w\">In My Father\u2019s Den (Brad McGann, 2004)</a><br></strong>Not enough people saw New Zealander Brad McGann\u2019s heartfelt family tragedy, which gave Macfadyen his first big-screen lead and earned him a British independent film award nomination for best actor. It\u2019s a classic prodigal son role: a feted war photographer returning to his Kiwi homeland following his father\u2019s death, uncovering dark family secrets. The script spirals into melodrama, but Macfadyen gives it a quiet, humane and emotional core.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Afx8MGg00g\">Pride and Prejudice (Joe Wright, 2005)</a><br></strong>Many think of Colin Firth as the quintessential screen Mr Darcy, but Macfadyen was at least his equal: a more broodingly sensual take on the character, teeming with interior emotional conflict, which fits well with the unbuttoned realism of director Joe Wright\u2019s interpretation. Costumed and styled with a scruffy dishevelment that was equal parts rakish and little-boy-lost, his performance didn\u2019t please all die-hard Austenites, but younger viewers swooned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8004817a2795bfc97b5abfd4c5780f3164cb64c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8004817a2795bfc97b5abfd4c5780f3164cb64c/0_70_3072_1845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen as Oblonsky in Joe Wright\u2019s Anna Karenina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen as Oblonsky in Joe Wright\u2019s Anna Karenina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Working Title Films/Kobal/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnzblqTGNnk\">Anna Karenina (Joe Wright, 2012)</a><br></strong>Joe Wright has been good to Macfadyen. The actor may not be as prominently featured in this whirring, theatrical, hyper-stylised adaptation of the Tolstoy novel, but in a film of wildly variable performances, his feckless, faithless Oblonsky \u2013 brother rather than lover of Keira Knightley\u2019s heroine this time \u2013 is one of the very best things in it. He\u2019s a cool, dry breeze of comic relief in otherwise hot, heavy surroundings.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/succession\">Succession, HBO (2018-)</a><br></strong>Following a career heavy on polite British period pieces, the role of Tom Wambsgans in Jesse Armstrong\u2019s critically adored US television drama is a wildly against-type opportunity that the actor palpably relishes. As the ambitious, obsequious third husband to an Elisabeth Murdoch-inspired heiress, Macfadyen wittily plays him as both repulsive and queasily sympathetic: a hungry add-on to the Roy family who, as much as he plays their game, will never quite have their respect.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHRXtJoNL28\">Quiz, ITV (2020)</a><br></strong>Macfadyen returns to British TV next month as the <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em> fraudster Major Charles Ingram in Stephen Frears\u2019s miniseries. It\u2019s a morally and psychologically complex part well suited to the actor\u2019s blend of vulnerability and very English propriety: his tragicomic performance is integral to making the series more than just a snarky take on a tabloid scandal. You may wind up thinking of Ingram a bit differently. <strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "I met Matthew Macfadyen on one of those days in ancient history, a couple of weeks ago, when we were still not quite sure whether to make silly jokes about elbow-touching greetings, or to fear for civilisation\u2019s immediate future. In many ways, Macfadyen is the archetypal actor for this kind of moment, a master of shifting and ambiguous tone, whose frequent bursts of laughter often threaten to turn hollow. One of the many joys of his portrayal of the bullied and bullying son-in-law Tom Wambsgans in the HBO show Succession \u2013 arguably the defining contribution to the defining TV drama of our times \u2013 is his winning ability to switch from empathy to psychopathy in a heartbeat. Next month, Macfadyen will bring all of that gift for nuance to the three-part ITV drama Quiz, in which he plays Major Charles Ingram, the \u201ccoughing major\u201d who was convicted of cheating his way to the top prize on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? in 2001. The show, an adaptation of the West End play by James Graham, has been directed for television by Stephen Frears. Macfadyen\u2019s major takes the hot seat across from Michael Sheen, who adds Chris Tarrant to his repertoire of uncanny impersonations. If I\u2019m honest I hadn\u2019t really expected to enjoy the miniseries, which I watched in preview. I felt I knew the story of the major, who was eventually convicted of the deception, along with his wife Diana and their coughing accomplice Tecwen Whittock, in a widely publicised court case, but I was wrong. Graham\u2019s script and Frears\u2019s direction \u2013 but above all Macfadyen\u2019s characterisation \u2013 brings unexpected humanity as well as fabulous observational comedy to the events. It takes you back to a curious time when the whole nation was in thrall to the quiz show \u2013 audience figures peaked at 19 million \u2013 which was the first of a string of British TV formats to be sold to the American networks. Major Ingram emerges as a fall guy to the feverish obsessions of a different era. His million-pound appearance came the day before 9/11. Macfadyen was sent the script when he was filming the last episode of the second season of Succession onboard a superyacht off the coast of Croatia. \u201cI\u2019d known about the story,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I thought I knew more about it than I did. And I knew that Sian Clifford was playing the wife \u2013 and I was a big fan of hers from Fleabag \u2013 and Stephen Frears, of course, and it was quite different from Tom Wambsgans so I immediately said yes.\u201d One of the things that makes the drama so watchable is that it maintains some reasonable doubt about the scam itself right to the end. Even Macfadyen wasn\u2019t quite sure what to think. \u201cSian and I kept sort of grabbing each other during filming going: \u2018They did it! Guilty! Yeah.\u2019 Then, five minutes later: \u2018No, no, no, they didn\u2019t!\u2019\u201d In some senses, I suggest, Ingram adds to Macfadyen\u2019s gift for playing that kind of contemporary everyman who finds himself suddenly in the midst of events way beyond his control. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think we all are like that, really. We are all living by the seat of our pants to greater and lesser degrees. Even majors in the British army.\u201d When I later speak to James Graham, who wrote the script, he describes his idea of it as \u201cMission Impossible, but set in a village in Wiltshire\u201d; it gave him the licence to explore a curious middle-England mix of reserve and wild-eyed obsession. He and the producers and Frears knew they had to persuade Macfadyen to take the role. \u201cComing from the theatre, I\u2019d known Matthew as one of our great stage actors, but vastly underappreciated,\u201d Graham says. \u201cBut then like everyone else, seeing him appear, or emerge, in Succession was a revelation. That is the most extraordinary performance, both buffoonish and terrifying simultaneously.\u201d Macfadyen finds a way to play the major as both a quite conventional military man and a genuine enigma. \u201cThe real Ingram has been lampooned to a degree that I think is out of proportion to his alleged crime,\u201d Graham says. \u201cI think Matthew is perfect because he does have this dashing aura of a Hollywood star, but also looks and feels incredibly nice. You just like him, everyone does.\u201d Sitting talking with Macfadyen it is hard to disagree with that impression. Nothing he says is quite in earnest, and he has a habit of laughing at your lamest joke. You can\u2019t help thinking some of this is performance, but then feel guilty for doubting his sincerity. Macfadyen is married to Keeley Hawes, who he met when they made Spooks together. They have two children in their teens, along with a 19-year-old son from Hawes\u2019s first marriage. The thought of actors off stage and at home, particularly when they are married to other actors, is always intriguing. Both he and Hawes can convincingly inhabit any shade of emotion. How do their arguments go? He laughs. \u201cI am really not good without a script. I\u2019m an absolutely hopeless fibber in real life. But even when I\u2019m acting I never feel I am inhabiting any emotion. You are just doing what the character does.\u201d He insists that he and Hawes are not competitive with each other, but both of them are in a rich run of TV success: Hawes with The Durrells and Line of Duty and The Bodyguard, he with Any Human Heart, and Ripper Street and Howards End, as well as Succession. He puts it down mostly to a determination to keep working. \u201cI think the trick is keep doing good work while you wait for those roles where everything comes together,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Keeley had that with Line of Duty. And perhaps me with Succession.\u201d In that philosophy, I suggest, he no doubt found a kindred spirit in Stephen Frears, who once told me he had made his remarkably varied directorial career by following the principle of simply always doing the best script that came through his letterbox. \u201cI think so. I mean, if you\u2019re lucky enough to get sent things and they sort of blow your hair back then, great. Quite often though my immediate thought is \u2018Well, I wouldn\u2019t cast myself as this\u2019. Or, you know, \u2018Why didn\u2019t they ask Damian Lewis?\u2019 But then there are some parts you think: \u2018Yeah I know what makes him tick.\u2019\u201d And that was the case with Charles Ingram? \u201cYes. He\u2019s a very particular kind of Englishman, self-effacing and traditional, a wearer of slacks.\u201d And apparently fantastically corruptible? \u201cWell that\u2019s the thing, was he? The tabloid narrative was that Diana, his wife, was the sort of controller, the Lady Macbeth, but who knows? A posh cheat? We rush to know and we rush to condemn. But maybe we always need to look a bit harder.\u201d Macfadyen did not find it hard to remain agnostic. \u201cYou are just playing incremental moments, so you can\u2019t add a wash of guilt or innocence anyway. Now and again Stephen would say, \u2018Let\u2019s turn the dial a bit one way on their culpability and then not so much\u2019 \u2013 just so he had options in the cutting room.\u201d It is a tribute to Macfadyen\u2019s skills that he could make every gradation of those reactions believable. I asked Lucy Prebble, one of the scriptwriting team on Succession, what it was like to write with his character in mind. \u201cI remember once half-joking [to Matthew] on set about a particular take: \u2018Yes, but Tom would feel 7% less shame,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe next take, on the monitor, there it was, not eight, not six, but 7% less shame. And completely true. It is the most exciting thing for a writer, because it gives you a completely open field in creating. It\u2019s what they mean when they say of an actor that there\u2019s nothing they can\u2019t do. There is nothing Matthew can\u2019t do.\u201d Macfadyen discovered he might have that talent quite early. His mother trained as an actor and later taught drama. They did a bit of am-dram together, including Oh! What a Lovely War, and whenever there was mention of a school play, he recalls, \u201cmy heart was immediately banging away\u201d. His upbringing also supplied those elements of dislocation and hyper-observation that seem at the heart of his best performances. Macfadyen\u2019s father was a physicist who became an engineer in the oil industry. They lived in places as varied as Great Yarmouth, Aberdeen, London and Jakarta. \u201cThere was a lot of me standing next to a teacher announcing \u2018Say hello to Matthew, children\u2019,\u201d he says. He saw it as an adventure rather than any kind of trauma. \u201cMum and Dad were always excited by new places, so my brother and I were excited too,\u201d he says. He was something of a prodigy, accepted at Rada at 17, and then into Declan Donnellan\u2019s acclaimed Cheek By Jowl touring company at 21. He credits the latter in particular with opening his eyes to that magic potential of \u201creally standing in someone else\u2019s shoes\u201d. \u201cDeclan is a big proponent of the idea that everything that feeds you as an actor comes from outside,\u201d he says. \u201cThe audience pays not for you to feel things, but for you to see things. You are not summoning emotions, it is all out there in front of you.\u201d He and Donnellan have remained friends. When I speak to the director, he recalls how he had never had such a young actor in the company before; Macfadyen starred in productions of The Duchess of Malfi and Much Ado that took them all over the world together. \u201cThe thing that young actors often don\u2019t realise,\u201d Donnellan says, \u201cis that if you want to get on, the first thing you need to look after is the group. Looking after me me me, on stage or off, never pays out. You have to give full attention to who you are acting with. Matthew always understood that.\u201d He stresses one other thing that has always struck him as unusual in his experience. \u201cMatthew always had an extraordinarily close relationship with his parents, both father and mother. They were around, somehow, when we were in Rio one time. I remember once we were rehearsing and his dad came and they sat in the cafe at the next table and I was so impressed by how easy they were with each other. I\u2019ve never forgotten that.\u201d Donnellan is, like everyone, addicted to Succession. \u201cWhat is really wonderful about the series, is how they all are about the vacuousness of all that wealth,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes you want to go down on your knees and thank God that you are not rich.\u201d It seems a telling coincidence that the cast of Succession did their first read-through of the script on the day of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. It felt something like an omen, for their tale of power and its discontents. \u201cEveryone, all the Americans, kept telling us, you know, the election will be fine, he can\u2019t win,\u201d Macfadyen recalls. \u201cThen we went to the producer Adam McKay\u2019s apartment that evening to watch the results come in. There was that truly terrible moment when it became clear what was going to happen. And everyone went a bit quiet and disappeared into their phones.\u201d Since that night, it has often appeared that something of the barely credible character of Trump\u2019s America has been feeding directly into the two seasons of Succession almost by osmosis. No comic excess or private humiliation seems beyond either drama. \u201cI hope so,\u201d Macfadyen says. \u201cThere does sometimes seem some feedback. Like a horrible loop of shit, you might say.\u201d The Roy family in the drama seem most directly based on the Murdoch dynasty, but in the nastier moments of their familial struggles they also seem to reference Trump and his dreadful sons. It captures what Brian Cox, speaking of his patriarchal role as Logan Roy, has called elsewhere, \u201cthe horrible last gasp of the alpha male in America\u201d, the extended death throes of all that concentrated wealth, which still exerts its global influence. \u201cIt is the Bible salesman arriving in a private jet,\u201d Macfadyen says, \u201cand people queuing up to say: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll buy one of those off you\u2019.\u201d Among the divides in our world just now, it sometimes feels like the most significant is between those who think the worst can\u2019t happen and those who understand that it can. Succession is cast in the no man\u2019s land between those attitudes. Critics of the series suggest that it is hard to sympathise with any of the characters. The genius of it, it seems to me, is that however loathsome and cynical they are, you can still sympathise with all of them. \u201cI agree,\u201d Macfadyen says. \u201cThe Roy children are all terrified. There is an awful absence of love from the father that has taken away all of their confidence. They can never talk about their feelings, though they want to.\u201d On the very edge of that orbit are Tom and his sidekick, cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun), who understands even less of the vicious world in which they find themselves. The pair of them have become a kind of contemporary Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, tragically unsure of their roles, but scheming like everyone else. \u201cThe thing is, however badly they behave,\u201d Macfadyen says, \u201cthey still think they are heroic, or doing their best under very difficult circumstances. Like all of us, Tom is in a film of his own making called Tom Wambsgans, his trials and tribulations.\u201d Some of the collective angst comes from the way the series is filmed. \u201cWe shoot these great long scenes, often with three cameras. And you are never sure whether the camera is on you. It feels like a play and it is liberating because you are forced to listen all the time, like you would in real life. I think we are much more affected by other people than anything inside us. That is the great thing about playing Tom \u2013 he is a totally different person with everyone he is with.\u201d He never knows what to feel? \u201cExcept a sort of panicky ambivalence always.\u201d Again, that seems to capture a quite contemporary sense\u2026 \u201cYes, I think we know life is quite scary but our vanity tells us we are in control \u2013 of our bank accounts and our careers and our relationships \u2013 until one day we are not.\u201d He pauses for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s like, you know, my father died in November, quite suddenly, and when that happens the world tilts and changes for you. Everything goes off, somehow. And it\u2019s like a lot of the world is like that now.\u201d When we speak Macfadyen is due to head out to begin six months\u2019 work, mostly in New York, filming series three of Succession, though no doubt by now some of that schedule has been changed along with everything else. Inevitably, we move from talking about panicky ambivalence to the current crisis. Did he have a sense of things falling apart? \u201cNo,\u201d he says, firmly. \u201cOf course not.\u201d And then: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. I am in that situation that perhaps we are all in, that the more I read about almost anything the less informed I feel. So I keep reading. Nothing quite seems to make sense and there is nothing you can do anyway. Apart, of course, in this case, from washing your hands.\u201d We both can\u2019t help but laugh for a moment \u2013 it\u2019s catching \u2013 and then, just as quickly, on cue, shrug and stop. Quiz is on ITV from 13-15 April Matthew Macfadyen\u2019s best screen roles Spooks, BBC (2002-2004) Long before Tom Wambsgans came Tom Quinn\u2026 After a few smaller roles, Macfadyen became known to British audiences in the first two series of the long-running MI5 drama, as the stoic chief of counter-terrorism division Section D. It was a disciplined portrayal that gradually thawed as the episodes went by, taking Quinn from stern, focused operative to questioning outlier. The series introduced Macfadyen to his wife, Keeley Hawes: they\u2019ve been married since 2004. In My Father\u2019s Den (Brad McGann, 2004) Not enough people saw New Zealander Brad McGann\u2019s heartfelt family tragedy, which gave Macfadyen his first big-screen lead and earned him a British independent film award nomination for best actor. It\u2019s a classic prodigal son role: a feted war photographer returning to his Kiwi homeland following his father\u2019s death, uncovering dark family secrets. The script spirals into melodrama, but Macfadyen gives it a quiet, humane and emotional core. Pride and Prejudice (Joe Wright, 2005) Many think of Colin Firth as the quintessential screen Mr Darcy, but Macfadyen was at least his equal: a more broodingly sensual take on the character, teeming with interior emotional conflict, which fits well with the unbuttoned realism of director Joe Wright\u2019s interpretation. Costumed and styled with a scruffy dishevelment that was equal parts rakish and little-boy-lost, his performance didn\u2019t please all die-hard Austenites, but younger viewers swooned. Anna Karenina (Joe Wright, 2012) Joe Wright has been good to Macfadyen. The actor may not be as prominently featured in this whirring, theatrical, hyper-stylised adaptation of the Tolstoy novel, but in a film of wildly variable performances, his feckless, faithless Oblonsky \u2013 brother rather than lover of Keira Knightley\u2019s heroine this time \u2013 is one of the very best things in it. He\u2019s a cool, dry breeze of comic relief in otherwise hot, heavy surroundings. Succession, HBO (2018-) Following a career heavy on polite British period pieces, the role of Tom Wambsgans in Jesse Armstrong\u2019s critically adored US television drama is a wildly against-type opportunity that the actor palpably relishes. As the ambitious, obsequious third husband to an Elisabeth Murdoch-inspired heiress, Macfadyen wittily plays him as both repulsive and queasily sympathetic: a hungry add-on to the Roy family who, as much as he plays their game, will never quite have their respect. Quiz, ITV (2020) Macfadyen returns to British TV next month as the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? fraudster Major Charles Ingram in Stephen Frears\u2019s miniseries. It\u2019s a morally and psychologically complex part well suited to the actor\u2019s blend of vulnerability and very English propriety: his tragicomic performance is integral to making the series more than just a snarky take on a tabloid scandal. You may wind up thinking of Ingram a bit differently. Guy Lodge",

This was the era before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/it-wont-be-easy-for-boris-johnson-to-keep-his-pledges-to-his-new-friends-in-the-north\" title=\"\">the 2019 election</a> when Johnson won the Tory majority that May couldn\u2019t.

Though primarily addressed to Conservatives, it is a thought-provoking read for those who are not. Since some of his analysis is shared within the Johnson government, it also offers some clues about their philosophy and intentions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This book is at its best when it challenges conventional right-wing thinking.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His diagnosis of what is wrong with Britain accurately includes corporate bureaucrats who have vastly enriched themselves while the real incomes of many of their workers have been stagnant. A fixation with driving up the number of young people going to university has seen the woeful neglect of vocational education. Prosperity has been far too concentrated, leaving many sections of society to feel that it has passed them by. Much political discourse has been toxified.</p> <p>All this and more he blames on what he calls the \u201cultra-liberals\u201d who \u201chave taken community and nation for granted\u201d. In its rightwing form, this has led to an over-reverence of free markets and an unthinking embrace of globalisation. In its leftwing form, it has corrupted classic liberalism (representative government, pluralism, checks and balances, free speech) into an obsession with \u201cgroup rights\u201d, a \u201cno-platforming\u201d intolerance of contrary opinions, and a neglect of the importance of place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1a0f52cc4df07b2acd60a6e30a04a0c3041cb5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1a0f52cc4df07b2acd60a6e30a04a0c3041cb5e/0_0_2372_1577/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Timothy in 2016: stimulating arguments dwarfed by coronavirus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Timothy in 2016: stimulating arguments dwarfed by coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He strikes home with some of his criticisms, but his attack on \u201cideological ultra-liberals\u201d, a category so baggy that it could include George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Jeremy Corbyn, is too bludgeoning and sweeping to be persuasive. A son of the West Midlands, he is right to say that we have a significant problem with regional inequalities. From infrastructure spending to research and development, resources have been overly concentrated in London and the south-east. Where he is too crude is to suggest that this is simply because successive governments have not been bothered. Following the urban riots of the 1980s, Michael Heseltine, a Welshman, put a lot of energy into the revival of inner cities. The government of Tony Blair, who grew up in Durham, devoted a lot of attention to the regeneration of conurbations in the north. You can make a case that they didn\u2019t care enough, but Timothy is wrong to suggest that they didn\u2019t care at all.</p> <p>A supporter of Brexit and very hostile to supranational institutions, one of his biggest beefs is with globalisation. Here you will find the familiar complaint of the anti-globalists that increased flows of capital, technology and migration have enriched poorer people in countries such as China while leaving lower-skilled workers in the west in more precarious and less rewarding employment. Like nearly all anti-globalists, he flinches from pursuing this argument to its conclusion.</p> <p>Should globalisation have never happened? Ought it now to be comprehensively reversed? Supposing that was anyway possible. It is not an attractive proposition to suggest that the many hundreds of millions of people around the world whose life chances have been lifted by the expansion of free trade should have been left in poverty for further generations. And I have yet to hear an anti-globalist who is honest enough to explain to people here that they would have them give up all the cheaper goods from Asia that they have come to enjoy.</p> <p>This book is at its best when it challenges conventional right-wing thinking. He calls for a \u201ccivic capitalism\u201d in which companies feel a sense of obligation to their employees and communities as well as their shareholders. He makes the case for tilting the burden of taxation away from income and towards accumulated wealth. He contends that everyone should be given a lifetime learning budget. These ideas are not altogether novel, but it is unusual and refreshing to hear them from a British Conservative.</p> <p>Overall he presents a blueprint for his party that would mean a revolution in thinking on the right. His Toryism does not crave an ever-shrinking state, which sets him apart from some of his fellow Brexiters.

      "bodyText": "What Dominic Cummings, the teacosy-wearing consigliere of Boris Johnson, is to the current regime at No 10, Nick Timothy was to Theresa May. He even had a svengalian beard. During that brief, and now largely forgotten, period when May appeared to be wildly popular, Timothy was her domineering co-chief of staff. In so much as there was anything you might call Mayism, he was the author of it. Then she fought her disastrous 2017 election campaign, in part at his urging and with a manifesto he co-authored, and the Tories lost their majority. \u201cMy phone rang. It was Theresa ... I could hear the disappointment and hurt and anger in her voice. There was terror, too. I had seen or heard her cry before, but this was different. She was sobbing. I remember thinking she sounded like a child who wanted to be told everything was just fine.\u201d He was thrown out of his job as May frantically struggled to cling on to her own. In a brisk opening chapter, he accepts some of the blame for what he calls \u201ca catastrophe\u201d while settling a few scores along the way. \u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d spits Lynton Crosby, the Australian campaign consultant, when the exit poll accurately forecasts a hung parliament. Philip Hammond was never on board for ending austerity and improving the life chances of the less privileged. Timothy reports the then chancellor sneering: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to actually do any of this stuff. You\u2019re miles ahead in the polls just talking about it.\u201d Though the author is describing quite recent events, this now reads like an account from a very distant time. This was the era before the 2019 election when Johnson won the Tory majority that May couldn\u2019t. Before we\u2019d left the EU. Before the coronavirus crisis, the scale of which makes all other politics look exceedingly small and gives a petty flavour to tales of past personality clashes. That said, there is continuing relevance to this book, the greater part of which is an attempt to diagnose what Timothy calls a \u201cpolitical and cultural crisis\u201d in the democracies. Though primarily addressed to Conservatives, it is a thought-provoking read for those who are not. Since some of his analysis is shared within the Johnson government, it also offers some clues about their philosophy and intentions. His diagnosis of what is wrong with Britain accurately includes corporate bureaucrats who have vastly enriched themselves while the real incomes of many of their workers have been stagnant. A fixation with driving up the number of young people going to university has seen the woeful neglect of vocational education. Prosperity has been far too concentrated, leaving many sections of society to feel that it has passed them by. Much political discourse has been toxified. All this and more he blames on what he calls the \u201cultra-liberals\u201d who \u201chave taken community and nation for granted\u201d. In its rightwing form, this has led to an over-reverence of free markets and an unthinking embrace of globalisation. In its leftwing form, it has corrupted classic liberalism (representative government, pluralism, checks and balances, free speech) into an obsession with \u201cgroup rights\u201d, a \u201cno-platforming\u201d intolerance of contrary opinions, and a neglect of the importance of place. He strikes home with some of his criticisms, but his attack on \u201cideological ultra-liberals\u201d, a category so baggy that it could include George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Jeremy Corbyn, is too bludgeoning and sweeping to be persuasive. A son of the West Midlands, he is right to say that we have a significant problem with regional inequalities. From infrastructure spending to research and development, resources have been overly concentrated in London and the south-east. Where he is too crude is to suggest that this is simply because successive governments have not been bothered. Following the urban riots of the 1980s, Michael Heseltine, a Welshman, put a lot of energy into the revival of inner cities. The government of Tony Blair, who grew up in Durham, devoted a lot of attention to the regeneration of conurbations in the north. You can make a case that they didn\u2019t care enough, but Timothy is wrong to suggest that they didn\u2019t care at all. A supporter of Brexit and very hostile to supranational institutions, one of his biggest beefs is with globalisation. Here you will find the familiar complaint of the anti-globalists that increased flows of capital, technology and migration have enriched poorer people in countries such as China while leaving lower-skilled workers in the west in more precarious and less rewarding employment. Like nearly all anti-globalists, he flinches from pursuing this argument to its conclusion. Should globalisation have never happened? Ought it now to be comprehensively reversed? Supposing that was anyway possible. It is not an attractive proposition to suggest that the many hundreds of millions of people around the world whose life chances have been lifted by the expansion of free trade should have been left in poverty for further generations. And I have yet to hear an anti-globalist who is honest enough to explain to people here that they would have them give up all the cheaper goods from Asia that they have come to enjoy. This book is at its best when it challenges conventional right-wing thinking. He calls for a \u201ccivic capitalism\u201d in which companies feel a sense of obligation to their employees and communities as well as their shareholders. He makes the case for tilting the burden of taxation away from income and towards accumulated wealth. He contends that everyone should be given a lifetime learning budget. These ideas are not altogether novel, but it is unusual and refreshing to hear them from a British Conservative. Overall he presents a blueprint for his party that would mean a revolution in thinking on the right. His Toryism does not crave an ever-shrinking state, which sets him apart from some of his fellow Brexiters. He argues for a Conservatism that rediscovers and embraces the power of active government and uses it to reform dysfunctional markets, deal with gouging corporates and redress inequalities between regions and generations. Elements of this thinking are clearly informing the \u201clevelling-up\u201d agenda that the Johnson government has sworn to deliver for the less affluent parts of Britain. How that will be changed \u2013 for changed it surely will be \u2013 by the coronavirus crisis we cannot yet be fully sure. This is an interesting book with stimulating arguments, but it is currently the fate of anyone writing about politics to know that their thoughts will be less influential in shaping society than a microbe. \u2022 Remaking One Nation: The Future of Conservatism by Nick Timothy is published by Polity Press (\u00a320)",

Some have been applauded for their actions \u2013 making donations to health workers, for instance \u2013 while others have quickly fallen foul of politicians, the public and their own workers. Here is a list of those who deserve plaudits and brickbats so far.</p> <h2>Plaudits \u2013 r<strong>etail</strong></h2> <p><strong>Co-op </strong>The food retailer is taking on 5,000 extra store workers to cope with increased demand, offering temporary employment to hospitality workers who have lost their jobs. People can apply for jobs directly in their local branch. And the 6,500 pupils at 25 Co-op Academy schools who receive free school meals are being given a \u00a320 weekly voucher while schools remain shut.</p> <p><strong>Timpson </strong>The retail chain, which provides shoe repair, dry cleaning and key-cutting services, says it will keep its 5,500 employees on full pay while its shops remain closed.</p> <p><strong>Lloyds Pharmacy </strong>The chain is hiring 1,500 staff so that it can continue delivering prescriptions and healthcare services.

FeedNHS \u2013 also backed by the <strong>Wasabi</strong>, <strong>Abokado </strong>and <strong>Franco Manca</strong> chains \u2013 will deliver 5,600 meals a day to five major hospitals belonging to two London healthcare trusts.</p> <p><strong>Pret a Manger</strong> Before the chain was ordered to close, it was offering free hot drinks and a 50% discount on all other purchases for all NHS workers.</p> <h2>Plaudits \u2013 banks</h2> <p><strong>Lloyds </strong>The bank has suspended 780 planned job cuts across its bank branches, amid a surge in demand and uncertainty over how many staff may need to self-isolate. An internal letter explained it was \u201cnot the right time, either for colleagues or for customers\u201d. Britain\u2019s biggest high street bank said it had granted mortgage holidays to over 70,000 customers in just over a week.

The London-headquartered firm is adapting manufacturing lines to produce sanitiser for use in institutions such as hospitals. It has also pledged to pay its small- and medium-sized suppliers early to help their cashflow.</p> <p><strong>Jingye </strong>The Chinese company, which recently bought British Steel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/24/chinese-company-sends-aid-package-to-british-steel-in-scunthorpe\">sent a private jet filled with medical and protective equipment</a> to the company\u2019s Scunthorpe steelworks. A private jet owned by Jingye landed at Doncaster Sheffield airport containing equipment including face masks, goggles, thermometers and medical gloves, destined for workers at the Scunthorpe blast furnace steelworks and the nearby hospital.</p> <p><strong>McCarthy &amp; Stone </strong>The company, the biggest builder of retirement properties in the UK, has offered government and local authorities more than 300 newly completed apartments in unoccupied developments to house older people recovering from Covid-19 or NHS key workers.</p> <p><strong>Brompton Bicycles </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/24/brompton-company-predicts-ebikes-future-folding-bicycle\">folding bicycle maker</a> is providing 200 bikes to hire, free of charge, to NHS key workers.</p> <p><strong>NCP </strong>The parking company extended its offer of free parking to NHS workers to all key workers.</p> <p><strong>British Land </strong>The business, which owns shopping centres including Sheffield\u2019s Meadowhall, has said it will scrap rent for three months for small and medium-sized companies renting its space, and will allow larger tenants to spread their second-quarter rents payments over an 18 month window.</p> <h2>Brickbats \u2013 <strong>retail</strong></h2> <p><strong>Frasers Group </strong>Mike Ashley\u2019s business, which owns the Sports Direct chain, gave in to government pressure and closed all their shops after previously informing staff that branches should remain open, as selling sporting and fitness equipment was \u201cextremely important\u201d.</p> <p>Following the government shutdown, Sports Direct increased the prices of some products by as much as 50%. Ashley admitted that his business had been struggling to enforce the government\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions for thousands of workers at its Derbyshire warehouse, which continues to operate to fulfil online orders. The Unite union had written to the group about concerned employees at the Shirebrook site, who had reportedly been told they would be immediately fired for self-isolating.</p> <p>Ashley<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/sports-direct-mike-ashley-apologises-for-poor-covid-19-actions\"> issued a public apology for the firm\u2019s behaviour</a> and said the company had since sought to make amends by offering its entire fleet of lorries to help deliver medical equipment and supplies for the NHS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf1be1bb5b40848090f4e9b24fe2dc9a35a72feb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf1be1bb5b40848090f4e9b24fe2dc9a35a72feb/0_83_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Sports Direct store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sports Direct stayed open until the government ordered the lockdown, claiming fitness equipment was \u2018extremely important\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Molly Darlington/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>B&amp;M </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/12/b-and-m-emerges-as-christmas-retail-winner\">discount retailer</a> remains open as it stocks food and grocery items, as well as pet food. Staff have complained on social media about having to work without protective equipment, including in stores where groceries only account for one aisle. An \u201cadvice update\u201d to workers informed them that the company \u201cpresumed all our colleagues are key workers\u201d and that they would be paid for any time spent self-isolating, provided they qualified for statutory sick pay. Those who don\u2019t qualify or who had \u201cexhausted their statutory sick pay entitlement\u201d were told they would be contacted by their payroll adviser.</p> <h2>Brickbats \u2013 <strong>hospitality</strong></h2> <p><strong>JD Wetherspoon </strong>The pub chain\u2019s boss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-wetherspoons-boss-says-uk-pubs-will-stay-open-as-long-as-possible\">Tim Martin, came in for widespread criticism</a> after he said he wanted to keep all 867 locations open until the government-ordered shutdown of all hostelries. The backlash against JD Wetherspoon grew when it said it could not commit to paying its 43,000 employees beyond 24 March, before it had processed details of the government furlough scheme, as it didn\u2019t have the financial resources to do so. </p> <p>It later changed tack and said it had created its own reimbursement scheme so that it could pay its workers on 3 April, provided the government backed its interpretation of the measures. The firm says it is retaining all staff and has advised those who want to apply to work for supermarkets during the current period that they will be given priority for jobs at Wetherspoons when pubs reopen. The chain has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/jd-wetherspoon-refuses-pay-suppliers-until-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-ends\">told its suppliers that they cannot expect payment</a> until after the pubs reopen, even for items that have already been delivered.</p> <p><strong>Travelodge </strong>Hundreds of residents in its hotels, including homeless families housed there by local councils, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/homeless-travelodge-residents-turned-out-on-to-street-coronavirus\">were turned out on to the street </a>after the budget hotel chain closed its premises. The firm gave letters to all residents asking them to leave as soon as possible, apparently in defiance of government guidance, which said that hotels looking after homeless families in temporary accommodation should not close.</p> <p><strong>Britannia </strong>The hotel chain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/scottish-hotel-admin-error-sacking-staff-covid-19\">blamed an administrative error for sacking staff</a> and leaving some without accommodation after it closed one of its properties in Scotland. It had terminated the employment of workers at the Coylumbridge hotel in Aviemore and asked them to leave their accommodation immediately. </p> <p><strong>Carluccio\u2019s </strong>The Unite union has accused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/carluccios-set-to-file-for-administration-amid-coronavirus-shutdown\">Carluccio\u2019s </a>of \u201cwage theft\u201d after the Italian restaurant chain was closed due to the government-ordered shutdown.

      "bodyText": "The dramatic effect of the coronavirus on the British economy has posed serious challenges for the country\u2019s companies and their employees. Some have been applauded for their actions \u2013 making donations to health workers, for instance \u2013 while others have quickly fallen foul of politicians, the public and their own workers. Here is a list of those who deserve plaudits and brickbats so far. Plaudits \u2013 retail Co-op The food retailer is taking on 5,000 extra store workers to cope with increased demand, offering temporary employment to hospitality workers who have lost their jobs. People can apply for jobs directly in their local branch. And the 6,500 pupils at 25 Co-op Academy schools who receive free school meals are being given a \u00a320 weekly voucher while schools remain shut. Timpson The retail chain, which provides shoe repair, dry cleaning and key-cutting services, says it will keep its 5,500 employees on full pay while its shops remain closed. Lloyds Pharmacy The chain is hiring 1,500 staff so that it can continue delivering prescriptions and healthcare services. The company has also recruited 406 pharmacy students to bolster its staff. Plaudits \u2013 hospitality Fullers The pub and hotel chain with over 400 sites has said it will not seek rent payments from its tenanted pubs. Whitbread The owner of the Premier Inn chain and restaurants including Beefeater and Brewers Fayre is putting some employees on a temporary furlough while its sites remain closed. But it will keep them on full pay by topping up the extra 20% of their wages not covered by the government scheme. Whitbread says it is in discussions with the government about providing rooms in its hotels, located near hospitals, to key workers. Leon The restaurant chain is keeping certain branches open to NHS employees and other key workers, and providing takeaway and delivery meals to NHS workers with a 50% discount. It is also bringing together other restaurants, food distributors and suppliers to deliver free daily hot meals to NHS critical care staff. FeedNHS \u2013 also backed by the Wasabi, Abokado and Franco Manca chains \u2013 will deliver 5,600 meals a day to five major hospitals belonging to two London healthcare trusts. Pret a Manger Before the chain was ordered to close, it was offering free hot drinks and a 50% discount on all other purchases for all NHS workers. Plaudits \u2013 banks Lloyds The bank has suspended 780 planned job cuts across its bank branches, amid a surge in demand and uncertainty over how many staff may need to self-isolate. An internal letter explained it was \u201cnot the right time, either for colleagues or for customers\u201d. Britain\u2019s biggest high street bank said it had granted mortgage holidays to over 70,000 customers in just over a week. The lender also confirmed that it would waive interest on arranged overdrafts up to \u00a3300 for all customers across its Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland branches from 6 April. HSBC The UK division donated \u00a31m to the National Emergencies Trust Coronavirus Appeal and British Red Cross to help support vulnerable people affected by Covid-19. Barclays The bank is automatically waiving interest on all overdrafts from 27 March to 30 April. It has also set up an online form for mortgage holiday applications to speed up the process. Plaudits \u2013 other sectors Unilever The company behind brands including Dove and Knorr is contributing \u20ac100m (\u00a389m) globally to fight the pandemic, including \u20ac50m (\u00a347m) worth of soap, sanitiser, bleach and food. The London-headquartered firm is adapting manufacturing lines to produce sanitiser for use in institutions such as hospitals. It has also pledged to pay its small- and medium-sized suppliers early to help their cashflow. Jingye The Chinese company, which recently bought British Steel, sent a private jet filled with medical and protective equipment to the company\u2019s Scunthorpe steelworks. A private jet owned by Jingye landed at Doncaster Sheffield airport containing equipment including face masks, goggles, thermometers and medical gloves, destined for workers at the Scunthorpe blast furnace steelworks and the nearby hospital. McCarthy &amp; Stone The company, the biggest builder of retirement properties in the UK, has offered government and local authorities more than 300 newly completed apartments in unoccupied developments to house older people recovering from Covid-19 or NHS key workers. Brompton Bicycles The folding bicycle maker is providing 200 bikes to hire, free of charge, to NHS key workers. NCP The parking company extended its offer of free parking to NHS workers to all key workers. British Land The business, which owns shopping centres including Sheffield\u2019s Meadowhall, has said it will scrap rent for three months for small and medium-sized companies renting its space, and will allow larger tenants to spread their second-quarter rents payments over an 18 month window. Brickbats \u2013 retail Frasers Group Mike Ashley\u2019s business, which owns the Sports Direct chain, gave in to government pressure and closed all their shops after previously informing staff that branches should remain open, as selling sporting and fitness equipment was \u201cextremely important\u201d. Following the government shutdown, Sports Direct increased the prices of some products by as much as 50%. Ashley admitted that his business had been struggling to enforce the government\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions for thousands of workers at its Derbyshire warehouse, which continues to operate to fulfil online orders. The Unite union had written to the group about concerned employees at the Shirebrook site, who had reportedly been told they would be immediately fired for self-isolating. Ashley issued a public apology for the firm\u2019s behaviour and said the company had since sought to make amends by offering its entire fleet of lorries to help deliver medical equipment and supplies for the NHS. B&amp;M The discount retailer remains open as it stocks food and grocery items, as well as pet food. Staff have complained on social media about having to work without protective equipment, including in stores where groceries only account for one aisle. An \u201cadvice update\u201d to workers informed them that the company \u201cpresumed all our colleagues are key workers\u201d and that they would be paid for any time spent self-isolating, provided they qualified for statutory sick pay. Those who don\u2019t qualify or who had \u201cexhausted their statutory sick pay entitlement\u201d were told they would be contacted by their payroll adviser. Brickbats \u2013 hospitality JD Wetherspoon The pub chain\u2019s boss, Tim Martin, came in for widespread criticism after he said he wanted to keep all 867 locations open until the government-ordered shutdown of all hostelries. The backlash against JD Wetherspoon grew when it said it could not commit to paying its 43,000 employees beyond 24 March, before it had processed details of the government furlough scheme, as it didn\u2019t have the financial resources to do so. It later changed tack and said it had created its own reimbursement scheme so that it could pay its workers on 3 April, provided the government backed its interpretation of the measures. The firm says it is retaining all staff and has advised those who want to apply to work for supermarkets during the current period that they will be given priority for jobs at Wetherspoons when pubs reopen. The chain has also told its suppliers that they cannot expect payment until after the pubs reopen, even for items that have already been delivered. Travelodge Hundreds of residents in its hotels, including homeless families housed there by local councils, were turned out on to the street after the budget hotel chain closed its premises. The firm gave letters to all residents asking them to leave as soon as possible, apparently in defiance of government guidance, which said that hotels looking after homeless families in temporary accommodation should not close. Britannia The hotel chain blamed an administrative error for sacking staff and leaving some without accommodation after it closed one of its properties in Scotland. It had terminated the employment of workers at the Coylumbridge hotel in Aviemore and asked them to leave their accommodation immediately. Carluccio\u2019s The Unite union has accused Carluccio\u2019s of \u201cwage theft\u201d after the Italian restaurant chain was closed due to the government-ordered shutdown. It claims workers have been informed they will only be paid 50% of their wages for the month of March, despite having worked until the chain\u2019s outlets closed on 20 March. The union believes the company\u2019s actions are a breach of employment law. Brickbats \u2013 travel EasyJet The carrier\u2019s pilots and cabin crew have been asked to take three months\u2019 unpaid leave and accept a pay freeze. The airline came in for widespread criticism after it proceeded with a \u00a3174m dividend payout to shareholders, \u00a360m of which was paid to easyJet\u2019s founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. Ryanair The low-cost airline has been accused of ripping off passengers after it was found to be charging \u00a380 more to those rebooking cancelled flights, even though it had offered fee-free changes. The Dublin-based company has waived its change fees, but passengers still have to pay the difference if the new fare is higher. According to consumer group Which?, the airline has increased the cost of those replacement flights by as much as \u00a380. Pay for all staff, including executives, has been cut by 50% for April and May, but the airline\u2019s boss Michael O\u2019Leary has not ruled out redundancies. Brickbats \u2013 other sectors Regus Small firms who rent office space from Regus, one of the largest providers of serviced offices, complain that they are still being charged rent even though they are not able to use their offices. The firm said it had seen an \u201cenormous growth in support needed\u201d in the weeks before the shutdown at the companies who rent space from them \u201cwith mail handling, internet services, and technology services that allow them to work efficiently\u201d. Cineworld Former and current employees of the UK\u2019s largest cinema operator by market share have protested about their treatment by their employers. There was widespread outrage over the company\u2019s decision to terminate the employment \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d of staff working at both Cineworld and its \u201cboutique\u201d arm, Picturehouse. Cineworld Action Group posted an open letter to the chain\u2019s CEO Greidinger after the UK government\u2019s decision to pay 80% of employees\u2019 wages, but says Cineworld is yet to change tack and reinstate the employees it has made redundant. Capita Employees at several call centres run by the outsourcing firm got in touch with the Guardian to raise concerns that the company was not taking their safety seriously. One member of staff at a call centre in Runcorn operated by Capita said people were still taking calls for the mobile operator O2 involving retention of customers threatening to quit, complaining of a \u201cfilthy\u201d building, dirty toilets and empty hand sanitiser stations. They said they were concerned about catching the virus and giving it to family members with underlying health conditions and were too scared to speak out, as they could be fired. Capita said it had increased cleaning at sites, staff were working from home where possible, and it had no policy of sacking employees who complain on social media: \u201cThe top priority of Capita at this very difficult time is the wellbeing of our people.\u201d",

There\u2019s an openness to these kinds of stories that wasn\u2019t there 10 years ago ... In the past, if you wanted to write something that was more feminist, you were highly discouraged by publishers.\u201d</p> <p>Now, more than 25 years since she started writing the column in the <em>New York Observer</em> that would become the smash-hit book and TV series, it is a more acceptable theme, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that young women are much more aware of. It seems like every generation has to relearn feminism.\u201d</p> <p>If she were writing <em>Sex and the City </em>today, there would be much more discussion of #MeToo in there, she says. \u201cBut it reflected the time we were in \u2026 When I was writing <em>Sex and the City</em> back in the 90s, if you were a 30-something single childless woman, you were considered a bit of an outcast. And now, we consider that woman as the norm, as 50% of their demographic. We don\u2019t consider those women freaks.\u201d</p> <p>Bushnell, who was born in Connecticut in 1958 and moved to New York in the 1970s, never had children herself and says she has never regretted her decision. \u201cThe opposite is true,\u201d she wrote on Twitter last year in response to a particularly gloating <em>MailOnline</em> headline.</p> <p>Her new book tries to warn girls born in the 21st century about the challenges they may face, in particular the sexist behaviour they encounter at school. \u201cOne of the things the book captures is typical high-school sexism.

And it used to happen in the workplace all the time \u2013 to me, and to pretty much every other woman I know.\u201d</p> <p>She began to notice a pattern in the behaviour of these men, which she details in her novel: \u201cIt always starts off with a little tiny thing, like they ask for a kiss or they try and get you alone. And you think: \u2018oh well, maybe that\u2019s OK.\u2019 And then it goes a little bit further. And a little bit further.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People often think: 'Oh, it will never happen to me' \u2026 but at first it's so subtle</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the time, she says, \u201cyou didn\u2019t do anything about it. You just tried as politely as possible to say no, without pissing them off. Because if they got pissed off, that\u2019s it.\u201d These men were quite capable of handing out punishments to women who refused to sleep with them: \u201cIt was pretty common actually, for professors to have sex with their students ... [if you refused] they could give you bad grades and that kind of thing.\u201d</p> <p>She wanted to reflect those experiences in <em>Rules for Being a Girl</em>, to prepare young women for the encounters they may face: \u201cIt\u2019s about being aware of these kinds of behaviours. It can happen to anybody. People often think: \u2018oh, it will never happen to me\u2019 but at first it\u2019s so subtle ... And if it wasn\u2019t for #MeToo, it would probably still be going on.\u201d</p> <p>She thinks people are much more aware of what\u2019s unacceptable behaviour now and women feel more empowered to call it out: \u201cWhereas before, it was hushed up. You were told: don\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p> <p>For example, in publishing, there was often pressure on female writers to sleep with the editor, she says. \u201cGetting the job in some way required stroking this guy\u2019s ego. I\u2019m not interested in doing that. Stroke my fucking ego. That\u2019s my feeling.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

And it used to happen in the workplace all the time \u2013 to me, and to pretty much every other woman I know.\u201d She began to notice a pattern in the behaviour of these men, which she details in her novel: \u201cIt always starts off with a little tiny thing, like they ask for a kiss or they try and get you alone. And you think: \u2018oh well, maybe that\u2019s OK.\u2019 And then it goes a little bit further. And a little bit further.\u201d At the time, she says, \u201cyou didn\u2019t do anything about it. You just tried as politely as possible to say no, without pissing them off. Because if they got pissed off, that\u2019s it.\u201d These men were quite capable of handing out punishments to women who refused to sleep with them: \u201cIt was pretty common actually, for professors to have sex with their students ... [if you refused] they could give you bad grades and that kind of thing.\u201d She wanted to reflect those experiences in Rules for Being a Girl, to prepare young women for the encounters they may face: \u201cIt\u2019s about being aware of these kinds of behaviours. It can happen to anybody. People often think: \u2018oh, it will never happen to me\u2019 but at first it\u2019s so subtle ... And if it wasn\u2019t for #MeToo, it would probably still be going on.\u201d She thinks people are much more aware of what\u2019s unacceptable behaviour now and women feel more empowered to call it out: \u201cWhereas before, it was hushed up. You were told: don\u2019t say anything.\u201d For example, in publishing, there was often pressure on female writers to sleep with the editor, she says. \u201cGetting the job in some way required stroking this guy\u2019s ego. I\u2019m not interested in doing that. Stroke my fucking ego. That\u2019s my feeling.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In Uganda, for the first time since 2013, more than three people can legally meet without needing to inform the police. Last week, parts of the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.ug/amnesty-international-welcomes-court-decision-on-public-order-management-act/\">Public Order Management Act</a>, a law used to gag political opponents, was declared unconstitutional. But most Ugandans are staying away from crowds and keeping at home to control the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>The government moved quickly to close schools and universities. Measures became more and more stringent \u2013 closing borders, compulsory quarantine, banning public transport and the sale of non-food items at open markets.</p> <p>While even the toughest critics of the president, <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-xl/news/other/yoweri-museveni-says-ugandans-health-conditions-cannot-allow-them-give-way-for-coronavirus/ar-BB11mUCD\">Yoweri Museveni</a>, who has been in power for 34 years, agree that these measures \u2013 and even more stringent ones \u2013 are necessary, they fear that the government may use coronavirus as an opportunity to clamp down on political freedoms once and for all.</p> <p>The rest of the world is having a taste of what it feels like to live with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/human-rights\">human rights</a> limitations. Traditional violators such as Uganda can claim to feel vindicated when they hear that democracies such as the UK have postponed local elections. The world is realising what many African leaders have known all along, they can argue: human rights are overrated and may stand in the way of \u201cefficiency\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is only a coincidence [the] court decision to allow gatherings comes at a time when we cannot exercise freedom of expression,\u201d says Michael Aboneka, a public interest lawyer and governance expert working with Action Aid. \u201cBut we cannot ignore the underlying symbolism. Coronavirus presents opportunities for the government to strengthen its grip.\u201d </p> <p>More than 21% of Ugandans live in poverty. At least 60% of them might become poor in the face of disaster. The UN has already warned of the devastating economic impact of coronavirus on Africa, with \u00a324bn equivalent to Uganda\u2019s GDP last year \u2013 already lost to the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cNobody is thinking about what will happen to the woman who can no longer sell her sweets, or go from home to home doing people\u2019s hair. Who is thinking about the HIV positive woman who cannot get her medicine?\u201d says <a href=\"https://namati.org/network/member/PrimahKwagala/\">Prima Kwagala</a>, health rights lawyer and founder of Women\u2019s Probono Initiative.</p> <p>She also asks how 10 people who sleep in one hut will socially distance; how women will cope with abusive men being around all the time; how refugees who live closely together and pastoralists who know no life other than that of moving from place to place with their animals will get by. On the day the government gave the first directive to close schools and implement social distancing, Betty Lukriyana, who lives in a fenced homestead of 34 families in Karamoja, one of the poorest regions in an already poor country, had never heard of coronavirus. She is hardly alone.</p> <p>Museveni and his family have been criticised for being detached from the reality of ordinary Ugandans, whether they are asking parents who can barely buy food for their children to buy <a href=\"https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Pack-pupils--food-flasks-keep-warm--Ms-Museveni/688334-3479112-wgp37w/index.html\">food flasks</a>, grounding public transport and businesses without giving alternatives, or pushing for social distancing without addressing the question of crowded homes in villages and slums.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People had money, ready to run away. Now they are in the same broken hospitals as those they were running from</p> <footer> <cite>Anthony Masake</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Under Museveni, government officials, including his family, routinely travel for medical treatment abroad, never experiencing the vagaries of an incompetent health system. Uganda spends more than \u00a360m on treatment of government officials abroad and has only <a href=\"https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/ICU-bed-capacity-Uganda/688334-5495822-dkw5rc/index.html\">55 intensive care unit beds f</a>or its 42 million people.</p> <p>In Uganda, high maternal mortality, patients sleeping on hospital floors or on beds without mattresses, and a lack of protective gear are not things that happen only in emergencies and pandemics \u2013 they are an inherent part of the health system. The <a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus-covid-19\">World Health Organization</a> has warned African countries to brace themselves for the worst, as coronavirus is likely to stretch already struggling health systems to breaking point.</p> <p>While African governments, including Uganda\u2019s, insist that experiences with outbreaks such as Ebola and cholera have prepared them to handle Covid-19, cracks are apparent. Politically connected people bribe their way out of quarantine. Emergency lines are not reachable. Children aren isolated without food, water or medicine.</p> <p>In some cases, phones and laptops have been taken away to silence quarantined critics, including <a href=\"https://observer.ug/news/headlines/63943-inside-uganda-s-coronavirus-quarantine\">Jimmy Spire Ssentongo</a>, a cartoonist and university lecturer. He spoke up for people facing coronavirus injustice after he shared his quarantine experience on Facebook and criticised government unfairness in charging people in quarantine $100 a day.</p> <p>In Uganda, the situation of poor people is encompassed in a euphemism, popularised last Christmas when prices rose sharply, as they do every year. \u201c<em>Omwavu wakufa</em>\u201d, the poor person is meant to die. This summary of powerlessness and resignation came up again in the face of Covid-19. Even as the government issues directives for people to stay at home, it has promised no financial bailout or tax relief. People who live from hand to mouth, barely earning enough to feed their families each day, know that hunger may kill them before coronavirus does.</p> <p>But Anthony Masake, <a href=\"https://www.africablogging.org/author/anthony/\">an activist</a> working with Chapter Four, one of the organisations that supported the challenge against the Public Order Management Act, is optimistic that coronavirus might be the lesson African autocrats need.</p> <p>\u201cPeople had their money, ready to run away in case of things like war. And now here is a pandemic, and they are stuck in the same broken hospitals as people they were running away from,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After the crisis, there will have to be candid conversations about the state of healthcare and the country. With this virus, people over 60 are most threatened \u2013 and those are the people with power.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Patience Akumu is a freelance journalist based in Uganda</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In Uganda, for the first time since 2013, more than three people can legally meet without needing to inform the police. Last week, parts of the Public Order Management Act, a law used to gag political opponents, was declared unconstitutional. But most Ugandans are staying away from crowds and keeping at home to control the spread of coronavirus. The government moved quickly to close schools and universities. Measures became more and more stringent \u2013 closing borders, compulsory quarantine, banning public transport and the sale of non-food items at open markets. While even the toughest critics of the president, Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power for 34 years, agree that these measures \u2013 and even more stringent ones \u2013 are necessary, they fear that the government may use coronavirus as an opportunity to clamp down on political freedoms once and for all. The rest of the world is having a taste of what it feels like to live with human rights limitations. Traditional violators such as Uganda can claim to feel vindicated when they hear that democracies such as the UK have postponed local elections. The world is realising what many African leaders have known all along, they can argue: human rights are overrated and may stand in the way of \u201cefficiency\u201d. \u201cIt is only a coincidence [the] court decision to allow gatherings comes at a time when we cannot exercise freedom of expression,\u201d says Michael Aboneka, a public interest lawyer and governance expert working with Action Aid. \u201cBut we cannot ignore the underlying symbolism. Coronavirus presents opportunities for the government to strengthen its grip.\u201d More than 21% of Ugandans live in poverty. At least 60% of them might become poor in the face of disaster. The UN has already warned of the devastating economic impact of coronavirus on Africa, with \u00a324bn equivalent to Uganda\u2019s GDP last year \u2013 already lost to the pandemic. \u201cNobody is thinking about what will happen to the woman who can no longer sell her sweets, or go from home to home doing people\u2019s hair. Who is thinking about the HIV positive woman who cannot get her medicine?\u201d says Prima Kwagala, health rights lawyer and founder of Women\u2019s Probono Initiative. She also asks how 10 people who sleep in one hut will socially distance; how women will cope with abusive men being around all the time; how refugees who live closely together and pastoralists who know no life other than that of moving from place to place with their animals will get by. On the day the government gave the first directive to close schools and implement social distancing, Betty Lukriyana, who lives in a fenced homestead of 34 families in Karamoja, one of the poorest regions in an already poor country, had never heard of coronavirus. She is hardly alone. Museveni and his family have been criticised for being detached from the reality of ordinary Ugandans, whether they are asking parents who can barely buy food for their children to buy food flasks, grounding public transport and businesses without giving alternatives, or pushing for social distancing without addressing the question of crowded homes in villages and slums. Under Museveni, government officials, including his family, routinely travel for medical treatment abroad, never experiencing the vagaries of an incompetent health system. Uganda spends more than \u00a360m on treatment of government officials abroad and has only 55 intensive care unit beds for its 42 million people. In Uganda, high maternal mortality, patients sleeping on hospital floors or on beds without mattresses, and a lack of protective gear are not things that happen only in emergencies and pandemics \u2013 they are an inherent part of the health system. The World Health Organization has warned African countries to brace themselves for the worst, as coronavirus is likely to stretch already struggling health systems to breaking point. While African governments, including Uganda\u2019s, insist that experiences with outbreaks such as Ebola and cholera have prepared them to handle Covid-19, cracks are apparent. Politically connected people bribe their way out of quarantine. Emergency lines are not reachable. Children aren isolated without food, water or medicine. In some cases, phones and laptops have been taken away to silence quarantined critics, including Jimmy Spire Ssentongo, a cartoonist and university lecturer. He spoke up for people facing coronavirus injustice after he shared his quarantine experience on Facebook and criticised government unfairness in charging people in quarantine $100 a day. In Uganda, the situation of poor people is encompassed in a euphemism, popularised last Christmas when prices rose sharply, as they do every year. \u201cOmwavu wakufa\u201d, the poor person is meant to die. This summary of powerlessness and resignation came up again in the face of Covid-19. Even as the government issues directives for people to stay at home, it has promised no financial bailout or tax relief. People who live from hand to mouth, barely earning enough to feed their families each day, know that hunger may kill them before coronavirus does. But Anthony Masake, an activist working with Chapter Four, one of the organisations that supported the challenge against the Public Order Management Act, is optimistic that coronavirus might be the lesson African autocrats need. \u201cPeople had their money, ready to run away in case of things like war. And now here is a pandemic, and they are stuck in the same broken hospitals as people they were running away from,\u201d he says. After the crisis, there will have to be candid conversations about the state of healthcare and the country. With this virus, people over 60 are most threatened \u2013 and those are the people with power. \u2022 Patience Akumu is a freelance journalist based in Uganda",

      "bodyText": "With its lush indoor gardens, ornate pavilions and red carpet area, Madrid\u2019s Ifema convention centre was the impressive backdrop Spain showed the world last December, when the country took on last-minute hosting duties for the Cop25 climate summit. Last week the spotlight was on it once again, but for a far grimmer reason. As Spain becomes an increasingly worrying hotspot of the global pandemic, the Ifema centre has been turned, with help from the military, into one of the country\u2019s largest hospitals. Inside are thousands of beds, in row after precisely spaced row. Spain\u2019s Covid-19 death toll last week surpassed that of China, and is now second only to Italy\u2019s. Yesterday the number of deaths surged to a new record for the country, with 832 people dying in 24 hours. The virus has so far claimed 5,690 lives. The figures last night prompted the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to tighten its lockdown and order all non-essential workers to stay at home for the next two weeks. In a televised address he said \u201cextraordinarily tough\u201d measures were needed as the county intensified its efforts to contain the pandemic. One who died was Yolanda Cumia\u2019s father, Juan. Her last conversation with him was on 16 March, after the 87-year-old said he had hurt his foot after a fall at the care home where he lived. Hours later, at 2am, her phone rang again: it was a staff member telling her that her father had died. Days earlier, two people linked to the home had tested positive for Covid-19, and the invisible killer stampeded through the centre. \u201cShe told me: \u2018Yolanda, we\u2019re overwhelmed. From what I know, we have 15 people dead.\u2019\u201d The care home did not reply to a request for comment. Cumia joined others in going public with the news as deaths at the 130-room home climbed to at least 17. Others chimed in with stories from across the country, painting a hazy picture of a contagion that had steadily preyed on the country\u2019s elderly, with ill-equipped staff the only line of defence. The Spanish government turned to the military for help in disinfecting the residences. What they discovered horrified the country. \u201cThe army has seen some totally abandoned elderly people \u2013 even some who were dead in their beds,\u201d the country\u2019s defence minister, Margarita Robles, told broadcaster Telecinco. The revelation was a blow to a country that has long prided itself on good treatment of its elders. \u201cThis is the generation that lived through a horrendous civil war and post-war era,\u201d said Cumia. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re dying alone.\u201d As the country enters its third week of near-total lockdown, the number of confirmed cases has rocketed to 72,248. The actual figure is likely to be much higher, as people with mild symptoms have been told to self-isolate rather than seek testing. In some cities the surge in cases has left the country\u2019s healthcare system \u2013 ranked among the top 20 in the world \u2013 on the edge of collapse, its defences already weakened by austerity measures that shaved billions from its budget. \u201cMine is supposed to be a 265-bed hospital, and today it has 700 patients,\u201d said doctor Ana Gim\u00e9nez of Madrid\u2019s Infanta Leonor hospital. \u201cHundreds of people are sitting in chairs or lying on the floor\u2026 all of the hospitals in Madrid are absolutely overwhelmed.\u201d The situation is exacerbated by a lack of protective gear. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything. We don\u2019t have masks, we don\u2019t have gloves, we don\u2019t have waterproof gowns. We have nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are naked against the coronavirus.\u201d While Spaniards take nightly to their windows and balconies to applaud the efforts of healthcare workers, the government still promises that supplies are on the way. In the meantime, DIY solutions have proliferated, with healthcare workers sharing photos of rubbish bags fashioned into protective gowns. It is little wonder, said Gim\u00e9nez, that healthcare workers in Spain account for 9,444 of the country\u2019s infected. Those killed by the virus include a nurse and two doctors.

The US historian Jill Lepore has written of \u201cplague novels\u201d, such as Camus\u2019s work, that \u201cunlike other species of apocalyptic fiction, where the enemy can be chemicals or volcanoes or earthquakes or alien invaders, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/what-our-contagion-fables-are-really-about\">the enemy here is other humans\u201d</a>.</p> <p>This is true not just of plague fiction but also of pandemic fact. From the media to the public, we seem to take the actions of a few idiots, rather than the decency of the vast majority, as representative of human nature.</p> <p>In part, too, the tendency to see other people as the problem is nurtured by a more atomised society. And there\u2019s the paradox: the outpouring of community-mindedness \u2013 from the half a million people who volunteered to help out the NHS to the mutual aid groups that have sprung up nationwide \u2013 takes place against a background of a hollowed-out civic and public life and the fading of many of the organisations through which social solidarity has traditionally been nurtured. It\u2019s perhaps symbolic that social distancing has become the most vital expression of social solidarity.</p> <p>The paradox can be seen too, in the resetting of politics, and in the shifting of the relationship between society and the state. In the space of a few weeks, governments on both sides of the Atlantic have jettisoned policies long considered sacrosanct in good economic management. Commentators who for years have insisted on the need for small government and debt reduction now call for the authorities to \u201cembrace socialism\u201d to save the free market. A Tory minister told the journalist Robert Peston that the government was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/boris-must-borrow-from-corbyn-s-playbook-to-prevent-a-coronavirus-crash\">implementing most of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s programme</a>\u201d.

But it is different from the big state of the past. The postwar Keynesian compact was shaped, at least in part, by the demands of a vibrant labour movement, and given impetus through a Labour government swept into power by popular acclaim. Today\u2019s big state is being brought into being by politicians who, just an election ago, were making the case for austerity, while we the public remain holed up in our houses watching press conferences in which the new social rules are laid down.</p> <p>Decency is a necessary underpinning of the good society, but not a sufficient one. Beyond decency lies politics. How decency is able to express itself, and what kind of society it can build, depends on political will and collective struggles.</p> <p>What happens to the energy unleashed by the mutual aid societies, the NHS volunteers, the food bank helpers, and to the willingness to upend our lives for the common good? Who will give shape to the new relationship being forged between society and the state? Once we have stopped social distancing, these are the questions we will need to address in the post-pandemic world.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

The US historian Jill Lepore has written of \u201cplague novels\u201d, such as Camus\u2019s work, that \u201cunlike other species of apocalyptic fiction, where the enemy can be chemicals or volcanoes or earthquakes or alien invaders, the enemy here is other humans\u201d. This is true not just of plague fiction but also of pandemic fact. From the media to the public, we seem to take the actions of a few idiots, rather than the decency of the vast majority, as representative of human nature. In part, too, the tendency to see other people as the problem is nurtured by a more atomised society. And there\u2019s the paradox: the outpouring of community-mindedness \u2013 from the half a million people who volunteered to help out the NHS to the mutual aid groups that have sprung up nationwide \u2013 takes place against a background of a hollowed-out civic and public life and the fading of many of the organisations through which social solidarity has traditionally been nurtured. It\u2019s perhaps symbolic that social distancing has become the most vital expression of social solidarity. The paradox can be seen too, in the resetting of politics, and in the shifting of the relationship between society and the state. In the space of a few weeks, governments on both sides of the Atlantic have jettisoned policies long considered sacrosanct in good economic management. Commentators who for years have insisted on the need for small government and debt reduction now call for the authorities to \u201cembrace socialism\u201d to save the free market. A Tory minister told the journalist Robert Peston that the government was \u201cimplementing most of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s programme\u201d. And all this after Corbyn was savaged at the polls. The \u201cbig state is back\u201d, observed the Economist. But it is different from the big state of the past. The postwar Keynesian compact was shaped, at least in part, by the demands of a vibrant labour movement, and given impetus through a Labour government swept into power by popular acclaim. Today\u2019s big state is being brought into being by politicians who, just an election ago, were making the case for austerity, while we the public remain holed up in our houses watching press conferences in which the new social rules are laid down. Decency is a necessary underpinning of the good society, but not a sufficient one. Beyond decency lies politics. How decency is able to express itself, and what kind of society it can build, depends on political will and collective struggles. What happens to the energy unleashed by the mutual aid societies, the NHS volunteers, the food bank helpers, and to the willingness to upend our lives for the common good? Who will give shape to the new relationship being forged between society and the state? Once we have stopped social distancing, these are the questions we will need to address in the post-pandemic world. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

The travel advisory said employees of trucking, food supply, financial services and some other industries were exempt and state governors had full discretion over how to carry out the advisory. The United Nations, based in New York, donated 250,000 face masks to the city. Cuomo delayed the state\u2019s presidential primary from 28 April to 23 June. The number of confirmed deaths in the US passed 2,000 on Saturday, more than double the level two days earlier. Worldwide infections surpassed 660,000 with more than 30,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. More than 135,000 people had recovered, it said. The US has more than 120,000 reported cases, the greatest number in the world. Italy has more than 10,000 deaths, the most of any country, followed by Spain, China, Iran and France. The disease has spread to other major US cities including Detroit, New Orleans and Chicago and into rural America, where hotspots erupted in midwestern towns and Rocky Mountain ski resorts. The Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said an infant with Covid-19 had died in Chicago. In Detroit, which has a large low-income population, the death toll rose to 31, with 1,381 infections as of midday Saturday. The trajectory was more steep than that of New York, said Dr Teena Chopra, a director at the Detroit Medical Center. Britain\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, who is in self-isolation with Covid-19, is to warn British households in a letter that the virus epidemic will get worse before it gets better and a tougher lockdown may be necessary. The Zaandam cruise ship, which has hundreds of passengers on board including at least 130 with flu-like symptoms, has been granted passage through the Panama canal. Four people on the ship have died and two of those with symptoms have been diagnosed with Covid-19. Elsewhere, the Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, ordered borders closed from Monday. Vietnam cut back domestic airline flights and ordered restaurants, shopping malls and other businesses deemed non-essential to close for at least two weeks. Gatherings of more than 20 people were banned and the government urged companies to allow employees to work from home if possible. Vietnam has quarantined nearly 60,000 people who entered the country from affected nations or had contact with infected people, according to the health ministry. On the European continent, governments including Italy, Spain and France have continued lockdowns. Germany has fewer deaths than some neighbouring countries but 12 residents of a nursing home in the northern town of Wolfsburg have died since Monday, according to the DPA news agency. Italy has been under lockdown for almost three weeks. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has signed a decree freeing up \u20ac400m (US$447m) for coupons and packages of food aid to be delivered door-to-door if necessary. New Zealand reported its first death on Sunday, while in Australia the toll stood at 16 deaths from 3,809 confirmed cases. Thailand has reported 143 new cases, bringing the total to 1,388, with one new death bringing total reported fatalities to seven. As other governments tightened controls, China eased more restrictions following the Communist party\u2019s declaration of victory over the coronavirus. Subway and bus service resumed on Saturday in Wuhan, the centre of the global outbreak. Restrictions that bar Wuhan residents from leaving the surrounding province of Hubei are due to end on 8 April.",

      "body": "<p>When the camera follows a young woman as she staggers around a bar, slurring her words, she is conventionally marked out as a victim. A judgmental film director might even indicate she is deserving of scorn. But what if this vulnerable target is actually the one deciding who really deserves what \u2013 and then meting out her own brutal form of justice? This is the subversive premise of the directorial debut from the British actress, screenwriter and author Emerald Fennell.</p> <p>Her film, <em>Promising Young Woman</em>, is released next month and opens with scenes that show Cassie Thomas, a medical school dropout played by Carey Mulligan, apparently indulging in just the sort of self-destructive alcoholic behaviour seen recently from other modern anti-heroines, such as Rachel in <em>The Girl on the Train</em>, or the eponymous Daphne in the admired off-beat British film of 2017. The difference this time is that Cassie has been weaponised by a damaging experience in her past. And although she is clinging on to a job in a coffee shop and still living with her parents at 30, she is no longer anyone\u2019s victim. The result, according to the <em>Telegraph</em>\u2019s Robbie Collin is a \u201cwild and righteous provocation\u201d of a film.</p> <p>As an actress Fennell will already be familiar to fans of either <em>The Crown</em> or <em>Call the Midwife</em>, where she has played, respectively, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Patsy the closet lesbian. But for this film she has not just stepped behind the camera as director, but also re-worked an existing screenplay to reflect contemporary attitudes and to puncture some common assumptions. At the Sundance film festival, where <em>Promising Young Woman</em> premiered this January, critics were ambushed by its unusual, dark tone. An editorial in the spring edition of the film magazine<em> Little White Lies</em> celebrated what several pundits have admired in the director\u2019s voice: \u201cFennell\u2019s pitch-black comedy is hard to stomach at times, but a piercing, vital addition to the growing canon of films that allow women to speak for themselves rather than through the gaze of men.\u201d</p> <p>If the film\u2019s violent twist works with audiences, as many reviewers have been slightly surprised to admit, it could be because Fennell has made sure that her story does more than just chime with a worthy Times Up message. While other upcoming feminist offerings, such as the Weinstein-inspired drama <em>The Assistant</em>, starring Julia Garner and Matthew Macfadyen, are also set to give us leading women who are prepared to fight back, Fennell\u2019s debut feels like a more focused correction to some of the wicked fun she recently had working as the show-runner and lead writer on the second series of the wildly successful television show <em>Killing Eve</em>.</p> <p>Born in London and educated at the exclusive Marlborough College and then at Oxford, Fennell was selected by Phoebe Waller-Bridge to take over the drama developed from Luke Jennings\u2019s novelas. It was an honour, in the light of the global impact of the show, and a demonstration of faith in another young female writer. In the end, Fennell\u2019s handling of the tale of the hitwoman and the obsessive sleuth hunting her down proved not quite as popular as the first series, but it continued to deliver a succession of stylishly amoral assassinations. Now, in Cassie, Fennell has found another violent leading lady, but one on a less random and more ethically nuanced mission to punish mankind. Not all men are guilty here, and appearances can deceive.</p> <p>As the Guardian critic who saw <em>Promising Young Woman </em>at the film festival in Utah noted: \u201cOne of the film\u2019s aces is showing us that sexual assault can come in an innocuous package, from an Oxford shirt-wearing, soft-speaking \u2018nice\u2019 guy who can quickly flip into a destructive mode when he thinks the power is in his hands.\u201d</p> <p>Since Sundance the title of the film has been applied to Fennell herself several times. And if she still \u201cpromises\u201d much, she is clearly set to fulfil public expectation this year. \u201cFrom her work on <em>Killing Eve </em>to her short film <em>Careful How You Go</em>, Fennell has always demonstrated a fascination with the grey spaces of morality, and her debut feature is no exception \u2013 it\u2019s a meticulous, candy-coloured fairy tale with a blistering central performance from Carey Mulligan that\u2019s quite unlike anything she\u2019s done before. Provocative and recalcitrant, it\u2019s sure to spark plenty of debate, but also resonate with anyone who has seen their life (or, indeed, the life of someone they love) changed forever by rape,\u201d wrote film critic Hannah Woodhead.</p> <p>Others, including the <em>Hollywood News </em>reviewer, have been less convinced by Mulligan as a malignant siren but are still intrigued by Fennell\u2019s film. \u201cLike everything here,\u201d the magazine declared, \u201c[Mulligan\u2019s] turn is skilful, entertaining and challenging, even when the eccentric method obscures the precise message.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e7f5a2064183658af4fc4971afd27d35358d89e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e7f5a2064183658af4fc4971afd27d35358d89e/306_238_2351_1411/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carey Mulligan in a bar scene from Promising Young Woman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carey Mulligan in a bar scene from Promising Young Woman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what exactly is this first time director\u2019s message? Well, it is clear Fennell loves to shock. That was an essential for the <em>Killing Eve</em> job, but also evident in the series of scary books she has written for children, starting with the spooky <em>Shiverton Hall</em> in 2013, and then in the mordant grimness of her 2015 novel <em>Monsters</em>, set in Cornwall. This adult book tells of two odd children who encounter a smattering of murders in beautiful Fowey. The acclaimed writer William Boyd was impressed when he reviewed if for the <em>New Statesman</em>. \u201cEmerald Fennell\u2019s <em>Monsters</em> is a tremendous, destabilising work of fiction, infusing the mundane with eerie and unsettling darkness it is written, moreover, in a remarkable tone of voice,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Yet in person Fennell\u2019s jolly manner and upper crust vowels, to say nothing of her close association with <em>Call the Midwife</em>, might also qualify her as a favourite for the title of \u201cthe next Miranda Hart\u201d.</p> <p>And, rather like Hart, Fennell has been tweeting during the current lockdown in an attempt to distract and amuse her followers. Back in her family home, the entertainment has fairly been thin on the ground, she has suggested. A selection of gratuitous eBay purchases have sent her falling back on her lurid teenage library of romances and ghost stories.</p> <p>Last week, on \u201cDay 3 of self-isolation\u201d in her childhood bedroom she wondered: \u201cIs this how our civilisation ends?

On arrival, hunt down the key safe on one of the barn walls. With the wind moaning in the trees and the looming skyline to the west \u2013 the ridge formed by Graystones, Broad Fell and Lord\u2019s Seat \u2013 it feels properly remote, even though the owners do live next door, the only other humans within an hour\u2019s walk.</p> <p>The cottage is perfectly snug: an air-source heat pump does the heavy lifting, while a logburner adds the final warm touches in the upstairs open-plan kitchen-diner-living area. Laminated maps and a full set of Wainwrights are on the window ledge awaiting the evening planning session, although the DVD selection might cause some distractions. Bedrooms and bathroom (with full-size bath, I\u2019m happy to see) are downstairs.</p> <p>Next day we settle on a circuit that will take us up the forested valley then out on the tops for a return along the ridge. However, when we get to the summit of Lord\u2019s Seat, the west wind is ferocious and has added a little scouring powder of hail that confuses the dog, Wilf. He can\u2019t walk into it and keep his eyes open, so closes them and stumbles around blindly.

Some hosts saw a surge in interest at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, as international travel restrictions and flight cancellations were imposed, but sales are now falling dramatically. In a bid to keep business going, travel companies are calling on those with with existing bookings to change their dates rather than scrap trips altogether. Taking a holiday might still be a way off but many rental companies are now also offering increased flexibility when it comes to changing dates. \u201cThe best way to help the industry right now is to look ahead. It might feel like a strange time to book a holiday but do consider it if you can,\u201d said Mike Shields, managing director of Sawday\u2019s and Canopy &amp; Stars. \u201cMany of our owners are offering vouchers or credit notes that can be redeemed at a later date and are a great way to show your support.

Bedrooms and bathroom (with full-size bath, I\u2019m happy to see) are downstairs. Next day we settle on a circuit that will take us up the forested valley then out on the tops for a return along the ridge.

Schools are providing support where they can, but there are also still plenty of smartphone and tablet apps that can be used as part of learning.</p> <p>It may be tricky to get some children to see these devices as good for more than TikTok, <em>Fortnite</em> and (adult) YouTube, but the positive side is that the best learning apps are interesting enough to \u2013 perhaps with an initial nudge \u2013 engage children. Here are 20 apps that may get parents off to a good start. The \u201cyounger children\u201d apps are most suitable for preschool and early primary kids, while the \u201colder children\u201d apps are more for later primary and early secondary age.</p> <h2><strong>For younger children</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4a0397f09e31e7fbdbd710370345a209c397b800\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a0397f09e31e7fbdbd710370345a209c397b800/0_0_512_512/500.jpg\" alt=\"Go Explore from CBeebies logo\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Go Explore from CBeebies</h2> <p>(<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.bbc.cbeebiesgoexplore\" title=\"\">Android</a>/<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/go-explore-from-cbeebies/id1444626898\" title=\"\">Apple</a>/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/BBC-MEDIA-APPLICATIONS-TECHNOLOGIES-LIMITED/dp/B07MVFBXYT/\" title=\"\">Amazon</a> \u2013 free) <br>The entire range of the BBC\u2019s CBeebies apps will be getting heavy usage in the coming weeks, clearly.

      "bodyText": "The closure of schools across the UK has left many parents and carers in the sudden, unexpected position of being home-school teachers. Schools are providing support where they can, but there are also still plenty of smartphone and tablet apps that can be used as part of learning. It may be tricky to get some children to see these devices as good for more than TikTok, Fortnite and (adult) YouTube, but the positive side is that the best learning apps are interesting enough to \u2013 perhaps with an initial nudge \u2013 engage children. Here are 20 apps that may get parents off to a good start. The \u201cyounger children\u201d apps are most suitable for preschool and early primary kids, while the \u201colder children\u201d apps are more for later primary and early secondary age. For younger children Go Explore from CBeebies (Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 free) The entire range of the BBC\u2019s CBeebies apps will be getting heavy usage in the coming weeks, clearly. They\u2019re all good, but this is the one focused on learning games, from phonics and geography to feelings and self-care, all based on the parent channel\u2019s shows and characters. Khan Academy Kids (Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 free) Khan Academy is a free collection of education courses for all ages, but it has an app specifically for two to seven-year-old children that focuses on maths, reading and social and emotional skills. It has a large and growing archive of learning videos, digital books and simple but engaging exercises. Montessori Preschool (Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 subscription) For very young children who\u2019ll be missing out on some of the formative teaching at preschool this year, this beautifully crafted app could be a great help. From maths and phonics to music and early coding, its colourful exercises never feel dry or dull. It costs \u00a35.49 a month. Hopster (Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 subscription) British company Hopster describes its app as \u201ceducational kids\u2019 TV\u201d. What that means is a collection of familiar cartoons and shows including the likes of Sesame Street, Bob the Builder, Thomas the Tank Engine, Fireman Sam and Pingu, accompanied by fun learning games on topics such as maths and phonics. It will even remind kids not to binge on too many episodes in a row. It costs \u00a34.99 a month. Teach Your Monster to Read (Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 free) This usually costs \u00a34.99, but has been made free owing to the school disruption. No matter how you feel after a couple of days of home-schooling, the titular monster isn\u2019t your child. Instead, this gets children to create a monster and then teach it to read \u2013 a great way of learning themselves. World of Peppa Pig (Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 subscription) This is one of a growing number of subscription-based children\u2019s apps \u2013 seen as a more trustworthy model than in-app purchases and/or ads. Aimed at preschool children, it\u2019s another collection of learning games, but also has videos, picture-making and songs from the TV show. It costs \u00a34.99 a month. YouTube Kids (Android/Apple \u2013 free) After a rocky start when some non-child-friendly videos made it through the filters, YouTube has worked hard to make its official children\u2019s app something parents can trust. It includes a dedicated learning category collecting great videos about science, nature, space and other topics. Mental Maths 5-6 (Apple \u2013 \u00a33.99) It\u2019s been out for a few years, but this is still one of the best maths apps for children that feels genuinely educational. It\u2019s built around a range of maths exercises and progress tests. Separate versions cover children up to the age of 11, and there\u2019s a spelling series, too. Dr Seuss\u2019s ABC: AR Version (Android/Apple \u2013 \u00a33.99) \u201cBig A, little a. What begins with A?\u201d Well, augmented reality does, for a start. Dr Seuss\u2019s inimitable alphabet book has been turned into an AR app, with animated characters appearing in the room around your child. The learning aspects include tracing the letters to learn their shapes for (non-AR) writing. ScratchJr (Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 free) Scratch is the programming environment that a lot of children will be familiar with already from school. ScratchJr is an app version designed for five to seven-year-olds, although older children can have fun with it, too. It uses coding blocks to create programs for games, animation, music and other creative tasks. For older children King of Maths: Maths Learner (Android/Apple \u2013 free + in-app purchases) This recently released maths game challenges children in quickfire sums, increasing in difficulty if they keep answering correctly. They write the numbers on the touchscreen with their finger rather than tapping buttons. It\u2019s free to try, with a \u00a33.99 in-app purchase unlocking everything. Google Arts &amp; Culture (Android/Apple \u2013 free) Field trips and museum visits may be out of bounds for a while, but Google\u2019s Arts &amp; Culture app at least has virtual tours of more than 1,200 museums and galleries. Children can look and read as well as curate their own lists of favourite artworks to share. Mimo (Android/Apple \u2013 subscription) There are a number of great learn-to-code apps out there for children, but Mimo is one in particular that feels most connected to the world of professional programming. At a cost of \u00a38.49 a month, it offers quick but interesting exercises in languages including Python, Java and Swift. Elevate: Brain Training (Android/Apple \u2013 subscription) Elevate is one of a clutch of quality brain-training apps (see also: Peak or Lumosity) full of mini-games designed to sharpen your memory, maths skills, focus and other mental skills. Like those other apps, it uses a subscription \u2013 \u00a338.99 a year \u2013 but with a week\u2019s trial to test it out. Simply Piano (Android/Apple \u2013 subscription) If music lessons have gone out of the window, Simply Piano is one of the best app alternatives. It helps children (or adults!) to learn songs and then listens to their playing on any real piano or keyboard to give feedback. Two courses are free, but then it costs \u00a383.99 a year \u2013 pricey for an app, but not so much for piano lessons. Women Who Changed the World (Android/Apple \u2013 \u00a32.99) This is a history app focused on a range of famous women who \u201chelped us to understand our world better, and to make it a better place to live in\u201d. Rosa Parks, Marie Curie, Malala Yousafzai and Amelia Earhart are among the women profiled through animation and storytelling. Duolingo (Android/Apple \u2013 free + in-app purchases) Duolingo isn\u2019t just a fun and popular way to learn languages that children already study at school. It covers more than 30, including Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew and Welsh. It\u2019s well designed, rewarding short daily sessions of practice. It\u2019s free, but in-app purchases remove ads and unlock some extra features. Kahoot! (Android/Apple \u2013 free/subscription) Kahoot! isn\u2019t just an app, it\u2019s also a website: a big collection of trivia quizzes created by other users. It\u2019s going to really come into its own as schools close. It\u2019s also a good group-learning experience: one person hosts a game and the others compete on their own devices. TED (Android/Apple/Amazon \u2013 free) The TED talks archives are a wonderful repository of brain food for all ages \u2013 older children included. Search for history, science, nature \u2013 anything \u2013 and see what comes up. The talks are not all suitable for children, but many are. Swift Playgrounds (Apple \u2013 free) Swift is Apple\u2019s own programming language, and Swift Playgrounds is its app for teaching people how to use it. It\u2019s for adults as well as children, but it\u2019s certainly accessible for the latter, with its lessons presented as coding puzzles that will give people the skills needed to start making their own apps and games. It\u2019s on Apple\u2019s iPad, but not (yet) its iPhone.",

From age four onwards, I wore them out. Dancing to the Beatles made me feel reckless. It was a kind of proto-lust: not for the men making the music, but for the music itself. Now I am aware of the context, the rhythm and blues records the Beatles ripped off. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-VAxGJdJeQ\" title=\"\">Twist and Shout</a> (1963) is actually a cover.

I just knew that every night you could twirl the dial and hear the distorted blare of happy hardcore, jungle and associated genres, sounds that turned into garage and grime. You rarely knew what you were listening to, but you knew teenagers were scaling tower blocks a mile away to hang an aerial and it all sounded mind-blowingly necessary and in real time.

It was even better that this diminutive Canadian former dancer had such diverse inputs: Tool! Manga! Computer games! Saccharine pop! The gig she played at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/11/grimes-review-brixton-academy-london-claire-boucher-art-angels\" title=\"\">Brixton Academy in 2016</a> involved two women \u2013 Grimes and her friend, the electronic artist Hana \u2013 bounding around the stage orchestrating an industrial rave disguised as pop. Grimes herself alternated between joy and menace and anxiety. That night was a win: it seemed that one aspect of the riot grrrl manifesto had been ticked off the to-do list. <strong>KE</strong></p> <p><strong>Pole 2</strong><br>The Pole albums are being reissued soon, and I\u2019m itching to declare how beyond magnificent they are, particularly the <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6372-cd-2/\" title=\"\">second one</a> (1999), a record I love. I know nothing about either the artist \u2013 Stefan Betke, originally from D\u00fcsseldorf, now an in-demand studio technician \u2013 or his authorial intentions. But as pure sound, this is immense: minimalist techno, produced as ambient dub reggae, through a fizzing, crackling, broken processor, a Waldorf 4-Pole filter which that Betke accidentally dropped.

This punk musical punched through distinctions. Puppets and humans jostled together. The stories were grisly, but their effects were beautiful: when a child burned to death, the fire was evoked in a whirl of flame-coloured petticoats. The music \u2013 a creamy falsetto, a jaunty accordion \u2013 soared and attacked. I saw this during my first year at the <em>Observer</em>; I still think of it as one of my best ever nights in the stalls. <strong>Susannah Clapp</strong></p> <p><strong>Escaped Alone</strong><br>As I watched <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/31/escaped-alone-caryl-churchill-review-royal-court\" title=\"\">Escaped Alone </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/31/escaped-alone-caryl-churchill-review-royal-court\" title=\"\">in 2016</a>, I realised how central <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/02/caryl-churchill-at-80-theatre-great-disruptor\" title=\"\">Caryl Churchill</a>\u2019s plays are to my idea of what makes a vital theatre: urgent subjects; provoking form; intensity of speech. Inconsequential chat is interspersed with soliloquies in which catastrophe is dazzlingly imagined. Domesticity is a breath away from dystopia. As surely as any of the site-specific performances which have been another major excitement of my years as a critic, Churchill\u2019s work has transported and immersed me. <strong>SC</strong></p> <p><strong>Cyrano de Bergerac<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/23/jamie-lloyd-theatre-director-interview-cyrano-betrayal-pinter-james-mcavoy\" title=\"\">Jamie Lloyd</a>\u2019s electric remaking of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/15/cyrano-review-playhouse-james-mcavoy-crimp-duchess-malfi-almeida-three-sisters-national-inua-ellams\" title=\"\">Cyrano de Bergerac</a></em> (2019) thrilled me by showing how the theatre is changing. Drawing on the lessons of such groundbreaking productions as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/25/phyllida-lloyd-director-all-female-shakespeare-trilogy-mama-mia-iron-lady\" title=\"\">Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s all-female Shakespeare</a>, it showed how starved the stage has been by assuming the default position for a commanding actor is white, male, tall with an RP accent. Ticking to the vibrant sound of beatboxing, the only thing wrong with Martin Crimp\u2019s adaptation was sticking to a title that suggested plumes and big boots. It should have been called \u201cTo Cyr, With Love\u201d. <strong>SC</strong></p> <p><strong>As You Like It</strong><br>The show that lit up the theatre for me a child was <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/apr/27/vanessa-redgrave-rosalind-as-you-like-it\" title=\"\">As You Like It</a></em> in 1961, with Vanessa Redgrave as Rosalind. She overflowed with feeling: every syllable seemed to argue with the next. She also wore a very interesting cap. I was fascinated by the sardonic Jaques, played by slinking Max Adrian, and I loved the shepherds making eyes at each other. I couldn\u2019t follow everything, but the drama seemed to promise such an intriguing world, of jokes and romance and sneering. <strong>SC</strong></p> <p><strong>Denise Gough</strong><br>When I admired but failed to recognise Denise Gough as she shimmered in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/21/red-velvet-all-fall-desire-elms\" title=\"\">Desire under the Elms</a> </em>(2012), I realised she was one of those unusual actors who vanish entirely into each role. I\u2019ve had a similar experience recently with the endlessly transforming Luke Thallon. Other fine actors \u2013 Fisayo Akinade, Patsy Ferran, Carey Mulligan, Thalissa Teixeira \u2013 have jolted me differently, carrying a distinctive glimmer from part to part. Seeing them early in their stage lives, trying to define what they are up to, has been one of the best bits of my job. <strong>SC</strong></p> <p><strong>Wielopole, Wielopole (Tadeusz Kantor)<br></strong>If one production could be said to have shaped my understanding of performance as a kaleidoscope of patternings, re-formed by every presentation we attend, then the Polish director Tadeusz Kantor\u2019s 1980 <em>Wielopole, Wielopole</em> was that production. To me, Kantor\u2019s work revealed the poetry of time and space expressed through movement and text. Like the teachings of Jacques Lecoq, it opened my heart to the infinite possibilities of performance: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanayckbourn\" title=\"\">Alan Ayckbourn</a>\u2019s precise comedies, the anarchic wildness of Catalan company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/08/spanish-theatre-troupe-la-fura-dels-baus-naumon\" title=\"\">La Fura dels Baus</a>, and everything around and between. <strong>Clare Brennan</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Film</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c076a27567a05b688edec8e0f152c9fcd98b1792\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c076a27567a05b688edec8e0f152c9fcd98b1792/0_195_3262_1957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, directed by Guillermo del Toro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The greatest art is created by those following their own instincts\u2019: Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, directed by Guillermo del Toro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Pan\u2019s Labyrinth</strong><br>Described by Mexican writer/director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/guillermodeltoro\" title=\"\">Guillermo del Toro</a> as the \u201csister picture\u201d to <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbe4PnIFqQ\" title=\"\">The Devil\u2019s Backbone</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/05/features.review1\" title=\"\">Pan\u2019s Labyrinth</a>/El laberinto del </em><em>fauno</em> (2006) is the film that brought together my love of monster movies, fairy tales and political dramas. Set in the aftermath of the Spanish civil war, it juggles two worlds, each as \u201creal\u201d as the other. Having followed del Toro\u2019s career since <em>Cronos </em>(1993), through the traumas of <em>Mimic</em> (1997) and the success of <em>Hellboy</em> (2004) this proved once again that the greatest art is created by those following their own instincts, without compromise.<strong> Mark Kermode</strong><br><br><strong>Dougal and the Blue Cat</strong><br>Originally released in France in 1970 as <em>Pollux et le Chat Bleu</em>, this <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1409841,.html\" title=\"\">Magic Roundabout</a></em> feature was redubbed by Eric Thompson and Fenella Fielding for the English-speaking market in 1972. In the days before video, listening to the soundtrack LP of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/28/fenella-fielding-dougal-blue-cat-magic-roundabout\" title=\"\">Dougal and the Blue Cat</a></em> (which featured music <em>and</em> dialogue) was the closest I got to rewatching a film at home. Playing it over and over again would conjure images of the film\u2019s weird Caligari-esque visuals, teaching me that we can watch movies with our ears.<strong> MK</strong></p> <p><strong>Second Coming</strong><br>A reminder that the most exciting films are often the ones you know little about in advance. I saw debbie tucker green\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/07/second-coming-mark-kermode-review\" title=\"\">Second Coming</a></em> (2015) at the end of two long days of screenings, and its blend of social realism and dreamlike religious analogy snapped me out of a soporific haze. From it, I learnt not pick my \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/mark-kermode-film-of-the-week\" title=\"\">film of the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/mark-kermode-film-of-the-week\" title=\"\">week</a>\u201d until I\u2019d seen everything on offer \u2013 and to go into every screening with the awareness that what I\u2019m about to see <em>might</em> just be a masterpiece.<strong> MK</strong><br><br><strong>Raw</strong><br>French film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/30/raw-director-julia-ducournau-cannibalism-is-part-of-humanity\" title=\"\">Julia Ducournau</a> told me that when she was very young, her parents left her in a room with a TV on which she managed to find and watch <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre\" title=\"\">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a></em>. Having grown up on horror movies, and lived through the \u201cvideo nasties\u201d panic about the corrupting influence of the genre, it was wonderful to find a modern auteur who cited a traumatic encounter with horror as a formative creative experience. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/09/raw-julia-ducournau-cannibal-fantasy-review-kermode\" title=\"\">Raw/Grave</a></em> (2017) is a thrillingly confident debut feature, buzzing with subversive energy.<strong> MK<br></strong><br><strong>The Ghost That Never Returns</strong><br>With Neil Brand and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/04/glastonbury-silent-cinema-dodge-brothers-beggars-of-life\" title=\"\">Dodge Brothers</a>, I have spent many years providing live, improvised musical accompaniment to silent films. Neil found this dizzying 1930 Soviet oddity, directed by Abram Room, which opens in a panopticon prison, moves to hallucinatory desert scenes, and finishes with a revolutionary call to arms. The strangeness of the narrative is accentuated by the fact that key scenes seem to be missing from surviving prints. Neil showed us how to fill the gaps, demonstrating the narrative power of music \u2013 using it to help the story make sense.<strong> MK</strong></p> <p><strong>Caravaggio </strong><br>Taped from the television on a VHS cassette which warped from repeated viewings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/derek-jarman\" title=\"\">Derek Jarman</a>\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1434768,00.html\" title=\"\">Caravaggio</a></em> (1986) was a game-changer for me. As a teenager with an interest in cinema but, at that point, rather rigid ideas about what movies were allowed to do, watching it was thrilling and unsettling. Transgressive, iconoclastic, seductive: Jarman\u2019s approach tore up the rules to period drama. It shaped my tastes and is one of the reasons that, even now, the cinema that excites me most is the cinema that pushes me out of my comfort zone. <strong>Wendy Ide</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fa953fe3b325917777e79d5d84e34f6df8971fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fa953fe3b325917777e79d5d84e34f6df8971fa/0_75_2760_1658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Brooks, Holly Hunter and William Hurt in Broadcast News (1987).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Brooks, Holly Hunter and William Hurt in Broadcast News (1987).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Broadcast News<br></strong>\u201cNews producer loves, also cries,\u201d so goes my five-word plot summary of the 1987 romantic comedy <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/jul/29/the-hour-broadcast-news-bbc\" title=\"\">Broadcast News</a></em>. I don\u2019t believe you have to see yourself represented to connect with a character, and certainly a brown girl growing up in suburban Birmingham doesn\u2019t appear to have much in common with an overachieving southern belle played by Holly Hunter. Brilliant, fearsome and prone to emotional outbursts, Jane Craig is a pragmatist, driven by her ethics and dogged by her insecurities. Before the days of op-eds about aspirational yet relatable on-screen heroines, she was mine. <strong>Simran Hans</strong></p> <p><strong>Three Colours Red</strong><br>When I was 11, we went on a family cinema trip to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/09/three-colours-red-review\" title=\"\">the third film</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/krzysztof-kieslowski\" title=\"\">Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski</a>\u2019s trilogy of human connection and communication. It was an alien form, but I was captivated: from the extraordinary, whooshing opening shot following a phone call across the Channel, it was the first film to make me consider what the camera could really do and why. I went home and attempted to put down in words what I\u2019d seen, starting a film review diary that never really stopped. <strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>Art</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b742ddbfa5ed66dc8252c459541184f016d0f2bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b742ddbfa5ed66dc8252c459541184f016d0f2bf/0_0_4162_4736/879.jpg\" alt=\"Las Meninas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.\" width=\"879\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Las Meninas by Vel\u00e1zquez.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Classic Image/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Las Meninas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez</strong><br>Flashing up before you is the mirror-bright vision of a little princess, her servants and the artist himself, gathered in a pool of sunlight at the bottom of a great volume of shadow that instantly sets the tenor of the scene. You know instantly these beautiful children will die, are already dead in fact, yet they live in the here and now of this moment, bright as fireflies \u2013 and what keeps them here, and alive, the artist implies, is not just his 1656 painting, but you. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/03/velazquez-vanishing-man-laura-cumming-john-snare\">It means more to me</a> than any other painting. <strong>Laura Cumming</strong></p> <p><strong>Eva Hesse<br></strong>I had scarcely seen anything by American artist<a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/eva-hesse-1280\"> Eva Hesse</a> before Tate Modern\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/nov/17/1\">2002 retrospective</a>. I\u2019ll never forget the intense beauty, wit and tragicomic force of these paradoxically fragile works, made of little more than beeswax or string. Hesse could create a whole crowd of characters, like this, out of slips of paper. Her work was almost as ephemeral as the artist, who died aged 34 in 1970. Nothing looked like this before, and the fact that so much has since speaks to her extraordinary influence over contemporary sculpture.<strong> LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Self-Portrait by Albrecht D\u00fcrer</strong><br>Someone gave me a postcard of <a href=\"https://www.pinakothek.de/en/modules/module-image-text-marginal/1052\">D\u00fcrer\u2019s 1500 self-portrait</a> as a child. It was the first time I realised that art had such power to move. So immediate yet so remote, the hair a glowing triangle, the face transfixing yet closed; I found it/ him stunning, but also frightening. It is exponentially more overwhelming in reality, with its unearthly radiance, symmetry and perfection. This painting inspired me to write <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/05/laura-cumming-praise-of-self-portraits\" title=\"\">a book on self-portraiture</a>, of which it is exhibit A \u2013 amazingly frontal, Christ-like, epochal, the first great closeup. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>The Visitors by Ragnar Kjartansson<br></strong>Contemporary art absorbs elements of every other art form \u2013 poetry, theatre, cinema, music.

Shot in one take, in a crumbling mansion in upstate New York in 2012, each screen shows a solitary musician performing in a separate room. You can see them, but they are invisible to each other, unwittingly contributing to an overwhelmingly beautiful multi-part elegy for the artist\u2019s failed marriage. Shakespeare in Woodstock; it changed my idea of what art film could be. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Four Mandarin Oranges by \u00c9douard Manet<br></strong>If I had money, I\u2019d travel anywhere to see a Manet. They all come out of such deep looking and living. I saw this little canvas (from 1882) in a show of his still lifes in 2001 \u2013 lemons, asparagus, the flower paintings made when he was dying \u2013 and my exhilaration was completely primitive. I just wanted to be inside the pictures.

It hadn\u2019t occurred to me that opera could reflect the human condition so probingly, or hauntingly. I fell for the music, its codes and cyphers and hidden tunes, and I fell for opera.<strong> Fiona Maddocks</strong></p> <p><strong>The Trout</strong><br>Apart from being there and doing it, nothing has conveyed the excitement of music-making like this 1969 film of the young, gifted Daniel Barenboim, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/from-the-archive-blog/2015/dec/01/jacqueline-du-pre-daniel-barenboim-interview-1969\" title=\"\">Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9</a> and friends (all famous in their own right) giddily performing Schubert\u2019s Trout Quintet. I saw it first as a child. I\u2019ve watched it, mesmerised, countless times since. Christopher Nupen, a pioneer in independent TV film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2015/may/27/schubert-the-trout-watch-a-clip-from-1969-documentary-barenboim-dupre-allegro-films\">caught a precious moment</a>. It became history, made all the more poignant by Du Pr\u00e9\u2019s, not to mention Schubert\u2019s, tragic demise. The joy remains indelible. <strong>FM</strong></p> <p><strong>Brahms\u2019s First Symphony</strong><br>Many works, more radical or off-centre, hooked me early: Stravinsky; Bart\u00f3k and Britten; the revelations of the conductor-composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/10/pierre-boulez-appreciation-nicholas-kenyon-agent-provocateur\">Pierre Boulez</a>. But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8o9ngx8Syw\">this symphony</a> made me realise for the first time how it\u2019s not the tunes but something deeper, more abstract and emotional, that speaks to the heart. As a teenager, I bought a secondhand LP, not knowing Brahms but because I liked the moody colours on the cover. The second movement, especially, I played over and over. It felt like my own discovery.<strong> FM</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_three\">BBC Radio 3</a><br></strong>It\u2019s guided me, exposed me to the unfamiliar, explained and informed and, yes, entertained, since as early as I can remember. It used to sound stuffy: old-style announcers. That\u2019s gone. Maybe it\u2019s too gushing at times, but better to enthuse than lecture. The emphasis on live music, still hanging on by a thread as the BBC teeters, gives it a vitality, energy, community: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/proms\">Proms</a>, orchestras, concerts. It\u2019s committed to experiment more than repetition. I\u2019m glad at the success of Classic FM and Scala Radio, but Radio 3 remains the gold standard.<strong> FM</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Television</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eeae5358b209f0b0693ee17f1b834dbeb8556ab4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeae5358b209f0b0693ee17f1b834dbeb8556ab4/0_182_1392_1391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geraldine Somerville, Robbie Coltrane and Robert Carlyle in Cracker, 1994.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geraldine Somerville, Robbie Coltrane and Robert Carlyle in Cracker, 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Cracker</strong><br>In one 1994 episode, entitled To Be a Somebody (Part II), Robert Carlyle, shaven-head scary as embittered Hillsborough survivor Albie Kinsella, stabs DCI Bilborough (Christopher Eccleston).

Best of all <a href=\"http://hastingschronicle.net/features/the-hastings-net-shops/\" title=\"\">are the huts</a> erected on the shingle for storing and drying fishing nets, tarred black to resist the weather. They are built tall, like a mini-Manhattan, for lack of space. Their pitched roofs look domestic, but their shortage of windows makes them enigmatic and faintly menacing.

Yes, too, the promise to build \u201ca high line\u201d has now become a gimmick of more-or-less cynical city-boosters around the world. But the original idea, of turning an old railway viaduct into a park like none other, remains brilliant. The execution \u2013 with the selective retention of old metal, semi-wild planting, and occasional moments of theatre \u2013 is not bad either. <strong>RM</strong></p> <p><strong>Dominus Winery, California</strong><br>When I first came across the Swiss architects <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/15/herzog-de-meuron-interview-tate-modern-switch-house-extension\" title=\"\">Herzog and De Meuron</a>, in an exhibition at the long-defunct 9H Gallery in the 1980s, I loved their ability to be conceptual and physical at once \u2013 to have ideas and to bring them to life through building materials. Their <a href=\"http://www.dominusestate.com/\" title=\"\">Dominus winery</a> in Napa Valley is a long, low shed whose wrapping of rough stones calms the heat, filters the light and bonds the building to its terrain.

Not just to look at, but also for the ways it plays with your senses: the temperature of the air, the modulation of light, the scent of plants, the sound of water. It is bodily as well as visual, not just a building, but a landscape and garden too. Although it is hardly a secret, and is plainly in Europe, it somehow doesn\u2019t feature in official histories of \u201cEuropean\u201d architecture; as if this perfect summation of the power of architecture was somehow an exotic diversion. <strong>RM</strong></p> <p><strong>Architecture: SESC Pomp\u00e9ia, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil</strong><br>Brazilian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/sep/09/lina-bo-bardi-together-review\" title=\"\">Lina Bo Bardi</a> (1914-92) was almost the perfect architect \u2013 her work is inventive and daring, rooted in the experiences and lives of those who use it.

From age four onwards, I wore them out. Dancing to the Beatles made me feel reckless. It was a kind of proto-lust: not for the men making the music, but for the music itself. Now I am aware of the context, the rhythm and blues records the Beatles ripped off. Twist and Shout (1963) is actually a cover.

In the early 1990s, I wasn\u2019t cool or knowledgable enough to have anything but a vague handle on the big two: Kool and Rinse FM. I just knew that every night you could twirl the dial and hear the distorted blare of happy hardcore, jungle and associated genres, sounds that turned into garage and grime. You rarely knew what you were listening to, but you knew teenagers were scaling tower blocks a mile away to hang an aerial and it all sounded mind-blowingly necessary and in real time.

The gig she played at Brixton Academy in 2016 involved two women \u2013 Grimes and her friend, the electronic artist Hana \u2013 bounding around the stage orchestrating an industrial rave disguised as pop. Grimes herself alternated between joy and menace and anxiety. That night was a win: it seemed that one aspect of the riot grrrl manifesto had been ticked off the to-do list.

But as pure sound, this is immense: minimalist techno, produced as ambient dub reggae, through a fizzing, crackling, broken processor, a Waldorf 4-Pole filter which that Betke accidentally dropped. It\u2019s just sublime, a hydraulic termite rave. KE * * * Theatre Shockheaded Peter Shockheaded Peter in 2001 made me rip up my ideas about what a show could be. This punk musical punched through distinctions. Puppets and humans jostled together. The stories were grisly, but their effects were beautiful: when a child burned to death, the fire was evoked in a whirl of flame-coloured petticoats. The music \u2013 a creamy falsetto, a jaunty accordion \u2013 soared and attacked. I saw this during my first year at the Observer; I still think of it as one of my best ever nights in the stalls. Susannah Clapp Escaped Alone As I watched Escaped Alone in 2016, I realised how central Caryl Churchill\u2019s plays are to my idea of what makes a vital theatre: urgent subjects; provoking form; intensity of speech. Inconsequential chat is interspersed with soliloquies in which catastrophe is dazzlingly imagined. Domesticity is a breath away from dystopia. As surely as any of the site-specific performances which have been another major excitement of my years as a critic, Churchill\u2019s work has transported and immersed me. SC Cyrano de Bergerac Jamie Lloyd\u2019s electric remaking of Cyrano de Bergerac (2019) thrilled me by showing how the theatre is changing. Drawing on the lessons of such groundbreaking productions as Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s all-female Shakespeare, it showed how starved the stage has been by assuming the default position for a commanding actor is white, male, tall with an RP accent. Ticking to the vibrant sound of beatboxing, the only thing wrong with Martin Crimp\u2019s adaptation was sticking to a title that suggested plumes and big boots. It should have been called \u201cTo Cyr, With Love\u201d. SC As You Like It The show that lit up the theatre for me a child was As You Like It in 1961, with Vanessa Redgrave as Rosalind. She overflowed with feeling: every syllable seemed to argue with the next. She also wore a very interesting cap. I was fascinated by the sardonic Jaques, played by slinking Max Adrian, and I loved the shepherds making eyes at each other. I couldn\u2019t follow everything, but the drama seemed to promise such an intriguing world, of jokes and romance and sneering. SC Denise Gough When I admired but failed to recognise Denise Gough as she shimmered in Desire under the Elms (2012), I realised she was one of those unusual actors who vanish entirely into each role. I\u2019ve had a similar experience recently with the endlessly transforming Luke Thallon. Other fine actors \u2013 Fisayo Akinade, Patsy Ferran, Carey Mulligan, Thalissa Teixeira \u2013 have jolted me differently, carrying a distinctive glimmer from part to part. Seeing them early in their stage lives, trying to define what they are up to, has been one of the best bits of my job. SC Wielopole, Wielopole (Tadeusz Kantor) If one production could be said to have shaped my understanding of performance as a kaleidoscope of patternings, re-formed by every presentation we attend, then the Polish director Tadeusz Kantor\u2019s 1980 Wielopole, Wielopole was that production. To me, Kantor\u2019s work revealed the poetry of time and space expressed through movement and text. Like the teachings of Jacques Lecoq, it opened my heart to the infinite possibilities of performance: Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s precise comedies, the anarchic wildness of Catalan company La Fura dels Baus, and everything around and between. Clare Brennan * * * Film Pan\u2019s Labyrinth Described by Mexican writer/director Guillermo del Toro as the \u201csister picture\u201d to The Devil\u2019s Backbone, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth/El laberinto del fauno (2006) is the film that brought together my love of monster movies, fairy tales and political dramas. Set in the aftermath of the Spanish civil war, it juggles two worlds, each as \u201creal\u201d as the other. Having followed del Toro\u2019s career since Cronos (1993), through the traumas of Mimic (1997) and the success of Hellboy (2004) this proved once again that the greatest art is created by those following their own instincts, without compromise. Mark Kermode Dougal and the Blue Cat Originally released in France in 1970 as Pollux et le Chat Bleu, this Magic Roundabout feature was redubbed by Eric Thompson and Fenella Fielding for the English-speaking market in 1972. In the days before video, listening to the soundtrack LP of Dougal and the Blue Cat (which featured music and dialogue) was the closest I got to rewatching a film at home. Playing it over and over again would conjure images of the film\u2019s weird Caligari-esque visuals, teaching me that we can watch movies with our ears. MK Second Coming A reminder that the most exciting films are often the ones you know little about in advance. I saw debbie tucker green\u2019s Second Coming (2015) at the end of two long days of screenings, and its blend of social realism and dreamlike religious analogy snapped me out of a soporific haze. From it, I learnt not pick my \u201cfilm of the week\u201d until I\u2019d seen everything on offer \u2013 and to go into every screening with the awareness that what I\u2019m about to see might just be a masterpiece. MK Raw French film-maker Julia Ducournau told me that when she was very young, her parents left her in a room with a TV on which she managed to find and watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Having grown up on horror movies, and lived through the \u201cvideo nasties\u201d panic about the corrupting influence of the genre, it was wonderful to find a modern auteur who cited a traumatic encounter with horror as a formative creative experience. Raw/Grave (2017) is a thrillingly confident debut feature, buzzing with subversive energy. MK The Ghost That Never Returns With Neil Brand and the Dodge Brothers, I have spent many years providing live, improvised musical accompaniment to silent films. Neil found this dizzying 1930 Soviet oddity, directed by Abram Room, which opens in a panopticon prison, moves to hallucinatory desert scenes, and finishes with a revolutionary call to arms. The strangeness of the narrative is accentuated by the fact that key scenes seem to be missing from surviving prints. Neil showed us how to fill the gaps, demonstrating the narrative power of music \u2013 using it to help the story make sense. MK Caravaggio Taped from the television on a VHS cassette which warped from repeated viewings, Derek Jarman\u2019s Caravaggio (1986) was a game-changer for me. As a teenager with an interest in cinema but, at that point, rather rigid ideas about what movies were allowed to do, watching it was thrilling and unsettling. Transgressive, iconoclastic, seductive: Jarman\u2019s approach tore up the rules to period drama. It shaped my tastes and is one of the reasons that, even now, the cinema that excites me most is the cinema that pushes me out of my comfort zone. Wendy Ide Broadcast News \u201cNews producer loves, also cries,\u201d so goes my five-word plot summary of the 1987 romantic comedy Broadcast News. I don\u2019t believe you have to see yourself represented to connect with a character, and certainly a brown girl growing up in suburban Birmingham doesn\u2019t appear to have much in common with an overachieving southern belle played by Holly Hunter. Brilliant, fearsome and prone to emotional outbursts, Jane Craig is a pragmatist, driven by her ethics and dogged by her insecurities. Before the days of op-eds about aspirational yet relatable on-screen heroines, she was mine. Simran Hans Three Colours Red When I was 11, we went on a family cinema trip to see the third film in Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski\u2019s trilogy of human connection and communication. It was an alien form, but I was captivated: from the extraordinary, whooshing opening shot following a phone call across the Channel, it was the first film to make me consider what the camera could really do and why. I went home and attempted to put down in words what I\u2019d seen, starting a film review diary that never really stopped. Guy Lodge * * * Art Las Meninas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez Flashing up before you is the mirror-bright vision of a little princess, her servants and the artist himself, gathered in a pool of sunlight at the bottom of a great volume of shadow that instantly sets the tenor of the scene. You know instantly these beautiful children will die, are already dead in fact, yet they live in the here and now of this moment, bright as fireflies \u2013 and what keeps them here, and alive, the artist implies, is not just his 1656 painting, but you. It means more to me than any other painting. Laura Cumming Eva Hesse I had scarcely seen anything by American artist Eva Hesse before Tate Modern\u2019s 2002 retrospective. I\u2019ll never forget the intense beauty, wit and tragicomic force of these paradoxically fragile works, made of little more than beeswax or string. Hesse could create a whole crowd of characters, like this, out of slips of paper. Her work was almost as ephemeral as the artist, who died aged 34 in 1970. Nothing looked like this before, and the fact that so much has since speaks to her extraordinary influence over contemporary sculpture. LC Self-Portrait by Albrecht D\u00fcrer Someone gave me a postcard of D\u00fcrer\u2019s 1500 self-portrait as a child. It was the first time I realised that art had such power to move. So immediate yet so remote, the hair a glowing triangle, the face transfixing yet closed; I found it/ him stunning, but also frightening. It is exponentially more overwhelming in reality, with its unearthly radiance, symmetry and perfection. This painting inspired me to write a book on self-portraiture, of which it is exhibit A \u2013 amazingly frontal, Christ-like, epochal, the first great closeup. LC The Visitors by Ragnar Kjartansson Contemporary art absorbs elements of every other art form \u2013 poetry, theatre, cinema, music. And they are all united in Ragnar Kjartansson\u2019s magnificent nine-screen installation, The Visitors. Shot in one take, in a crumbling mansion in upstate New York in 2012, each screen shows a solitary musician performing in a separate room. You can see them, but they are invisible to each other, unwittingly contributing to an overwhelmingly beautiful multi-part elegy for the artist\u2019s failed marriage. Shakespeare in Woodstock; it changed my idea of what art film could be. LC Four Mandarin Oranges by \u00c9douard Manet If I had money, I\u2019d travel anywhere to see a Manet. They all come out of such deep looking and living. I saw this little canvas (from 1882) in a show of his still lifes in 2001 \u2013 lemons, asparagus, the flower paintings made when he was dying \u2013 and my exhilaration was completely primitive. I just wanted to be inside the pictures. One aim of criticism is to sustain that feeling, without any loss, while trying to express it in far more considered terms. LC * * * Photography Love on the Left Bank This book, first published in 1954, is a groundbreaking merging of fiction and reality, documentary and staged narrative that was way ahead of its time. Everything about the book \u2013 the images, the text, the characters, the setting \u2013 drew me in when I first picked it up decades later. Photographer Ed Van der Elsken brilliantly evokes the spirit of a short-lived Parisian demimonde where intellectualism and bohemianism went hand in hand. At its centre is cult icon, Vali Myers, as the semi-fictional Anne, her style - kohl-rimmed eyes, big hair and baggy polo necks - defining the beatnik sublime as she moves through the St. Germain night, trailed by a passing cast of beautiful outsiders. \u201cI report on young, rebellious scum with pleasure,\u201d he once remarked. This photo-book, more than any exhibitions of this work I have seen, brilliantly evokes that profane punk spirit.Sean O\u2019Hagan * * * Classical music Wozzeck by Alban Berg All my early listening \u2013 and playing \u2013 was chamber and orchestral music. I didn\u2019t encounter much opera (outside the complete works of Gilbert and Sullivan) until later. An enlightened music teacher took me to Wozzeck (1925), Alban Berg\u2019s tragedy about one soldier\u2019s humiliation at the hands of his seniors. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me that opera could reflect the human condition so probingly, or hauntingly. I fell for the music, its codes and cyphers and hidden tunes, and I fell for opera. Fiona Maddocks The Trout Apart from being there and doing it, nothing has conveyed the excitement of music-making like this 1969 film of the young, gifted Daniel Barenboim, Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 and friends (all famous in their own right) giddily performing Schubert\u2019s Trout Quintet. I saw it first as a child. I\u2019ve watched it, mesmerised, countless times since. Christopher Nupen, a pioneer in independent TV film, caught a precious moment. It became history, made all the more poignant by Du Pr\u00e9\u2019s, not to mention Schubert\u2019s, tragic demise. The joy remains indelible. FM Brahms\u2019s First Symphony Many works, more radical or off-centre, hooked me early: Stravinsky; Bart\u00f3k and Britten; the revelations of the conductor-composer Pierre Boulez. But this symphony made me realise for the first time how it\u2019s not the tunes but something deeper, more abstract and emotional, that speaks to the heart. As a teenager, I bought a secondhand LP, not knowing Brahms but because I liked the moody colours on the cover. The second movement, especially, I played over and over. It felt like my own discovery. FM BBC Radio 3 It\u2019s guided me, exposed me to the unfamiliar, explained and informed and, yes, entertained, since as early as I can remember. It used to sound stuffy: old-style announcers. That\u2019s gone. Maybe it\u2019s too gushing at times, but better to enthuse than lecture. The emphasis on live music, still hanging on by a thread as the BBC teeters, gives it a vitality, energy, community: Proms, orchestras, concerts. It\u2019s committed to experiment more than repetition. I\u2019m glad at the success of Classic FM and Scala Radio, but Radio 3 remains the gold standard. FM * * * Television Cracker In one 1994 episode, entitled To Be a Somebody (Part II), Robert Carlyle, shaven-head scary as embittered Hillsborough survivor Albie Kinsella, stabs DCI Bilborough (Christopher Eccleston). It was shocking not only for the violence, but for the programme\u2019s audacity in killing off a seriously major character early. It affected me inordinately: years later, when I interviewed (with difficulty) Robbie Coltrane, it turned out the episode had the same effect on him. That eruptive, defensive, vulnerable you\u2019re-not-me tribalism still has me jarred. Euan Ferguson The Bridge Scandi noir may technically have begun four years earlier in 2011 with The Killing, but Saga Nor\u00e9n, with her quixotic unempathy and that unlovely mud-green Porsche, ripped Sarah Lund\u2019s sweaters to shreds. We\u2019ve had so much of value since that plots the story not of a crime but of the effect on any community, and I wish in hindsight that 70s and early 80s television, of which much was by-numbers cop TV or dreck period drama, had given hints of some people\u2019s personal psychoses or mental health problems. TV such as The Bridge has taught us (well, me) so much about empathy. EF Brass Eye: Paedogeddon Satire isn\u2019t dead, even though the fat bluebottles are circling. Along with Black Mirror and The Thick of It, this 2001 episode gleefully shocked, not least in the range of voices who rushed to condemn, from every side of politics, without having even watched the show. As a TV critic, I\u2019m astonishingly happy to be celebrating a revivified form of art. TV is on a new up, and will be until we\u2019ll have seen everything, everywhere, for all time, and might as well just die. But until then\u2026 watch the bloody telly, and never, ever, condemn an artistic endeavour without having experienced it. Brass Eye inspires in me, to this day, a hatred of unthinking, kneejerk populism. EF Black Books This show (2000-04) was, I think, the bridge to modern comedy, supremely aided around that time by The Office, Father Ted and various sharp snarky Americans. But with Black Books, Dylan Moran and Bill Bailey gave me back my sense of humour at a truly difficult time. For anyone just back from reporting on the war in Iraq and juggling lovely girlfriends and fighting alcoholism, Dylan\u2019s inspired refettling of a cellarful of fine wines was, is still, a hook around the neck back to reality. EF * * * Radio and podcasts Annie Nightingale I grew up listening to Radio 1: Stewpot\u2019s Junior Choice on Saturday mornings, the Hairy Cornflake (Dave Lee Travis) on weekday breakfasts, Steve Wright in the Afternoon\u2026 But it wasn\u2019t until I heard Annie Nightingale on Sunday evenings after the chart rundown that I understood what music radio could be. Nightingale had a broader music taste than, say, John Peel, but was alternative enough to introduce me to songs I never would otherwise have heard. She\u2019s still on Radio 1 now, at the very Nightingale time of 2am. She still plays tracks I hate, tracks I love. She\u2019s still the best. Miranda Sawyer Podcast: Have You Heard George\u2019s Podcast? I\u2019d been reviewing podcasts for around a decade when last year I came across George \u201cthe Poet\u201d Mpanga\u2019s first series. It was so revolutionary, in its daring mix of music, real life, fiction, acting, poetry and conversation, that I was genuinely astonished. Podcasting had already settled into a limited selection of formats, but George ignored those and turned it into something else: a gripping experimental journey through the intimacies of his mind and the realities of his social situation. His show assumes listeners are clever and interested enough to join his journey. Brilliant. MS Victoria Derbyshire, 2011 Podcasting has revitalised audio in the last few years, but radio is the medium we turn to in times of trouble. The radio phone-in is where you\u2019ll hear politics argued out, personal problems aired, worries shared\u2026 There are many phone-in shows that can make you stop what you\u2019re doing and just listen \u2013 James O\u2019Brien, Eddie Mair, Emma Barnett, Iain Lee \u2013 but I will never forget this utterly riveting call to Victoria Derbyshire\u2019s old show on 5 live. Rachel, a doctor and an active alcoholic about to check into rehab, called the show to explain what it was like to be in the grips of this terrible disease. She remained a friend of the show and appeared on it several times until her death, aged 45, in 2014. MS * * * Architecture Net shops, Hastings I grew up near Hastings, a wondrous nursery of architectural oddities \u2013 its disaster-prone pier, an apartment block said to be modelled on the Queen Mary, funicular railways with Norman-style turrets. Best of all are the huts erected on the shingle for storing and drying fishing nets, tarred black to resist the weather. They are built tall, like a mini-Manhattan, for lack of space. Their pitched roofs look domestic, but their shortage of windows makes them enigmatic and faintly menacing. There\u2019s a lesson in there about form following function, which may have been lost on my young brain. Rowan Moore The High Line, New York Yes, the High Line is now an urban Mona Lisa, an attraction so overwhelmed with visitors as to defeat the point of going there. Yes, too, the promise to build \u201ca high line\u201d has now become a gimmick of more-or-less cynical city-boosters around the world. But the original idea, of turning an old railway viaduct into a park like none other, remains brilliant. The execution \u2013 with the selective retention of old metal, semi-wild planting, and occasional moments of theatre \u2013 is not bad either. RM Dominus Winery, California When I first came across the Swiss architects Herzog and De Meuron, in an exhibition at the long-defunct 9H Gallery in the 1980s, I loved their ability to be conceptual and physical at once \u2013 to have ideas and to bring them to life through building materials. Their Dominus winery in Napa Valley is a long, low shed whose wrapping of rough stones calms the heat, filters the light and bonds the building to its terrain. As a way of housing an ancient activity in the New World, it\u2019s hard to beat. RM The Alhambra, Granada, Spain The Alhambra, which I first visited at the end of my first year at architecture school, is just plain heart-stoppingly beautiful. Not just to look at, but also for the ways it plays with your senses: the temperature of the air, the modulation of light, the scent of plants, the sound of water. It is bodily as well as visual, not just a building, but a landscape and garden too. Although it is hardly a secret, and is plainly in Europe, it somehow doesn\u2019t feature in official histories of \u201cEuropean\u201d architecture; as if this perfect summation of the power of architecture was somehow an exotic diversion. RM Architecture: SESC Pomp\u00e9ia, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Brazilian Lina Bo Bardi (1914-92) was almost the perfect architect \u2013 her work is inventive and daring, rooted in the experiences and lives of those who use it. SESC Pomp\u00e9ia, a cultural, sports and social centre, is partly a subtle renovation of an old factory, partly unsubtle new build: three concrete towers linked by exhilarating bridges. It is a proud celebration of the communities it serves. RM * * * Games The Last Guardian Japanese director Fumito Ueda\u2019s trio of works \u2013 2001\u2019s Ico, 2005\u2019s Shadow of the Colossus and 2016\u2019s The Last Guardian \u2013 share similarities both aesthetic and thematic: a determined child protagonist, an ancient, forsaken ruin, a textless plot, a sidekick who must be both protected and relied upon. In The Last Guardian, your collaborator is a towering, abused creature who must be whistled and cajoled into position to act variously as stepping stone and transport as you work to escape a lonely castle. Unlike many other directors, Ueda is not in thrall to Hollywood, which has freed him to explore and develop his chosen medium\u2019s unique narrative qualities \u2013 perhaps more successfully than any other. Simon Parkin Tetris That a puzzle game as faultless as Tetris (1984) should have been designed in a Soviet laboratory feels like a kind of grand cosmic contrivance. Still, like a hypnotic virus, Alexey Pajitnov\u2019s perfect game spread from the streets of Moscow into the world and, as the years passed, across each new wave of technological platforms. Like many, I first played the game when I was given a Game Boy for Christmas. More than three decades later, Tetris\u2019s pristine lustre is completely undiminished. It is a game whose design feels as eternal as the Pyramids, as unimprovable as the wheel. SP Rez Video games evolved in the world\u2019s amusement arcades, where financial imperatives led makers to design games orientated around taut tests of dexterity, reaction and high-score competition. This sport-like heritage underpins 2001\u2019s Rez, but, as your character flies into the screen, shooting down futuristic foes, director Tetsuya Mizuguchi elevates the shoot-\u2019em-up into a multi-sensory, artful experience. Each shot fired is punctuated by a quantized drumbeat, drawing the player into the role of trance musical accompanist. As you fly over wireframe landscapes, to a crescendo of soundtrack, the effect is not only beguiling, but transcendent. SP * * * Dance The Rite of Spring The Rite of Spring premiered in 1913, to outrage and riots. With its spiky, rritualistic movements, dread-filled undertow of sexual violence, folk influences and compulsive repetition, it shattered the elegant conventions of classical ballet. I saw it as a teenager on a late-night drama documentary about the Ballets Russes, and it was like nothing I\u2019d seen before. Choreographed by Nijinsky, scored by Stravinsky, produced by the Ballets Russes, it exists in fragments, memories and reconstructions. It\u2019s inspired many other choreographers, including Pina Bausch, Christopher Hampson and Yang Liping, and has fed into newer works like DV8\u2019s disturbing mid-90s riff on macho behaviour, Enter Achilles. Bidisha Jerome Robbins\u2019 Dances at a Gathering As a ballet-crazed child, my first visit to see the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden was in 1970, for a performance of Jerome Robbins\u2019 magical, breezy dances to Chopin\u2019s piano pieces, performed by a cast that included Rudolf Nureyev. My father had been determined that I would see my idol and bought great seats. We got lost en route because we\u2019d never been to London before. I cried at the end and the die was cast; I have loved ballet for ever. Sarah Crompton Nureyev and Fonteyn in Romeo and Juliet Seeing them on film convinced me that classical ballet could deliver just as much edge as more recent forms. Many critics found the fiery Russian wunderkind and the steely British star duetting as a middle-aged pair of supposed teenaged lovers from ancient Verona to be pathetic, but I disagree. Their chemistry and love for one another as dance collaborators shines out, and each moment sizzles with their history together. Bidisha In the Middle Somewhat Elevated Created for the wunderkinder of Nureyev\u2019s Paris Opera Ballet \u2013 the great Sylvie Guillem among them \u2013 William Forsythe\u2019s deconstruction of classical ballet in 1987 has a casual insolence and a shattering brilliance that works like an electric shock. It made ballet look modern and relevant at a time when it seemed fusty and tired. It is still thrilling today. SC Vogue by Madonna I did ballet and modern at school and got dragged to Giselle and Swan Lake. But my really galvanising experiences with dance were through film. There were the three Fs: Flashdance, Fame and Footloose. There were classic dance movies like The Red Shoes. There was MTV. Then there was Madonna\u2019s Vogue (1990, directed by David Fincher), choreographed by the great Karole Armitage: a whipping, euphoric, defiant thunderbolt in which movement and message are totally fused. It made me want to punch through the MTV screen and join La Madgesty on stage. Bidisha",

Precisely, and this is why a similar approach is needed to confront the climate emergency \u2013 and why rightwing governments will fail to do so unless they adopt a leftwing approach that does not prioritise market and profit and instead sees the merits of massive state intervention. And the coronavirus crisis rather pointedly undermines Philip Cerny\u2019s remark that the nation state cannot have a key role in this (\u201cMy solution to the climate crisis\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/letters-give-boris-johnson-his-moment-for-now\" title=\"\">Letters</a>). What we are learning now is the importance, yes, of individual responsibility and local initiatives but also of decisive governmental action to enforce the suspension of business as usual, and of international cooperation.

Precisely, and this is why a similar approach is needed to confront the climate emergency \u2013 and why rightwing governments will fail to do so unless they adopt a leftwing approach that does not prioritise market and profit and instead sees the merits of massive state intervention. And the coronavirus crisis rather pointedly undermines Philip Cerny\u2019s remark that the nation state cannot have a key role in this (\u201cMy solution to the climate crisis\u201d, Letters). What we are learning now is the importance, yes, of individual responsibility and local initiatives but also of decisive governmental action to enforce the suspension of business as usual, and of international cooperation.

I\u2019ve seen patients in their 30s really sick with the heart complications you get with Covid-19, and fit and well patients in their 40s and 50s who are very sick. People are kidding themselves if they think they\u2019re safe. So it was weird, before the lockdown, seeing the streets completely packed.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>Still seeing people on my way to work ignoring the lockdown blew my mind. The big challenge with managing Covid-19 patients is that it\u2019s not obvious when they\u2019re deteriorating. That\u2019s heartbreaking. Patients seem blissfully unaware they may be about to die. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>I have the day off, which I spend reading guidance on the disease and listening to a podcast for non-intensive-care doctors about how to, for example, manage a ventilator. I want to be good at my job in the months ahead and aware of every possible challenge I am likely to encounter.</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p>Back at work. I have asthma, and my personal protective equipment is just a plastic gown, a pair of gloves and a surgical mask. It\u2019s pretty alarming going in to see a patient who\u2019s coughing their lungs out, and all you\u2019ve got is a piece of paper over your mouth. But Public Health England says that\u2019s all I need. I have got to trust that recommendation, and I do.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p>I arrive at work for a night shift. More than 10 people with Covid-19 symptoms are waiting for beds. They all have an oxygen requirement. It gets busy but we remain in control throughout. I have confidence in our ability to manage this. My advice to people is: cherish the moments you have with your family. Because if you die from this, you die alone.<br></p> <p><br></p>",

I\u2019ve seen patients in their 30s really sick with the heart complications you get with Covid-19, and fit and well patients in their 40s and 50s who are very sick. People are kidding themselves if they think they\u2019re safe. So it was weird, before the lockdown, seeing the streets completely packed. Tuesday Still seeing people on my way to work ignoring the lockdown blew my mind. The big challenge with managing Covid-19 patients is that it\u2019s not obvious when they\u2019re deteriorating. That\u2019s heartbreaking. Patients seem blissfully unaware they may be about to die. Wednesday I have the day off, which I spend reading guidance on the disease and listening to a podcast for non-intensive-care doctors about how to, for example, manage a ventilator. I want to be good at my job in the months ahead and aware of every possible challenge I am likely to encounter. Thursday Back at work. I have asthma, and my personal protective equipment is just a plastic gown, a pair of gloves and a surgical mask. It\u2019s pretty alarming going in to see a patient who\u2019s coughing their lungs out, and all you\u2019ve got is a piece of paper over your mouth. But Public Health England says that\u2019s all I need. I have got to trust that recommendation, and I do. Friday I arrive at work for a night shift. More than 10 people with Covid-19 symptoms are waiting for beds. They all have an oxygen requirement. It gets busy but we remain in control throughout. I have confidence in our ability to manage this. My advice to people is: cherish the moments you have with your family. Because if you die from this, you die alone.",

Death tolls in Italy and Spain have been especially alarming. But not every nation has suffered to the same grim extent. Some have avoided lockdowns but have still not suffered huge leaps in case numbers. Others have introduced strict monitoring and contact tracing of infected individuals and have managed to contain the disease so far. Here we look at the ways four very different nations have reacted. Japan remains one of the major international puzzles \u2013 as it has avoided the death tolls that have affected Italy and Spain \u2013 but without imposing draconian restrictions on movement or widespread testing. Hokkaido, so far the worst-affected region with 154 cases, is now lifting its state of emergency. Some officials still believe Tokyo could still be affected by a major outbreak, however. Sweden reacted very differently to its Scandinavian neighbours Norway and Denmark, which imposed tight restrictions when Covid-19 first appeared in Europe. Instead Sweden closed only its high schools and colleges while keeping schools for younger children open \u2013 along with bars, restaurants and borders. Germany remains a Covid-19 outlier because of its very low mortality rate: 200 out of a total of 37,000 cases, just under 0.6%. (Spain\u2019s death rate is 7.8%; Italy\u2019s is 10.1%.)

Streaming is great, but nothing replaces this invaluable source of information, often written by the performer. * * * Theatre Susannah Clapp Favourite theatre critic I don\u2019t have a favourite per se, but I look with interest at what Ben Brantley says in the New York Times, particularly when he reviews British shows. Favourite website I don\u2019t invariably look at any, but often at Exeunt for extended pieces and adventurous argument. Favourite young theatre writer I admire Natasha Tripney in The Stage: judicious and independent. Favourite book about the theatre I often consult The Oxford Companion to Theatre and Performance by Dennis Kennedy (and reread The Swish of the Curtain by Pamela Brown and Ballet Shoes by Noel Streatfeild with nostalgic enthusiasm). Another resource Looking at paintings and architecture gees up my eyes for the stage. Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i\u2019s pictures made me see light and space completely differently. * * * Architecture Rowan Moore Favourite architecture critic Owen Hatherley is bracing in his anger, eloquent about his passions, and writes with a healthy dose of unreason, which are all good qualities in a critic. Favourite architecture website Municipal Dreams is an unending trove of knowledge and stories about housing and public works Favourite young architecture writer Otto Saumarez Smith, author of Boom Cities, a book on postwar planning, writes with balance, perception and wit. Favourite book about architecture London: the Unique City, written by Steen Eiler Rasmussen in the 1930s, describes a city that is now so distant as to be dreamlike, and is wonderful on the interaction of buildings and society. Another resource The Architecture Foundation, of which I was once director, now runs a provocative and revelatory programme of events and talks, for which I can take no credit. * * * Dance Bidisha My favourite dance critic Tobi Tobias, the stringent (some might say astringent) critic for New York Magazine. She died in February at 81 after a career that began with a feature on Twyla Tharp. Favourite dance website The Huntley Film Archives is an extraordinary resource of vintage black-and-white clips that have preserved moments of dance from the 1890s on, including Anna Pavlova dancing the Dying Swan. Favourite young voice It\u2019s a bit like the kids from Fame being transported to 21st-century London, but I like the student interviews from London Contemporary Dance School (also a venue for rising choreographers and dancers) on YouTube. Favourite book about dance It all began with Noel Streatfeild\u2019s children\u2019s classic about ambitious stage sisters, Ballet Shoes. For a heavyweight read, I love Lucy Moore\u2019s Nijinsky. And for pure inspiration, the young American star Misty Copeland\u2019s memoir Life in Motion: An Unlikely Ballerina doesn\u2019t disappoint. Another resource I love footage of contemporary dance companies in rehearsal, and am currently obsessed with the young, hugely athletic Kenny Muntanga Dance Theatre. * * * Art Laura Cumming Favourite art critic Tom Lubbock at the Independent and Arthur C Danto at The Nation: original writers, who see art as an experience both in and of life. Or I should say \u201csaw\u201d, for both are alas now dead, but I never stop reading them on the net. Favourite website The Art Newspaper \u2013 all human life is there: shows to dramatic showdowns, features, reviews, interviews, obituaries; the clue is in the word \u201cnewspaper\u201d. Favourite young art writer Alice Spawls at the London Review of Books. Favourite book about art Arthur C Danto\u2019s four volumes of criticism, especially Encounters and Reflections (though there are many others: John Berger, Anita Brookner, Robert Hughes, Rebecca Solnit, Bridget Riley). Another resource Tyler Green\u2019s The Modern Art Notes Podcast is indispensable. The wondrously eccentric Journal of Art in Society blog is stuffed with strange connections, and I\u2019m addicted to the tweets of artist Jane Hoodless, \u2013 startling images and two-sentence stories. * * * Film Mark Kermode Favourite film critic I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of Anne Billson \u2013 her knowledge of horror is up there with Kim Newman, and her BFI book on The Thing is terrific. Favourite film website The BBFC\u2019s site not only provides comprehensive information on ratings, running times and cuts, but also often hilariously deadpan consumer advice (\u201cstrong language, violence, sex, all involving puppets\u201d). Favourite film writer I first came across writer, director and vlogger Jack Howard through YouTube and Radio 1, and I\u2019ve since recorded several podcasts with him. He\u2019s sharp, funny, and very knowledgeable \u2013 and very young! Favourite book about film I was given copies of the Dilys Powell Film Reader and the CA Lejeune Film Reader when I was starting out in film criticism. Both remind me how far I still have to go. Another resource The Cinematologists podcast. Film scholars Dario Llinares and Neil Fox host a podcast and film club that bridges the gap between criticism, academia, film-making, and fandom. It\u2019s a terrifically welcome forum for informed film debate. * * * Audio Miranda Sawyer Favourite critic I always read, though don\u2019t always agree with, Gillian Reynolds of the Sunday Times (for radio) and Fiona Sturges of the Financial Times (podcasts). Favourite audio website Searching for podcasts can be tortuous, but there are a few hubs if you\u2019re stuck: Radiotopia and Gimlet for interesting, properly produced American shows and Wondery for true crime. BBC Sounds can be useful, but is still frustrating. Favourite young audio expert Matt Deegan is an audio obsessive. He runs Fun Kids Radio, works at audio consultancy Folder Media, and set up the British podcast awards with Matt Hill. He understands the ins and outs of UK radio and podcasting like no one else. Favourite book [There isn\u2019t a reference book I use, mostly because the audio landscape is changing massively at the moment. I read other journalists\u2019 collections for inspiration (Clive James, Lynn Barber) and dip in and out of the odd radio memoir: I enjoyed Eddie Mair\u2019s A Good Face for Radio and John Humphrys\u2019s A Day Like Today. Another resource Twitter is an immensely useful resource. A simple question such as \u201cWhat family podcasts are you enjoying?\u201d will give you reams of answers worth checking out Plus I follow some great audio makers such as Helen Zaltzman, Eleanor McDowell, and Cathy Fitzgerald, so I can hear about their shows and the others they\u2019re enjoying. * * * Television Euan Ferguson Favourite TV critic Alison Graham in the Radio Times: alarmingly unafraid to challenge metro sensibilities. I think of her as my Vera. Favourite TV website I use, although don\u2019t really like, Digital Spy. It\u2019s a bit silly-gossipy but handy for TX dates. Variety is good for thoughtful, informed criticism of shows coming out of the US. Favourite young TV critic Janice Forsyth\u2019s afternoon show on BBC Radio Scotland has many hugely informed young critics of both TV and films\u2026 and they get space, time and laughter to air their views. Favourite book about TV I have the entire Clive James canon behind me, funny and wise. Another resource I was given Harold Evans\u2019s Newsman\u2019s English 35 years ago, part of a lovely silver-backed series on editing and design. It urges one to be clear and concise.",

Which is where audio comes in. Podcasts, once the in-ear accompaniment to the commute and the gym workout, can liven up household chores immensely. Radio makes you feel as though you\u2019re in touch with the outside world (if you fancy that). Plus, if you actually have The Virus (I currently do), then you\u2019ll find that going up and downstairs with too much purpose requires a lie-down afterwards. Listening in bed is entirely allowed.</p> <p>A friend has found a lovely app: <strong><a href=\"http://radio.garden/visit/london-borough-of-hackney/NTTf99VW\" title=\"\">Radio Garden</a></strong>. Tap on it and you see a virtual globe with twinkling lights on it. Each light is a radio station and you can listen in. Many are, boringly, in English, French or Spanish (ah, colonialism), most play terrible international pop, but there are several that are more local and broadcast some great music. I can recommend La Voz del Chaco Paraguayo in Paraguay (around 9am our time), Radio RNA, from Madagascar, and Senegal\u2019s RTS Kolda FM92.2. Also, Radio Krokom in Sweden, if weird oompah is your thing. But the joy, really, is in the spinning of the globe and landing who knows where. It reminds me a bit of ye olde radio knob-twiddling in order to hear strange shortwave stations.

Philip Moss, about to marry the much-liked Kirsty Miller, has revealed himself to be a swine and a rotter.</p> <p>In a truly horrible scene on Tuesday, Philip, who runs a building firm, smoothly bullied his young employee Blake. Poor Blake is lying in bed, having broken his back in the explosion. It was Blake who caused it, we know, by using petrol as a solvent and turning on a grill. Now it turns out that he was using the petrol on Philip\u2019s son\u2019s advice, and he only switched on the grill because he was hungry and wanted to make toast. \u201cI hadn\u2019t eaten since lunch the day before,\u201d he said to Philip, desperately. Philip wasn\u2019t interested, insisting that Blake \u201cstick to the story\u201d \u2013 which is that it was Blake\u2019s decision to use petrol, to save cash. \u201cYes, Mr Moss,\u201d agreed Blake, sadly.</p> <p>In a somewhat unlikely plot twist, we now realise that Philip has three workers \u2013 Blake, Kenzie and Jordan \u2013 who were once on the streets. He\u2019s making them work like dogs for little money, and hardly any food. Boo! Hiss! Suddenly Philip couldn\u2019t be more of a panto villain if his surname were Green. And, yes, it\u2019s strange when contemporary slavery becomes a respite from the real world, but that is where we are. (Did I say the plot twist was somewhat unlikely? How old-fashioned of me.)</p> <p>Finally, for those of you who are working your way through old DVDs, or trying out movies you never got round to watching, may I recommend a great film podcast, <strong><a href=\"http://www.stevenbenedict.ie/\" title=\"\">Steven Benedict</a></strong>. Yes, that\u2019s both the title of the podcast and the presenter\u2019s name. Benedict, a lecturer from Ireland, has made 401 shows (he\u2019s just finished), each one only 15 minutes long and based around a classic film, from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/20/animation.conservation\" title=\"\">Wall-E</a></em> to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/30/conversation-classic-dvd-coppola-review\" title=\"\">The Conversation</a></em>. Benedict isn\u2019t a natural podcaster \u2013 his voice is a bit flat \u2013 but what he does brilliantly is focus on a single aspect of the film in question, such as walking, or equipment, or failure, or a particular historical situation. Every show reveals a new angle and makes you want to see the film straight away, even if you\u2019ve watched it a hundred times. Happy culturing, isolaters.</p> <h2>Three shows to raise a smile<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/earwolf/conan-obrien-needs-a-friend\" title=\"\">Con</a><a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/earwolf/conan-obrien-needs-a-friend\" title=\"\">an O\u2019Brien Needs a Friend</a><br>Yes, yet another \u201ccelebrity chats to a mate\u201d show.

A silky powder blush in colours for everyone</h2> <p>Blusher can be reassuring, making us look healthier and happier. Surely there\u2019s something in that. Lovers of blush are usually divided into two camps: cream and powder. I\u2019ve never really bought into the cream variety. On fair skin, it adds a youthful flush and the malleable texture means you\u2019re less able to go overboard with it. For darker skins it is a little more complicated \u2013 creams and liquids are rarely bold enough to show up. And if wearing foundation, it doesn\u2019t matter what colour you choose, it\u2019ll all turn to a brown sludge. So I prefer powder blushes. This one from KVD \u2013 a premium vegan, cruelty-free brand \u2013 is one of the best. There are six shades ranging from a nude beige to a tawny rose, with a bold orange thrown in for good measure. It\u2019s enough to suit all skin tones; no one needs a million blushers, just great colours and pigments \u2013 which this has. The texture is also impressive; it glides on like silk. It doesn\u2019t sit in pores and lines, and doesn\u2019t oxidise as the day goes on, so it\u2019s great for all skin types, including mature and oily. The things I love most, however, are that it lasts all day \u2013 hence the name \u2013 and it makes my face look happy. So, if you are looking for a small way to find pleasure in your beauty routine, this is a good place to start. <em>KVD Vegan Beauty Everlasting Blusher, \u00a322, <a href=\"http://boots.com/\">boots.com</a></em></p> <h2>On my radar: Treat your clean hands to some soothing lotion</h2> <p><strong>Soothe and smooth </strong>For a cream that acts as skincare for your hands, look no further.

Historically, women have boldly sported bright lipstick in challenging times. In 1912, Elizabeth Arden famously handed out red lipsticks to the suffragette movement and in the Second World War sent tubes of it to women serving in the military. Wearing a bold lip colour is a sign of defiance, it symbolises fearlessness and it will bring you a little comfort and joy every time you catch your reflection in the mirror. There\u2019s nothing frivolous about that. 1. Kevyn Aucoin Unforgettable Lipstick \u00a324, spacenk.com 2. Kilian Paris Le Rouge Parfum Lipstick \u00a342, harveynichols.com 3.

      "body": "<p>As you sit at position 27,308 in your online supermarket queue, think again: there are smaller businesses out there that desperately need your help. Minimal trips for essentials are the order of the day in the time of coronavirus, as are home deliveries. Many independent firms are pulling out all the stops to help shoppers at this difficult time. But they need our support as much as we need theirs.</p> <p>To stay afloat, small companies have had to shift their business models quickly in ways they would have never previously imagined, while helping their communities, including key workers and the vulnerable.</p> <p>We asked a team of experts where we should be spending our money on essentials to make a real difference all around the UK. We\u2019re also featuring businesses selling books and items for children. (Government guidance may change. Please check the current advice, as well as companies\u2019 Covid-19 policies, before you buy.)</p> <h2>Rachel Cooke</h2> <p><em>Observer food writer</em></p> <p>For bread, cakes and other good baked things, I recommend <strong>Botham\u2019s of Whitby</strong>. It has put together three care packages with no postage to pay: cupboard supplies, fresh goods or Easter treats.</p> <p>For wine, especially Italian, try <strong>Decorum Vintners</strong>, where Mark Roberts will be glad to advise. (I love the sound of Punset, a biodynamic barbaresco that he says is \u201cinsane value\u201d). For cheese, check out the <strong>East London Cheese Board</strong>, which has everything from Cornish Kern to Vacherin Mont d\u2019Or (also a soft Scottish cheese called\u2026 wait for it\u2026 Minger).<br><br>Should you be about to run out of soap with all that hand washing, <strong>RE-foundobjects</strong> of Corbridge in Northumberland has bars from Aleppo in Syria made from green argan oil and donkey milk. <strong>Gosh! Comics</strong> in London is still delivering, so support a brilliant independent while catching up on my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/comics+profile/rachelcooke\">graphic novel of the month</a>.</p> <h2>Funmi Fetto</h2> <p><em>Observer beauty director</em></p> <p>Support small brands like <strong>Pai</strong> and <strong>Oskia</strong>. They\u2019re donating hand products, including sanitisers and creams, to NHS hospitals and care homes.

The majority of the brands it supports are start-ups without lots of stockists or huge backing. And don\u2019t forget <strong>Beauty Banks</strong>, which help people who can\u2019t afford hygiene essentials. They are always glad of donations, either in the form of money or products.</p> <h2>Sat Bains</h2> <p><em>Chef/patron, Restaurant Sat Bains</em></p> <p>My local hero is Jonathan from <strong>The Fruit Basket</strong>, West Bridgford, in Nottinghamshire. He\u2019s delivering to the whole community, keeps replenishing through the day, makes sure no one is hoarding and insists the two-metre rule is strictly kept.</p> <h2>Romy Gill</h2> <p><em>Chef, author of Zaika: Vegan Recipes from India</em></p> <p><strong>Jess\u2019s Ladies Organic</strong> in Gloucestershire is going flat out to help meet the local demand for milk, cream, yoghurt, buttermilk and kefir. <strong>Hobbs House Bakery</strong> of Bristol is open and letting in only two people at a time, as well as supplying farm shops and service stations. It is also selling bread-making kits with flour so that customers can try their hand at home.</p> <h2>Jay Rayner</h2> <p><em>Observer restaurant critic</em><br><br>All food businesses have had to look at the way they work in the lockdown, and many are finding ways to support those battling the emergency. Healthy fast food chain <strong>Leon</strong> is keeping branches open and serving meals to NHS workers at a 50% discount.</p> <p>In London, Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant <strong>A Wong</strong> is providing meals for the vulnerable through its local church, but is also inviting orders to help support its work (e-mail <a href=\"mailto:wong@awong.co.uk\">wong@awong.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>In Bristol, <strong>Tapestry Brewery</strong> (<a href=\"http://tapestrybrewery.com/\">tapestrybrewery.com</a>) has moved to delivery of beer and pizza with 50% off for NHS workers. In Manchester, <strong>Cloudwater Brewery</strong> (<a href=\"http://cloudwaterbrew.co/\">cloudwaterbrew.co</a>) is inviting NHS workers to register with its online store via their NHS email to get an automatic 25% discount on orders. These are just a few examples. Check in with your local restaurants or cafes to see what they are doing.</p> <h2>Pete Brown</h2> <p><em>Beer and cider writer, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/27/pie-fidelity-by-pete-brown-review\">Pie Fidelity: In Defence of British Food</a></em></p> <p>Beer is not an essential but taprooms and microbreweries are really struggling now. Check what your local is doing first, and support them.</p> <p><strong>Rooster\u2019s in Harrogate</strong> is doing a take-home taproom for \u00a335, which includes 15 cans and some great bar snacks. <strong>Signature Brew </strong>in London is doing a pub in a box, including a music quiz and playlists to accompany the beers.</p> <p>Local cheesemakers should not be forgotten \u2013 their cheeses aren\u2019t usually stocked by the supermarkets and tend to rely on events and the hospitality trade.

One thought while taking exercise is to walk in the vicinity of your local shop and buy a few supplies to take home, which serves to support the smaller business whose futures are challenged.</p> <p><strong>Leila\u2019s Shop</strong> in Shoreditch, east London is a wonderful, community-minded grocery doing all it can to deliver to those unable to leave their homes. For an astonishing array of vinegars, oils, pulses, grains, flour, spices and herbs, the delivery-only <strong>Vinegar Shed</strong> website is a great option.<br><br><strong>Cabrito Goat Meat</strong> is a good choice to bring variety into a household unable to shop, and the <strong>Blackface Meat Company</strong> in Dumfries has an excellent delivery service. <strong>Natoora</strong> is doing online sales for fruit and vegetable delivery, and <strong>Flourish Produce</strong> is arranging delivery to east London sites for customers to pick up.</p> <h2>Nadia Shireen</h2> <p><em>Children\u2019s writer and illustrator</em></p> <p>If you need something new for your child to read on lockdown, <strong>Round Table Books</strong> in Brixton Market is a brilliant, inclusive bookshop for kids, now putting its stock online.</p> <p><strong>Book-ish</strong> in Crickhowell, in the Brecon Beacons, is doing a fantastic job of delivering books, music and DVDs all around the country. It\u2019s absolutely at the heart of its community, and given that the town suffered terrible floods in February, it\u2019s worth championing. It also has a great selection of kids\u2019 games and jigsaws to help parents stuck at home.</p> <h2>Sasha Wilkins</h2> <p><em>LibertyLondonGirl on Instagram, food blogger, author of Food, Friends, Family</em></p> <p>In big cities, support your local Turkish, Somali or halal corner shops, many of which are still well stocked.

      "bodyText": "As you sit at position 27,308 in your online supermarket queue, think again: there are smaller businesses out there that desperately need your help. Minimal trips for essentials are the order of the day in the time of coronavirus, as are home deliveries. Many independent firms are pulling out all the stops to help shoppers at this difficult time. But they need our support as much as we need theirs. To stay afloat, small companies have had to shift their business models quickly in ways they would have never previously imagined, while helping their communities, including key workers and the vulnerable. We asked a team of experts where we should be spending our money on essentials to make a real difference all around the UK. We\u2019re also featuring businesses selling books and items for children. (Government guidance may change. Please check the current advice, as well as companies\u2019 Covid-19 policies, before you buy.) Rachel Cooke Observer food writer For bread, cakes and other good baked things, I recommend Botham\u2019s of Whitby. It has put together three care packages with no postage to pay: cupboard supplies, fresh goods or Easter treats. For wine, especially Italian, try Decorum Vintners, where Mark Roberts will be glad to advise. (I love the sound of Punset, a biodynamic barbaresco that he says is \u201cinsane value\u201d). For cheese, check out the East London Cheese Board, which has everything from Cornish Kern to Vacherin Mont d\u2019Or (also a soft Scottish cheese called\u2026 wait for it\u2026 Minger). Should you be about to run out of soap with all that hand washing, RE-foundobjects of Corbridge in Northumberland has bars from Aleppo in Syria made from green argan oil and donkey milk. Gosh! Comics in London is still delivering, so support a brilliant independent while catching up on my graphic novel of the month. Funmi Fetto Observer beauty director Support small brands like Pai and Oskia. They\u2019re donating hand products, including sanitisers and creams, to NHS hospitals and care homes. Or The Soap Co., a social enterprise that employs disadvantaged and disabled workers. Antidote Street sells afro and curly hair products online (most of their staff either work remotely already, or are now). The majority of the brands it supports are start-ups without lots of stockists or huge backing. And don\u2019t forget Beauty Banks, which help people who can\u2019t afford hygiene essentials. They are always glad of donations, either in the form of money or products. Sat Bains Chef/patron, Restaurant Sat Bains My local hero is Jonathan from The Fruit Basket, West Bridgford, in Nottinghamshire. He\u2019s delivering to the whole community, keeps replenishing through the day, makes sure no one is hoarding and insists the two-metre rule is strictly kept. Romy Gill Chef, author of Zaika: Vegan Recipes from India Jess\u2019s Ladies Organic in Gloucestershire is going flat out to help meet the local demand for milk, cream, yoghurt, buttermilk and kefir. Hobbs House Bakery of Bristol is open and letting in only two people at a time, as well as supplying farm shops and service stations. It is also selling bread-making kits with flour so that customers can try their hand at home. Jay Rayner Observer restaurant critic All food businesses have had to look at the way they work in the lockdown, and many are finding ways to support those battling the emergency. Healthy fast food chain Leon is keeping branches open and serving meals to NHS workers at a 50% discount. In London, Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant A Wong is providing meals for the vulnerable through its local church, but is also inviting orders to help support its work (e-mail wong@awong.co.uk). In Bristol, Tapestry Brewery (tapestrybrewery.com) has moved to delivery of beer and pizza with 50% off for NHS workers. In Manchester, Cloudwater Brewery (cloudwaterbrew.co) is inviting NHS workers to register with its online store via their NHS email to get an automatic 25% discount on orders. These are just a few examples. Check in with your local restaurants or cafes to see what they are doing. Pete Brown Beer and cider writer, author of Pie Fidelity: In Defence of British Food Beer is not an essential but taprooms and microbreweries are really struggling now. Check what your local is doing first, and support them. Rooster\u2019s in Harrogate is doing a take-home taproom for \u00a335, which includes 15 cans and some great bar snacks. Signature Brew in London is doing a pub in a box, including a music quiz and playlists to accompany the beers. Local cheesemakers should not be forgotten \u2013 their cheeses aren\u2019t usually stocked by the supermarkets and tend to rely on events and the hospitality trade. Google \u201ccheesemaker\u201d and your county to find out who you can help. Jenny Colgan Bestselling novelist Along with other booksellers, the gorgeous Topping &amp; Company in Bath is doing deliveries, including beautiful first editions. Big Green Books in London runs #buyastrangerabook every Wednesday, as well as delivering nationwide. Jeremy Lee Scottish TV chef, proprietor at Quo Vadis Keeping a kitchen reasonably stocked while keeping people safe is a great concern. One thought while taking exercise is to walk in the vicinity of your local shop and buy a few supplies to take home, which serves to support the smaller business whose futures are challenged. Leila\u2019s Shop in Shoreditch, east London is a wonderful, community-minded grocery doing all it can to deliver to those unable to leave their homes. For an astonishing array of vinegars, oils, pulses, grains, flour, spices and herbs, the delivery-only Vinegar Shed website is a great option. Cabrito Goat Meat is a good choice to bring variety into a household unable to shop, and the Blackface Meat Company in Dumfries has an excellent delivery service. Natoora is doing online sales for fruit and vegetable delivery, and Flourish Produce is arranging delivery to east London sites for customers to pick up. Nadia Shireen Children\u2019s writer and illustrator If you need something new for your child to read on lockdown, Round Table Books in Brixton Market is a brilliant, inclusive bookshop for kids, now putting its stock online. Book-ish in Crickhowell, in the Brecon Beacons, is doing a fantastic job of delivering books, music and DVDs all around the country. It\u2019s absolutely at the heart of its community, and given that the town suffered terrible floods in February, it\u2019s worth championing. It also has a great selection of kids\u2019 games and jigsaws to help parents stuck at home. Sasha Wilkins LibertyLondonGirl on Instagram, food blogger, author of Food, Friends, Family In big cities, support your local Turkish, Somali or halal corner shops, many of which are still well stocked. Lots of trade sales companies are now supplying to the public, like Westlands UK. In Cambridge, Malloy\u2019s Craft Butchery is selling meat, dairy, bread and vegetables via contactless delivery. The award-winning cheese shop Courtyard Dairy in North Yorkshire is selling nationwide, as is Fish For Thought in Cornwall.

Wiper and True is delivering beers in several Bristol postcodes, and More Wine in Frome, Somerset, which sells bagged and canned wine to save on the carbon footprint of glass, is selling nationwide. Mevalco of Avonmouth is delivering Spanish meats, sausages, beans and pulses. Henrietta Green Food Lover\u2019s Guide To Britain editor, founder of British Charcuterie Live I\u2019m isolating, so I\u2019m doing everything I can to support food business from indoors. I\u2019m trying to collect names of all independent charcuterie producers to help them sell online, so e-mail salami@britishcharcuterie.live if that helps you.

Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy is also doing a great job getting out its cheese. Tips for a safe online delivery Do not open your door to the driver but instead make it clear when you place an order where your parcel can be safely left. Leave a tip if you can. Many drivers are on low wages and will only get statutory sick pay if they fall ill. Ideally, tip electronically online, in the app you ordered. from or over the phone, to avoid the risk of contamination via notes and coins. Wash your hands before opening goods, then dispose of packaging and wash again. If you are able to express your gratitude to your driver from a safe distance, do. Small gestures matter.",

      "body": "<p>Last week, the BBC replayed the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics. The stars of that spectacle, you will remember, were a battalion of NHS nurses from Great Ormond Street hospital, who wheeled in hundreds of beds \u2013 complete with children in stripy pyjamas \u2013 and constructed a make-believe hospital before the world\u2019s eyes. No moment at that London Games, not the grit of Mo Farah, not the grace of Jessica Ennis, provoked a more emotional surge of collective pride than that one.</p> <p>That \u201cwe can be heroes\u201d spirit has been ignited in the country again, only this time in earnest. The hospitals that now \u2013 grimly \u2013 are being created before our eyes are those repurposed exhibition halls, the new Nightingale facility in east London and those planned in Birmingham and Manchester and Cardiff. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/26/clap-for-carers-applauding-the-nhs-during-coronavirus-in-pictures\">#clapforcarers</a> moment at 8pm last Thursday saw the country emerging from behind its closed doors to applaud each and every act of compassion and bravery from those at the sharpest end of this pandemic, in a gesture of heart-swelling unity perhaps not felt since that heady sporting fortnight eight years ago.</p> <p>The prime minister has sometimes cast his rhetoric about the disease as a call to arms, but the British people have never needed war as an excuse to volunteer. This has long been a nation of collection tin shakers and Red Nose activists, of helpers for heroes and GoFundMe marathon runners. The volunteers \u2013 an extraordinary 700,000-plus and counting \u2013 who have stepped forward to provide a network of support for those 1.5 million fellow citizens most at risk prove that this determination is alive and kicking; even more courageous, perhaps, are those 7,000 former and retired doctors and nurses willing to return to intensive care.</p> <p>In recent years, it has often seemed that the splits opened by Brexit cast us into two implacable tribes. The past weeks show that there remain things about which we can nearly all agree: among them the selflessness of the NHS staff on whom we all depend, and the capacity for decency and kindness in communities up and down the land.

      "bodyText": "Last week, the BBC replayed the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics. The stars of that spectacle, you will remember, were a battalion of NHS nurses from Great Ormond Street hospital, who wheeled in hundreds of beds \u2013 complete with children in stripy pyjamas \u2013 and constructed a make-believe hospital before the world\u2019s eyes. No moment at that London Games, not the grit of Mo Farah, not the grace of Jessica Ennis, provoked a more emotional surge of collective pride than that one. That \u201cwe can be heroes\u201d spirit has been ignited in the country again, only this time in earnest. The hospitals that now \u2013 grimly \u2013 are being created before our eyes are those repurposed exhibition halls, the new Nightingale facility in east London and those planned in Birmingham and Manchester and Cardiff. The #clapforcarers moment at 8pm last Thursday saw the country emerging from behind its closed doors to applaud each and every act of compassion and bravery from those at the sharpest end of this pandemic, in a gesture of heart-swelling unity perhaps not felt since that heady sporting fortnight eight years ago. The prime minister has sometimes cast his rhetoric about the disease as a call to arms, but the British people have never needed war as an excuse to volunteer. This has long been a nation of collection tin shakers and Red Nose activists, of helpers for heroes and GoFundMe marathon runners. The volunteers \u2013 an extraordinary 700,000-plus and counting \u2013 who have stepped forward to provide a network of support for those 1.5 million fellow citizens most at risk prove that this determination is alive and kicking; even more courageous, perhaps, are those 7,000 former and retired doctors and nurses willing to return to intensive care. In recent years, it has often seemed that the splits opened by Brexit cast us into two implacable tribes. The past weeks show that there remain things about which we can nearly all agree: among them the selflessness of the NHS staff on whom we all depend, and the capacity for decency and kindness in communities up and down the land. Last week has proved, as Jo Cox so indelibly argued, that we still at heart \u201chave more in common than that which divides us\u201d. In the coming weeks, in which, as now seems horribly likely, we watch those new overflow hospitals and morgues pressed into service, that principle may be tested as never before in most of our lifetimes. Like all crises in the age of social media, this one offers constant opportunity to pick sides; to rage at lockdown transgressors and troll mercenary millionaires and yell at politicians on TV.

They are dressed with a pokey spiced olive oil, pickled scapes (the green sprouts thrown out by garlic) discs of Cape gooseberry and black sesame seeds. It tastes like southern Europe shaking hands vigorously with Asia. Some will find a dish of a warm, set custard texturally challenging. I find it intensely comforting, and love the way the topping of shiny, orange salmon roe and sea urchin jolts me every time they arrive on to my spoon.</p> <p>We are brought some brilliant red kimchi made from cabbage and a funkier version involving cucumber. There is a bowl of tiny, pungent, crisped anchovies and, to cool things down, a scoop of a herb-flecked tofu. The star of the night is a generous chunk of sablefish which has been simmered and then saut\u00e9ed in sweet, dark garlic-enriched soy full of hefty caramel tones.

A pandemic of this sort would always place intolerable strain on the NHS.

There will be unnecessary and avoidable deaths as a result.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will warn every household in Britain that the coronavirus outbreak is likely to worsen and that he is prepared to tighten the nation\u2019s lockdown, after the UK suffered the biggest daily increase in its death toll. The country\u2019s 30 million households will receive a letter from the prime minister cautioning them that the worst is still ahead, along with details of the government\u2019s orders on social distancing, symptoms and handwashing, as ministers battle to prepare the NHS for the coming surge in cases. \u201cFrom the start, we have sought to put in the right measures at the right time,\u201d Johnson says in the letter, which will land on doorsteps this week. \u201cWe will not hesitate to go further if that is what the scientific and medical advice tells us we must do. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to level with you \u2013 we know things will get worse before they get better. But we are making the right preparations, and the more we all follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner life can return to normal \u2026 That is why, at this moment of national emergency, I urge you, please, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d The stark warning came as health chiefs reiterated that Britain will do well to keep deaths below 20,000 and warned against complacency. It follows new research from Imperial College London, which suggested Britain could suffer 5,700 deaths \u2013 far lower than previous estimates \u2013 should it follow the same path as China. \u201cNow is not the time to be complacent,\u201d warned Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England. \u201cIf we do reduce the deaths to a level which is below what we initially thought, I want to be absolutely clear, that won\u2019t be because we are somehow lucky. It will be because every citizen of this country, the British public, has complied with the instructions that the government has given based on the best scientific evidence.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has written in the Telegraph that mass testing as used in South Korea and Germany is the fastest way to end the lockdown. \u201cThe restaurants are open in South Korea. You can go shopping in Taiwan. Offices are open in Singapore,\u201d Hunt wrote. \u201cThese countries learned the hard way how to deal with a pandemic after the deadly Sars virus. They now show us how we can emerge from lockdown.\u201d Germany has carried out four times as many tests as the UK and recorded only 342 deaths from the virus. \u201cWhere you find it, you can isolate and contain it,\u201d Hunt wrote. \u201cAnd where you don\u2019t [find the virus], vital services continue to function. With mass testing, accompanied by rigorous tracing of every person a Covid-19 patient has been in touch with, you can break the chain of transmission.\u201d With the number of coronavirus cases around the world passing 600,000, it emerged that: The UK death toll increased by 260 people over the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths to 1,019 so far. It was the largest daily increase since the outbreak began and the largest day-on-day percentage increase since 18 March. Police signalled they would take robust action against acts of deliberate coughing over elderly or vulnerable people, as officers said they had been made aware of several such allegations. Spain recorded another record daily death toll of 832, though health officials said that the outbreak may be peaking in some parts of the country. Deaths in Italy rose by 889 to 10,023 people. President Trump said he was considering a two-week quarantine for New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut as the number of Covid-19 cases in those states continued to climb. Meanwhile the business secretary, Alok Sharma, insisted there were \u201cno gaps in government\u201d despite the prime minister being among several senior figures to have entered self-isolation. Officials said that Boris Johnson still had only mild symptoms, after revealing on Friday that he had contracted the virus. He was working from 11 Downing Street on Saturday and will today chair a meeting of the Covid-19 war cabinet. Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, is the latest cabinet minister to be self-isolating after he developed mild symptoms. A poll for the Observer shows the majority of the British public want even stricter measures put in place to combat the spread of the virus and believe that the government was too slow in responding to the pandemic. The latest Opinium poll suggested 57% of the public think the lockdown measures should go even further, while a third (33%) think there should be a ban placed on all public transport.

Anyone can have an idea about that but converting that into an actual deliverable program that can reach millions of people is a very complicated exercise and that is the work we are engaged in doing.</p> <p>\u201cBut the principle, I can say, is that the package would support those who have more recently been the victims of these closures that have taken place and we will be seeking to support people involved in those closures, but we will advise further details of the starting point about that.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison said the new measures would be on top of the existing coronavirus crisis package and would be announced \u201cas soon as we can\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not that far away,\u201d he said.</p> <p>ACTU boss Sally McManus, who along with Labor and the Greens <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xuz0ZL-Nj7M\">has been pushing for a government-backed wage subsidy</a>, said she was heartened by the government\u2019s new proposal.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be a very welcome announcement for all those workers who have lost their jobs or are facing losing their jobs.\u201d</p> <p>McManus also called on the wage subsidy to be backdated in circumstances where job losses had already occurred and said it needed to be applied to small as well as large enterprises, and should apply across all categories of workers, including casuals and temporary visa holders.</p> <p>Labor also welcomed the news, but said the government needed to ensure the final product kept the relationship between employer and employee and was conditional on keeping people in work.</p> <p>\u201cIf Scott Morrison, instead of ruling this out weeks ago had been working on it then, then some of the scenes we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks, we may not have,\u201d the shadow minister for industrial relations, Tony Burke, said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of people transfer from work to the welfare system. The best approach is if we can have a wage subsidy so they can keep their connection to work, so on the other side of this, we\u2019ve got an economy that is ready to go again.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the government was looking at rolling out the program through existing payment schemes, rather than build a new payments program, like the UK proposed to do.</p> <p>\u201cWe are going to do it in an Australian way,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it in a way that actually is going to be able to be delivered, using our existing systems and our existing architecture.</p> <p>\u201cJust making a broad promise without giving ourselves the capacity to deliver would not be responsible thing to do. So we are working very hard on further expanding the level of income support through businesses to enable more businesses, either to stay there or to survive through this difficult period ahead for a strong bounce back on the other side.\u201d</p> <p>Cormann gave no answers as to how that would work, other than it would be addressed through the existing welfare and tax systems.</p> <p>\u201cWell, what it means is providing significantly enhanced income support through business,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat form that will take will be announced once all of those decisions have been made.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison had previously publicly resisted calls for a government-backed wage scheme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-nsw-and-victoria-set-to-tighten-lockdowns-as-pm-says-all-states-can-pursue-own-plans\">telling a press conference on Wednesday</a> that building a new payment scheme was not the answer.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that can put at great risk the sort of resources we\u2019re trying to get to people. The best way to get help to people is through the existing payment channels, through the existing tax system arrangements,\u201d he said then.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-gets-personal-crying-in-the-streets-as-australian-jobs-vanish-and-lives-change-forever\">Coronavirus gets personal: crying in the streets as Australian jobs vanish and lives change forever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat was the lesson from the GFC. Of all the money that went out in the GFC ... the key lesson was you must use existing channels for getting money to people because that is the most effective way for that to occur.

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s forthcoming wage guarantee will include people who have already lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and is designed to keep employees connected to their employers, but on Sunday Scott Morrison gave no details on how it would work, other than that it would be in addition to measures already announced. The prime minister has so far been reluctant to install a government-backed wage guarantee, claiming it would take too long to build a new payment system, and that it would lead to inequalities in government assistance, with higher income earners receiving more. But with hundreds of thousands of people losing their jobs as more and more businesses close down, Morrison said the government was open to establishing a wage guarantee to try to keep employers\u2019 relationships with their employees. \u201cTreasury is meeting as we speak, they met yesterday and the day before that and the day before that,\u201d Morrison told reporters on Sunday. \u201cThese are not simple things to do when you\u2019re talking about rolling out programs of income of support to millions of people. Anyone can have an idea about that but converting that into an actual deliverable program that can reach millions of people is a very complicated exercise and that is the work we are engaged in doing. \u201cBut the principle, I can say, is that the package would support those who have more recently been the victims of these closures that have taken place and we will be seeking to support people involved in those closures, but we will advise further details of the starting point about that.\u201d Morrison said the new measures would be on top of the existing coronavirus crisis package and would be announced \u201cas soon as we can\u201d. \u201cIt is not that far away,\u201d he said. ACTU boss Sally McManus, who along with Labor and the Greens has been pushing for a government-backed wage subsidy, said she was heartened by the government\u2019s new proposal. \u201cThis will be a very welcome announcement for all those workers who have lost their jobs or are facing losing their jobs.\u201d McManus also called on the wage subsidy to be backdated in circumstances where job losses had already occurred and said it needed to be applied to small as well as large enterprises, and should apply across all categories of workers, including casuals and temporary visa holders. Labor also welcomed the news, but said the government needed to ensure the final product kept the relationship between employer and employee and was conditional on keeping people in work. \u201cIf Scott Morrison, instead of ruling this out weeks ago had been working on it then, then some of the scenes we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks, we may not have,\u201d the shadow minister for industrial relations, Tony Burke, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of people transfer from work to the welfare system. The best approach is if we can have a wage subsidy so they can keep their connection to work, so on the other side of this, we\u2019ve got an economy that is ready to go again.\u201d Earlier in the day, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the government was looking at rolling out the program through existing payment schemes, rather than build a new payments program, like the UK proposed to do. \u201cWe are going to do it in an Australian way,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it in a way that actually is going to be able to be delivered, using our existing systems and our existing architecture. \u201cJust making a broad promise without giving ourselves the capacity to deliver would not be responsible thing to do. So we are working very hard on further expanding the level of income support through businesses to enable more businesses, either to stay there or to survive through this difficult period ahead for a strong bounce back on the other side.\u201d Cormann gave no answers as to how that would work, other than it would be addressed through the existing welfare and tax systems. \u201cWell, what it means is providing significantly enhanced income support through business,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat form that will take will be announced once all of those decisions have been made.\u201d Morrison had previously publicly resisted calls for a government-backed wage scheme, telling a press conference on Wednesday that building a new payment scheme was not the answer. \u201cAnd that can put at great risk the sort of resources we\u2019re trying to get to people. The best way to get help to people is through the existing payment channels, through the existing tax system arrangements,\u201d he said then. \u201cThat was the lesson from the GFC. Of all the money that went out in the GFC ... the key lesson was you must use existing channels for getting money to people because that is the most effective way for that to occur. To dream up other schemes can be very dangerous.\u201d Cormann would not say what any future package would look like for people who had already lost their job. \u201cWhatever support we will provide moving forward will be provided on a way that is fair and equitable. But again, when it goes to the futures of the next announcement which is to be made in the next few days,\u201d he said. As part of its stimulus package, the government has provided payments of up to $25,000 to businesses to cover employees wages, but there was no obligation to keep employees on. As businesses continue to close, Morrison has said the Australian economy will be going into a form of suspended animation or \u201chibernation\u201d, which Cormann said was about \u201cspreading the pain\u201d. \u201cBusiness is facing a perfect storm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on helping bring down the costs, helping defer costs where that is appropriate. Working with the banks, working with state and territory governments around some of the things that we can do ourselves in our capacity as landlords for businesses in some of the properties that are owned by government. \u201cThe idea here is to spread the pain as fairly and as equitably as possible to as many business as possible to be there on the other side when we expect a very strong recovery.\u201d The states and territories are still working on a rental assistance plan, which has been on the national cabinet agenda for the past two weeks.

The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that from midnight people should stay home for two weeks, until 12 April, in a significant tightening of curbs on social and commercial life. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro insinuated that the number of coronavirus cases was being inflated for political purposes. </strong>He added: \u201cSome people will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Syria said on Friday it was banning travel between cities and governorates</strong> as part of tightening measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Syria has recorded five cases of corona virus so far but relief agencies worry that any outbreak could be lethal after years of conflict that has ravaged its healthcare system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK has again recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths.</strong> In the last 24 hours, 181 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19. It comes after 115 deaths were recorded the day before.

Northern Ireland has announced a wave of new restrictive measures which came into force an hour ago, including a ban on gatherings and leaving home without a reasonable excuse. Spain has announced further restrictions on movement to stem the flow of the virus, with all non-essential workers being told to stay home. Panama\u2019s government has said it will allow the Zaandam cruise ship to pass through the Panama Canal, after passengers got stuck on board when authorities refused to grant access. The cruise ship has 130 people with flu-like symptoms, and four have died. At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus. The coronavirus death toll in France has passed the grim milestone of 2,000 deaths, with more than 38,000 cases. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliff, the British-Iranian aid worker who has been detained in Iran on spying charges has had her prison leave extended and her case put forward for clemency, her husband said Cases in the US have passed 120,000. A letter from UK prime minister Boris Johnson will be sent to every household in Britain, warning them that the worst of the virus is yet to come. Thanks for joining me for these updates. I hope you\u2019re all staying well, wherever you\u2019re reading from. Britons stranded in New Zealand are facing costs of \u00a340,000 to return home, my colleague Mark Townsend reported. Those stranded say they have been left without guidance or assistance after the UK embassy and consular services in New Zealand abruptly closed their doors last week. Flight prices to return to the UK have hiked, with one Qatari Airlines flight from Auckland to London on 31 March priced at NZ$83,534 (\u00a340,096). Read more here: Destination of stricken cruise liner remains unclear My colleagues Erin McCormick and Patrick Greenfield report on the future of the Zaandam cruise ship, which had been stranded off the coast of Panama but has now been allowed to pass through the Panama canal. The Zaandam cruise liner might have been given permission to pass through the Panama canal but the question of where the coronavirus-stricken ship will be allowed to dock remains unclear. Holland America Line, the boat\u2019s owners, have previously said they planned to try to dock in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. But the Broward County Commissioner told the Guardian that he did not know if the cruise liner will be allowed to dock. Four people have died on board so far. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten anything,\u201d said Broward county commissioner Michael Udine, who had voiced his strong concerns about the ship coming into South Florida. \u201cThat\u2019s something that would have to go through Unified Command at the port first,\u201d referencing a group which includes the US Centers for Disease Control, the US Coast Guard and the Florida Department of Health. \u201cI\u2019m still very concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this ship arrives here, it\u2019s going to put a lot of pressure on our local health system.\u201d Panamanian officials did not confirm whether the Rotterdam, another Holland America Line that has been sent to help with the rescue operation of asymptomatic passengers, would be allowed to pass through the canal. New allegations have been made about an outsourcing firm running NHS 111 services making staff work \u201cdesk to desk\u201d, in an apparent breach of coronavirus social distancing rules. Labour has written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, with \u201curgent concerns\u201d about a call centre operated by Sitel in Plymouth. MP Luke Pollard said numerous workers at the site told him that up to 200 staff are working \u201cdesk to desk\u201d in close proximity on one floor of the building, with allegedly no deep cleaning. Pollard said he had been told people are required to go to work or risk their employment even if they are closely associated with people who are self-isolating. David Lloyd health clubs could be turned into emergency hospitals in response to the Covid-19 outbreak. According to ITV News, the chain is in talks with the government about converting a \u201chandful\u201d of its largest gyms into emergency medical facilities in an attempt to prevent the NHS becoming overwhelmed during the pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has described Trump\u2019s idea of a lockdown in the state as \u201canti-American\u201d. Earlier, Trump told reporters that he was considering imposing a quarantine in New York, and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. However, Cuomo has said that the travel ban would be \u201ccounter-productive\u201d, telling CNN: \u201cIf you started walling off areas all across the country it would be totally bizarre, counter-productive, anti-American\u201d. \u201cIt makes absolutely no sense and I don\u2019t think any serious governmental personality or professional would support it,\u201d he added. The United States now has more than 120,000 confirmed cases, the highest figure in the world, with New York the national epicentre of the virus. Panama\u2019s government has said it will allow the Zaandam cruise ship to pass through the Panama Canal. No one from the ship will be allowed to disembark in Panama, however. It comes after a stalemate, in which Panama\u2019s authorities had not given approval to let the ship pass through the canal, leaving passengers stuck on board. They are reportedly allowing the ship to pass for \u201chumanitarian reasons\u201d. The Zaandam cruise ship, currently in Panama, has 130 people with flu-like symptoms, and four have died. At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus. This will allow the ship to try and dock in Florida. My colleagues Patrick Greenfield and Erin McCormick will have more information shortly. Boris Johnson, the UK\u2019s prime minister, is set to warn British citizens that the worst of coronavirus is yet to come, and that tougher measures may be necessary. The country\u2019s 30m households will receive a letter from the prime minister including the warning, along with details of the government\u2019s orders on social distancing, symptoms and handwashing. It comes as the UK braces for a surge in coronavirus cases. Read more here: Two new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Libya. The two cases were discovered in Tripoli and Misrata, the National Centre for Disease Control said, without giving any further details. The first, confirmed on Monday, was a man who had recently returned to Libya from overseas. Libya has been embroiled in war since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and is split between two warring administrations. The conflict has wrecked the economy, fuelled migrant smuggling and militancy, and disrupted oil supplies. Due to the volatile domestic situation, international aid agencies have warned of a disaster if coronavirus spreads. Gatherings of more than two people have been banned in Northern Ireland, and anyone who can work from home must do so, authorities have announced. Authorities will have the power to enforce restriction of movement and social distancing in Northern Ireland, in a deal agreed by Stormont executive. The measures will come into force at 11pm on Saturday night, and enable authorities to hand out fines up to \u00a35,000. The regulations also give the authorities the power to close certain premises and prohibit anyone from leaving home without a reasonable excuse. Mali has recorded its first coronavirus death hours just before its election. The first patient died of coronavirus on Saturday, a day before the West African country voted in a long-delayed parliamentary election threatened by both the pandemic and security concerns. The leader of the main opposition party was kidnapped earlier in the week, with a security source saying he is \u201clikely\u201d in the hands of a jihadist group, according to Reuters. Several opposition parties on Saturday called for the vote to be postponed due to the pandemic. So far, 18 people have tested positive in Mali, with the first diagnosis on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia is indefinitely extending the suspension of international passenger flights and workplace attendance in both public and private sectors, as part of ongoing efforts to tackle the spread of coronavirus. Domestic flights, trains, buses and taxis also remain suspended, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. Airbnb has announced it will offer frontline healthcare workers free places to stay during the coronavirus outbreak. The accommodation company announced it has teamed up with the NHS to create a global programme which aims to house 100,000 frontline healthcare staff fighting the coronavirus pandemic around the world. This will include healthcare professionals, relief workers and first responders. Homeowners who list their properties through Airbnb are able to opt in to the programme and offer an entire home, with Airbnb waiving all fees for the stays. So far, nearly 1,500 places to stay have been offered in the UK. Patrick Robinson, director of public policy at Airbnb, said: The entire country is behind our heroic NHS and medical staff as they battle the coronavirus outbreak. We have made it our priority to stand with the Airbnb community to do what we can to help. By working together, we can ensure that frontline workers can find a free and convenient place to stay as they continue their critical work. We thank our doctors and nurses across the country from the bottom of our hearts and are grateful to hosts who have already opened their homes during these difficult times. The initiative builds on programmes already launched in Italy and France where Airbnb and local partners, including the French Government, announced that doctors, nurses, care-givers and other medical support staff who are responding to the outbreak in the country can access accommodation on Airbnb.

An organ transplant consultant volunteering for the NHS frontline fight against coronavirus has died from the disease, it has been reported. Dr Adil El Tayar, a working surgeon, died on Wednesday at West Middlesex University Hospital in Isleworth, west London, his family told the BBC. Dr El Tayar, 63, had volunteered to help in the A&amp;E and general department of a hospital in the Midlands, his cousin said in a report for Radio 4\u2019s From Our Own Correspondent programme. Dr El Tayar was a father of four, two of whom were NHS doctors. Two weeks ago he became unwell and did not return to work, eventually having to be taken to hospital where he died, his cousin said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran, has had her leave from prison extended by two weeks, her husband has said. Richard Ratcliffe said his wife\u2019s father had been told that her temporary release from Evin prison in Tehran will now continue until 18 April. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s father was also notified that his daughter\u2019s file had been put forward to the Iranian Prosecutor General for consideration for clemency, Richard Ratcliffe said. A crowdfunder to raise money for personal protective equipment in British hospitals has reached \u00a3400,000. The fundraising effort was launched by a group of NHS doctors and a GP to source PPE \u201cfor those who need it the most\u201d. The group originally set a \u00a3200,000 target, but this was met in 48 hours. According to the crowdfunder, actor James McAvoy made a large contribution, with the group behind the fundraiser thanking him for his \u201cextraordinary generosity\u201d. The next two weeks will be the toughest yet in the fight against coronavirus in France, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has warned. Doctors in the greater Paris region have warned their intensive care units will be full by the end of the weekend, whilst healthcare services in the east of France are already struggling to cope. \u201cWe are fighting a battle that will take time,\u201d Philippe said in a televised address. \u201cThe first two weeks of April will be harder than the two we have just lived through.\u201d The army and emergency workers were this weekend stepping up the transfer of patients to less-affected regions, using a military helicopter and a specially-adapted TGV train, in an attempt to free up intensive care beds in worst-hit areas. By Saturday, the death toll in France was 2,314, with more than 37,575 confirmed cases, according to official figures. However, the government tally only accounts for those dying in hospital, so the figure is likely to be much higher. Authorities say they will be able to compile data on deaths in retirement homes from next week, which is likely to result in an increase in the official death toll. Hundreds of passengers stuck on a cruise ship where coronavirus has spread will be transferred to another ship. The Zaandam cruise ship, currently in Panama, has 130 people with flu-like symptoms, and four have died. At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus. \u201cThe ship which could not dock at any port in South America will remain in Panamanian waters 8 nautical miles from the coast, since it did not receive approval from Panamanian health authorities to cross the (Panama) Canal,\u201d Panama\u2019s maritime authority said. It said 401 asymptomatic passengers will be transferred from cruise operator Holland America Line\u2019s 238-meter (781-foot) MS Zaandam vessel to the Rotterdam, a sister ship. There are 1,243 guests and 586 crew on board the Zaandam, as well as four doctors and four nurses, the cruise operator has said. About 70 healthy passengers on the Zaandam have already been boarded onto tenders pulled up on the port side of the ship for transfer to the Rotterdam, according to a passenger. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed the 1,000 mark in Greece after a further 95 people tested positive overnight. The country\u2019s health ministry spokesman, professor Sotiris Tsiodras, said 1,061 cases had now been recorded, up from 966 yesterday, with the vast majority in Athens. The death toll had also risen from 28 to 32 (25 are men). The average age of those who had succumbed to the virus was 73, he said. Although almost 1,000 more people had been tested for the virus in the last 24 hours, testing in Greece remains low (14,363 in total), fuelling fears that the real number of those with the novel virus is higher. Addressing reporters, Tsiodras said the country, thus far, had managed to avert \u201cthe bad scenario of the type [we have seen] in Italy.\u201d But Greek experts also insist that the coming weeks are crucial. Earlier, the minister of development and investment, Adonis Georgiadis, acknowledged that restrictive measures on movement, for several weeks among the most stringent in Europe, were likely to be extended way beyond the original end date of April 6th. Further curbs are not excluded. Tellingly, the government announced it would be cutting air links to the Netherlands in addition to severing flights to Italy, Spain, the UK and Turkey. Greeks abroad would only be repatriated if they had \u201ca serious reason\u201d to be returned to the country. \u201cWe are not implementing a general repatriation. That would be devastating for the country,\u201d the deputy minister for civil protection Nikos Hardalias also told reporters. Some 2,850 Greeks have requested to be repatriated from the UK but only pregnant women or those with health problems or who had nowhere to stay would be brought back to Greece, he said. Here\u2019s some more detail on Spain\u2019s announcement from my colleague Sam Jones in Madrid: The Spanish government has tightened up its national lockdown, ordering all non-essential workers to stay at home for the next two weeks in a bid to halt the spread of the coronavirus and relieve pressure on the country\u2019s overstretched hospitals. The measure, which comes two weeks after the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, declared a state of emergency, was announced hours after Spanish health authorities said the outbreak appeared to be peaking in parts of the country. In a televised address on Saturday evening, S\u00e1nchez ordered all those in non-key jobs to stay at home from Monday, saying the \u201cextraordinarily tough\u201d measures were needed as the county intensified its efforts to contain the pandemic. \u201cThis measure will reduce people\u2019s movement even further [but] it will reduce the risk of contagion and allow us to unblock out intensive care units,\u201d the prime minister said. S\u00e1nchez also warned that the EU needed to react to the global health crisis in a united and decisive fashion to safeguard its own future. \u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s time to act. Europe is at risk,\u201d he said. You can read the full article here: South Africa\u2019s confirmed cases of coronavirus increased at a slower rate on Saturday, up by 17 to 1,187 people, the health ministry said. The country is in its second day of a national lockdown. In a statement the Ministry of Health however stressed that the slower rate of reported infections did not indicate a reduction in the speed of the outbreak. \u201cWe must outrightly state that these numbers do not indicate a reduction in the number of infections. It is merely a reflection of positive results that were received, verified and ready for today\u2019s reporting,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Since the first positive case was reported on March 5 the rate of infections in South Africa has been exponential, rising from less than 20 two weeks ago to over 1,000, leading President Cyril Ramaphosa to announce a 21-day lockdown to slow the outbreak. Only one death has been reported in South Africa so far. Italian PM is approving new legislation to make \u20ac4.7bn available to cities in Italy affected by coronavirus, Sky News have just announced. Meanwhile, the Italian economic minister says Europe will need a package like that of the Marshall plan after the Second World War. The United Arab Emirates has extended its nightly curfew to April 5 in an attempt to combat the spread of coronavirus. It came as neighbouring Qatar reported its first death from the disease. The UAE\u2019s deep clean campaign, being implemented between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. each day, began on March 26 and had been due to end on the morning of March 29. \u201cWe are all hoping that everybody - citizens, residents and visitors - will stay at home during this period,\u201d Farida Al- Hosani, a health ministry spokeswoman, told a news conference. Qatar became the latest Gulf state to report its first virus-related death, a Bangladeshi resident. The majority of the 590 cases in Qatar are among migrant labourers, where foreigners make up most of the work force. Thanks to all those getting in touch on Twitter. I won\u2019t be able to answer all questions directly but will try and fill in any gaps in information here on the blog. If you spot something I miss, you can drop me a message @mollyblackall. Hubei province in China, where the outbreak originated, has removed all outbound traffic highway checkpoints, the Chinese media outlet Global Times reports. The city of Wuhan, where the wet market thought to have been the source of coronavirus was located, is the only exception. This signals another lifting of restrictions, as the rate of coronavirus spread in China slows. All remaining checkpoints in Wuhan will be removed on April 8. Germany conducts 500,000 tests in a week, Sky News reports. The British government is aiming to be testing 10,000 per day by tomorrow. Coronavirus is not an airborne infection. Here\u2019s a fact check from the World Health Organization: Six people in the Vatican have tested positive for coronavirus, but the Pope and his aids are not among them. Tests were done on 170 people in the Vatican and six showed positive, including one of the several dozen permanent residents of the Santa Marta guesthouse on the Vatican grounds, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement. The person who tested positive works in the Secretariat of State and is in a Rome hospital. \u201cI can confirm that neither the Holy Father nor his closest aides are among these,\u201d he said. Tests showed one other person who had been in contact with the priest also came up positive but that person did not live in the papal residence. The modern residence, which has 130 rooms and suites and a staff of about 30 people, is home to dozens of priests who work in key Vatican departments. Bruni said the entire residence, which is run like a hotel but has not been accepting temporary guests for the past few weeks, was sanitised. Francis appears to be in generally good health but part of one of his lungs was removed following an illness when he was a young man. Canada will prevent anyone with symptoms of coronavirus board domestic flights or inter-city passenger trains, prime minister Justin Trudeau has said. The measures will come into effect on Monday at noon EDT. Asked how screening would be different, Trudeau said the government was giving new tools to airlines and railways. Transport Canada later said airline and rail company staff would ask health questions of passengers and look for visible symptoms. Even enhanced screening offers \u201cno guarantee\u201d that sick people will not board, as they can hide symptoms, Howard Njoo, Canada\u2019s deputy chief public health officer, said in a separate press conference. Canada has confirmed 5,153 cases of coronavirus, and 55 deaths. You can read the full report on the developments in Italy from my colleague Lorenzo Tondo in Italy here: The 47 countries of the WHO Africa region now has 2,650 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 49 deaths, the head of the World Health Organization has said. Dr Tedros made the announcement in a tweet: Coronavirus patients in intensive care units in the UK have a 50% survival rate, a report has revealed. Data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) showed that of 165 patients treated in critical care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since the end of February, 79 died, while 86 survived and were discharged. The figures were taken from an audit of 775 people who have been or are in critical care with the disease, across 285 intensive care units. The remaining 610 patients continue to receive intensive care. You can read the rest of the article from my colleagues Denis Campbell and Toby Helm here: The death toll in France has risen to 2,314, up from 1,995 on Friday, French health authorities have said. French health authorities reported 319 new deaths from the coronavirus on Saturday, up 16% on the previous day. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in France has reached 37,575, compared to 32,964 on Friday. The daily government tally only accounts for those dying in hospital but authorities say they will be able to compile data on deaths in retirement homes from next week, which is likely to result in a big increase in registered fatalities. Ireland hopes to lift or tweak restrictive measures in a fortnight, Health Minister Simon Harris said. This will only be possible if the country can slow the rate of admissions to intensive care units, however. Ireland\u2019s prime minister ordered citizens on Friday to stay home until April 12, with people only allowed to leave to shop for groceries, for brief individual physical exercise or to make essential family visits. Ireland reported 14 deaths on Saturday, the most on a single day. The death toll has reached 36. A further 294 cases brought the number of infections to 2,415, slightly down on the 302 new cases reported on Friday. The British government has chartered three more flights to bring Britons trapped in Peru back to the UK, the British Ambassador has announced. The flights are set to leave Lima on Sunday and Monday, and are being operated by British Airways, ambassador Kate Harrisson said in a video posted on Twitter. The government are also bringing in flights from other regions to connect to those flights out of Lima, and are organising bus routes across the country which will begin tomorrow morning. To reach more remote destinations, the government is working with international partners to bring British nationals, along with other nationals, back to Lima, Europe, or the UK. Harrisson said that coronavirus cases have been confirmed in hostels where UK nationals are staying. She said consulate staff are providing those nationals with support. There are around 1,000 British nationals in Peru at the moment, Harrisson said. On Wednesday, the government brought around 200 Britons back from Peru. Trump contacted UK prime minister Boris Johnson last night, who apparently said \u201cthe UK needs ventilators\u201d as soon as Trump picked up the phone. Trump was speaking outside the US naval hospital ship Comfort, which will now head to New York to treat patients suffering from emergency conditions other than coronavirus, to free up healthcare workers and resources to treat the virus. All non-essential workers must stay home over the next two weeks, in an attempt to stem the spread of coronavirus, the Spanish prime minister has announced. They will be paid a full salary, PM Pedro Sanchez says. The measure are set to last from March 30 to April 9. The number of confirmed cases in Ireland has reached 2,415, up from 2,121 on Friday. Trump is speaking now, and confirms he is considering a quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Trump says he\u2019ll announce either way soon, but says this won\u2019t apply to truckers, and won\u2019t affect trade. He also says that four hospitals have been completed in \u201crecord time\u201d. He adds that reserves are being activated to boost healthcare supplies. Using his catchphrase, he says he has \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of new supplies in process. Iran has allocated 20% of its annual state budget to fighting the coronavirus outbreak in the country, President Hassan Rouhani said. Iran is one of the worst-hit countries in the world, with the death toll from coronavirus rising to 2,517 on Saturday. It had 139 fatalities in the past 24 hours, and cases rose by 3,076 to 35,408. \u201cWe are in difficult conditions, in conditions of sanctions but we have allocated 20% of our budget this year to corona ... and this might be surprising for the world from a country under sanctions,\u201d Rouhani told state TV. The budget allocation, amounting to about 1,000tn rials, would include grants and low-interest loans to those affected by Covid-19, Rouhani said. France has ordered 1bn face masks, mostly from China, the French health minister has said. Health Minister Olivier Veran said the country was using 40 million face masks each week, and currently has three weeks worth of supplies. Here\u2019s some more information from my colleague Lorenzo Tondo in Italy, on the announcement that the Italian death toll has now passed 10,000: The number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy has passed 10,000 while the number of total cases is now over 90,000. On Saturday, Italy announced 889 new deaths from Covid-19, as total fatalities leapt to 10,023. Another 5,974 have tested positive with coronavirus, 470 less than Friday. Some 70,065 people across the country are currently infected with Covid-19. The total number of contagions in Italy, including the deceased and those who have recovered, is 92,472. Yesterday, the country recorded its highest daily rise in Covid-19 deaths, with 969 new fatalities. On 31 March, flags will be flown at half-mast in cities across Italy to commemorate the victims of the pandemic. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, warned on Saturday that the EU could lose its purpose if it failed to come up with a strong response to the coronavirus threat and accused other member states of a timid response to an unprecedented economic shock. \u201cIf Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d\u2019\u00eatre to the people,\u201d Conte told the Il Sole 24 Ore financial newspaper. \u201cWe are at a critical point in European history,\u201d Conte added, \u201cI represent a country that is suffering a lot and I cannot afford to procrastinate.\u201d The national government is said to be considering plans to extend a country-wide lockdown to mid-April. The Higher Health Institute (ISS) said that the peak of the coronavirus epidemic in Italy was approaching. \u201cWe have seen an apparent reduction in the infection curve since 20 March but we are not yet in a downward phase,\u201d said ISS president Silvio Brusaferro. As the spread of coronavirus in Italy continues to soar, the Vatican has confirmed the Pope and his aids do not have coronavirus. The EU has granted Tunisia \u20ac250m in aid to help it cope with the economic and social effects of the coronavirus outbreak, EU ambassador Patrice Bergamini said in a tweet. Tunisia has limited healthcare infrastructure, leading to concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Currently, the country has 227 confirmed Covid-19 cases and six deaths. In Italy, 10,023 people have now died from coronavirus, after rising by 889 since Friday. The number of confirmed cases in the country increased to 92,472 from 86,498. The death toll in Turkey has risen from 16 to 108, the health minister has announced. The country now has 7,402 cases, an increase of 1,704. Cuomo said that the cost of ventilators had increased from $25,000 to $45,000 because of demand. Despite Donald Trump telling reporters earlier that there was a possibility of an enforced quarantine in New York, the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said he hadn\u2019t been told anything about this. Cuomo added that Trump had not consulted him about a quarantine, saying \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means\u201d. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that cases in the state have increased to 52,318, and the death toll has risen to 728. He warns that coronavirus efforts are a \u201cmarathon not a sprint\u201d, admitting that it feels like a \u201clifetime\u201d since schools closed just 10 days ago. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Greece has risen to 1,061. It comes after Greece confirmed 95 new cases on Saturday. So far, 32 people have died due to coronavirus in the country. This is Molly Blackall, taking over the blog for the next few hours. I\u2019ll be keeping you up to date with all of the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. If you spot anything I miss, do drop me a message on Twitter, @mollyblackall. I won\u2019t be able to reply to everything, but will try to read it all. Thanks in advance! Earlier we reported that thousands of migrant workers in India had been forced to trek back to their homes after the government shut down trains to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Here are some pictures from the sub-continent. The Covid-19 death toll in Lombardy, Italy, has risen by 542 since Friday, Reuters reports. The agency says it learned the figure, which brings the total in the region worst hit by Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak to 5,944, from a source \u201cfamiliar with the data\u201d. Official figures are not due to be published until later. The number of deaths was in line with Friday\u2019s tally of 541, which was the second highest since the outbreak began on 21 February, the agency said. The number of cases in the region increased by 2,117 to 39,415, the source said. Nationwide figures will be released at around 6pm local time (1700 GMT). The country\u2019s death toll stood at 9,134 on Friday, the highest in the world. More than 11 million people tuned in to watch Pope Francis deliver a blessing in an empty Saint Peter\u2019s Square, Lorenzo Tondo reports television bosses as saying. The pope\u2019s blessing, Urbi et Orbi - to the city and the world - is usually reserved for Christmas Day and Easter Sunday, when many thousands of people gather to hear it. Images of the cloudy sky and glistening square with the pope praying alone on a platform illuminated by the faint light of six candelabras, were beamed across the world. He said: For weeks now it has been evening. Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets and our cities. It has taken over our lives. Panama\u2019s maritime authority has shared images of a boat-to-boat rescue operation from a cruise liner with a Covid-19 outbreak on board near the entrance to the Panama canal. A small number of symptomless passengers are being moved from the Zaandam to its sister ship, the Rotterdam, after dozens of people reported flu-like symptoms and four people died. The ship was carrying 1,243 guests and 586 crew before the operation, of whom 53 guests and 85 crew have fallen ill so far. Several Latin American countries refused to let the Zaandam dock and there are fears that hundreds of ill and elderly passengers and crew members will be left stranded at sea during the global pandemic. Passengers contacted by the Guardian on Friday issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after Panama refused to let the ship pass through the canal, citing safety concerns to their staff. China has sent a plane loaded with medical personnel and supplies to Pakistan to help fight the spread of the coronavirus in one of the world\u2019s most populous countries, the Associated Press reports. The foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureishi, met the plane at Islamabad airport on Saturday and greeted the Chinese doctors and officials on board. Pakistan is a key link in Beijing\u2019s ambitious One Road project linking south and central Asia with China. Beijing is also an important military supplier the the country, which is a nuclear power, and supplied it with missiles capable of carrying atomic weapons. Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, has 1,408 confirmed cases of the virus, and has recorded 11 deaths. Most of the infected people were travellers returning from neighbouring Iran, which is in the grip of one of the worst outbreaks. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has refused to impose a countrywide lockdown, saying it would devastate the country\u2019s poor. He has, however, ordered non-essential businesses, including restaurants, money changers and wedding halls, to close. Thousands of migrant workers in India, left jobless and penniless by the full shutdown of the country, are walking long distances back to their home villages after all transport was stopped except for essential services, AFP reports. Huge numbers had crammed onto trains and buses before the country of 1.3 billion people ground to a halt for three weeks, but many others were left stranded. \u201cRather than die hungry, we decided to walk,\u201d said Dilipji Thakor, who worked at a now-shuttered shopping centre in Ahmedabad in Gujarat state, as he trudged along a road. In Italy they are singing and sharing recipes. In France humour is saving the day. In Spain communal staircases have become the new running tracks, and in Germany ordinarily disorderly hackers are busy coding corona-busting apps. As hundreds of millions of Europeans languish in lockdown, people are finding increasingly inventive ways to keep themselves entertained and counter what the continent\u2019s psychologists warning are the very real risks of confinement. The Guardian\u2019s correspondents across the continent report. The first official train to disembark passengers in Wuhan since it was put under lockdown arrived in the Chinese city on Saturday, as it began to reopen after more than two months of almost total isolation, Peter Beaumont reports. The easing of the quarantine, allowing people to enter the city of 11 million and ground zero of the global coronavirus outbreak, comes as China plans measures to kickstart its economy. Trains have been fully booked for over a week in advance. Chinese state media showed crowds of passengers arriving at Wuhan station on Saturday, many wheeling suitcases. Some people had managed to slip back into the city a day earlier on rail services that were stopping in the city, but had nominally banned passengers from disembarking. A 1,000 bed US navy hospital ship is to head to New York City to aid Covid-19 healthcare efforts in the what has become the United States\u2019 worst affected region, the Associated Press reports. The USNS Comfort was undergoing maintenance but has been pressed back into service and rushed to the city. It is expected to arrive at Manhattan pier on Monday - a week after its sister ship, the USNS Mercy arrived in Los Angeles to preform similar duty on the west coast. The ship has 12 operating rooms as well as radiology suites and a CT scanner. It also has intensive care beds, a laboratory and a pharmacy. The 1,100 or so medical staff on board are mostly active duty service members from the U.S. Navy, and some reservists, who serve on the East Coast. All migrants in Portugal will be treated as permanent residents until 1 July to ensure they have access to public services during the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports. Claudia Veloso, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, told the news agency: People should not be deprived of their rights to health and public service just because their application has not yet been processed. In these exceptional times, the rights of migrants must be guaranteed. The policy is also intended to reduce contagion risk by minimising contact between border control staff and applicants, the statement said. Portugal has reported 5,170 cases of the virus and 100 deaths, far fewer than in neighbouring Spain. Health authorities expect cases to peak at the end of May. It is not known how many people have ongoing residency applications, but government statistics show that a record 580,000 immigrants were living in Portugal in 2019 and 135,000 people were granted residency. The Department of Health said another 260 people across the UK had been reported dead in the last 24 hours, a significant one-day rise from 759 and by far the largest since the outbreak began. The latest total is 34% higher than the equivalent figure yesterday, the largest day-on-day percentage increase since 18 March, when there was a 46% jump. In England, a further 246 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths there to 935, NHS England said. \u201cPatients were aged between 33 and 100 years old and all but 13 - aged between 63 and 99 years old - had underlying health conditions,\u201d it said in a statement. A further four people died from coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total to 38, health officials have said. The country also reported 172 new confirmed cases, bringing the total to 1,093. Dr Robin Howe, the Covid-19 incident director at Public Health Wales, said the true number of cases was likely to be higher: Coronavirus is now circulating in every part of Wales. The single most important action we can all take in fighting coronavirus is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives. We know that staying at home can be hard, and we want to thank each and every person across Wales for doing their bit to help slow the spread of the virus. In Scotland, a further seven people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total there to 40, the Scottish government announced. Two further people with Covid-19 have died in Northern Ireland, taking the toll to 15, the nation\u2019s Public Health Agency said. There were also 49 new positive cases of coronavirus confirmed on Saturday, bringing the total number of known cases there to 324. Across the UK, a total of 120,776 people have been tested for coronavirus as of 9am on March 28, with 17,089 positive results. As of 5pm on Friday, of those threated in hospital in the UK, 1,019 have died. Russia will close its borders on Monday, a government order published on Saturday said. The measure will come into force at all vehicle, rail and pedestrian checkpoints, and will also apply to Russia\u2019s maritime borders. The country, which has already grounded all international flights, has reported 1,264 coronavirus cases. Russian diplomats and drivers of freight trucks, among others, will be exempt from the ban. The coronavirus outbreak may be peaking in parts of Spain, the country\u2019s health authorities said on Saturday as they announced another record single-day death toll of 832, Sam Jones reports from Madrid. The number of cases in the country rose from 64,059 on Friday to 72,248 on Saturday, and the number of dead now stands at 5,69o. Between Thursday and Friday, 769 people died from the disease. Despite the figures, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies said that the situation was improving in certain places. Fernando Sim\u00f3n told a press conference on Saturday afternoon: We don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019ll get confirmation, but we\u2019re getting close to the peak of the curve that we\u2019re studying so anxiously. In some parts of the country, they probably may even have passed it \u2013 but we need to be cautious with preliminary information ... The increase in cases is coming down in comparison with previous weeks, but it could be that there are cases that aren\u2019t being detected in some regions. But Sim\u00f3n also warned that reaching a peak would not ease the pressure on Spain\u2019s overstretched intensive care units (ICUs), adding they were predicted to pass beyond full capacity in less than a week\u2019s time. We still have a big problem when it comes to the overloading of our ICUs Patients who pick up the disease today may need a bed in an ICU in seven to 10 days. That means that we\u2019re still seeing a lag between the control of transmission and the saturation of ICUs. It also means they\u2019re going to be overloaded by the end of next week or the beginning of the following week. France\u2019s supermarkets have pledged to engage in \u201cfood patriotism\u201d to boost the country\u2019s hard-hit farmers and producers during the coronavirus crisis, Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent, reports. Fruit and vegetable growers have been severely hit by a government decree banning open air markets. Now major stores have said they will shun foreign imports in favour of national produce. The French Federation of Business and Distribution said all the country\u2019s major supermarket chains, including Carrefour, Leclerc and Intermarch\u00e9 had agreed. They are in the process of moving to French supplies. Foreign products on the shelves will be sold, but there will be no resupplying from outside France. Local prefects and mayors have been given the power to allow local markets if they are essential to farmers and shoppers and on the condition that they ensure strict distancing and health safety measures are enforced. In a message to customers, Carrefour promised that \u201c100% of our strawberries, cucumbers, and asparagus (white and violet) are from now on 100% French\u201d, adding:. To support French production, we have decided to stop the sale of fruit and vegetables from abroad where there is a French alternative available. French farmers have also put out an appeal for 200,000 volunteers to help them harvest fruit and vegetables. The sector normally relies on foreign workers for two thirds of its workforce, but with restrictions on movement and border closures, there is a shortage. The Latin American populists Jair Bolsonaro and Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador have faced intense criticism for their lackadaisical reaction to the coronavirus crisis. Critics accuse the leaders of Brazil and Mexico of playing down the risk posed by the pandemic, Tom Phillips reports from Rio de Janeiro. But L\u00f3pez Obrador, or Amlo as he is known, appears to be changing tack as the regional death toll rises. In a 14-minute \u201cmessage to the Mexican people\u201d on Friday, he declared: \u201cWe need to stay in our homes. We need to keep a healthy distance from each other. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stay inside our homes the number of infection cases could shoot up, and it would saturate our hospitals. It would be overwhelming.\u201d Bolsonaro shows no sign of a similar change in approach. He has been actively undermining efforts to keep Brazil\u2019s 210 million citizens at home in recent days. His son, supporters and the federal government have backed a campaign called Brazil Can\u2019t Stop. \u201cSome people are going to die,\u201d Bolsonaro said on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s life ... You can\u2019t shut down a car factory because people die in traffic accidents.\u201d A number of people who attended \u201clockdown parties\u201d in Belgium are now gravely ill, Daniel Boffey in Brussels reports the country\u2019s prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, as saying She announced an extension of the country\u2019s lockdown measures until 19 April and urged everyone to take the crisis more seriously. Many young people do not feel concerned. You feel invincible when you are young. Among the young people who partied in cafes a fortnight ago, there are some who are today in intensive care. Residents in Belgium are only allowed to leave their homes for exercise, essential shopping and work that cannot be done remotely. Large gatherings are banned and police have been told to be active in fining those found to be flouting the rules. A total of 353 people have died in Belgium of Covid-19 infection, including 64 in the past 24 hours. There are 3,717 patients in hospital, including 789 in intensive care. Singapore reported 70 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the health ministry said, taking the city-state\u2019s total number of infections to 802. Of the new cases, 41 were imported and 29 were local cases who had no recent history of travel abroad, the ministry said in a press release. Singapore is still carrying out extensive contact tracing of patients confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus. More than half of its confirmed cases have been in patients arriving from overseas. A little something to lighten the mood ... Outrage is growing in Kenya after police fired teargas at a crowd of ferry commuters and mobile phone footage captured officers hitting people with batons as they enforced the country\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown. Amnesty International Kenya and 19 other human rights groups said in a statement: We were horrified by excessive use of police force ahead of the curfew that began Friday night. We continue to receive testimonies from victims, eyewitnesses and video footage showing police gleefully assaulting members of the public in other parts of the country. The teargas caused hundreds of people trying to reach a ferry in the port city of Mombasa ahead of the curfew to touch their faces as they vomited, spat and wiped away tears, increasing the chance of the virus spreading, the statement said. The Associated Press reported Kenya\u2019s interior ministry on Saturday as saying in a statement that the curfew \u201cis meant to guard against an apparent threat to public health. Breaking it is not only irresponsible but also puts others in harms way.\u201d Kenya\u2019s government has not said how many people have been arrested. Six new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the West Bank, raising the total in Palestine to 97, the Wafa news agency reports. West Bank government spokesman Ibrahim Milhem said in a daily briefing on Saturday that three new cases were confirmed in Irtas, a village near Bethlehem, one in nearby Beit Iskaria, and two in villages near Jerusalem. Milhem urged Palestinians to stay at home and avoid socialising with family members. Social visits appear to have been the main cause of transmission so far. Nine of Palestine\u2019s confirmed cases are in Gaza. Officials from the Israeli civil administration in the West Bank confiscated tents on Thursday intended as a field clinic and emergency housing for Palestinians affected by the Covid-19 outbreak, the Israeli human rights organisation B\u2019Tselem reported. The group said in a statement: As the whole world battles an unprecedented and paralysing healthcare crisis, Israel\u2019s military is devoting time and resources to harassing the most vulnerable Palestinian communities in the West Bank, that Israel has attempted to drive out of the area for decades. Shutting down a first-aid community initiative during a health crisis is an especially cruel example of the regular abuse inflicted on these communities, and it goes against basic human and humanitarian principles during an emergency. There are plans in India to turn some railway coaches into isolation wards for patients with the coronavirus, as authorities prepare the country\u2019s health infrastructure for an expected surge in cases. The country\u2019s 1.3 billion people were this week ordered to stay indoors for three weeks in the world\u2019s biggest lockdown, leaving the country\u2019s trains lying idle. One train coach has been turned into a prototype quarantine facility, the state-owned Indian Railways said in a statement on Saturday. Once they receive clearance, the plan is for each of India\u2019s 16 railway zones to convert 10 coaches into such wards every week, the company added. Saudi Arabian airlines will begin exceptional commercial flights this week to bring British nationals and their families back to the UK, and similar flights are being arranged for American citizens to return home, both countries said. All international passenger flights in and out of the Arab country were suspended for two weeks starting March 14 to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus , but there is no indication normal travel will resume on Sunday. However, flights to London Heathrow will begin on Sunday from Riyadh and later in the week from Jeddah and Dammam, according to the British embassy. The US embassy said on Saturday it was working with the Saudi authorities to arrange repatriation flights on a commercial airline, but no flights had been confirmed yet. The kingdom recorded 99 new confirmed cases on Saturday, taking its total to more than 1,200 \u2013 the most in the Gulf Arab region \u2013 with four fatalities. Another 38 people have died in Switzerland from coronavirus over the past 24 hours, the health ministry has said. The Alpine country\u2019s death toll is now 235 people, and the number of cases has also increased to 13,213 from 12,161. Army medical units have been deployed at hospitals to help in crisis regions like Ticino, which borders Italy, and it is drawing upon its strategic stockpile of pharmaceuticals to cover rising demand, Reuters reported. Like other European countries, Switzerland is pumping money into its crisis-hit economy, and state-backed loans worth 20bn Swiss francs (\u00a316.9bn) became available on Thursday. Finance minister Ueli Maurer made clear on Saturday the government was happy to help with state-backed loans worth more than $20bn, but that it needed the money back and could not compensate for income losses. He told SRF radio: We are not distributing federal money, but taxpayers\u2019 money. Many of those who pay taxes are now partially unemployed, their jobs are in question, and now we take the money away from them and distribute it somewhere where there are also problems. Greeks should brace themselves for the long haul and prepare for lockdown to continue for some time yet, the country\u2019s development and investment minister warned today. In the first hint of government thinking on the issue, Adonis Georgiadis said measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus will be in place \u201cuntil scientists tell us we have beaten the virus.\u201d Restrictions on movement in Greece \u2013 already some of the most stringent in Europe \u2013 have extended to citizens being forced, with few exceptions, to remain at home. The controls have turned cities across the country into ghost towns after prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced the measures last Sunday. But Georgiadis said there was no prospect of the restrictions being relaxed by April 6 \u2013 the original cut-off date. \u201cThe measures prohibiting circulation in our country will last much longer than April 6th,\u201d he told Open TV. Officials are privately voicing fears that April will be the most difficult month yet. Transmission rates and fatalities, as a result of Covid-19, are both expected to rise even if the spread of the disease has, so far, been kept under relative control. Latest figures show the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases jumping to 966, according to the government, with 28 fatalities recorded as of Friday. But experts believe in the absence of widespread testing \u2013 only 13,477 people to date have been tested for the virus \u2013 the real number is almost certainly higher. Media reports on Saturday suggested that the centre-right government is considering enforcing even stricter measures, including a ban on all flights in and out of the country, and perhaps even clamping down further on movement. People are currently allowed to venture out of their homes for exercise, upon the condition they stay in the vicinity of their immediate neighbourhood and inform authorities beforehand. China has sent medical personnel and supplies on a plane to Pakistan to help stop the spread of coronavirus, the Pakistani foreign ministry said on Saturday. The plane carrying aid to Pakistan was met at the capital\u2019s airport on Saturday by its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureishi, who greeted the arriving Chinese doctors and officials, the Associated Press reported. China has already sent ventilators, masks and other medical equipment to the South Asian country. Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, currently has 1,408 confirmed cases of Covid-19 \u2013 including 11 deaths. It has closed its borders with both Iran and Afghanistan, but has been criticised for its initial lax response to the virus. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has refused to impose a countrywide lockdown saying it would devastate the country\u2019s poor people, but non-essential businesses have been ordered to close, including restaurants, money-changers and wedding halls. According to Pakistan\u2019s federal health authorities, the outbreak has been largely concentrated in the Punjab \u2013 which borders India \u2013 with 490 confirmed cases there, and Sindh, which has 457 confirmed infections. Other cases are spread throughout several other regions, including the capital, Islamabad. On Saturday a woman in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province became the latest person in Pakistan to die from coronavirus-related symptoms. Health authorities said the woman fell sick after returning from a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, before dying in a government hospital where she tested positive for coronavirus. A group of teenagers in the north of England who claimed to have coronavirus and deliberately coughed at NHS staff will be prosecuted, police have said. Details of the incident were released on the Facebook page of Warrington police. Sgt Hillyard of Cheshire police wrote: We have attended reports of a group of youths coughing at NHS staff stating they have coronavirus. The youths will be prosecuted as will their parental guardians. This is an absolutely abhorrent incident involving abuse of our NHS heroes. I will once again urge all parents and persons with parental responsibility to make sure that their children stay inside. You too can and will be prosecuted if you fail to keep your children inside. A man in Manchester has also been charged with assault after allegedly coughing at a police officer and claiming to have the coronavirus. Greater Manchester police said Mateusz Rejewski, 33, of no fixed abode, has been charged with one count of common assault on an emergency service worker and one count of breaching a dispersal notice. The officer is self-isolating as a precaution, and Rejewski has been remanded in custody and will appear at Manchester magistrates court on Tuesday. More than 5,000 medics from countries around Europe have appealed to governments and the EU to urgently ensure the safety of refugees and migrants in overcrowded camps on the Greek islands, where they warn of an impending medical disaster. The pandemic that threatens to overwhelm the camps will have \u201ccatastrophic consequences for the refugees, Greek inhabitants and the rest of European society,\u201d says the petition, launched last week by Dutch medical professors and public health experts. It is an illusion to think that a COVID-19 outbreak in these camps could be kept under control: 40,000 people are living on a few square kilometres, and there are only a handful of doctors present. Many children and adults are already ravaged by physical and mental traumas. If Europe looks away now, this situation could escalate to become a medical disaster, which would represent a serious violation of the norms and values of European healthcare. It is our duty to prevent this from happening. The signatories called on EU member state governments to comply with their 2016 agreement to take in a fixed number of refugees to prevent \u201ca medical disaster on European territory\u201d. The European parliament\u2019s civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee called last week for the evacuation of the 42,000 people on the Greek islands as an urgent preventive measure to avoid \u201cmany deaths\u201d. Holding facilities on all five Aegean islands opposite the Turkish coast, widely considered particularly high-risk environments for the spread of the virus, are currently six times over capacity. The first case of Covid-19 on the islands was confirmed earlier this month when a Greek woman on Lesbos, the island long on the frontline of the refugee crisis, tested positive. A doctor in Uzbekistan has died after attempting to treat a coronavirus infection that the patient had kept secret, according the country\u2019s health authorities. The 39-year-old man had been in contact with Uzbekistan\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d. The doctor was admitted to hospital in a critical condition on 26 March and died two days later. He is the second person known to have died of the coronavirus in the country, according to Reuters. Uzbekistan has 104 confirmed cases of the virus. It has locked down all of its provinces and barred citizens from leaving their homes except for work and essential shopping. Here are the latest major developments in the global coronavirus pandemic so far on Saturday. The number of confirmed cases globally has passed 600,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The true extent of infections is likely to be much greater. A sixth of those infections are in a single country, after the number of cases in the US passed 100,000, making it the worst affected country in the world, followed by Italy and China. Spain, the fourth-worst affected country, reported a record single-day rise of 832 in the number of people to die Covid-19 deaths in a single day. The country now has confirmed 72,248 infections. The ratings agency Fitch has cut Britain\u2019s sovereign debt rating to AA-, saying debt levels will jump as the government increases its spending to offset the near shutdown of the economy. Moody\u2019s downgraded South Africa\u2019s sovereign credit rating to junk status, heaping more pain on an economy already in recession and facing a further steep contraction. A global shortage of condoms is looming. The world\u2019s biggest manufacturer said coronavirus lockdowns had forced it to shut down production. Iranian doctors say hundreds of people have died after ingesting toxic methanol and thousands more have fallen ill after a rumour spread that it killed the coronavirus. Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama have issued desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board. Lockdowns around the world have triggered a rise in domestic violence. From Brazil to Germany and from Italy to China, activists say they are already seeing an alarming rise in abuse. Afghanistan has reported 15 new Coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections to 110. The figure includes four Nato soldiers and two foreign diplomats, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports. Eleven of the new cases have been confirmed in western province of Herat, raising the total number of infections in Afghanistan\u2019s worst-affected province to 76. Herat borders Iran, where the authorities have been struggling to control one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. Three cases were also reported in Farah province, which also has a border with Iran. Another was confirmed in Ghazni province, which is related to travel to Iran, health ministry said. The Afghan government has a partial curfew in place in all cities that border Iran, and a three-week curfew was also announced on Friday for Kabul, a city of around 6 million people. The curfew went into effect on Saturday morning. The Taliban announced that it had established a coronavirus treatment and isolation centre in an area of the the northern province of Kunduz it controls. Three coronavirus deaths and four recoveries have been reported across Afghanistan, but testing is limited and experts fear the true scale of outbreak is unknown. This tweet from the air traffic tracking service Flightradar24, showing the number of planes in the air on Friday evening compared to four weeks earlier, shows the remarkable impact of travel restrictions across Europe. Spain has recorded a record single-day death toll for the second day in succession after 832 people died between Friday and Saturday, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, Sam Jones. The total number of people to have lost their lives to the coronavirus now stands at 5,69o. Spain also has 72,248 confirmed cases of the virus, up from 64,059 on Friday. Between Thursday and Friday, 769 people died from the disease. The Spanish government has already extended the nationwide lockdown declared a fortnight ago to 11 April and does not rule out introducing stricter controls. Speaking to the Guardian earlier this week, Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya, said: We have done what was required at every moment and we will continue down that path. Iran has reported 139 new coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the total for the country to 2,517, Reuters reports. Kianoush Jahanpour, a health ministry spokesman, said on state TV that the total number of cases diagnosed had rised by 3,076 to 35,408, and that 3,206 people were in a critical condition. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, earlier reassured the public that the country, one of the most affected by the pandemic, has a strong healthcare system able to cope should the disease spread rapidly. In comments broadcast on state TV, he said his government had allocated 20% of the budget to fighting the outbreak. The tycoon Richard Branson is trending on Twitter after news broke that his airline, Virgin Atlantic, is applying for hundreds of millions of pounds in state aid. Twitter users, by and large, are not impressed. Branson\u2019s carrier has been hit hard by the travel bans and does not have the cash reserves of larger rivals such as British Airways or easyJet, my colleague Gwyn Topham, transport correspondent, reported yesterday. Spain has reported 832 deaths from Covid-19 since Friday, bringing the total for the country to 5,690. The health ministry also reported 8,189 new confirmed infections, bringing the total to 72,248. Spain has the second-highest Covid-19 death toll, and the fourth highest number of confirmed cases. Saudi Arabian Airlines has agreed to operate exceptional commercial flights to repatriate British nationals, Reuters reports. They will take place in the week starting 29 March from Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam to London\u2019s Heathrow airport. Additional flights will be put on if required, according to a British embassy email sent late on Friday. Authorities in Finland have restricted movement out of Uusimaa, the region that includes the capital, Helsinki, to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Restrictions came into force at midnight and are expected to remain in force until 19 April, Yle Uutiset reports. They prevent people from entering or leaving Uusimaa, except to work, return home or care for a vulnerable person. Uusimaa has most of Finland\u2019s 1,025 confirmed coronavirus cases. The Finnish parliament approved the measures unanimously on Friday night. Feeling brave? Scientists at Oxford University are recruiting volunteers to take part in the UK\u2019s first coronavirus vaccine trial. Police enforcing the coronavirus lockdown in South Africa fired rubber bullets at shoppers queuing outside a supermarket in Johannesburg, according to an Agence France-Presse photographer. The agency said about 10 police vehicles had arrived in Yeoville, a poor part of the city\u2019s central business district, where several hundred people who had gathered outside a Shoprite supermarket were failing to observe physical distancing rules. Startled shoppers trampled on each other and a woman with a baby on her back fell to the ground, the report said. Police later used whips to get the shoppers into line. South Africa, which has 1,170 confirmed coronavirus cases, recorded its first death from the virus on Friday. The country\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has ordered the population of 57 million to stay at home for 21 days, and has deployed the security forces to enforce the lockdown. The number of people on Jersey confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus has reached 52, and one person is confirmed to have died. There are 83 tests still pending and 601 people have tested negative, according to an update the island\u2019s government published on Facebook on Friday evening. For readers more interested in the latest coronavirus news from the UK, my colleague Lucy Campbell has just published our UK-focused live blog. That means I will only be taking the top UK news lines for this blog, which from now on will focus on global developments. Health officials in the Philippines reported 14 new coronavirus deaths and 272 new cases on Saturday, according to Reuters. The numbers reported represent the country\u2019s largest daily increase in deaths and infections since the outbreak began . The total number of confirmed infections in the Philippines is now 1,075, of whom 68 have died, the health ministry said. Four patients have recovered, bringing the number of recoveries to 35. In a sign of the wider impact of the crisis now enveloping the world, wildlife rescue centres around the world are struggling to treat endangered species, Gloria Dickie reports. As the coronavirus spreads from country to country, disrupting global travel and the economy, the centres are struggling to make ends meet. The Centre for Orangutan Protection in Kalimantan in Indonesia\u2019s section of Borneo has temporarily shut down to minimise the spread of the virus. Others such as Merazonia in Ecuador rely on tourism dollars to care for their animals. Since China\u2019s shutdown of Wuhan in January, visitor numbers have also plummeted at Asia\u2019s wildlife centres. Derbyshire police in the north of England made headlines this week after using a drone to shame dog walkers who had driven into the Peak District National park during the lockdown. Now, the Guardian\u2019s north of England editor Helen Pidd reports, police officers have been pouring black dye into a reservoir near Buxton known locally as \u201cthe blue lagoon\u201d to make it less appealing to swimmers. The Buxton Safer Neighbourhoods Team wrote in a Facebook past that it taken the measure after receiving reports people were congregating there: No doubt this is due to the picturesque location and the lovely weather (for once!) in Buxton. However, the location is dangerous and this type of gathering is in contravention of the current instruction of the UK government. With this in mind, we have attended the location this morning and used water dye to make the water look less appealing. This is a regular tactic that we use to reduce ASB and we work in partnership with HPBC and Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service. However, as things stand, it has never been so important to discourage these types of gatherings. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world has now passed 600,000, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. With many countries, including the UK, now only testing the most serious cases, however, the true extent of infections is likely to be much greater. According to the university\u2019s interactive map, 601,478 people had been confirmed as infected with Covid-19, and 27,862 deaths attributed to the disease. At least 131,826 people have recovered after falling ill. The US has the highest number of confirmed infections with 104,837, followed by Italy with 86,498 and China with 81,948. The lockdown implemented to curb the spread of the coronavirus is disrupting UK government plans to recruit 20,000 new police officers - a key manifesto pledge of the Conservative party at the December election. Assessment centres have been hit by sweeping closures of premises, PA Media reports. Katy Bourne, the chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), who also serves as PCC for Sussex told the agency: We began a big recruitment drive and along comes this virus. We don\u2019t want to stop that recruitment. The national call has a lot of officers who are in the pipeline who have been through the assessment centres and are still waiting to come out to forces and so on. The assessment centres nationally where you expect people to turn up to classrooms, obviously those can\u2019t function because we are all isolated, we have got to stay at home. So, it\u2019s keeping those officers warm or those potential officers warm in the system. It\u2019s really how do forces deal with the numbers that they have got. Bourne also said it was critical that police officers get the equipment they need to stay safe during the pandemic. The personal protective equipment (PPE) has been a big issue nationally. The police are out and about in the country they need protection. I know from Sussex\u2019s point of view they have managed to secure some. I know some police forces in other areas of the country have really struggled. The supplies are there but it\u2019s getting it out to those forces. After a week in which France\u2019s government has come under increasing criticism for perceived lack of transparency, the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, and the health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, are holding a press conference on Saturday to outline the situation in detail and answer questions, Kim Willsher reports from Paris. We will have the usual announcement of the daily update figures early evening. The controversial hospital professor Didier Raoult from Marseille released new research late on Friday on 80 patients conducted over six to 10 days, which apparently shows that hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin is effective in treating Covid-19 patients. Let\u2019s begin with the latest from the UK. In Wales, teachers have been urged to keep schools open for NHS staff and carers during the two-week Easter holidays, PA Media reports. The education minister, Kirsty Williams, who described school workers as national heroes for keeping more than 700 schools open during the coronavirus epidemic, said: It takes a community to raise a child and that statement has never been more true. In this time of national need, our school community has stepped up and met the challenge. More than 700 schools have stayed open to look after the children of NHS staff, carers, people who are saving lives. I am now asking you to do more and keep schools open during what would have been school holidays. It has never been more important for our children and young people to be surrounded by the people they know and trust. I am asking you to be flexible, and to offer up some time during the Easter period to continue to support both vulnerable children and the families of our critical workers. Williams also confirmed that the families of children who get free school meals would continue to be assisted during the break. She said: Wales has a strong tradition of supporting communities and I can confirm that the funding announced last week to support children in receipt of free school meals can be used to carry on providing free school meals over the Easter holiday. This will allow local authorities to continue with their local arrangements while we establish a national scheme to support children in receipt of free school meals. In devising a national scheme I will ensure that local authorities will still be able to maintain their own approaches, should they want to do so. They will have the discretion to opt into a national scheme or continue to provide flexible support if that is their preference, such as direct payments or deliveries to families who are unable to leave their homes, due to isolation requirements. I believe this will be a sustainable approach, that will enable families to budget and plan their spend according to their needs. Hello everybody, this is Damien Gayle taking the reins of the live blog from London. As usual I will be bringing you the latest coronavirus updates from our network of correspondents around the world, from the news wires and anywhere else I can find it. And as usual I will need the help of the Guardian\u2019s global readership. Please send any coronavirus news from your part of the world to me at damien.gayle@theguardian.com or via a direct message to my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. Let me know what we\u2019re missing. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan on this Saturday in what I can\u2019t believe is still March. It\u2019s been a long month. I leave you now with my colleague Damien Gayle. I\u2019ll be moving to a different room to watch an entire continent isolate itself from incoming flights. And who said self isolation wasn\u2019t fun? Here are the latest key coronavirus pandemic developments from around the world: US cases passed 100,000. Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the US coronavirus crisis pleaded on Friday for more protective gear and equipment to treat waves of patients expected to overwhelm hospitals as the number of known US infections surpassed 100,000, with more than 1,600 dead. The ratings agency Fitch has cut Britain\u2019s sovereign debt rating to AA-, saying debt levels will jump as the government ramps up its spending to offset the near shutdown of the economy in the face of coronavirus. Italy overtook China to become the second-worst affected country after the US. Italy also recorded the highest daily rise in deaths anywhere since the outbreak began, with 969 fatalities. Chinese authorities reverse planned re-openings of movie theatres. China\u2019s official media also told people to stay on guard against the coronavirus on Saturday, and restrictions on foreigners entering went into effect, as the country reported no new locally transmitted infections and a small drop in imported cases. Australia stepped up enforcement of social distancing rules on Saturday. In an attempt to contain community transmission of the novel coronavirus, states across the country implemented fines, closed beaches and threatened stricter measures if people defy pleas to stay at home. More than 100 Australian doctors and dentists returned to Australia after being stranded on a cruise ship off the coast of Chile. Moody\u2019s downgraded South Africa\u2019s sovereign credit rating to \u201cjunk\u201d status on Friday, heaping more pain on an economy already in recession and now staring down the barrel of a steep contraction over the global coronavirus pandemic. A global shortage of condoms is looming. The world\u2019s biggest producer or condoms warned of a global shortage after a coronavirus lockdown forced it to shut down production. Iranian doctors say \u2018hundreds\u2019 have died after ingesting toxic methanol. An Iranian doctor said hundreds have died and thousands have been sickened from ingesting toxic methanol across the Islamic Republic out of the false belief it kills the new coronavirus. Passengers on cruise ship stranded off Panama coast issue desperate plea. Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board. Argentina saw a record jump in cases. Despite the full national lockdown declared on March 20, the country reached 690 cases and 17 deaths so far, with 101 new cases and five deaths reported Friday. The capital city of Buenos Aires is the worst hit, with 223 cases, followed by the province of Buenos Aires with 193. South Korea reports highest new cases in a week. South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States during recent days. Lockdowns around the world bring rise in domestic violence. Women and children who live with domestic violence have no escape from their abusers during quarantine, and from Brazil to Germany, Italy to China, activists and survivors say they are already seeing an alarming rise in abuse. A shorter summary is available here: The NHS could have prevented \u201cchaos and panic\u201d had the system not been left \u201cwholly unprepared for this pandemic\u201d, the editor of a British medical journal has said. Numerous warnings were issued but these were not heeded, Richard Horton wrote in The Lancet. He cited an example from his journal on 20 January, pointing to a global epidemic: \u201cPreparedness plans should be readied for deployment at short notice, including securing supply chains of pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, hospital supplies and the necessary human resources to deal with the consequences of a global outbreak of this magnitude.\u201d Dr Horton wrote that the government\u2019s Contain-Delay-Mitigate-Research plan had failed. \u201cIt failed, in part, because ministers didn\u2019t follow WHO\u2019s advice to \u2018test, test, test\u2019 every suspected case. They didn\u2019t isolate and quarantine. They didn\u2019t contact trace. \u201cThese basic principles of public health and infectious disease control were ignored, for reasons that remain opaque. \u201cThe result has been chaos and panic across the NHS.\u201d Dr Horton\u2019s warning came as the UK saw its biggest day-on-day rise in deaths since the Covid-19 outbreak began, while Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock said they had tested positive for the virus and frontline testing of NHS workers was set to begin. The ratings agency Fitch has cut Britain\u2019s sovereign debt rating to AA-, saying debt levels will jump as the government ramps up its spending to offset the near shutdown of the economy in the face of coronavirus. Fitch downgraded the country by one notch to the same level as its rating for Belgium and the Czech Republic. It said a further cut could follow as it kept the rating on negative outlook. \u201cThe downgrade reflects a significant weakening of the UK\u2019s public finances caused by the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and a fiscal loosening stance that was instigated before the scale of the crisis became apparent,\u201d Fitch said. \u201cThe downgrade also reflects the deep near-term damage to the UK economy caused by the coronavirus outbreak and the lingering uncertainty regarding the post-Brexit UK-EU trade relationship.\u201d Fitch said the coronavirus shutdown was likely to shrink Britain\u2019s economy by nearly 4% in 2020, assuming the drastic containment measures could be relaxed in the second half of the year, leading to a 3% bounce in growth in 2021. But doubts about Britain\u2019s future trading ties with the European Union posed a further risk, Fitch said. Here\u2019s the wrap of coronavirus pandemic news from the last few hours: The US has become the first country to exceed 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as Donald Trump signed into law the largest economic stimulus package in US history, a $2.2tn bill designed to rush federal assistance to workers and businesses. The number of confirmed US cases rose by 15,000 on Friday, fewer than the 16,000 reported on Thursday. By Friday night there were more than 6,000 hospitalised Covid-19 patients in New York with almost 1,600 in intensive care while the state had logged 519 deaths, the most in the US, and more than 44,000 infections. Hospitals in New York City, New Orleans, Detroit and other virus hotspots have sounded the alarm about scarcities of drugs, medical supplies and trained staff. In California a navy hospital ship, the Mercy, has docked at the Port of Los Angeles to provide 1,000 beds and full medical facilities \u2013 freeing up hospitals on land for seriously ill coronavirus patients, as the state braces for an outbreak potentially on New York\u2019s scale. The president on Friday invoked a national security law compelling General Motors (GM) to mass produce ventilators \u2013 accompanied by barbs that the carmaker had not been acting quickly enough. Some saw it as partly an act of spite amid Trump\u2019s continuing feud with the company \u2013 GM said it had already been working around the clock for more than a week to help build more ventilators. Italy became the second country to overtake China in terms of the number of infections, reaching more than 86,000 cases. Its latest 969 deaths represent the highest national one-day figure anywhere since the outbreak began, seemingly dashing hopes that Italy might be flattening its rate of infection. The US Navy is the military service hit hardest by the coronavirus, as it scrambles to contain its first at-sea outbreak, with at least two dozen infected aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, one of 11 active aircraft carriers whose mission is central to the Pentagon\u2019s strategy for deterring war with China and Iran. The Roosevelt and its contingent of warplanes may be sidelined for days, sitting pier side in Guam as the entire crew more than 5,000 is tested, Reuters reports. Navy leaders say the carrier could return to duty at any time if required, but the sudden setback is seen as a harbinger of more trouble to come. The carrier, like other Navy ships, is vulnerable to infectious disease spread given its close quarters. The massive ship is more than 1,000 feet long; sailors are spread out across a labyrinth of decks linked by steep ladder-like stairs and narrow corridors. Enlisted sailors and officers have separate living quarters, but they routinely grab their food from crowded buffet lines and eat at tables joined end-to-end. Although the US Navy is much smaller than the US Army, it accounts for at least one-third of all reported Covid-19 cases in the military. None has been reported among Navy submarine crews, which are widely deployed and include subs armed with long-range nuclear missiles on constant patrol. The US embassy in Riyadh said on Saturday it was working with the Saudi authorities to arrange repatriation flights to the United States on a commercial airline. \u201cNo flights or departure/arrival locations have been confirmed at this time,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cIt is likely that flights will be scheduled with little advance notice.\u201d Meanwhile a video shared on Twitter claims to shows a father crying after coming home to his son. The doctor is heard saying \u201cNo, no,\u201d in Arabic as his son rushes to greet him. There are 1,104 reported cases in the country, and three deaths. Coronavirus latest: at a glance A summary of big developments in the global coronavirus outbreak: What happens to people\u2019s lungs when they get coronavirus? What became known as Covid-19, or the coronavirus, started in late 2019 as a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause. The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19. Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms. WHO says about 80% of people with Covid-19 recover without needing any specialist treatment. Only about one person in six becomes seriously ill \u201cand develops difficulty breathing\u201d. So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? The UK Ambassador to Madagascar and Comoros Phil Boyle pointed out on Twitter a few hours ago how few flights are going to and from Africa at the moment, as countries across the continent respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The latest data, from FlightRadar24, still shows the continent as having close to zero aircraft leaving or arriving: The Guardian\u2019s Emma Graham-Harrison and Angela Giuffrida report from Rome with Helena Smith in Athens and Liz Ford in London. Around the world, as cities have gone into lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus, the mass efforts to save lives have put one vulnerable group more at risk. Women and children who live with domestic violence have no escape from their abusers during quarantine, and from Brazil to Germany, Italy to China, activists and survivors say they are already seeing an alarming rise in abuse. In Hubei province, the heart of the initial coronavirus outbreak, domestic violence reports to police more than tripled in one county alone during the lockdown in February, from 47 last year to 162 this year, activists told local media. \u201cThe epidemic has had a huge impact on domestic violence,\u201d Wan Fei, a retired police officer who founded a charity campaigning against abuse, told Sixth Tone website. \u201cAccording to our statistics, 90% of the causes of violence [in this period] are related to the Covid-19 epidemic.\u201d It is a pattern being repeated globally. In Brazil a state-run drop-in centre has already seen a surge in cases it attributes to coronavirus isolation, the Brazilian broadcaster Globo said. \u201cWe think there has been a rise of 40% or 50%, and there was already really big demand,\u201d said Adriana Mello, a Rio de Janeiro judge specialising in domestic violence. \u201cWe need to stay calm in order to tackle this difficulty we are now facing.\u201d The Catalan regional government said that calls to its helpline had risen by 20% in the first few days of the confinement period; in Cyprus, calls to a similar hotline rose 30% in the week after 9 March, when the island had its first confirmed case of coronavirus. Hong Kong has brought in new restrictions on gatherings and nightlife venues after a recent rise in imported cases and a cluster of 43 infections connected to live music venues. Another 19 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday who are connected to the cluster. The venues are in Tsim Sha Tsui, Wan Chai, and Lan Kwai Fong. Musicians from bands manage by one company are among those infected. Last week Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam flagged suspending the liquor licences of 8,600 venues, reasoning that people get intimate when they\u2019re drinking. However that was later withdrawn, and restrictions on the number of patrons brought in instead. Britons go on shopping spree to ease grind of Covid-19 confinement In more British retail and manufacturing news, the prospect of weeks trapped at home has seen Britons embark on unlikely shopping sprees as they create home offices and gyms but also embrace hobbies ranging from dressmaking to jigsaw puzzling and growing their own veg, Zoe Wood and Joanna Partridge report for the Guardian. With all non-essential high street shops and some websites now closed, what is left of high street trade is online as households hunker down and seek ways to keep themselves and their children entertained. During week one of the government\u2019s new home isolation rules, online sales were \u201cfairly flat\u201d on a year ago, according to the IMRG Capgemini online retail index. However, that measure, based on the web sales of 200 retailers, masked seesawing demand: while sales of electricals and DIY products were up 42% and 14% respectively, sales of clothing fell 27% and demand for footwear slumped 38%. British retailers and manufacturers in \u2018wartime effort\u2019 to fight Covid-19 British industry has thrown its weight behind the fight against Covid-19 in a wartime-style effort to churn out protective masks, hand sanitiser and medical ventilators. While most retailers have been forced to shut down to contain the pandemic, a raft of firms across the country, in sectors from manufacturing to fashion, are setting up emergency operations that often involve striking out into unfamiliar territory. The most high-profile example has been the effort by industrial powerhouses to manufacture 30,000 medical ventilators, with household names such as Airbus, Dyson, Ford and Rolls-Royce all pitching in with expertise and resources. The banking group HSBC moved to help ventilator manufacturers by offering fast-track loan applications, cheaper interest rates and extended repayment terms. A host of companies are focusing on limiting contagion and protecting NHS workers. In Australia, retailers Country Road, Mimco, Politix, Trenery and Witchery will close their doors as the spread of coronavirus leaves many shoppers confined to their homes. The stable of retailers, owned by South African company Woolworths Holdings, announced the temporary closure of stores until further notice on Saturday. Department store David Jones, which is also owned by Woolworths, will continue to operate its larger stores. \u201cAs a heritage Australian brand, we recognise that we have an important role to play in slowing the spread of COVID-19,\u201d Country Road said in a statement posted online. \u201cThis is a decision that has not been made lightly, and one we feel is necessary to protect the health and wellbeing of our team, customers and wider community.\u201d All the brands will continue to trade online. The closures follow an announcement by competitor Myer on Friday that it would shut its shops from Sunday night. Have questions, news tips, or jokes you think our readers would enjoy? I\u2019m on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Thailand reported 109 new coronavirus cases and one death on Saturday, bringing the total to 1,245 infections and 6 deaths, the spokesman of the government\u2019s Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) said. The new cases are higher than the 91 reported on Friday. The latest death is of a patient with some prior health complication, Taweesin Wisanuyothin, the CCSA spokesman said. The Thai government on Friday ordered the closing down of more public facilities and businesses to curb the spread of coronavirus, and has extended existing closures until the end of April. The provinces of Narathiwat and Pattani in southern Thailand are in lockdown while several other provinces have issued orders to restrict the opening and closing times of 24-hour convenience stores. People in greater Tokyo and the Osaka area in western Japan hunkered down on Saturday as officials urged citizens to stay indoors to prevent a potential emergency, but some were carrying on as normal, Reuters reports. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike\u2019s plea for the tens of millions of people in the capital and surrounding regions to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings until 12 April, and particularly this weekend, followed a surge in coronavirus infections this week that she said put Tokyo on the brink of an emergency. Koike urged the public to avoid the national pastime of congregating to drink and watch the cherry blossoms as they hit their peak in the capital, saying on Friday, \u201cThe cherry blossoms will bloom again next year.\u201d Infections in Japan have climbed to more than 1,400, with 47 deaths, excluding those from a cruise ship quarantined last month. Hit early by the coronavirus in its initial spread from China, Japan had seen a more gradual rise than the recent surge in much of Europe and the United States. This week, however, saw an acceleration that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called \u201ca national crisis\u201d. Infections on Friday rose by a daily record 102, said public broadcaster NHK. Tokyo reported 40 new cases on Friday, bringing its total to 299. Moody\u2019s downgraded South Africa\u2019s sovereign credit rating to \u201cjunk\u201d status on Friday, heaping more pain on an economy already in recession and now staring down the barrel of a steep contraction over the global coronavirus pandemic. The ratings firm downgraded the rating one notch to \u2018Ba1\u2019 from \u2018Baa3\u2019 and maintained a negative outlook, meaning another downgrade could follow if the economy performs worse or government debt rises faster than expected. An annual budget in February showed a worsening of the fiscal picture, and the country entered a 21-day nationwide lockdown on Friday that will dent output as workers have been told to stay at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The local Eye Witness News channel reported that homeless people living in the city of Durban said they had been taken to a reception centre against their will: South Africa\u2019s finance ministry said the downgrade would add to prevailing financial market stress. Moody\u2019s said the main driver behind the downgrade was \u201cthe continuing deterioration in fiscal strength and structurally very weak growth\u201d. \u201cThe rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak will exacerbate South Africa\u2019s economic and fiscal challenges and will complicate the emergence of effective policy responses,\u201d it added. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said the government was not \u201ctrembling in our boots\u201d and was committed to reforms to address weak growth and ailing state-owned companies. The agency is the last of the big three agencies to downgrade Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy to sub-investment grade, after S&amp;P Global and Fitch moved there in 2017. Moody\u2019s left South Africa on the brink of junk in November after it revised the outlook on its rating to negative following a bleak mid-term budget. NSW Health have also revealed that more than 100 Australian doctors and dentists, who were stranded on a cruise ship off the coast of Chile, have today returned to Australia. Last week, we reported the doctors were on board as part of a medical convention when Chile banned cruise vessels from docking. Today NSW Health confirmed they had returned and none were identified as being \u201cunwell\u201d. \u201cTwo international flights arrived in Sydney overnight and this morning with 245 passengers...These passengers include numerous doctors and nurses who had been attending a health convention on-board who had not been able to berth off the South American coast,\u201d the departmnet said. \u201cAirport screening was immediately commenced, including symptom assessment and temperature, and no passengers were identified as being unwell. \u201cAll passengers are subject to the requirement for 14 day isolation under ministerial direction. This includes those who were able to safety return to their place of residence as well as around 150 people who are in quarantine in two Sydney hotels.\u201d China\u2019s official media told people to stay on guard against the coronavirus on Saturday, and restrictions on foreigners entering went into effect, as the country reported no new locally transmitted infections and a small drop in imported cases. \u201cAt this time, we must be extremely vigilant and cautious, and we must prevent the post-epidemic relaxation from coming too soon, leading to the loss of all our achievements,\u201d the Communist Party\u2019s official People\u2019s Daily newspaper said in a front-page editorial. The authorities also reversed planned re-openings of movie theatres, the state-owned China Securities Journal reported, citing sources. Reuters could not verify the existence of the National Film Administration\u2019s order to extend cinema closures, but a man answering the phone at a Wanda Cinemas theatre in Shanghai confirmed it had been ordered to close again. Theatres in major cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing, remained closed, searches on an online ticketing platform showed. Effective Saturday, China has suspended the entry of foreign nationals with valid Chinese visas and residence permits. Beijing has also ordered airlines to sharply cut international flights from Sunday. China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier, one of which was transmitted locally. The total number of infections for mainland China now stands at 81,394, with the death toll rising by three to 3,295, the commission said. A reminder that UK prime minister Boris Johnson became the first major world leader to test positive for Covid-19 in Friday night. On 3 March, Johnson boasted that he was continuing to shake hands with \u2018everybody\u2019, including people who had tested positive for Covid-19. On another day of rapid growth in the number of deaths caused by the virus, Johnson issued a video message revealing that he had developed \u201cmild symptoms\u201d,write Heather Stewart, Matthew Weaver and Kate Proctor write for the Guardian. But he added: \u201cBe in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.\u201d Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, was subsequently spotted running out of No 10 and along Downing Street, apparently hoping not to be noticed. Not long afterwards, Hancock issued his own statement saying he too had tested positive, and would be working from home. And later in the day, Prof Whitty, who had advised the prime minister to get tested, said he too was displaying symptoms. In other news: US cases passed 100,000. Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the US coronavirus crisis pleaded on Friday for more protective gear and equipment to treat waves of patients expected to overwhelm hospitals as the number of known US infections surpassed 100,000, with more than 1,600 dead. Italy overtook China to become the second-worst affected country after the US. Italy also recorded the highest daily rise in deaths on Friday. With 969 fatalities, it was the highest one-day increase anywhere so far since the outbreak began, AFP reports. The new fatalities took the country\u2019s total to 9,134. The number of cases topped 86,498 according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The head of the country\u2019s national health institute warned that infections have not yet reached their peak and that lockdown measures will have to be extended. Australia stepped up enforcement of social distancing rules on Saturday. In an attempt to contain community transmission of the novel coronavirus, states across the country implemented fines, closed beaches and threatened stricter measures if people defy pleas to stay at home. The death toll from the virus rose to 14 after an elderly woman died in an aged-care facility in New South Wales, where several residents and employees have tested positive for the virus, according to NSW health officials. A global shortage of condoms is looming. The world\u2019s biggest producer or condoms warned of a global shortage after a coronavirus lockdown forced it to shut down production. Malaysia\u2019s Karex Bhd makes one in every five condoms globally, normally marketed internationally by brands such as Durex, supplied to state healthcare systems such as Britain\u2019s NHS or distributed by aid programmes such as the UN Population Fund, Reuters reports. Iranian doctors say \u2018hundreds\u2019 have died after ingesting toxic methanol. An Iranian doctor said hundreds have died and thousands have been sickened from ingesting toxic methanol across the Islamic Republic out of the false belief it kills the new coronavirus. Passengers on cruise ship stranded off Panama coast issue desperate plea. Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Greenfield and Erin McCormick report. Argentina saw a record jump in cases. Despite the full national lockdown declared on March 20, the country reached 690 cases and 17 deaths so far, with 101 new cases and five deaths reported Friday. The capital city of Buenos Aires is the worst hit, with 223 cases, followed by the province of Buenos Aires with 193. South Korea reports highest new cases in a week. South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States during recent days. No new domestic infections in China. China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier. Just a reminder that you can get in touch with me, Helen Sullivan, any time on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Australia stepped up enforcement of social distancing rules on Saturday to contain community transmission of the novel coronavirus, implementing fines, closing beaches and threatening stricter measures if people defy pleas to stay at home, Reuters reports. The death toll from the virus rose to 14 after an elderly woman died in an aged-care facility in New South Wales, where several residents and employees have tested positive for the virus, according to NSW health officials. The country\u2019s total number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 212 to 3,378 early on Saturday, two-thirds of them in NSW and Victoria states, according to the federal heath ministry. The infection rate in Australia remains slower than in many other countries, although it is accelerating, especially in the most populous states of NSW and Victoria where more than half of the country\u2019s 25.5 million people live. As of midnight on Saturday, all returning citizens from abroad will be put into compulsory quarantine in hotels for two weeks at the government\u2019s expense. Military personnel will help ensure travellers comply with the new rules. Australia\u2019s state and federal governments have sent some mixed messages about social distancing and other containment measures, leading to widespread confusion. While there is no national order to stay home, entertainment and other mass-gathering venues have been shut and authorities have urged people to cancel house parties and other social gatherings. In Victoria, police closed beaches on Saturday after hundreds of people flocked to the waterside a day earlier in a repeat of scenes the previous weekend at Sydney\u2019s Bondi beach. Police raided a party at a backpacker hostel at Bondi on Friday night, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported. In Queensland state more than one million people headed to polling stations on Saturday for council elections, and were asked to bring their own pens and maintain distances of 1.5 metres (5 feet), the state government said. A global shortage of condoms is looming, the world\u2019s biggest producer said, after a coronavirus lockdown forced it to shut down production. Malaysia\u2019s Karex Bhd makes one in every five condoms globally. It has not produced a single condom from its three Malaysian factories for more than a week due to a lockdown imposed by the government to halt the spread of the virus. That\u2019s already a shortfall of 100 million condoms, normally marketed internationally by brands such as Durex, supplied to state healthcare systems such as Britain\u2019s NHS or distributed by aid programmes such as the UN Population Fund. The company was given permission to restart production on Friday, but with only 50% of its workforce, under a special exemption for critical industries. \u201cIt will take time to jumpstart factories and we will struggle to keep up with demand at half capacity,\u201d Chief Executive Goh Miah Kiat told Reuters. \u201cWe are going to see a global shortage of condoms everywhere, which is going to be scary,\u201d he said. Malaysia is Southeast Asia\u2019s worst affected country, with 2,161 coronavirus infections and 26 deaths. The lockdown is due to remain in place at least until April 14. There are already more than 6,000 hospitalised Covid-19 patients in New York, with almost 1,600 in intensive care, AP reports. The state has logged a nation-high of 519 deaths, and has more than 44,000 confirmed cases. An Iranian doctor says hundreds have died and thousands have been sickened from ingesting toxic methanol across the Islamic Republic out of the false belief it kills the new coronavirus, AP reports. Iranian media report nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. An Iranian doctor helping the country\u2019s Health Ministry told The Associated Press on Friday the problem was even greater, giving a death toll of around 480 with 2,850 people sickened. The poisonings come as fake remedies spread across social media in Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the government after it downplayed the crisis for days before it overwhelmed the country. \u201cOther countries have only one problem, which is the new coronavirus pandemic. But we are fighting on two fronts here,\u201d said Dr. Hossein Hassanian, an adviser to Iran\u2019s Health Ministry who gave the higher figures to the AP. \u201cWe have to both cure the people with alcohol poisoning and also fight the coronavirus.\u201d Brunei reported its first coronavirus death on Saturday, that of a 64-year-old man. Brunei has reported 115 cases of the virus so far, some of which were linked to a religious gathering in Malaysia that authorities said had been attended by about 16,000 people. The man who died had not attended the gathering but had a history of travel to Malaysia and Cambodia. The director of one of Haiti\u2019s top hospitals was kidnapped on Friday, prompting staff to refuse to take in new patients in protest, as the impoverished country battles an outbreak of the novel coronavirus amid a spike in gang violence. Dr. Jerry Bitar, a surgeon, was kidnapped shortly after leaving for work at Hospital Bernard Mevs from his home in an upmarket neighborhood of the capital, hospital administrative assistant Carla Puzo told Reuters. \u201cThe relevant authorities are following the case,\u201d a Health Ministry spokesman said. \u201cThe Bernard Mevs hospital is a trauma and critical care center and is not treating coronavirus cases currently, but could need to if the disease spreads substantially in the country, where healthcare services and sanitation infrastructure are inadequate.\u201d Kidnappings for ransom have sharply increased this year amid a political and economic crisis in Haiti, which according to the World Bank is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Police confirmed 15 kidnapping cases in January alone. Gangs appear to strike indiscriminately, with victims ranging from Haitian schoolchildren, lawmakers and businessmen to foreign aid workers. \u201cHospital staff decided not to take any new cases for the time being,\u201d Puzo said. \u201cWe will continue to look after those already here.\u201d A crowd gathered outside the facility in solidarity with Bitar, who runs the hospital together with his twin brother, while staff chanted in unison calls for his release. Haitian media outlets also pleaded for bandits to free Bitar. Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson returned to Los Angeles on Friday after spending more than two weeks in quarantine in Australia after testing positive for the coronavirus. Hanks, a double Oscar winner and one of America\u2019s most beloved stars, and Wilson were the first big celebrities to announce they had tested positive for the disease. They were treated in hospital in Australia and isolated themselves for a further period after leaving. Hanks\u2019 last post on his Twitter account on Sunday said it had been two weeks since their first symptoms and that they were feeling better. Hanks was in Australia working on a movie about Elvis Presley when he announced on 11 March that he and Wilson had tested positive for the disease. Filming has since been shut down on the movie, and on hundreds of other film and television productions worldwide. A chilling video from New York records the wails of ambulance sirens on Friday night, as patients are rushed to buckling hospitals amid the coronavirus pandemic. The US has become the worst-affected country on earth, with more than 104,000 confirmed cases. New York state accounts for 44,000 of these. The video was posted to Twitter minutes ago by Pulitzer prize-winning science journalist Laurie Garrett: In the US, congress ensured that the legislation for the US$2.2tn rescue plan for American businesses creates multiple layers of accountability, despite president Donald Trump\u2019s declaration tat \u201cI\u2019ll be the oversight,\u201d when lawmakers were in the final days of drafting the plan, AP reports. The House passed the bill by voice vote on Friday and Trump immediately signed it. The new oversight system will test the relationship between the White House and Congress, which frayed after Democrats won the House and deteriorated severely during Trump\u2019s impeachment as officials flouted requests for witnesses and documents. Trump immediately threw the oversight provisions into question, writing in a signing statement Friday night that the new law contains several provisions that raise constitutional concerns.\u2019\u2019 Trump said a new inspector general intended to monitor spending under the law would not be bound by requirements to report to the Congress without delay. His administration will continue the practice of treating provisions like these as \u201cadvisory and non-binding,\u201d Trump said. Italy on Friday recorded the most daily deaths of any country since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. Italy showed a continuing downward trend in infection rates, however. The country overtook China to become the second-worst affected country after the US. Six of the 10 countries with the highest number of infections are in Europe, including the UK, according to Johns Hopkins University figures: US: 103,942 Italy: 86,498 China: 81,897 Spain: 65,719 Germany: 50,871 France: 33,402 Iran: 32,332 United Kingdom: 14,745 Switzerland: 12,928 South Korea: 9,332 There are 597,072 cases confirmed worldwide and 27,360 deaths. South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States during recent days. Aid groups warn that without measures millions could die in low-income countries and war zones such as Syria and Yemen, where hygiene conditions are already dire, AFP reports. Across Africa, the official numbers are still relatively low with 83 deaths and over 3,200 confirmed cases on Friday, according to the African Union. But aid groups are sounding the alarm on the potentially devastating consequences of a severe outbreak in low-income and conflict-ridden countries, where healthcare systems are in tatters and hygiene conditions poor. Around the world three billion people lack access to running water and soap, which are the most basic weapons of protection against the virus, UN experts said. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres issued a stark warning last week: \u201cIf we let coronavirus spread like wildfire - especially in the most vulnerable regions of the world - it would kill millions of people.\u201d The UN chief announced a humanitarian relief plan on Wednesday, featuring an appeal for US$2bn dollars to help the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people. As India and other South Asian nations work to stop the spread of the virus, they face another battle: reams of misinformation, AP reports. On Tuesday, Indians were ordered to stay indoors for three weeks in the worlds biggest coronavirus lockdown. In announcing the move, Modi reiterated the danger of misinformation. \u201cI appeal to you to beware of any kind of rumours or superstitions,\u201d the prime minister said. With the pandemic starting to gain a foothold in the region, social media sites are rife with bogus remedies, tales of magic cures and potentially hazardous medical advice. Experts are urging caution and warning that the coronavirus infodemic could have disastrous consequences. It\u2019s a trend also seen elsewhere and governments around the world have been urging citizens not to listen to or spread rumors about the pandemic. As we continue to report on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, we\u2019re looking for stories of how this unprecedented crisis has affected couples, families, friends and communities. If you\u2019ve been separated from a loved one by lockdowns, have had to cancel your wedding or miss an important family event, we\u2019d like to hear from you. We\u2019re always interested in hearing what you may have done in response, too, or how you and your loved ones (and neighbours) are supporting each other in these trying times. Please do include photographs if you can and are happy for us to use them. Send me a message on Twitter @helenrsullivan, tag me in a tweet of your own (if you\u2019re happy for us to include it in the blog), or email me: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. Here\u2019s the latest from Australia, which announced its 14th coronavirus-related death on Saturday. From midnight anyone arriving at an Australian airport from overseas will be taken straight to a hotel. The Victorian and NSW premiers have explained how this will work: travellers will be given health checks and taken straight by bus to hotel rooms. They will be monitored by authorities to ensure they are adhering to quarantine and so they can be given treatment if they become unwell. They will be provided with food. Another airline support package has been announced to support regional communities that depend on aviation for medical and food supplies. The additional $198m was announced by the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, with about 140 communities relying on regional aviation. Victoria and South Australia have followed NSW in introducing on-the-spot fines for businesses and individuals breaching social distancing restrictions. Total job losses across Australia have exceeded 75,000. Queenslanders are heading to the polls for local government elections and two state byelections, with the state\u2019s Covid-19 total now at 625. Pleas for safe harbour from stranded cruise ship near Panama Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama have issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Greenfield and Erin McCormick report. Two people have tested positive for the disease and dozens are ill with flu-like symptoms on the Zaandam luxury cruise liner, which has not been able to dock after several Latin American countries closed their ports in response to the global pandemic. Hundreds of North American, Australian and British citizens are in isolation in their rooms and a boat-to-boat operation is underway to move some healthy travellers to a sister ship, the Rotterdam, over the weekend. But there are fears that sick, elderly passengers and crew members will be left stranded at sea during a global pandemic, with some on board isolating in small, humid cabins with no natural light or fresh air. The latest leap in coronavirus cases has set a new record in Argentina, as the country braces for an expected sharp increase in cases over the coming weeks \u2013 despite the full national lockdown declared on March 20. The total has reached 690 cases and 17 deaths so far, with 101 new cases and five deaths reported Friday. The capital city of Buenos Aires is the worst hit, with 223 cases, followed by the province of Buenos Aires with 193. The country locked its borders to its own citizens even more tightly Friday, closing the northern border crossing at Foz de Iguaz\u00fa to Argentinians trying to enter the country on land from Brazil. President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez ordered the halt of repatriation flights this week on the suspicion of persons hiding their symptoms by lying about their health and taking paracetamol to lower their fever before boarding planes. Some 15 thousand Argentinians have been left stranded abroad, mainly in Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, the US, Spain, Italy and the UK. Repatriations will be considered on a case by case basis, with travelers who left the country after March 13, when the government had already put in place its first measures against the pandemic, to be awarded the lowest priority, authorities said. A line of cheap credit for small and medium-sized companies having trouble paying wages during the lockdown was announced by Argentina\u2019s national bank, Banco Naci\u00f3n, Friday. The loans carry a yearly interest rate of 24%, high by international standards, but still less than half the country\u2019s annual inflation rate of 50%. In the US, Donuts Delite in Rochester is selling doughnuts featuring the face of Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s \u2013 the doctor leading the US battle with coronavirus \u2013 surrounded by white frosting and topped off with patriotic sprinkles. The exclusive treats have been selling \u201clike crazy\u201d since the store put them on display Monday, according to Nick Semeraro, franchisee of the caf\u00e9, AP reports. It appears the city of Los Angeles inadvertently notified more than 200 people about their Covid-19 results in a mass email that included the names of all recipients, according to LA Times reporter Soumya Karlamangla: The mass email, which reportedly failed to blind copy the recipients, was informing them of negative results, according to a screenshot posted by Karlamangla, who noted this was a major privacy violation: The email came from someone listed as a contract specialist for the mayor\u2019s office of public safety, writing on behalf of the health department\u2019s Covid-19 response team. Spokespeople for the mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment this afternoon. Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said Friday he will maintain his busy travel schedule dedicating infrastructure projects around Mexico in spite of growing restrictions prompted by the coronavirus, including a shutdown of most federal government operations, the Associated Press reports. L\u00f3pez Obrador took a commercial flight to the western state of Nayarit and then was heading to the northern border state of Baja California before finishing the weekend in Sinaloa. However, the president said he doesn\u2019t want people gathering in airports to see him like they usually do to shake hands and request selfies with him. He was criticized last weekend on a similar swing in the southern state of Oaxaca for stopping to eat in a local restaurant and for urging Mexicans to continue to eat out in spite of the virus. He said Friday he would continue to evaluate the situation, but for now planned to continue travelling. Mexico reported 717 cases of the coronavirus and 12 deaths as of Friday night. And here is a tweet about Boris Johnson testing positive for coronavirus: Here\u2019s the clip of US president Donald Trump saying on Friday that he had a conversation with UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who has tested positive for coronavirus, and \u201cthe first thing he said to me is: \u2018We need ventilators\u2019\u201d. Trump mentioned Johnson \u201casking for ventilators today\u201d twice during the Coronavirus Task Force briefing. Thirty-nine Australians who were on board the Costa Luminosa, and are now trapped in quarantine in Rome, have gotten word that at least two of their international shipmates have died, Matilda Boseley reports for the Guardian. Italian authorities demanded the group isolated for two weeks before returning to Australia after Coronavruis infections broke out on board their cruise ship. They may soon be joined by 200 Australian\u2019s on the Costa Victoria. The Australian state of New South Wales has confirmed 212 new cases of the virus since yesterday, bringing the state total to 1,617 confirmed cases. The state is the worst-affected by the virus. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said 84,907 people have been tested and excluded. Of those infected, 22 are in intensive care. There was a death overnight: a 91 year-old woman who was a resident of the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility. The death toll in the state is now eight. Australia has the 19th-highest number of cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The total number of cases is 3,378, according to the health department. From midnight on Saturday all people arriving in Australia will be put into a mandatory 14 day quarantine in hotels and other accommodation. Hospital ship arrives in LA as California braces for crisis on par with New York The Mercy hospital ship docked on Friday morning at the Port of Los Angeles, joining California\u2019s battle against the coronavirus as the state prepares to meet New York City levels of demand on hospitals, possibly within days. The Mercy is one of two supertankers the navy converted to a floating hospital. Typically deployed to provide disaster relief, the ship has fully equipped operating rooms, a 1,000-bed hospital facility, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, and a landing deck for military helicopters. Speaking from an afternoon press conference, with navy ships as a backdrop, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said the Mercy was fully staffed and operational with 800 medical staffers and 12 operating rooms. It would be ready to start taking patients as early as tomorrow, Newsom said. Today, at the end of that contentious and partially accurate White House coronavirus briefing, a reporter asked Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2013 who has become a trusted figure for many Americans overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 whether over the course of his career he had experienced anything like the past month in the United States? While the HIV/AIDS epidemic was incredibly devastating, the suffering and deaths unfolded more slowly than what people around the world are experiencing now, Fauci said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now, in actual real time, is something that\u2019s unprecedented. This is something we have never seen before, at least in our generation. They\u2019ve seen maybe something like this 100 years ago.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re really being challenged to not only learn in real time, to be able to respond in a way that\u2019s helpful an effective, we\u2019re also in uncharted waters. That is the thing that I find different...\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t as if we have an example of how to do it.\u201d During briefing, Trump feuds with state governors, makes false claims Two key moments from Trump\u2019s coronavirus briefing earlier today. Trump tossed out barbs at state governors he said have been insufficiently gracious to him, and said he advised the vice-president, Mike Pence, just not to return their calls. (But added that Pence called them anyway.) And asked if his administration\u2019s belated push to manufacture or obtain 100,000 ventilators meant that everyone who needed a ventilator will be able to get one, he lashed out at the reporter asking the question, calling him a \u201cwise guy\u201d and complaining about all the problems he had inherited. A British man has described the \u2018gut-wrenching pain\u2019 of losing his mother to coronavirus. Stuart Hamlin urges people to stay inside in an emotional video filmed hours after his mother died from the coronavirus. He describes his pain just four days after Tracy was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms. \u201cWe can\u2019t grieve. We can\u2019t comfort each other. We can\u2019t hold each other. Losing someone is hard enough, but not being able to hold your family close when you do is the most gut-wrenching pain I\u2019ve ever felt in my life,\u201d he says. Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the US coronavirus crisis pleaded on Friday for more protective gear and equipment to treat waves of patients expected to overwhelm hospitals as the number of known U.S. infections surpassed 100,000, with more than 1,600 dead, Reuters reports. Physicians have called particular attention to a desperate need for additional ventilators, machines that help patients breathe and are widely needed for those suffering from Covid-19, the respiratory ailment caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus. Hospitals in New York City, New Orleans, Detroit and other virus hot spots also have sounded the alarm about scarcities of drugs, medical supplies and trained staff while the number of confirmed US cases rose by 15,000 on Friday to just over 100,000. That was down slightly from more than 16,000 new cases reported on Thursday, the largest one-day US surge to date, but kept the United States as the world leader in the number of known infections, having surpassed China and Italy on Thursday. In the US, Gizmodo is reporting that a 17-year-old boy has become the first coronavirus patient to die after being denied treatment because he lacked private health insurance. The Guardian is working to verify this story. Gizmodo reports: A 17-year-old boy in Los Angeles County who became the first teen believed to have died from complications with covid-19 in the U.S. was denied treatment at an urgent care clinic because he didn\u2019t have health insurance, according to R. Rex Parris, the mayor of Lancaster, California. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have insurance, so they did not treat him,\u201d Parris said in a video posted to YouTube: Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, tweeted about the news, calling it \u201cbarbaric\u201d. China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier. The total number of infections for mainland China now stands at 81,394, with the death toll rising by 3 to 3,295, it said. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. I\u2019ll be taking you through the next few hours of important updates and breaking new as the number of cases worldwide moves towards 600,000. Both the US and Italy now have more cases than China, with 101,657 and 86,498 respectively. You can get in touch with me on Twitter throughout the day @helenrsullivan. Before we kick off, here\u2019s a summary of the main points so far: US President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to built ventilators for hospitals, he announced at the White House\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. The Irish government has announced sweeping restrictions that will put Ireland in a de facto lockdown. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that from midnight people should stay home for two weeks, until 12 April, in a significant tightening of curbs on social and commercial life. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro insinuated that the number of coronavirus cases was being inflated for political purposes. He added: \u201cSome people will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d Syria said on Friday it was banning travel between cities and governorates as part of tightening measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Syria has recorded five cases of corona virus so far but relief agencies worry that any outbreak could be lethal after years of conflict that has ravaged its healthcare system. The UK has again recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths. In the last 24 hours, 181 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19. It comes after 115 deaths were recorded the day before. The UK death toll stands at 759, with 14,579 confirmed cases. Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and is exhibiting \u201cmild symptoms\u201d. In a video posted on Twitter, Johnson confirmed he had developed \u201ca temperature and persistent cough\u201d over the last 24 hours. The UK prime minister, 55, said he was now self-isolating and working from home and would continue to lead the national fightback against the virus. Matt Hancock, the UK\u2019s health secretary, also tested positive. Spain recorded a new record single-day death toll. There have been 769 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 4,858. The previous record was 738, between Tuesday and Wednesday this week. The country now has 64,059 confirmed cases up from 56,188 yesterday. The Spanish government has withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%. The number of cases in Iran has risen to 32,332, while the number of deaths hits 2,378, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. Covid-19 continues its spread across the African continent with 3243 cases and 83 deaths now recorded. South Africa has reported its first deaths resulting from Covid-19. There are now more than 1000 cases in the country. Firefighters, retired police officers and former ambulance workers are being drafted in to help the NHS. It comes as one in five police officers are off sick or self-isolating in areas worst hit by the virus. Italy recorded the highest daily rise in deaths and has not yet reached peak, experts say. Italy had 919 new fatalities, taking the total to 9,134. The update follows a warning from the head of the country\u2019s national health institute that infections have not yet reached their peak and that lockdown measures will have to be extended. France extended its lockdown by a fortnight. France has recorded 299 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, the prime minister announced in a speech. Edouard Philippe said it was clear that the country was \u201cjust at the beginning of this epidemic wave\u201d. A spike in coronavirus patients means hospitals in and around Paris will reach saturation point within 48 hours, said the head of the French Hospital Federation. Four died on a cruise ship after the outbreak. Four people have died on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama after a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the boat\u2019s owners have confirmed. The US approved a $2.2tn economic stimulus package. Congress has given final approval for a $2.2tn financial package designed to rush federal aid to workers, businesses and a healthcare system ravaged by the virus, after politicians united to overcome a last-minute attempt to delay its passage.",

Ventilator Challenge UK, a consortium of 14 firms including Airbus and Rolls-Royce, is expected to say that it has secured a formal order for two types of machine. The government has 8,175 ventilators but has turned to British industry to help produce 30,000 in a matter of weeks, to combat an expected surge in new cases. The engineer Dyson became the first to reveal it had signed a formal contract last week, when it announced an order for 10,000 of its CoVent prototype, which was designed in about a fortnight. While the CoVent is yet to secure final regulatory approval \u2013 and may not reach production for weeks \u2013 Ventilator Challenge UK\u2019s plans, set to be unveiled on Monday, are more advanced because they use two existing designs. One model, understood to be government clinicians\u2019 first choice, goes by the codename Project Oyster and involves slight tweaks to an existing design by a little-known Oxfordshire firm called Penlon. Production is scheduled to begin this week, with approval from the government\u2019s Medical and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) likely to prove straightforward. A parallel effort by the same consortium, nicknamed Project Penguin, will involve scaling up production of a model made by medical equipment firm Smiths Medical at its factory in Luton. Both projects have progressed under the oversight of the MHRA, to ensure the devices meet specifications laid down by clinicians. The Ventilator Challenge UK consortium has a formal order for 10,000, matching the number that Dyson will provide if it secures regulatory approval for its CoVent prototype. But it expects to deliver many thousands more if required, harnessing the combined manufacturing muscle of firms including Airbus, Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, Ford, McLaren, GKN, Meggitt, Renishaw, Thales, Siemens and Ultra Electronics. As well as lending factory floor space and logistical know-how, the companies have redeployed some of their most skilled engineers from key company projects to work on the ventilator effort. The government has been considering at least 13 separate proposals from companies offering to plug an expected shortfall of the medical devices. No 10 said on Friday that it had narrowed the options down to seven. The shortlist includes companies proposing to design and build machines from scratch, such as the partnership between Dyson and Cambridge-based The Technology Partnership. Defence company Babcock is also building its own machine, working with an unnamed firm specialising in medical equipment. On Friday evening, a consortium of seven Formula One teams including Aston Martin, Mercedes-AMG and Renault said they were working on multiple ventilator projects, under the banner Project Pitlane. Companies that already make ventilators are also scaling up production. Breas UK, the British arm of a Swedish company, has tripled capacity and moved to a seven-day working week to increase production at its Stratford-upon-Avon site. Crawley-based Inspiration Healthcare signed a \u00a34m contract with the government to import devices from Israel and the US, although the order is understood to be for fewer than 500, likely to help bridge any gaps until new machines become available. Ventilator Challenge UK has made the fastest progress and expects to begin production this week. The arrival of the first batch could ease pressure on Boris Johnson, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week, after it emerged that the government missed an opportunity to take part in four EU ventilator procurement schemes, because of a \u201ccommunications problem\u201d.",
