More than 3,000 people were killed or forcibly disappeared during Pinochet\u2019s 1973-1990 dictatorship, and in 2001, the then president, Ricardo Lagos, revealed that at least 120 of them were later thrown to their deaths from helicopters into \u201cChile\u2019s ocean, lakes and rivers\u201d. T-shirts making light of such atrocities have become popular among the far right, and were openly on sale on Amazon \u2013 where shoppers could choose garments emblazoned with Pinochet\u2019s face alongside images of helicopters or slogans such as \u201cFree Helicopter Rides\u201d. Survivors of the dictatorship expressed outrage that the e-commerce giant could sell T-shirts mocking violent killings. \u201cIt is unbearable for people like me who had to endure that time when people were thrown alive into the sea from helicopters,\u201d the Chilean author Diamela Eltit told the Guardian. \u201cThis is not only hurtful, it is also incomprehensibly cruel. It shows how the worst part of humanity can be absorbed by the market and transformed into an object of consumption,\u201d she said. Other T-shirts available on Amazon depicted a body in freefall from a helicopter beneath the caption \u201cWanna take a ride?\u201d or showed a helicopter with the legend \u201cPinochet Is My Co-Pilot\u201d. One shirt \u2013 depicting a helicopter beneath the legend \u201cAnti-Commie Action\u201d \u2013 was advertised on Amazon as \u201cthe perfect gift for any Patriot, Trump supporter, conservative, republican person you may know.\u201d When asked for comment by the Guardian, a spokesperson for Amazon said: \u201cAll sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action, including potential removal of their account. The products in question have been removed.\u201d Most of the garments disappeared from the website, but several were still available on Friday. The popularity of Pinochet T-shirts among the US far-right was first highlighted during the 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when the white nationalist Christopher Cantwell wore one in an interview with Vice. Last year, a political storm erupted in Chile when the far-right politician Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast \u2013 who came fourth in the 2017 presidential elections \u2013 was pictured alongside a supporter wearing a T-shirt saying \u201cPinochet\u2019s Helicopter Tours\u201d. Although Kast has often spoken favourably of Pinochet\u2019s dictatorial regime, the politician said he did not realise what the T-shirt said when he was asked to pose for the selfie. Tens of thousands of people were detained or tortured following Chile\u2019s 1973 coup. In the first month after coming to power, Pinochet ordered his military to round up more than 10,000 students, workers and political activists in Chile\u2019s National Stadium, which became an improvised concentration camp and torture centre. Earlier this month, Amazon was forced to pull Christmas ornaments decorated with images of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where over 1 million people were murdered during Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime. Eltit, who founded the Collective of Art Actions (Cada) in 1979 as an act of resistance against censorship during the dictatorship, described the sale of such items on Amazon as a tear in the fabric of society. \u201cThese examples \u2013 the Auschwitz Christmas ornaments, or T-shirts depicting bodies thrown alive into the sea \u2013 are a metaphor of how the social pacts that bind us together are being broken by free-market consumerism,\u201d she said.",

On Thursday departmental officials also defended the appointment of the former Liberal staffer Adam Boyton to the $500,000-a-year job of interim national skills commissioner through a limited tender. Williams said that Boyton was appointed after an \u201copen merit-driven, competitive process\u201d due to the \u201ctechnical merit of his experience\u201d including as a member of the New South Wales government skills board and chief economist at the Business Council of Australia and Deutsche Bank in Australia.

Boyton was the department\u2019s preferred \u201cmerit recommendation\u201d, who was then appointed by cabinet at Cash\u2019s recommendation. The Austender contract notice states Boyton was appointed through a limited tender.

      "bodyText": "An Australian man charged with trying to broker missile deals for the North Korean regime has told a court he cannot get a fair trial in Australia, saying his phone calls with his lawyer are being listened to, and even prime ministers have publicly condemned the allegations against him. But Justice Ian Harrison, in the New South Wales supreme court, dismissed the Chan Han Choi\u2019s application for a permanent stay of proceedings, saying he will stand trial next February. Choi, 61, is the first person ever charged with offences under Australia\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Act, alleged to have been a sanctions-busting \u201ceconomic agent\u201d of Pyongyang and of working to broker missile technology and resources deals on behalf of the North Korean regime. He has told the court he is a political prisoner incarcerated because of his socialist political beliefs. Choi, brought to court in handcuffs wearing a green prison tracksuit, was arrested in December 2017 and charged over alleged attempts to broker coal deals to raise money for the North Korean regime as well as selling weapons technology, including equipment for missiles. An affidavit presented to the court argued his ability to prepare a defence is hampered because he cannot speak freely to his lawyer. The affidavit included written confirmation from NSW corrective services commissioner Peter Severin that authorities \u201cdrop in\u201d to listen to Choi\u2019s calls from prison, but only \u201cto ensure they are in English and with approved contacts\u201d. Severin said the drop-ins were brief and not recorded, and were required for \u201cnational security interest\u201d cases such as Choi\u2019s. The affidavit also argues that when Choi was arrested, then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull commented on the case, drawing significant negative public attention. Turnbull said Choi had been \u201carrested and will be charged with offences relating to breaking sanctions and endeavouring \u2013 by breaking sanctions \u2013 to provide economic support for the North Korean regime. These are very, very serious matters. North Korea is a dangerous, reckless, criminal regime, threatening the peace of the region\u201d. A separate affidavit said the translator he was provided with was unable to properly translate for him, and another Korean speaker could not be found who had sufficient security clearance. Justice Harrison, in the NSW supreme court, dismissed Choi\u2019s application for a permanent stay of his trial. Choi has been refused bail, with prosecutors arguing he has international connections and poses a flight risk. Choi will seek to apply for bail again ahead of his trial, set to commence in February. At a demonstration supporting Choi held outside the NSW supreme court, Praba Balasubramaniam, from the Trotskyist Platform, said Choi was a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d, charged for resisting \u201ccruel\u201d economic sanctions imposed on North Korea that were designed to starve the people of that country. \u201cChoi is being persecuted because of his political views. \u201cIt\u2019s clear he cannot get a fair trial in this country.\u201d In a message recorded in prison and broadcast outside the court, Choi said: \u201c[I] would like to express my appreciation and sincere gratitude for all the support I have received. \u201cI honestly believe that every human being deserve basic human rights and I have been deprived of those rights through my incarceration. \u201cI strongly believe that the United Nations economic sanctions imposed on North Korea are both unjust and unfair,\u201d he said. The Guardian has seen a police statement of alleged facts tendered to the court ahead of his trial. These have not been tested in court and have not been agreed to by Choi\u2019s defence. Born in the South Korean capital Seoul, Choi emigrated to Australia in 1987 and became a citizen in 2001. The statement alleges Choi used a web of black market contacts in Syria, Taiwan, Cambodia and Russia to broker deals mostly in coal and iron, but also in weapons technology, including short-range missiles. The statement cites Choi\u2019s regular overseas travel, including to North Korea, and alleged email correspondence that reveals a declared loyalty to the North Korean regime. An email allegedly from the regime praised Choi\u2019s devotion and willingness to \u201cwork hard for our country\u201d. \u201cEven when you are far away from our country, in your heart there is the country, so I am certain that your project will run successfully,\u201d the email, sent in July 2013, allegedly said of Choi. The police statement alleges Choi, who used the pseudonym Solomon in his negotiations, developed a code to discuss weapons sales on the phone, referring to missiles as \u201cpine trees\u201d and missile factories as \u201cnurseries\u201d. According to the police allegations, Choi described himself as North Korea\u2019s \u201cinternational commerce\u201d liaison, working on behalf of the highest echelons of the DPRK government. \u201cI am a recognised strategist that has favour with Kim Jong Eun [sic],\u201d he wrote. When Choi was arrested, Australian federal police assistant commissioner Neil Gaughan stressed Choi was not alleged to have engaged in spying, but simply to have tried to raise money for the North Korean regime. Gaughan said evidence suggested Choi had been in contact \u201cwith high-ranking North Korean officials\u201d but did not provide details. \u201cWe believe this man participated in discussions about the sale of missile componentry from North Korea to other entities abroad.\u201d Gaughan would not identify the alleged international entities or their location, but said there were no governments or government officials involved.",

Just under a month ago, the Rural Fire Service told Australia Walkabout Wildlife Park, in Calga, 60km north of Sydney, there was a chance it could come under threat from the Gospers Mountain fire. The park\u2019s owner, Tassin Barnard, was concerned there was no way to safely evacuate the animals if the blaze descended. She put a call out on Facebook and reached more than 170,000 people.

The RFS told Barnard two days ago that in this event, the sanctuary could not be protected. \u201cI felt sick, because I thought I\u2019d made the wrong decision and it was too late,\u201d she said. Another call was put out to the contacts Barnard and her crew had made and an evacuation plan was drawn up to shift the animals to Blackbutt Reserve, two hours north of the farm. A helicopter was first procured to take two wombats to Featherdale Wildlife Park. \u201cThey\u2019re two particularly craggy old wombats that weren\u2019t going to take well to travelling anyway, so the fact that we could give them a 15-minute helicopter ride instead of a two- potentially three-hour car trip was really, really important,\u201d she said.

Clearly, he is a fine footballer, and can deliver a wonderful long pass, but I\u2019ve always had a suspicion that he\u2019d be a much better deep midfielder than a centre-half (who can\u2019t seem to keep track of his marker).\u201d Well, yes, a deep midfielder (or a centreback in a three-man defence) and possibly a better one than any of Arsenal\u2019s current crop. The problem goes beyond one player - Arsenal\u2019s is a very unbalanced squad; and conceding is certainly a problem, but that negative difference is also because they\u2019re not scoring anywhere near as many as they should. Burnley and Villa has netted more than them so far this season. Still, I fancy them to nick another 2-2 today (which is why Aubameyang is my fantasy captain again).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5de962208f08bacaf000aebf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-05T20:02:34.494Z\">8.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the thoughts of Kim \u201cNo Relation\u201d Doyle: \u201cWith Freddie and Per at the helm of the Gunners, I expect the return of quick attacking, one or two touch football.

Their highest paid player is a creative midfielder. And in the summer they spent a record fee on an exciting forward. So it has taken extraordinary incompetence for them to reach the 14-game mark with a negative goal difference. And that\u2019s just one reason why Unai Emery got the boot. Yes, Arsenal are, in the throes of a crisis. They are desperately seeking a full-time manager and a coherent way of playing. And, er, they are four points and six places above Brighton, who are so happy with their gaffer that they\u2019ve just handed him a six-year contract extension without being asked. </p> <p>The thing is, Graham Potter has given Brighton a sense of direction even if results have yet to live up to the promise shown. He has generated belief. Arsenal, alas, remain a club riddled with doubts, possibly even despair, at least for some. Temporary boss Freddie Ljungberg didn\u2019t do a heck of a lot to change that in his first match in charge even if there were brief spells of encouragement during the draw at Norwich. Let\u2019s see if the visit of Brighton to the Emirates bring any more cheer to Arsenal fans, and justifies the Seagulls\u2019 faith in Potter.<br> </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cOf course it was disappointing but we have to keep on going. The players are low on confidence, I think you can see that. We had a good reaction at the start of the second half but we need to start games likes that. That\u2019s the biggest disappointment I have ... We\u2019re in a difficult situation, we\u2019ve lost a lot of games and confidence has gone down. You could see that at the start, with low energy... A lot of things to think about.\u201d Asked whether players are aware of their responsibility for improving performances, he replies: \u201cPlayers do as good as they can. They are a bit low on confidence.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely delighted. It\u2019s a wonderful feeling. We had three tough games with no pints so it\u2019s nice to bounce back at a place like this. I thought we did really well in the first half ... pressed well and defended well, kept the ball when we had to and tried to create things. Then there was a response [from Arsenal] and we had to dig in... It gives us a lot of belief.\u201d \u201cI thought Aaron Mooy was fantastic all game. He was so unselfish with his play and then added that little bit of quality at the end [the cross for Maupay\u2019s decisive goal]. All the player were amazing, real courage and real bravery on the ball.\u201d Lewis Dunk: \u201cWe made it tough for ourselves after the first half in which ew were excellent ... but we showed great character to come back and win the game.\u201d Maupay: \u201cLewis said before the game we can\u2019t say \u2018we played well but didn\u2019t get the win\u2019. We needed to win today.\u201d Dunk: \u201cWe were expecting a reaction. [Arsenal] showed at the start of the second half what a side they cane be. We had to grind out the win.\u201d Nick Ames was at the Emirates. I haven\u2019t had a chance to read his report yet but the Probability Indicator says there\u2019s a 99% chance it\u2019s terrific. Have a gander here: Lee Dixon, referring to how easily Brighton found space all over the pitch, but especially in midfield: \u201cIt\u2019s fine to make mistakes, but if you keep making the same mistakes .... There are players out there doing exactly the same thing now that they were doing at the end of last season. The players have got to take responsibility.\u201d Alan Pardew, speaking on Amazon, has it right. \u201cBrighton totally deserved it .... it all came down to basics. If you don\u2019t have pressure on the ball you look disjointed and that was Arsenal. Brighton did all the basics right.\u201d \u201cOnly just noticed that Aaron Mooy looks like a young Freddie Ljungberg,\u201d parps Jim Greenan. \u201cThis is becoming a Stephen King novel.\u201d Arsenal extend their winless run to nine matches, as Brighton make off with an impressive victory. Graham Potter\u2019s team dominated the first half and went in at the break with a lead thanks to Adam Webster. Freddie Ljungberg inspired an improvement from Arsenal in the second half and they deservedly equalised through Alexander Lacazette. But that was as good as it got for the generally ragged hosts, who fell to an excellent late winning goal by Neal Maupay. Brighton were the better, more accomplished side overall and deserve their win. 90+3 min: Trossard pounces on a mistake by Xhaka and dodges his way towards the Arsenal box. He cuts back on to his left foot and then blems a shot over the bar. That would have sealed it! 90+1 min: There will be at least three more minutes of stoppage time. Our makeshift Probability Indicator - mad from some staples and chewing gum - puts Brighton\u2019s chances of victory at 96.7%. 90 min: P\u00e9p\u00e9 curls a low freekick around the wall and wide of the far post. It must have taken a slight nick of the wall, actually, because a corner has been awarded. Nowt comes of it. 89 min: Freekick to Arsenal about 20 yards out, a little to the right of the D, after Trossard needlessly fouls P\u00e9p\u00e9... will he be made to regret that? Brighton substitution: Duffy on, Alzate off. That\u2019s a pretty strong declaration of intent. 86 min: Tierney\u2019s provides a wonderful cross from the left. Martinelli meets it with a very good header towards the bottom corner, but Ryan manages sto pushes it behind for a corner. That was almost a convincing cover version of Brighton\u2019s second goal. 84 min: Bellerin scampers down the right and sends a token cross into the box. Easy pickings for Ryan. 82 min: P\u00e9p\u00e9 forces Ryan into a moderate save with a reasonable effort from the right. 80 min: That really was an exquisitely crafted goal. Mooy outfoxed Bellerin on the left by shifting niftily on to his right foot to deliver an ideal cross. And then Maupay, having found space with some deft movement away from Arsenal\u2019s defenders, glanced a header into the corner beyond the reach of Leno. All very accomplished, in the image of their overall performance here. A superbly directed header from 10 yards after a lovely cross from the left by Mooy! Brighton substitution: Trossard on, Gross off. 79 min: Mooy finds Maupay with a canny disguised pass. David Luiz makes an important block. Arsenal substitution: Martinelli on, Lacazette off. 76 min:Delightful play by Propper and Alzate to work the latter into a prime crossing position. But then Alzate tries one trick too many and confuses himself, allowing the ball to dribble out of play. Brighton substitution: Montoya on, Connolly off. That suggest a change of tack from Potter. 74 min: This match is in the balance. Arsenal are looking the more sprightly but Brighton still have the ability to create chances. There\u2019s no telling how this is going to play out. Anyone know where a man could get a good Probability Indicator? Arsenal substitution: Tierney on, Kolasinac off. I believe that change was already in the pipeline before Koalsinac got that knock - he doesn\u2019t appear to be seriously injured. 71 min: Another burst forward by Kolasinac ends with him being caught late by Alzate, who\u2019s lucky to avoid a booking. 69 min: Lacazette retrieves a hopeful pass chucked into the channel by Sokratis. He looks up and presents the ball to Ozil about 25 yards out. Ozil goes for the first time shot but doesn\u2019t catch it properly. 68 min: David Luiz booked for taking out Connolly to abort a counter-attack. 67 min: Dunk goofs mid-way inside the Arsenal half and has the ball ripped off him. P\u00e9p\u00e9 hurtles forward and then nips a nice ball through to Aubameyang, whose shot on the run is deflected out for a corner. 64 min: The goal is ruled out, correctly. 63 min: GOAL? Ozil floats in a freekick from the right and David Luiz is free to sidefoot a volley in from 15 yards! But he was a couple of yards offside so expect VAR to overrule it .... eventually. 62 min: Lovey dainty cross from the right by Alzate after a flowing move. Mooy leaps above Bellerin to get a good downward header in from eight yards. Leno pushes it out for a corner! 61 min: Brighton take the corner short, then Xhaka clears Mooy\u2019s cross. Gross cops a booking for deliberately handling the ball to curtail a counter-attack. 60 min: Gross cruises through midfield and slips in Mooy, whose shot from the edge of the area cannons off a defender and goes out for a corner. 58 min: Torreira seems to have injured himself whilst fouling Connolly. 58 min: Kolasinac is getting stuck into Brighton like they\u2019re a pair of knife-wielding car-jackers. Aubameyang narrowly fails to get a touch to his latest cross from the left. 55 min: Superb work by Bellerin down the right, followed by a cracking cross. Webster gets enough of a touch on it ti deviate it away from Aubameyang, who would have had a tap-in. 54 min: Ljungberg evidently located Arsenal\u2019s mojo at half-time because they\u2019ve come out with fresh intensity in this half and have already posed Brighton more problems than they did in the whole of the first period. 52 min: Brighton\u2019s counter-attack. Connolly has Mooy coming in offering support on the left but he doesn\u2019t see him and goes for goal himself. His shot from the edge of the box goes wide off a defender. Ozil\u2019s corner is flicked on at the heat post by Lacazette and it goes in off the far post. Kolasinac jumped but didn\u2019t need to it help it over the line, which is just as well, as he may have been offside. 50 min: P\u00e9p\u00e9 supplies the overlapping Bellerin, whose cross is deflected out for a corner. 49 min: Strong run by P\u00e9p\u00e9 down the right - he\u2019s made a positive impact so far, adding much-needed thrust and urgency to Arsenal\u2019s attack. But his concluding pass this time falls short of Ozil. 47 min:P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s first contribution is a dinky exchange with Ozil, which enables him to win a corner. Ozil\u2019s delivery is cleared by Burn. Arsenal substitution: P\u00e9p\u00e9 on, Willock off. According to Clive Tyldsley, the new comers \u201chas just gone through the most languid warm-up I have ever seen.\u201d \u201cI was listening to one of those learned podcasts we\u2019re always being encouraged to improve ourselves with, and it turns out that Hope hasn\u2019t always had a good press among the philosophers,\u201d lectures Charles Antaki. \u201cApparently there\u2019s some feeling that Zeus arranged that it should remain in Pandora\u2019s box of vices precisely because it was the most pernicious of the lot. Nietzsche didn\u2019t think much of it either. And now legions of Arsenal fans.\u201d Don\u2019t fret, Charles: Pepe is about to come on .... \u201cBooooooooo!\u201d is the familiar verdict from home fans. Their team have been disjointed and slow, the total opposite of Brighton, who have had the majority of possession and been clever and constructive with it. They know what they\u2019re doing, whereas Arsenal have got nothing but spasmodic bluster and glimpses of talent. The Probability Indicator say Brighton are cruising to victory here, Ljungberg isn\u2019t getting this job full-time and the New Manager will have his work cut out. 45 min: Sokratis booked for sliding into to the back of Connolly\u2019s legs near the corner flag. 44 min: Aubameyang sends over another useful cross from the right. It comes to Lacazette, who goes down under a light challenge by Webster. No penalty, reckons the referee. At first look that seems right. 41 min: Connolly collects a nice pass from Mooy but is too slow to feed Maupay. Otherwise Brighton would have surely been in for goal number two. 40 min: Aubameyang leaves Burn for dead down the right and then measures out a fine cross. Lacazette meets it with a header seven yards out ... and Ryan makes an excellent save! Much better from Arsenal! 39 min: Brighton stream forward anew, and Arsenal are lucky that the final ball towards Connolly is overhit. \u201cThe Arsenal back line simply retreats and retreats,\u201d notes Mary Waltz. \u201cDon\u2019t they know how to challenge a onrushing attacker?\u201d In fairness to them, they are getting zero protection from midfield - Brighton are free to run at them in numbers. 37 min: The sound you can hear is either Arsenal fans whingeing or the Amazon Probability Indicator smashing into a million useless pieces on the ground after being chucked out of a window with righteous vigour .... That\u2019s been coming! Brun nods a corner to the edge of the six-yad box, where Connolly took it down and tried to shoot on the swivel. It as taken off his foot by a defender but fell to Webster, who swept it into the net from eight yards! 35 min: David Luiz, spooked by Connolly\u2019s ferocious pressing, donks the ball straight out of play for a Brighton throw-in, then throws his hands up at the lack of options provided by teammates. Arsenal fans\u2019 grumbling is growing louder ... 34 min: Propper canters through midfield and has a pop from 20 yards. Leno makes another save. Arsenal are increasingly nervous and ragged, other than their goalkeeper. 33 min: Maupay lets fly from 25 yards after a quickly taken Brighton freekick. While Arsenal\u2019s defenders dozed, Leno was alert enough to dive to his left and push the ball away. 30 min: Brighton are having the majority of possession and passing with far more confidence and purpose than Arsenal have mustered so far. 28 min: Arsenal work up a storm around the opposing box. Torreira\u2019s miskick from outside the area finds its way to Aubameyang, whose low effort from the right-hand side wobbles wide. \u201cI\u2019ve been an Arsenal follower since 1953, I\u2019m in my hospital bed in Melbourne recovering after a cancer op,\u201d says Ray Brindle. \u201cAre there any signs so far that the Gunners will give me a hope for a reverse in fortunes?\u201d At the moment I\u2019s say Arsenal\u2019s most likely source of a goal is a penalty, because Brighton\u2019s defenders are quick to grab shirts on the rare occasions Arsenal apply pressure in the box. Soonoer or later the ref is going to spot it, you suspect. Get well soon! 26 min: Mooy\u2019s delivery from the left finds Maupay beyond the far post. The Frenchman takes it down and cracks a fierce low shot just wide of the other post from a difficult angle. 25 min: Three players converge on Connolly at the edge of the Arsenal area but the young striker manages to win a corner. \u201cDoes the Amazon Win Probability Indicator work like Duckworth-Lewis in cricket,\u201d wonders Graeme Thorns. \u201cSo that if the floodlights failed, there was a freak flood submerging the pitch or any other way the match is abandoned, then Arsenal would be awarded the win?\u201d Probably not. 24 min: Ebster gets his head to Gross\u2019 outswinging corner. Leno makes another comfortable save. 23 min: Gross bangs the freekick straight into the wall he had been watching get assembled for the past two minutes. 22 min: No quick freekick by Brighton this time, unlike at Anfield .... Arsenal are still setting up their wall 20 min: Connolly goes down in the Arsenal box as he tries to latch on to a clipped pass by Stephens. Bellerin pulled him back and gets a booking. The ref awards a freekick just outside the box.. 18 min: Connolly jinks on the his right foot at the left-hand corner of the Arsenal box and tries to send a curler into the far corner of the net. But it\u2019s too close to Leno, who makes a straightforward save. 15 min: Steady buildup by Brighton, featuring a nice burst by Mooy past Bellerin. But then David Luiz steps in front of Connolly to make a good interception. 13 min: According to Amazon new-fangled \u201cWin probability indicator\u201d, Arsenal have a 53% chance of winning this match based on the play so far. Brighton have just 15% chance. I put it to you that that is 100% bilge. 12 min: Brilliant interplay between Xhaka, Ozil, Aubameyang and Lacazette before the Frenchman forces a good save from Ryan from 10 yards .... but it wouldn\u2019t have counted, as the flag was up for offside. 10 min: Brighton half-clear a corner. The ball is worked to David Luiz at the right-hand corner of the box. He rasps a low ball across the face of goal. Ryan gets down to snaffle it. 9 min: Ozil and Kolasinc combine down the left before the German sends over a cross that Burn feels obliged to head behind for a corner. Ozil delivers that, too, and Lacazette gets a good flick on it at the near post despite a shove from Gross. 7 min: Xhaka heads a Brighton cross away at the near post. 7 min: Brighton have settled into a nice passing rhythm, but Arsenal are working hard without the ball to restrict space. 5 min: Bellerin fires over a low cross from the right. Ozil tries to flick it on artfully. Alzate puts it out for a corner. Ozil\u2019s delivery is wellied clear at the penalty spot by Maupay. 4 min: [...buffering ...] 3 min: Mooy digs out a cross from the left. It\u2019s hoofed clear by Mesut Ozil, of all people. 2 min: Aubameyang, operating wide on the left it seems, gives the ball away with his first touch. Brighton start passing it around methodically ... until they, too, give it away, and Dunk has to make an important interception to stop Arsenal from taking advantage. 1 min: Arsenal v Brighton is go! But only after Lacazette throws a dummy before taking kickoff. Classic Arsenal. The players enter the arena to warm applause. Ljungberg takes his place in the dugout. He\u2019s wearing a big coat zipped up to his neck so I can\u2019t tell you whether he\u2019s got a shirt and tie underneath: sorry, Paul Scholes. In other news, Newcastle have taken the lead at Sheffiled United thanks to Allan Saint-Maxims first goal for the club. Steve Bruce\u2019s Black and White Army are on the march! And here\u2019s thought for the day, from Justin Kavanagh. \u201cHas Arsenal\u2019s negative goal difference got much to do with the presence of the Brazilian enigma who was at the heart of the 7-1 World Cup semi-final heartbreak, do you think? Clearly, he is a fine footballer, and can deliver a wonderful long pass, but I\u2019ve always had a suspicion that he\u2019d be a much better deep midfielder than a centre-half (who can\u2019t seem to keep track of his marker).\u201d Well, yes, a deep midfielder (or a centreback in a three-man defence) and possibly a better one than any of Arsenal\u2019s current crop. The problem goes beyond one player - Arsenal\u2019s is a very unbalanced squad; and conceding is certainly a problem, but that negative difference is also because they\u2019re not scoring anywhere near as many as they should. Burnley and Villa has netted more than them so far this season. Still, I fancy them to nick another 2-2 today (which is why Aubameyang is my fantasy captain again). Here are the thoughts of Kim \u201cNo Relation\u201d Doyle: \u201cWith Freddie and Per at the helm of the Gunners, I expect the return of quick attacking, one or two touch football. The real problem has been in the defensive midfielder position(s) \u2013 with teams attacker through the middle, almost at will. Torreira needs to return to the combative form that he showed in his first several Arsenal starts of last season. Like the classical Hero the Gunners have gone down to the underworld but now will return to the Land of the Living.\u201d Freddie Ljungberg\u2019s hopes of getting the Arsenal gig on a permanent basis have just suffered a blow: Marco Silva is now available. David Luiz has been stating the obvious: \u201cIn modern football everyone has to understand both moments of the game - attacking and defending ... We have to improve this immediately because it\u2019s been a long time since you can see that nobody can score against us.\u201d As for Brighton, Pascal Gross says the keys to them winning today will be \u201cpatience on the ball, be brave on the ball and then use your chances.\u201d Ljungberg has made three changes to the lineup that started at Carrow Road, with Mustafi jilted to enable Sokratis to return. Bellerin comes in at right-back. Still no place for Pepe, though. Arsenal: Leno; Bellerin, Sokratis, David Luiz, Kolasinac; Willock, Xhaka, Torreira; Ozil; Aubameyang, Lacazette Subs: Martinez, Guendouzi, Tierney, Pepe, Martinelli, Nelson, Chambers Brighton: Ryan; Webster, Dunk, Stephens; Alzate, Propper, Mooy, Gross, Burn; Maupay, Connolly Subs: Bissouma, Duffy, Button, Bernardo, Murray, Trossard, Montoya Referee: G Scott Arsenal have two of the best strikers around - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. Their highest paid player is a creative midfielder. And in the summer they spent a record fee on an exciting forward. So it has taken extraordinary incompetence for them to reach the 14-game mark with a negative goal difference. And that\u2019s just one reason why Unai Emery got the boot. Yes, Arsenal are, in the throes of a crisis. They are desperately seeking a full-time manager and a coherent way of playing. And, er, they are four points and six places above Brighton, who are so happy with their gaffer that they\u2019ve just handed him a six-year contract extension without being asked. The thing is, Graham Potter has given Brighton a sense of direction even if results have yet to live up to the promise shown. He has generated belief. Arsenal, alas, remain a club riddled with doubts, possibly even despair, at least for some. Temporary boss Freddie Ljungberg didn\u2019t do a heck of a lot to change that in his first match in charge even if there were brief spells of encouragement during the draw at Norwich. Let\u2019s see if the visit of Brighton to the Emirates bring any more cheer to Arsenal fans, and justifies the Seagulls\u2019 faith in Potter.",

      "bodyText": "Tufts University has announced it is removing the name of a longtime, major donor from its departments \u2013 that of the Sackler family which owns Purdue Pharma, maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin blamed for fueling the US opioids crisis. The prestigious college on the outskirts of Boston has been a beneficiary of largesse from the billionaire members of the pharmaceutical family whose reputation is at stake amid an avalanche of lawsuits over their role in aggressively pushing sales of OxyContin. Several scientific and medical departments at Tufts have long been named after the Sacklers and the university acknowledged that it had received and solicited gifts from the family over the years. In a statement, Tufts said on Thursday: \u201cOur students, faculty, staff, alumni and others have shared with us the negative impact the Sackler name has on them each day, noting the human toll of the opioid epidemic in which members of the Sackler family and their company, Purdue Pharma, are associated.\u201d In 2013 Tufts\u2019 president, Anthony Monaco, personally traveled to the headquarters of Purdue Pharma in Connecticut to bestow an honorary doctorate on Raymond Sackler, one of the co-founders of Purdue who died in 2017 at 97. The decision to remove the name is highly significant. Leading billionaire members of the Sackler family have given millions to elite colleges and arts institutions in the US and UK. Amid court cases and high-profile protests, some said in the last year that they are no longer taking donations from the family, such as Columbia University, the University of Washington, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim Museum in the US and the Tate art group and the Serpentine gallery in the UK. But most have not taken down the name \u2013 with the notable exception of the Louvre in France, and now Tufts. Others, such as Yale University in Connecticut and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London, have resisted calls to shun Sackler philanthropy, and the V&amp;A was the latest place to suffer a high-profile protest led by the US artist Nan Goldin. Eight members of the Sackler family have been individually named in hundreds of lawsuits brought by US states, counties and cities seeking accountability and damages for the ravages of overdose deaths and opioid addiction blighting communities coast to coast. A group of Sackler family members that own Purdue Pharma are estimated to be worth collectively at least $13bn, generated largely by profits from its opioids business. The family, usually via public relations or legal representatives, has repeatedly and vehemently denied all the allegations in the lawsuits. A statement issued on behalf of the Raymond and Mortimer branches of the family, which include widows and descendants of the late brothers, on Thursday afternoon called the decision to remove the Sackler name by Tufts \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d and hinted at possible legal action in response. Nan Goldin called Tufts\u2019 decision \u201ccommendable\u201d. She said students graduating from colleges with departments named after the Sacklers were suffering as a result of having the family name on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. After battling an opioid addiction herself, the US art photographer launched a campaign to persuade institutional beneficiaries of Sackler donations to shun the money and remove the name. She said that Tufts\u2019 past relationship with the Sacklers was \u201cquestionable and did harm\u201d and referred to the university\u2019s having allowed a Purdue executive, David Haddox, who was on record saying OxyContin was not addictive, to lecture in its pain research program. Goldin added, however, speaking on behalf of her campaign group Prescription Addiction Intervention Now (Pain): \u201cWe commend Tufts wholeheartedly for making this decision \u2026 We hope that other institutions are watching and will follow their brave lead.\u201d Tufts announced on Thursday that it will remove the Sackler name from the university entities carrying it: the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences; the Arthur M Sackler Center for Medical Education; the Sackler Laboratory for the Convergence of Biomedical, Physical and Engineering Sciences; the Sackler Families Fund for Collaborative Cancer Biology Research; and the Richard S Sackler, MD Endowed Research Fund. The name does not appear on the university\u2019s other campuses, it noted. They are all being retitled using the Tufts name instead.

NSW was told to expect wind gusts of 80km/h and high temperatures, and Queensland will likely see temperatures about 12C above average over the next two days, surpassing 40C in the Lockyer Valley and Ipswich. On Thursday night NSW crews responded to five emergency level fires, including the Currowan fire on the south coast, where a number of buildings were believed to have been destroyed. By Friday morning the blazes had all been downgraded, with six fires in the state at watch and act levels. Less than half of the 97 active fires were under control. \u201cI think the really difficult thing is the amount of fire people have seen since the beginning of August, how much fire we\u2019ve had in the northern part of NSW \u2013 well, we\u2019ve just replicated that in the central part of the state as well as still having the north going so it\u2019s quite extraordinary conditions,\u201d the Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers, told the ABC. The 230,000-hectare Gospers Mountain blaze on Sydney\u2019s north-western outskirts was the first fire to reach emergency level on Thursday and, as the day dragged on, there were fears the fire would merge with the 6,000-hectare Three Mile blaze near Wisemans Ferry, which had spread quickly to Mangrove Mountain late on Thursday night. Gary Flynn from the Wisemans Inn Hotel said the small town was \u201cdead quiet\u201d as bushfires burned across the Hawkesbury River. \u201cWe are just copping all the smoke,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cWe are just keeping an eye on things at the moment.\u201d Earlier in the day three firefighters were airlifted from the Green Wattle Creek fireground after they sustained minor injuries battling the blaze. On Friday morning Queensland Fire and Emergency Services issued a watch and act warning for a large fire near Millmerran west of Toowoomba, which had blackened almost 1,200 hectares and was raging in the Western Creek state forest near Cypress Gardens and Forest Ridge. Emergency crews were on alert amid concern that properties have been lost to a fast-moving bushfire on the Darling Downs. Queensland\u2019s south-east coast, Darling Downs and Granite Belt, and the Wide Bay and Burnett districts were under a severe fire conditions warning for Friday, with fire bans stretching up most of the state\u2019s coastal and neighbouring regions. The Bureau of Meteorology predicted showers and thunderstorms for the northern Wide Bay and Burnett area but warned the storms will potentially be severe and produce damaging wind gusts. Almost the entire coastal area of NSW and much of the state\u2019s north-east have a severe fire danger rating for Friday. Total fire bans will be in place for the far south coast and the Monaro alpine, southern ranges, Illawarra-Shoalhaven, central ranges, greater Sydney, the greater Hunter, northern slopes and north-western regions. Meanwhile, the longest period of air pollution on record in NSW is set to continue with the Bureau of Meteorology saying heavy smoke from the bushfires ringing Sydney will linger in the city basin until Saturday. The smoke is being blown from large fires near Warragamba Dam and the Wollombi national park.",

      "bodyText": "More than 30 of Europe\u2019s air pollution and health experts have teamed up with clean air campaigners to highlight a pollutant that is being overlooked in environmental regulations. The health impacts of air pollution have been linked to the mass of particles in the air around the world, but by only weighing them we miss the tiny, ultrafine particles, less than 100 nanometres across. They have little mass but are very numerous. The cloud scientist and meteorologist John Aitken found between 40,000 and 200,000 particles in each cubic centimetre of London\u2019s air in the 1880s. Similar numbers were found when modern measurements began about 15 years ago, suggesting little improvement in more than a century. Things are better today, at about 10,000 particles per cubic centimetre, following laws to clean sulphur from diesel fuel. Due to their small size, ultrafine particles are thought to pass beyond our lungs to have whole-body health impacts including heart attacks, and recent research has pointed to a link with brain cancer. Some sources of ultrafine particles are already being controlled by actions targeted at other pollutants, such as scrubber systems for vehicle exhausts. But other sources are being overlooked including airports, shipping, wood burning and commercial cooking.",

The survey covered the 2015-2016 school year, the most recent year surveyed. That figure doesn\u2019t include schools with armed private security guards or teachers and administrators who carry guns.</p> <p>The US Department of Justice has adopted best practices for resource officers from the National Association of School Resources. Those guidelines call for resource officers to serve as police officers as well as teachers and mentors.</p> <p>Nasro recommends such officers have three years of experience and says they should be willing to engage with students and have excellent communication skills. They should complete a school-based policing course before being assigned to the beat and complete an advanced school policing course Nasro provides within a year of completing the basic course. They also should complete biannual training on how lone officers should handle threats and assailants.</p> <p>No Wisconsin laws spell out any special requirements for resource officers or restrictions on their weapons. But the state department of justice has adopted best practices similar to Nasro\u2019s recommendations, calling for officers to work with schools on the extent of their duties, the skills they need, and where school discipline ends and illegal conduct begins. The state guidelines also suggest officers receive training in child development, restraint policies and de-escalation strategies.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear what led to Tuesday\u2019s stabbing at Oshkosh West high school, which has 1,700 students. The police chief, Dean Smith, said that the officer and the student got into an \u201caltercation\u201d in the officer\u2019s office, the student stabbed the officer with an edged weapon \u2013 Smith declined to elaborate \u2013 and the officer opened fire with his 9mm pistol, hitting the student once. It\u2019s unclear how many times the officer may have fired. Officials said the officer has 21 years of experience with the Oshkosh police department and has served as a school resource officer since 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7359781daea6a49c28a4186204dbb8ec2144c720\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7359781daea6a49c28a4186204dbb8ec2144c720/0_294_3787_2272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Rogstad, right, hugs Morgan Rogstad, grade 9, after the school shooting at Oshkosh West high school.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Rogstad, right, hugs Morgan Rogstad, grade 9, after the school shooting at Oshkosh West high school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wm.

In Parkland, the school\u2019s resource officer remained outside rather than enter the building to engage the shooter and try to stop it.</p> <p>But gun-rights advocates believe having more armed educators and law enforcement in schools will help stop a shooter from going on a rampage.</p> <p>\u201cThis confirms that action can, and should, be taken to mitigate harm and limit casualties when weapons are brought into school,\u201d Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, said on Tuesday.</p> <p>Evers, the Wisconsin governor, said he is committed to working with Republicans who control the legislature on increasing mental health funding for schools.</p> <p>Evers said on WTMJ-Radio that he thinks Republicans will work with him on that, even though they did not provide as much funding for mental health programs as Evers requested in the state budget approved this summer. Republicans also refused to take up a pair of gun safety bills earlier this year that Evers said were part of the solution to combating violence in schools.</p> <p>Evers, a former state superintendent of schools who worked as a principal, school superintendent and administrator before he was elected governor, said the issue is particularly striking for him, given his background and the fact that has three grown children and nine grandchildren. Two of his children attended the high school in Oshkosh where the shooting occurred.</p> <p>\u201cOur kids need help,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around long enough to see how this has amplified over time.

The Democratic governor of Wisconsin, Tony Evers, called the shootings \u201cbreathtaking and tragic\u201d. \u201cThe trauma that happens because of this just ripples through the community,\u201d Evers added. \u201cIt will take time for people to recover from this. Trauma is a significant issue. We have to be patient.\u201d The debate about the role of armed teachers or police in schools has been a constant in the wake of school shootings across the country. But rarely have armed resource officers been able to prevent a shooting. An estimated 43% of public schools have armed officers on campus, according to a survey by the National Center for Education Statistics. The survey covered the 2015-2016 school year, the most recent year surveyed. That figure doesn\u2019t include schools with armed private security guards or teachers and administrators who carry guns. The US Department of Justice has adopted best practices for resource officers from the National Association of School Resources. Those guidelines call for resource officers to serve as police officers as well as teachers and mentors. Nasro recommends such officers have three years of experience and says they should be willing to engage with students and have excellent communication skills. They should complete a school-based policing course before being assigned to the beat and complete an advanced school policing course Nasro provides within a year of completing the basic course. They also should complete biannual training on how lone officers should handle threats and assailants. No Wisconsin laws spell out any special requirements for resource officers or restrictions on their weapons. But the state department of justice has adopted best practices similar to Nasro\u2019s recommendations, calling for officers to work with schools on the extent of their duties, the skills they need, and where school discipline ends and illegal conduct begins. The state guidelines also suggest officers receive training in child development, restraint policies and de-escalation strategies. It\u2019s not clear what led to Tuesday\u2019s stabbing at Oshkosh West high school, which has 1,700 students. The police chief, Dean Smith, said that the officer and the student got into an \u201caltercation\u201d in the officer\u2019s office, the student stabbed the officer with an edged weapon \u2013 Smith declined to elaborate \u2013 and the officer opened fire with his 9mm pistol, hitting the student once. It\u2019s unclear how many times the officer may have fired. Officials said the officer has 21 years of experience with the Oshkosh police department and has served as a school resource officer since 2017. At Waukesha South high school, 80 miles (130km) south of Oshkosh in suburban Milwaukee, a 17-year-old student apparently grew angry with another student and pointed a pellet gun at the other student. The school\u2019s resource officer helped clear students from the classroom. Linda Ager told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the Waukesha shooting happened in the classroom of her husband, Brett Hart, a special education teacher at Waukesha South. Ager said her husband restrained the student until the resource officer arrived. At some point, another officer entered the room and shot the student who refused to drop the weapon. Police said the boy pointed the gun at officers as they confronted him. Police said the student with the pellet gun underwent surgery and was in stable condition. \u201cToday\u2019s tragic event shows that trained school resource officers can save lives,\u201d Vickie Cartwright, the Oshkosh superintendent, said at a news conference on Tuesday. As school shootings have become more frequent, gun rights advocates and gun control advocates have sparred over how best to respond to them. Supporters of gun restrictions have argued that putting more guns in schools does little to prevent shootings and just puts students at greater risk. Last year armed guards at three high-profile school shootings \u2013 Marshall county high school in Benton, Kentucky; Majory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida; and Santa Fe high school in Texas \u2013 were unable to stop those shootings. In Parkland, the school\u2019s resource officer remained outside rather than enter the building to engage the shooter and try to stop it. But gun-rights advocates believe having more armed educators and law enforcement in schools will help stop a shooter from going on a rampage. \u201cThis confirms that action can, and should, be taken to mitigate harm and limit casualties when weapons are brought into school,\u201d Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, said on Tuesday. Evers, the Wisconsin governor, said he is committed to working with Republicans who control the legislature on increasing mental health funding for schools. Evers said on WTMJ-Radio that he thinks Republicans will work with him on that, even though they did not provide as much funding for mental health programs as Evers requested in the state budget approved this summer. Republicans also refused to take up a pair of gun safety bills earlier this year that Evers said were part of the solution to combating violence in schools. Evers, a former state superintendent of schools who worked as a principal, school superintendent and administrator before he was elected governor, said the issue is particularly striking for him, given his background and the fact that has three grown children and nine grandchildren. Two of his children attended the high school in Oshkosh where the shooting occurred. \u201cOur kids need help,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around long enough to see how this has amplified over time. The time is now to take it on.\u201d",

As it stands they have a squad where most of the players were signed before the appointment of the director of football, Marcel Brands, whose appointment predated the lining up of Silva.</p> <p>Little wonder there is a confusion of methods here. Brands\u2019 most notable piece of recruitment is Moise Kean, a client of his friend Mino Raiola, who is still to score for the club and whom Silva seems to regard with a sense of mild bemusement.</p> <p>Ambition, flux, a congealment into energetic mediocrity: this has been the story of so many clubs at this level. The real game-changer here would have been to keep Silva, to make him settle and work with the players, to stay a while and grow roots for the first time in his elite career. The easier way was to sack him. Either way, a more profound change than simply the man with the coat and the face is required.</p>",

Four of Liverpool\u2019s goals involved simply running straight through Everton\u2019s midfield and defence and putting the ball in the net, meeting on the way no resistance, no sense of coherent planning. Silva will bear responsibility for this. But who bears responsibility for Silva, or indeed for the sense of wider drift? Everton have spent around \u00a3450m on players under their current structure and recouped half as much, an incoherent splurge that has brought them to a place where there is widespread surprise that a team containing Theo Walcott and Alex Iwobi should seem so decoratively fragile. There is talk of a boardroom split on what kind of manager Everton should be seeking, what kind of style they should expect, a fissure that runs through the everyday component parts. As it stands they have a squad where most of the players were signed before the appointment of the director of football, Marcel Brands, whose appointment predated the lining up of Silva. Little wonder there is a confusion of methods here. Brands\u2019 most notable piece of recruitment is Moise Kean, a client of his friend Mino Raiola, who is still to score for the club and whom Silva seems to regard with a sense of mild bemusement. Ambition, flux, a congealment into energetic mediocrity: this has been the story of so many clubs at this level. The real game-changer here would have been to keep Silva, to make him settle and work with the players, to stay a while and grow roots for the first time in his elite career. The easier way was to sack him. Either way, a more profound change than simply the man with the coat and the face is required.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 6 December. Top stories A shadowy group has used some of Facebook\u2019s largest far-right pages to create a commercial enterprise that harvests anti-Islamic hate for profit and influences politics across the globe, a Guardian investigation has revealed. The Israel-based group has churned out thousands of coordinated posts to more than 1 million followers over the past two years, funnelling audiences to a cluster of 10 advertisement-heavy websites to milk the traffic for profit. The revelations show how Facebook has failed to stop clandestine actors from using its platform to run coordinated disinformation and hate campaigns. Nancy Pelosi has asked the judiciary committee to proceed with articles of impeachment against Donald Trump. Quoting from the Declaration of Independence and the founding fathers about the danger of a president betraying the country\u2019s trust to foreign powers, the House speaker announced on Thursday that she was directing the judiciary committee to draft articles of impeachment. \u201cThe president leaves us no choice but to act,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cSadly, but with confidence and humility, with allegiance to our founders and a heart full of love for America, today I am asking our chairman to proceed with articles of impeachment.\u201d A leading Uighur activist, Rushan Abbas, has urged Australian MPs to take a stronger stance against the Chinese regime, while backing controversial comparisons between the state\u2019s authoritarianism and Nazi Germany. Abbas, who met MPs in Canberra on Thursday and held a roundtable at the US embassy on the plight of the Uighur Muslim minority in China\u2019s Xinjiang province, said \u201cmodern day\u201d concentration camps holding as many as 3 million Uighurs were a case of \u201chistory repeating itself\u201d. Australia Angus Taylor has doubled down on his assertion he saw and met the US author Naomi Wolf during his time at Oxford University, while demanding she apologise for accusing him of antisemitism. The State Emergency Service was \u201cnot happy\u201d that its volunteers were used as support people during the strip-search of children and ordered two members to leave a music festival in NSW last weekend due to a fear of the \u201clegal ramifications\u201d, an inquiry has heard. The Labor party\u2019s national president, Wayne Swan, will issue a call to arms for progressive parties to fight back against misinformation, declaring nothing can be off the table \u201cincluding breaking up the social media platforms where the concentration of their market power is damaging society\u201d. Footage showing cattle having their horns removed has prompted renewed calls for the use of pain relief to be made mandatory on Australian cattle stations. The Block star Scott Cam will be paid $345,000 for 15 months\u2019 work as the national careers ambassador, employment department officials have revealed. In OctoberMichaelia Cash announced Cam\u2019s appointment to the role promoting vocational education, but refused to reveal his pay, arguing it was \u201ccommercial in confidence\u201d. The world An Indian woman has been set on fire on her way to a court hearing to testify against two men who had allegedly raped her. The 23-year-old is in a critical condition with 70% burns after she was attacked by five men in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh. They dragged her to a field, doused her with petrol and set her alight. Israel\u2019s state prosecutor plans to indict several associates of Benjamin Netanyahu, including his cousin, for corruption in relation to a contentious A$2.8bn deal to buy German submarines. More than 450,000 people have marched in cities across France as railway workers, teachers and hospital staff held one of the biggest strikes in decades against Emmanuel Macron\u2019s plans to overhaul the pension system. North Korea has threatened to redeploy its arsenal of formidable insults against Donald Trump, referring to him once more as a \u201cdotard\u201d if he continues to use nicknames like \u201cRocket Man\u201d for Kim Jong-un.

      "bodyText": "The Times is looking to expand further into radio amid speculation that its parent company, News UK, is considering rebranding the station talkRadio as Times Radio in the new year. Staff at the station have been discussing the potential relaunch in recent weeks, with the speculation over potential high-profile departures increasing after the talkRadio presenter Matthew Wright publicly cast doubt on his future at the station. Wright returned to air on Wednesday to say he did not know \u201c[what] is going on, truth be told, whether it be the general election or Brexit or my own future\u201d, following claims on MailOnline that he had been sacked. A spokesperson for the station said no decision had been taken on whether to rebrand the station: \u201cTalkRadio has grown its audience and has presenters that are well loved by their listeners. The Times currently sponsors the Julia Hartley-Brewer breakfast show and we are exploring ways to work more closely with the Times across the station.\u201d They said the Times radio project was being overseen by Stig Abell, a former managing editor of the Sun and current editor of the Times Literary Supplement, who has experience as a broadcaster. Wright has since told listeners he had been expecting to leave at Christmas but had instead been offered more work with the station. \u201cWe were told we were going to be signing new contracts. So we\u2019ve not been fired with immediate effect. We\u2019re not going our separate ways as I thought might happen at Christmas. \u201cWe\u2019re here into the new year and maybe even beyond. There\u2019s never a dull moment on talkRadio.\u201d News UK\u2019s chief executive, Rebekah Brooks, has made a substantial push into radio, relaunching stations including talkRadio and Virgin Radio and moving their studios into the company\u2019s main headquarters in London Bridge, where they sit alongside the Sun and the Times. News UK coaxed the former Radio 2 breakfast show host Chris Evans over to Virgin Radio, while also putting substantial resources into talkRadio and its sister station, talkSport. However, News UK\u2019s ambitions were recently dented when talkSport lost senior staff to the audio division of the deep-pocketed sport startup the Athletic. Other presenters on talkRadio include Eamonn Holmes, James Whale and Iain Lee. The station launched in its current form three years ago and its audience has grown by more than 50% in the past year. It is still only reaching a relatively small audience of 409,000 people a week compared with 2.6 million at its long-established rival LBC.",

      "bodyText": "Facebook has come under fire this week after a hoax story about women being abducted in white vans went viral on its platform. The site\u2019s algorithms are thought to have perpetuated the circulation of the story. The story resulted in a TV appearance on Monday by Baltimore\u2019s mayor, Jack Young, who warned citizens that the white vans are abducting women for sex trafficking and selling their body parts, even though the claims have not been substantiated. \u201cIt\u2019s all over Facebook,\u201d he told a local news station. The platform says it is is now trying to stop the misinformation from spreading even further \u2013 by limiting the circulation of viral posts that are perpetuating it. This week, the Guardian uncovered a far-right network pushing out thousands of fake news articles about the US congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. When the Guardian notified Facebook of its investigation, the company removed several pages and accounts \u2013 but not because they were spreading misinformation. The media platform removed only content that \u201cappeared to be financially motivated\u201d. Here are some other unsubstantiated stories that remain on the platform. 1 Trump\u2019s grandfather, the pimp, and his father, the KKK member A story from the American Herald Tribune claiming that Donald Trump\u2019s grandfather was a pimp and a tax evader continues to circulate on Facebook. It also claims that the president\u2019s father, Fred Trump, was a KKK member. The article was thought to be shared almost 30m times, despite having no substantial evidence to support its claims. Fred Trump was detained during a KKK protest in Queens, New York, in 1927, but he was released without charges. Trump\u2019s grandfather, Frederick Trump, owned hotels and restaurants in Seattle. The Trump family biographer Gwenda Blair said that one such restaurant in the middle of Seattle\u2019s red-light district, the Dairy, advertised \u201crooms for ladies\u201d \u2013 commonly thought to be a euphemism for prostitution. However, there is no evidence that he was a pimp \u2013 something Blair herself stated. 2 Ilhan Omar attended an al-Qaida training camp Another false story that had an estimated 77,000 views claims that Omar attended an al-Qaida training camp. It comes from a photo taken at a Mogadishu training camp by the Associated Press in 1978, three years before Omar was born. Facebook flagged the post as fake as part of its goal of reducing fake news on the site, but it continues to circulate elsewhere online. In October, the North Dakota state senator Oley Larsen shared the debunked post on Facebook. 3 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to ban motorcycles A story claiming that the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to ban motorcycles in the US was shared online more than 12m times on Facebook, and has since been debunked. It comes from the website Taters Gonna Tate and quotes Ocasio-Cortez as saying: \u201cBesides like, what I just said? A lot of these like, motorcycle people, OK, they\u2019re like: \u2018Ooh, look at me, I\u2019m all old and fat and tough and I voted for Trump and smell like wet dog.\u2019\u201d Although the website is clearly satirical, articles written on it have been taken seriously \u2013 including one that claims Ocasio-Cortez believes that soldiers are paid too much. A Louisiana police officer shared that article in a Facebook post in July, calling Ocasio-Cortez a vile idiot and saying she should be shot. 4 Holocaust denial content Facebook has repeatedly made the case that it is not the job of the platform to remove Holocaust denial content. Mark Zuckerberg memorably defended the rights of Facebook users who post Holocaust denial content in 2018, saying that he didn\u2019t \u201cthink that they\u2019re intentionally getting it wrong\u201d. He later added that he found Holocaust denial \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d, but maintained that the platform\u2019s role is not to remove things that people get wrong.",

      "bodyText": "A founding member of the pop band Level 42 who quit the music industry because of mental health issues and moved to Devon took his own life, a coroner has concluded. Guitarist Rowland \u201cBoon\u201d Gould, 64, was found dead at a friend\u2019s home in Uffculme, Devon, on 30 April this year. He had previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and told doctors he had suffered from depression all his life, the inquest in Exeter was told. The assistant Devon coroner Deborah Archer described Gould as a talented and much-loved musician. But she said: \u201cBoon had a difficult and complex history, which I find adversely affected his mental health. \u201cHe had coped with these issues sometimes without being completely open and honest with family and friends about the degree of suffering that he was going through.\u201d The coroner said Gould tried different types of therapy but did not find anything that consistently worked for him. She said this was likely due to his \u201cwish not to trouble others and the deep-seated nature of his problems, coupled with a tendency to self-medicate\u201d. Gould\u2019s wife, Moira, said her husband had been \u201copen\u201d about his mental health problems during their 17-year marriage. \u201cHe talked about how exhausting it was to be him,\u201d she told the inquest. \u201cHe had constant voices in his head. He had a constant internal battle.\u201d His wife described Gould as intelligent, modest and caring but eccentric and fun. Dr Clare Matthews, his family doctor, said Gould had a long history of mental health problems and alcoholism. The inquest heard Gould told doctors he consumed a bottle or half a bottle of whisky per day. \u201cHe became a successful guitarist and led a lifestyle characterised as heavy drinking, cocaine drug abuse and mental health problems, which ultimately led to him retiring from the music business in the 1990s,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cHe retired to move to Devon for a quieter life.\u201d Det Sgt Lucy Skinner, of Devon and Cornwall police, said Boon was last seen alive buying whisky and coke from a local shop on 27 April, three days before his body was found. The inquest heard that in the year before he died, he became agitated at being asked to do jury service. He caused damage at the family home and disappeared, sparking a police search. A post mortem concluded he died from hanging and there was a small amount of alcohol in his system. Charles Dixon, a psychiatrist, said Gould suffered mood swings all his adult life but that at times he felt invincible and would write songs in the middle of the night. After his death, Gould\u2019s brother and band member, Phil Gould, wrote that his heart was \u201cbeyond broken\u201d. The Level 42 vocalist Mark King described Gould as a \u201cdear friend and brother\u201d. The coroner concluded Gould had taken his own life.

The state-owned oil business will emerge as the world\u2019s most valuable listed company after valuing its shares at 32 riyals ($8.53) apiece before its float on Riyadh\u2019s stock exchange next week. At this price the mega-float would exceed the record $25bn debut of the Chinese online retailer Alibaba to make Aramco\u2019s IPO the biggest in history. The listing would also topple Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable listed company by valuing Aramco\u2019s total market worth at $1.7tn. Apple is valued at $1.17tn. Aramco confirmed the price of its shares late on Thursday before the start of trading on 12 December. The record-breaking market listing is towards the higher end of Aramco\u2019s recent expectations but it still falls well short of the ambition of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman to value the country\u2019s economic crown jewels at $2tn. The prince revealed plans to sell a stake of the world\u2019s most profitable company in 2016 as part of his plan to modernise the Saudi economy, but the IPO\u2019s ambition has been steadily scaled back in recent months. Aramco plans to list just 1.5% of the company on the local Tadawul stock exchange after marketing the float almost exclusively to investors in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. It was originally expected to sell about 5% through a dual-listing on the Saudi market and on a major international stock exchange. The IPO lost the support of international investors, which are sceptical of the company\u2019s valuation. Investors are also wary of Aramco\u2019s close ties to the Saudi regime, which is embroiled in geopolitical conflict and whose behaviour has raised human rights concerns. Among local investors demand for Aramco shares was almost three times oversubscribed after the Saudi government encouraged Middle Eastern investors and wealthy Saudi families to support the IPO.",

A vicious spiral can set in, where an exodus of bright young people leads to a declining skills base in their old home towns; companies become reluctant to invest there, creating even fewer reasons for the next generation to stay. Big cities are getting younger, and southern towns are ageing roughly in line with national trends. But many of the smaller towns that Boris Johnson must win to get a majority are quietly haemorrhaging the age group most likely to vote Labour, and becoming dominated by a more hostile one, while younger people\u2019s votes pile up in the big cities where Labour was already strong.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just about pensioners\u2019 greater tendency to have backed Brexit, either. These are sweeping generalisations with many individual exceptions, but older people tend to hold socially conservative attitudes on issues such as immigration and defence; pensioners have been relatively shielded too from the long post-crash <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/19/uk-millennials-second-worst-hit-financially-in-developed-world-says-study\" title=\"\">squeeze on wages</a> and working-age benefits, at least compared to the young. And voters who remember the hard left in the 1980s may be more sceptical about Corbynomics than those to whom it\u2019s new and exciting. Brexit has driven a new wedge between Labour and its former heartlands, but the truth is they\u2019ve been growing apart for years, in ways not easily reversed by last-minute offers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/15/jeremy-corbyn-promises-free-broadband-under-labour-video\" title=\"\">free broadband</a>.</p> <p>In the south, meanwhile, human geography plays out very differently. Places such as Canterbury became richer pickings for Labour in 2017, just as Cheltenham and Guildford are now for the Lib Dems, at least partly because these towns are changing as 30-something professionals find themselves priced out of London. Young families seeking somewhere affordable to live have spread first to the outer suburbs and then beyond, across Surrey and Gloucestershire and Kent and Sussex, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/10/surrey-commuters-marginal-voters-election-tories-guildford\" title=\"\">bringing socially liberal attitudes</a> and frustration with the economic status quo into once sleepy market towns and villages. (If the Canterbury effect isn\u2019t working for Labour as it did in 2017, that\u2019s perhaps because the Lib Dems are more competitive this time around among these mainly remain-leaning voters.)</p> <p>As the Centre for Towns report stresses, demographics can\u2019t explain everything; they\u2019re just part of a bewildering jumble of social and economic changes, some pulling the result one way and others another. But the pattern it identifies suggests the Tories should be closing the gap in northern towns while Labour should be piling up votes in cities such as Bristol, which is indeed what we saw in 2017. What drives elections may not always be individuals changing their minds, but places slowly changing over the years as a consequence of decisions both politicians and voters have often unwittingly made.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/digital-election-what-demographics-are-the-parties-targeting\">Digital election: what demographics are the parties targeting?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Old habits die hard, so knowing all this won\u2019t stop us political junkies obsessing over every moment of the last few days.

This isn\u2019t just about pensioners\u2019 greater tendency to have backed Brexit, either. These are sweeping generalisations with many individual exceptions, but older people tend to hold socially conservative attitudes on issues such as immigration and defence; pensioners have been relatively shielded too from the long post-crash squeeze on wages and working-age benefits, at least compared to the young. And voters who remember the hard left in the 1980s may be more sceptical about Corbynomics than those to whom it\u2019s new and exciting. Brexit has driven a new wedge between Labour and its former heartlands, but the truth is they\u2019ve been growing apart for years, in ways not easily reversed by last-minute offers of free broadband. In the south, meanwhile, human geography plays out very differently. Places such as Canterbury became richer pickings for Labour in 2017, just as Cheltenham and Guildford are now for the Lib Dems, at least partly because these towns are changing as 30-something professionals find themselves priced out of London. Young families seeking somewhere affordable to live have spread first to the outer suburbs and then beyond, across Surrey and Gloucestershire and Kent and Sussex, bringing socially liberal attitudes and frustration with the economic status quo into once sleepy market towns and villages. (If the Canterbury effect isn\u2019t working for Labour as it did in 2017, that\u2019s perhaps because the Lib Dems are more competitive this time around among these mainly remain-leaning voters.) As the Centre for Towns report stresses, demographics can\u2019t explain everything; they\u2019re just part of a bewildering jumble of social and economic changes, some pulling the result one way and others another. But the pattern it identifies suggests the Tories should be closing the gap in northern towns while Labour should be piling up votes in cities such as Bristol, which is indeed what we saw in 2017. What drives elections may not always be individuals changing their minds, but places slowly changing over the years as a consequence of decisions both politicians and voters have often unwittingly made. Old habits die hard, so knowing all this won\u2019t stop us political junkies obsessing over every moment of the last few days. Nor is it to denigrate the heroic efforts of people out knocking on doors in the freezing cold and dark, each time hoping this conversation is the one that makes the difference. But elections are won in the years leading up to them, not the weeks. This time more than ever it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that the letter is already in the post, even if nobody yet knows what it says; that all we\u2019re really doing, in these last frantic days, is keeping busy until we can open it. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

Private pension funds are waiting in the wings to benefit.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cThe gilets jaunes protests got people thinking and talking more about politics and people determined not to let things pass. You can feel a defiant mood in the air.\u201d</p> \n<p>The standoff is a crucial test for the centrist president, whose planned overhaul of the pensions system was a key <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/07/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidency-marine-le-pen\">election promise</a>. Macron\u2019s office said he was following events closely \u201cwith calm and determination\u201d.</p> \n<p>The government argues that unifying the pensions system \u2013 and getting rid of the 42 \u201cspecial\u201d regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris Opera staff \u2013 is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. But unions say introducing a universal system for all will mean millions of workers in both the public and private sectors must work beyond the legal retirement age of 62 or face a severe drop in the value of their pensions.</p> \n<p>The row cuts to the heart of Macron\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/15/macron-finds-elitist-tag-hard-to-shake-but-he-has-the-upper-hand\">presidential project</a> and his pledge to deliver the biggest transformation of the French social model and welfare system since the postwar era. Since his election in 2017, Macron has leaned towards a Nordic style of \u201cflexi-security\u201d in which the labour market is loosened and the focus is on changing from a rigid work code to a society of individuals moving between jobs.</p> \n<p>While many voters agree the pensions system should be changed, they are not sure the pro-business president can be trusted to do it.

      "bodyText": "More than 800,000 people have marched in cities across France as railway workers, teachers and hospital staff held one of the biggest public sector strikes in decades against Emmanuel Macron\u2019s plans to overhaul the pension system. A nationwide transport strike brought much of France to a standstill and was expected to continue for the next few days as unions dug in, saying the president\u2019s pension changes would force millions of people to work longer or receive lower payments. Trains, metros and bus services were severely hit, some flights were cancelled and many schools were closed in the biggest challenge to Macron\u2019s reform agenda since the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) anti-government protests erupted last year. In Paris, police briefly fired teargas during skirmishes with black-clad protesters on the edges of the trade union-led march in the early afternoon. Some protesters set fire to a storage trailer, smashed windows and a bus shelter, and overturned cars. Firefighters put out small fires lit in bins. More than 6,000 riot police lined the route of the demonstration from Paris Gare du Nord to the east of the city, while groups of officers stopped people walking towards the demonstration and searched bags. By late afternoon there had been more than 70 arrests and 9,000 searches. Riot police in Nantes, western France, fired teargas at masked protesters, who hurled projectiles at them. The Paris march included hospital staff, electricity workers, firefighters, teachers and school pupils as well as gilets jaunes protesters who had taken part in blockades on roundabouts earlier this year. Banners read: \u201cMacron out.\u201d Isabelle Jarrivet, 52, who had worked as an administrator in a town hall north of Paris for 20 years, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a question of life or death for the French social system, which Macron is dismantling. We\u2019re being taken back to a time before 1945, where we risk losing the social safety net. Private pension funds are waiting in the wings to benefit.\u201d She added: \u201cThe gilets jaunes protests got people thinking and talking more about politics and people determined not to let things pass. You can feel a defiant mood in the air.\u201d The standoff is a crucial test for the centrist president, whose planned overhaul of the pensions system was a key election promise. Macron\u2019s office said he was following events closely \u201cwith calm and determination\u201d. The government argues that unifying the pensions system \u2013 and getting rid of the 42 \u201cspecial\u201d regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris Opera staff \u2013 is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. But unions say introducing a universal system for all will mean millions of workers in both the public and private sectors must work beyond the legal retirement age of 62 or face a severe drop in the value of their pensions. The row cuts to the heart of Macron\u2019s presidential project and his pledge to deliver the biggest transformation of the French social model and welfare system since the postwar era. Since his election in 2017, Macron has leaned towards a Nordic style of \u201cflexi-security\u201d in which the labour market is loosened and the focus is on changing from a rigid work code to a society of individuals moving between jobs. While many voters agree the pensions system should be changed, they are not sure the pro-business president can be trusted to do it. A recent Ifop poll found 76% of people back pensions reform, but 64% do not trust the government to pull it off. Public transport unions said they would extend their strike until at least Monday, after 90% of TGV and regional trains were cancelled and nearly all lines on the Paris metro were affected. Sandrine Berger, an engineering lecturer at a Paris university and a representative for the leftwing CGT union, said: \u201cThis is about protecting public services, which are being chipped away and turned towards an American model of privatisation.\u201d She criticised the government for suggesting public sector workers were privileged. With two PhDs, a 26-year career and a senior job running a department of 70 people, Berger said she earned \u20ac2,200 (\u00a31,860) a month before tax, including bonuses. Gr\u00e9gory Chaillou, a fire officer, said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see this through to the end. The public understands the need to support public services and workers.\u201d As commuters in Paris turned to using bikes and scooters, the environmental group Extinction Rebellion claimed responsibility for the sabotage of 3,600 electric scooters in Paris and other French cities, saying the green image of the fashionable gadgets hid an \u201cecologically catastrophic\u201d reality. Extinction Rebellion said it had sabotaged the scooters, including more than 2,000 in Paris as well as in Bordeaux and Lyon, by obscuring the QR codes that riders use to unlock them with their smartphones. \u201cContrary to their reputation as a \u2018soft\u2019 or \u2018green\u2019 way of getting around, the electric scooters are ecologically catastrophic,\u201d the group said in a statement on its French Facebook page.",

      "body": "<p>In the context of one of the most worrying threats to liberty and the constitution in decades, the future of John Bercow may seem a petty matter. Yet if you seek a small indication of how a Boris Johnson majority government might behave more generally, then whether Mr Bercow is given a peerage might offer the public an insight. Ever since the 18th century, almost every Commons Speaker, good or bad, has been given a peerage when they step down. Mr Bercow has not yet been offered one but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic\" title=\"\">told the Observer</a> last month that he \u201cwould accept, if it was offered\u201d.</p> <p>The point here is not whether the automatic peerage convention is a good one, or the House of Lords an institution worth preserving. Neither proposition gets our vote. The point is whether a decision to single out Mr Bercow, if it happens, indicates a more general appetite in Mr Johnson\u2019s Tories for revenge against its enemies and a more peremptory approach against those with the temerity to get in the way of Brexiter orthodoxy and dogma. The election campaign has raised that possibility. When Channel 4 held its party leaders\u2019 climate debate last month, Mr Johnson did not turn up.

      "bodyText": "In the context of one of the most worrying threats to liberty and the constitution in decades, the future of John Bercow may seem a petty matter. Yet if you seek a small indication of how a Boris Johnson majority government might behave more generally, then whether Mr Bercow is given a peerage might offer the public an insight. Ever since the 18th century, almost every Commons Speaker, good or bad, has been given a peerage when they step down. Mr Bercow has not yet been offered one but told the Observer last month that he \u201cwould accept, if it was offered\u201d. The point here is not whether the automatic peerage convention is a good one, or the House of Lords an institution worth preserving. Neither proposition gets our vote. The point is whether a decision to single out Mr Bercow, if it happens, indicates a more general appetite in Mr Johnson\u2019s Tories for revenge against its enemies and a more peremptory approach against those with the temerity to get in the way of Brexiter orthodoxy and dogma. The election campaign has raised that possibility. When Channel 4 held its party leaders\u2019 climate debate last month, Mr Johnson did not turn up. The broadcaster decided to empty-chair him for the debate with a melting ice sculpture, whereupon the Conservative party threatened to review Channel 4\u2019s licence if elected. This week the broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, rejected a Tory party bias complaint against Channel 4. In the event of a Johnson win, it may be a matter of time before Ofcom, too, finds itself in the dock. These examples may seem the rough-and-tumble of an election campaign. There is reason, however, to suspect that they are more than that: this may be the shape of things to come if the Conservatives win. The best reason for thinking this is found in the party\u2019s manifesto itself.

because of changes in corporation tax.</p> \n<p>A Conservative party statement later tried to clarify Johnson\u2019s position. \u201cOur manifesto does not propose increasing taxes on UK resident

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has claimed that all-out strikes on public transport will be made illegal under a new Conservative administration following major disruption on UK train routes. \u201cI do think it\u2019s absurd that critical transport mass-transit systems should be capable of being put out of actions by strikes, and other countries around the world have minimum service requirements for public transport \u2013 and that\u2019s what I want to see,\u201d said Johnson in front of an audience of textile workers near Matlock in Derbyshire. The Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union (RMT) said its members on South Western Railway (SWR) were \u201cstanding firm\u201d on the second of 27 planned strikes over the role of guards on trains. On new trains due to start running next year, SWR wants drivers to operate the doors at every stop to save time. The move to Derbyshire on Thursday by Johnson\u2019s campaign highlighted the Tories\u2019 hope to break through the so-called \u201cred wall\u201d of traditional Labour seats. Appearing at the John Smedley factory, Johnson was asked if he would \u201cabsolutely promise\u201d to get a trade deal with the EU by the end of the transition period in December 2020. \u201cI\u2019ve absolutely no doubt at all that we\u2019ll be able to make sure that the EU protects its own interests and has a deal with us that ensures that continues for the future. \u201cIf you say \u2018can I absolutely guarantee that we\u2019ll get a deal\u2019, I think I can and I\u2019ll tell you why \u2013 look at what we achieved \u2026 in three months with the new deal that I did,\u201d said the prime minister. Asked if it was a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d, Johnson said: \u201cThe possibility you allude to [of not getting a deal within a year] simply will not happen.\u201d Questioned about suggestions in the Times and the Telegraph that the government would cut taxes in a February budget \u2013 contradicting the party\u2019s manifesto, which shows taxes will go up \u2013 Johnson said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about \u2026 We\u2019re cutting taxes on business rates, we\u2019re cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country, everybody paying NICs.\u201d The Tory manifesto document shows that the party plans to reduce the government\u2019s tax receipts by \u00a33.195bn in 2020-21 while government revenue through taxation would increase by \u00a33.32bn. Although personal taxes would go down, the overall tax burden would increase because of changes in corporation tax. A Conservative party statement later tried to clarify Johnson\u2019s position. \u201cOur manifesto does not propose increasing taxes on UK resident companies and would not put up personal taxes for hard-working Brits,\u201d it said. \u201cWe have been very clear that we are pausing future corporation tax cuts, and will invest this money into our NHS.\u201d Earlier Johnson apologised \u201cfor any offence caused\u201d by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. The prime minister was confronted over the issue on ITV\u2019s This Morning by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, who said Muslims had been hurt and offended by his remarks. Johnson replied: \u201cPeople dig out all sorts of articles \u2026 I\u2019ve already said sorry for any offence caused and I say it again.\u201d The prime minister claimed his words had been taken out of context, and added: \u201cWhat [the Conservatives] have to do is have an inquiry over xenophobia and prejudice of all kinds.\u201d The original article written in the Telegraph last year argued the burqa should not be banned even though it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letterboxes\u201d.

      "bodyText": "For Brazil\u2019s embattled civil society activists, the government\u2019s distortion of truth has taken many forms since the ultra-right militarist Jair Bolsonaro took power at the beginning of this year. But it has hit a menacing new level after last week\u2019s police raid on an Amazonian NGO and the arrest of four volunteer firefighters who are accused of setting alight the forest they risked their lives to protect. Even by the standards of the past 11 months, the detentions in Alter do Ch\u00e3o, and the confiscation of equipment at the headquarters of Sa\u00fade e Alegria, or the Health and Happiness Project, in Santar\u00e9m have proved shocking for those involved \u2013 and those who fear they may be next. Until recently, Brazilian NGOs\u2019 greatest fear was being publicly smeared by a president who has baselessly accused Greenpeace of creating oil slicks, environmentalists of starting forest fires and Leonardo DiCaprio of bankrolling the arson. Now activists worry the powers of the state are being used to criminalise their activities. \u201cThe executive has been investing in new tactics of repression,\u201d Camila Marques from the free-speech watchdog Article 19 said during a webinar of NGOs this week. \u201cWe have never seen intelligence agencies, police and services so active in monitoring and surveillance of social movements. We are facing a scenario of arbitrary imprisonments.\u201d The case in Santar\u00e9m is seen as a bellwether. Shortly after dawn last Wednesday, half a dozen federal police armed with semi-automatic weapons showed a warrant and demanded entry to the premises of Health and Happiness Project \u2013 a long-established NGO that has worked with Prince Charles, Caritas, Coca-Cola and many other international partners. Staff turned up for work expecting to organise medical assistance, sanitation or solar power for remote forest communities \u2013 but instead found state agents examining documents and hauling off computers and files. \u201cI was afraid at first, then angry,\u201d said Jarine Reis, who is responsible for projects related to gender, tourism and traditional art. \u201cI could taste the wrongness in my mouth.\u201d Members of the group felt the raid was politically motivated \u2013 and part of a broader assault on civil society by the government of Bolsonaro. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable in a democracy. This show of force is disproportionate. We feel violated and disrespected,\u201d said Paulo Lima, a senior coordinator. \u201cUnfortunately, though, at this moment in Brazil, political polarization is leading to a criminalisation of civil society.\u201d The mood of disbelief and fear grew stronger as news came in that one of Health and Happiness\u2019s chief logistical officers, Gustavo Fernandes, had been arrested, along with three other men. The four had set up their own volunteer fire brigade to help the authorities tackle forest blazes in Alter de Ch\u00e3o, one of Brazil\u2019s beloved resort towns and a mecca for artists and nature lovers. The riverside community is also a heartland of the environmental movement in Brazil. The four men were initially denied bail and their heads were shaved. Families and friends believe they were targeted to reinforce Bolsonaro\u2019s claim in August that environmental activists were responsible for the worst Amazonian fires in a decade \u2013 rather than his own government, which has weakened forest protections and encouraged loggers, miners and land grabbers. Bolsonaro and the environment minister, Eduardo Salles, praised the detentions. Civil police said the suspects were under investigation for arson. Local media alleged \u2013 without proof \u2013 that they started a huge fire in September so they could take photographs for fundraising from the WWF and others. But the fragility of the case was quickly apparent. Federal prosecutors challenged the validity of the investigation, saying they looked into the allegations in September and found nothing to suggest any causal link between the fires and the volunteer brigade. In a public statement, they said the evidence pointed instead to land grabbers and property speculators, who use fire to clear forest and drive up its commercial value. The case was further weakened when the suspects provided alibis that showed they were far from the fires when they started \u2013 in one case, on a plane. As doubt grew, the governor of Par\u00e1 replaced the chief investigator and a judge ruled the men should be released until their court hearing. Friends of the arrested men say all four left jobs in S\u00e3o Paulo so they could live closer to nature in Alter do Ch\u00e3o and work with tourism, permaculture and forest protection. They said the founder, Daniel Gutierrez \u2013 a 36-year-old photographer and tourist operator \u2013 worked with the authorities, received training from the state fire brigade, and went out of his way to be politically neutral. \u201cEverybody is in shock. Nobody can believe it,\u201d said Priscila Cotta, who has known the men for several years. \u201cWhy would those who fight fires start fires? Everyone knows they devote themselves to the forest.\u201d Others, who are reluctant to give their names due to fears of retribution, believe the raid and arrests may be linked to land speculation. Gutierrez was planning to start an organisation that would create a deforestation firewall that would prevent a sprawl of tourist resorts along the bank of the Tapaj\u00f3s River. Members of Health and Happiness \u2013 which has no formal links with the volunteer brigade \u2013 have not been charged with any crime, but the police confiscation of computers and files has paralysed the group\u2019s operations, including a hospital boat that was due to carry 40 doctors and nurses and 14 tonnes of medicine and equipment to a remote community on the Arapiuns River. Other NGOs warn this could be just the start of a crackdown. With the government planning to tighten restrictions on public protests and relax regulations on the police, the space for civil society looks set to shrink. The Brazilian Association of Non-Governmental Organizations said the government was pursuing a strategy to delegitimize civil society. Amnesty International\u2019s executive director in Brazil, Jurema Werneck, said Bolsonaro\u2019s tactics echoed similar moves in Russia, India and Hungary. \u201cThe rhetoric of the president and other government officials creates an environment of extreme vulnerability for NGOs, activists and human rights defenders,\u201d she said. Those already in the midst of this assault say they have been living a nightmare. \u201cEach day seems 100 hours long, we never have time for anything, and we feel that someone has declared war on us,\u201d said Caetano Scannavino, a co-founder of the Health and Happiness Project. But he retained faith in Brazil\u2019s institutions to right a wrong, and expressed gratitude for the many people who have given support. \u201cWe have received huge solidarity from all sides.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s total wealth grew by 13% in the two years to 2018 to reach a record \u00a314.6tn, with wealth among the richest 10% of households increasing almost four times faster than those of the poorest 10%. A study by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also found that the poorest 10% of households had debts three times greater than their assets compared with the richest 10% who amassed a wealth pile 35 times larger than their total debts. The figures highlight the growing divide between those at the top of the wealth ladder, many of whom have retained their pension rights, property values and invested their savings since the 2008 financial crash, while those on low incomes live in rented accommodation with meagre pension entitlements and rising debts The Resolution Foundation thinktank said the wealth gap had opened up between 2016 and 2018 after the top 10%\u2019s wealth increased by 11% in contrast to an increase in wealth for the bottom 10th of just 3%. The different rates of growth documented by the ONS Wealth and Assets survey meant the top 10% finished 2018 with 45% of national wealth, while the poorest 10th held just 2%. Much of the wealth gap could be accounted for by a rise in the values of homes owned by the better-off that has prevented those lower down the income scale from getting on the property ladder. The foundation said the lack of first-time buyers from lower income groups in recent decades was only partially offset by an expansion of pension saving following the auto-enrolment reforms. The survey also found that regional wealth gaps have grown, with the fastest pace of growth found in the south-east. Typical household wealth in the south-east is \u00a3445,900, more than twice as high as the north-east at \u00a3172,900. The foundation said despite the UK\u2019s record level of wealth, typical wealth in the north-east and east Midlands in 2016-18 was still below its pre-crisis level. George Bangham, a research analyst at the foundation, said the Gini coefficient, an international measure of wealth inequality, was almost twice as high at 0.63 as income inequality at 0.34. \u201cWealth has a huge impact on people\u2019s living standards over the course of their lives, from getting on the housing ladder to drawing down on pension savings later in life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while wealth has been largely ignored as a political issue in this election campaign, it is playing an increasingly important role in shaping the future of our economy and society.\u201d Labour has promised to tax the income from wealth at the same level as income from work if it achieves a majority in the general election, pushing up the rate of capital gains tax (CGT) to 40p in the \u00a31. The Conservative party has pledged to maintain CGT at 28%, but said a rise in the national insurance personal threshold will cut a major tax on income. A separate report by the ONS on the nation\u2019s growing debt pile showed that total household borrowing reached \u00a31.28tn in 2018, of which 9%, or \u00a3119bn, was financial debt and \u00a31.16tn, or 91%, was mortgage debt. Sarah Coles, a financial analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was disturbing that the number of households with personal, non-mortgage debts had increased from 12.4 million to 12.7 million since 2016 and that the average household\u2019s debts had risen to \u00a39,400, up 11% on 2016. She said discounting \u00a332bn of student loan debt still left \u00a387bn in loans, credit cards, hire purchase agreements, overdrafts and arrears that needed to be paid off each month. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous burden of debt and interest to be facing each month, and it keeps rising,\u201d she said.",

In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no-deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs at the end of this year. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2020?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further potential Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing another tough year in 2020. The latest rise in the national minimum wage in April will also add to costs and hit profits. On the plus side, there are hopes of a boost to the housing market from increased certainty about Brexit after the general election. There are also signs that the shift to online shopping is slowing, potentially easing the pressure on high streets.</p>\n    <p><b>Sarah Butler</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Dunelm\u2019s established stores are thought to have experienced a 2% increase in sales, despite a tough market in which other homeware retailers have been struggling.</p> \n<p>The slowdown in the housing market and low consumer confidence amid political and economic uncertainty has held back spending on expensive items such as furniture, kitchen appliances and carpets.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/carpetright\">Carpetright</a> recently agreed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/15/carpetright-agrees-15m-sale-to-main-investor-meditor\">cut-price \u00a315m sale to its biggest shareholder</a> after it made a pre-tax loss of nearly \u00a325m in the year to April.

Carpetright recently agreed a cut-price \u00a315m sale to its biggest shareholder after it made a pre-tax loss of nearly \u00a325m in the year to April. The sale came after the retailer closed more than 90 showrooms last year in a rescue restructure as it fights off competition from loss-making rival Tapi. Meanwhile, the loss-making furnishings chains Harveys and Bensons for Beds were sold off by their troubled South African parent company Steinhoff last month.",

The size of these outbreaks is very large.\u201d She said the outbreaks were having a severe impact on the provision of other healthcare in countries where provision was already stretched, she said. The solutions involved better vaccination services and boosting public confidence, O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHesitancy is high on our radar screen and on our risk register now and into the future. We\u2019re very concerned about science deniers, we\u2019re very concerned about misinformation and we\u2019re very concerned about the ability of families, community leaders and even the political world to discern the difference between accurate scientific information, proven information and this misinformation. \u201cAnti-vaccine messages are not new. But what is new is the tools with which and the opportunity for these messages even from a small fringe group of people to disseminate very widely and to portray themselves as if they are accurate pieces of information, which they are not.\u201d Social media companies are beginning to help by taking down blatant misinformation and directing people to reliable sources such as Public Health England, the WHO or the CDC in the US. O\u2019Brien said healthcare workers needed to be well prepared to answer vaccine questions, and young people needed to be educated about science, illness, vaccines and credible sources. \u201cThey will be the parents of the future and we really think that there\u2019s a lot that could be done now to essentially immunise young people against misinformation,\u201d she said.",

Richard Falkenh\u00e4ll, a senior FX strategist at the Nordic bank SEB, said sterling\u2019s recovery could be short-lived because a Conservative win would increase the risk of the UK falling out of the EU without a trade deal by the end of next year.",

Background In an interview with Sky News Javid said that homelessness had peaked in 2008 under a Labour government. He said it had halved since then. He said that when he was housing secretary the government had prioritised cutting homelessness. Reality Official figures showed that in 2017/18, 56,600 households were accepted as being in priority need of housing. That figure is below the peak of 135,000 recorded in 2003/04 under a Labour government, but an increase from the 40,000 in the year before the coalition government came into power. Figures for the number of households in temporary accommodation, including B&amp;Bs and hostels, showed a similar trajectory. According to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, there were 84,740 households in temporary accommodation in the first quarter of 2019, including 126,020 children.

Last year, 6,463 of the \u201caffordable\u201d homes that were built were to be let at the traditional social rent, while 26,838 were to be available at the higher \u201caffordable rent\u201d. Changes to local housing allowance, which froze payments, together with the benefits cap, the move to universal credit, and the withdrawal of housing benefits for young adults have also added to the number of people struggling to afford somewhere to live. Recently, the Chartered Institute of Housing found that housing associations were denying housing to homeless people who they feared would fall behind on rent. Figures for homelessness are never entirely accurate \u2013 government data captures the number of households who have been accepted by their local council as in need of accommodation, or the number of rough sleepers on a given night, but this is not the whole picture. The number of people sofa-surfing, or living in overcrowded family accommodation because they have no other option is impossible to capture. The housing charity Shelter has estimated that the overall 277,000 people are homeless in England on a given night. Verdict Homelessness did rise under Labour \u2013 but it had fallen by the time the Conservatives came to power and has increased since. Javid\u2019s claim is misleading.",

      "bodyText": "A wealthy businessman who is the prime suspect in the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia has told a court in Malta that he received regular tipoffs about the investigation from the former government chief of staff Keith Schembri. Yorgen Fenech, who was charged last week for allegedly masterminding the 2017 killing, appeared in court to seek the removal of the police chief leading the case, saying he was too close to Schembri. His testimony in a packed courtroom piled further pressure on Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, who has said he will stand down next month after his party elects a new leader. The prime minister is a friend of Schembri, who resigned last week and was briefly arrested in connection with the investigation. He was released without charge and has denied any wrongdoing. Fenech has denied accusations of complicity in the murder and has instead blamed his close friend Schembri, who was Muscat\u2019s righthand man and the architect of his two electoral victories. Fenech said Schembri had passed on information from briefings that the chief investigator, Keith Arnaud, gave at Muscat\u2019s office. This meant he knew swiftly about key developments, including that his own phone had been tapped, Fenech said. Schembri\u2019s lawyer did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Fenech\u2019s testimony. Arnaud made no immediate comment but the police last week issued a statement saying there was no reason for his removal and that the investigation was proving effective. Fenech did not address the murder allegations levelled against him and is due back in court on 10 December. But he said that following his arrest, Schembri managed to pass him notes on two occasions telling him what to say in interrogations. He ignored the advice and instead implicated Schembri. At that point, he said police rushed to charge him and skated over the allegations he was making. \u201cBut all the recordings and evidence link Schembri with the murderers,\u201d he told the court hearing. The self-confessed middleman in the murder, Melvin Theuma, who has been given legal immunity in return for providing evidence, told a court on Wednesday that Fenech was the sole mastermind behind the killing. Caruana Galizia was a campaigning journalist who regularly accused government ministers and business leaders of corruption. On Thursday, a European parliament delegation to the Mediterranean country said the integrity of the murder inquiry remained at risk while Muscat was still in power. Muscat was \u201cnot convincing\u201d over why he should delay his resignation until mid-January, said Sven Giegold, a German Green MEP who took part in a two-day emergency mission to Malta. The European parliament delegation welcomed progress in the murder inquiry but said its integrity remained at risk while Muscat stayed in office. \u201cThe next 40 days will be crucial, also for trust in the integrity of the investigation,\u201d said a statement from the MEPs. Giegold said Muscat told the group he would not be in a position to destroy evidence in the case. The MEP described their encounter this week as \u201cnot a friendly meeting\u201d . Giegold said Muscat seemed quite different to the \u201cvery self-confident\u201d man he recalled from previous meetings. \u201cThis time it was totally different. He was on the defensive. He admitted misjudgment when it came to his chief of staff, Keith Schembri.\u201d Giegold said EU leaders would find themselves in a difficult position if Muscat attended a European council summit next week. \u201cThe decision to stay on for four more weeks puts Malta into difficulty and puts Europe into difficulty, because who wants to shake hands at the Euro summit with this prime minister,\u201d he said.

The Liberal MP Andrew Hastie sparked a storm of controversy when he penned an opinion piece in the Nine newspapers in August, comparing the west\u2019s complacency about China to France\u2019s response to the rise of authoritarian Germany in the lead up to the second world war. Abbas, the executive director of the Campaign for Uyghurs, said she strongly backed the comparison, saying the first German concentration camps were built in 1933 while the country was still trading with other democratic countries.

Labelling the mass detention of Uighurs as the \u201cunprecedented atrocity of the century\u201d, Abbas hit out at western countries, including Australia, for being too timid in the face of China\u2019s authoritarianism. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201c[This] is the largest incarceration of one ethnic group since the Holocaust, since world war two \u2013 why we are not getting much attention in the international media? \u201cIt\u2019s because China is using its economy and the market for silencing the world population. \u201cChina has become a power able to strong-arm the world \u2026 and with all that they are actually successfully silencing the world communities,\u201d she said. She urged Australia to do more to raise human rights concerns in its dealings with China, saying the west could use its combined economic might to pressure China.

The foreign minister, Marise Payne, has tasked parliament\u2019s joint standing committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade to conduct an inquiry into Australia\u2019s legal standing in response to international human rights abuses. Such legislation has already gained support from the Labor senator Kimberley Kitching and the Liberal senator James Paterson. Last month, Payne labelled reports of China\u2019s mass internment of Uighurs as \u201cdisturbing\u201d and called on China to end arbitrary detention, following leaked internal Chinese government documents which included directives from the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to \u201cshow absolutely no mercy\u201d in the \u201cstruggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism\u201d.

I only saw a few ads for the WBBL before it started, and I feel that there could be a bit more done to get media coverage of games. It\u2019s not an easy ask \u2013 women\u2019s sport in general is lacking media exposure and that\u2019s not easy to change.

But it\u2019s actually been really good \u2013 with not a lot of other cricket happening in Australia for most of the WBBL season, people have flocked to watch us. We\u2019ve had great crowds and people watching on the live stream \u2013 so it shows that people want to watch cricket at this time of year and with a bit more promotion we can keep building on that.</p> <p>It\u2019s obviously been a big season for us at Adelaide Strikers and I\u2019m really looking forward to playing in the finals this weekend. To be honest, I\u2019m not mad that we\u2019re not hosting it in Adelaide because Brisbane is probably my second favourite place to play. We always get great crowds at Allan Border Field; it\u2019s a really nice place to play cricket, so we\u2019re feeling relaxed and confident going in.</p> <p>We\u2019re very lucky to have such a great culture in our group. We have a laugh and genuinely enjoy each other\u2019s company and I think that\u2019s really hard to achieve. The WBBL is a short tournament, but it\u2019s so intense and we spend almost every day together, so the love is really important and I think we\u2019ve got that.</p> <p>Our focus for the weekend is just going to be on staying calm. The only time we\u2019ve been in a semi-final before, we got thrashed, so this time we want make sure we go in calm and knowing that we deserve to be there.</p> <p>We\u2019ve pretty much played in every scenario possible this season. We\u2019ve had super overs, we\u2019ve thrashed teams and we\u2019ve been thrashed. We don\u2019t know what the finals will bring, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be some great, exciting cricket that will really live up to the festival atmosphere of our first standalone season.</p>",

We always get great crowds at Allan Border Field; it\u2019s a really nice place to play cricket, so we\u2019re feeling relaxed and confident going in. We\u2019re very lucky to have such a great culture in our group. We have a laugh and genuinely enjoy each other\u2019s company and I think that\u2019s really hard to achieve. The WBBL is a short tournament, but it\u2019s so intense and we spend almost every day together, so the love is really important and I think we\u2019ve got that. Our focus for the weekend is just going to be on staying calm. The only time we\u2019ve been in a semi-final before, we got thrashed, so this time we want make sure we go in calm and knowing that we deserve to be there. We\u2019ve pretty much played in every scenario possible this season. We\u2019ve had super overs, we\u2019ve thrashed teams and we\u2019ve been thrashed. We don\u2019t know what the finals will bring, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be some great, exciting cricket that will really live up to the festival atmosphere of our first standalone season.",

This deeply personal song is the perfect comeback vehicle, and showcases her still-impressive range, with a subtle 60s-leaning backing track giving her breathing space to command such a weighty song. Lyrically, MacRae speaks of allowing a new lover into your family home \u2013 literally and metaphorically. \u201cMaybe this time around,\u201d she sings hopefully, over a swinging soul backing, \u201cmaybe I got it right.\u201d</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Listen to MacRae\u2019s other new single, Up Above Your Head.</p> <h2><strong>Sunnyboys \u2013 Can\u2019t You Stop</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>The Saints (mid-80s version), Richard Clapton, The Raspberries</p> <p>It\u2019s only the slight rasp in Jeremy Oxley\u2019s voice \u2013 which speaks of thousands of cigarettes and decades of hard living \u2013 that betrays the fact that this song wasn\u2019t recorded in 1981 with the rest of the classic debut album that launched the Sunnyboys into legendary status. Oxley\u2019s schizophrenia, and the drugs and drink he used to deal with it, split the band apart in 1984 and this is their first single since. Thankfully, not a lot has changed: the guitars still ring out, the band\u2019s harmonies are as sunny and lazy as ever, and the production shows no signs of the modern era. This is Aussie radio rock, the type of tune that echoed around surf clubs and RSLs back when a cloud of cigarette smoke stained every ceiling, beers were as cheap as a Sunnyboy ice block, and there was a band on every corner.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>The career-spanning compilation Sunnyboys 40 is out now; the band will be touring the east coast in February 2020.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0dea3a44aeb07f9a4171a22500335ecfbee36906\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dea3a44aeb07f9a4171a22500335ecfbee36906/0_0_1440_2160/667.jpg\" alt=\"Stella Donnelly.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The perfect summation of an Australian Christmas lunch\u2019: Stella Donnelly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helge Brekke</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Stella Donnelly \u2013 Season\u2019s Greetings</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Frente, C86, Sarah Records</p> <p>An aptly titled single to ring in the silly season, this song \u2013 like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLVzHv9Nrng\">regrettably relatable video clip that accompanies it</a> \u2013 is the perfect summation of an Australian Christmas lunch spent with parents who don\u2019t understand and \u201call your idiot cousins\u201d (in this case, ones that worship Donnelly\u2019s mother over the other aunties because she was a punk when younger). Musically, it is spritely and breezy, the opposite of the heavy, meat-filled meal it chronicles and the arguments that arise when brandy slides into beer into wine. A fitting sleigh bell solo jingles in, before the judgmental words \u201cfuck up your life\u201d ring over and over as the song fades out.

Danny McDonald is one of the finest purveyors of sunny Australian power pop, replete with jangling Rickenbackers, references to beaches and suburban pursuits, and the chronicling of an endless summer while basking in small, special details \u2013 it\u2019s psycho-geography in song. Cordylines are a common feature of the Australian garden, complementary to palm trees and other tropical plants but tolerant of the cold and shade. It\u2019s an apt metaphor for the sunshine that McDonald spins out of chilly Melbourne winters, one eye looking back longingly at a past of milk bars and P76s, the other firmly fixed on the horizon, where there\u2019s always another summer on its way and another song to soundtrack it.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Danny McDonald\u2019s Modern Architecture EP is out February 2020.</p> <h2><strong>Stevan \u2013 Warm</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Frank Ocean, Erykah Badu, Rex Orange County</p> <p>A shimmering song from this young Wollongong artist, Warm does exactly what it says on the tin, wrapping the listener in blankets of cosy harmonies and reassuring sentiments.

But across four albums and a handful of standalone singles, they have rarely dialled it back from 11 \u2013 the result being that when they do, songs such as the tender Saramona Said are hailed as standouts. A-OK is another, a beautifully muted ballad built on an acoustic guitar and a countrified slide. The grunge acts of the early 90s that Violent Soho echo had a penchant for this type of acoustic excursion, so it makes sense that the Brisbane band is starting to pepper them through their catalogue. A-OK was released at the same time as the rockier Vacation Forever \u2013 and while the latter has received most of the attention, thanks to its prescient anti-boomer sentiment, A-OK is more exciting, opening the door to future unplugged possibilities.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Violent Soho\u2019s fifth album is due in early 2020.</p> <h2><strong>Scott &amp; Charlene\u2019s Wedding \u2013 Back In The Corner</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Lower Plenty, Lou Reed, the Twerps</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/02/the-20-best-songs-of-2019-tracks\">The 20 best songs of 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s an overused quote most often ascribed to Brian Eno: only 1,000 people bought the first Velvet Underground album, but all 1,000 formed a band. Lou Reed and co\u2019s influence shows no signs of slowing 52 years later , and Back In The Corner drips with Reed\u2019s laconic attitude, and his reliance on a few chugged chords. The playing is the right side of loose, the production is suitably lo-fi but bright enough to jump out of the speakers, and like all the best rock\u2019n\u2019roll tunes, this could have been produced at any point in the last half-century and still command attention. It\u2019s good to see Scott &amp; Charlene\u2019s Wedding back in the mix.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out their new EP: When In Rome, Carpe Diem.</p> <h2><strong>Kota Banks - Big Bucks</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Charli XCX, M\u00d8</p> <p>Kota Banks is \u201ctoo fucking busy for a boyfriend\u201d in this unashamed and playfully exaggerated ode to excessive wealth, based on \u201ca daydream I had whilst in London about living luxe, wearing designer brands and staying in nice hotels\u201d, as she explains in a press release. With thumping production from Melbourne\u2019s Swick, and a string of world-class singles that sharpen with each release, this fantasy might become a reality soon for the 25-year-old Sydney artist.

Much like the tortured tales of betrayal Pete Doherty and Carl Bar\u00e2t flung at each other as the Libertines collapsed in a heap of heroin abuse and litigation, Ugly finds the Origliasso sisters trading not-at-all coded accusations about their own fractured relationship, raking over what went wrong. \u201cHow can you honestly say I don\u2019t have your back,\u201d asks Lisa of Jess. \u201cYou trade your diamonds for rubies\u201d is a not-so-veiled reference to the <a href=\"https://people.com/celebrity/ruby-rose-slams-girlfriend-twin-for-alleged-homophobic-comment/\">public spate the twins had regarding Jess\u2019s ex-partner Ruby Rose</a>, who accused Lisa of homophobia.

This narrative carries over to the Veronicas\u2019 new reality show which sees the twins constantly bickering like \u2026 well, twins. Not surprisingly, Ugly doubles as that show\u2019s theme song: a hooky diary entry of a tune with the twin refrains, \u201chow\u2019d we get so ugly?\u201d and the pleading, \u201cyou know blood is for life\u201d.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Tune into their MTV show The Veronicas: Blood is for Life.</p> <h2><strong>Hachiku \u2013 Shark Attack</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Rachel Yamagata, Frankie Cosmos, Hatchie</p> <p>Not a song about sex \u2013 despite there being a hair stuck in a throat, a smell that lingers, the licking of fingers, and a sexy swing that speaks of seduction despite the use of the decidedly un-sexy word \u201csaliva\u201d. It\u2019s actually about the traumatic death of a dog, and its impact on a teenager who relied upon their shared love as a proxy for human connection. Singer Anika Ostendorf, 25, was born in America, grew up in Germany and eventually ending up interning at Milk! Records, where she fell in love with the label\u2019s handmade quality and DIY ethos.

Bad urban design is a barrier to what should be the smooth flow of life in cities. It ruins commutes and can make daily life unnecessarily difficult for disabled and elderly people. Guardian Australia spoke to experts and chose a few of the worst examples across Australia \u2013 from the crossing chaos of Sydney\u2019s Central Station to the train stations in the middle of freeways in Perth. But we want to hear your examples too, both general and specific. Tell us your experiences in the comments below. Sydney: \u2018Urban design mistake 101\u2019 Crossing in almost any direction from Sydney\u2019s Central Station is an ordeal. But on the east side, the voyage across Elizabeth Street is such a crush of bodies that police are sometimes deployed to manage the crowd. \u201cThere are three crossing points that are missing,\u201d says Benjamin Driver, senior urban designer at Hill Thalis Architecture. \u201cIt squashes hundreds of people at one time between two columns. That to me is urban design mistake 101.\u201d Driver\u2019s solution is to add multiple single crossing points all around, or to make the entire thing a large, square scramble \u2013 like the one at the corner of Park and George streets in the CBD. The installation of the new light rail station \u2013 due to open on 14 December \u2013 has made the problem even worse. That one crossing is now a bottleneck for pedestrians, train traffic and a bike path that is frequently blocked by crowds of people waiting to cross the road. The crossing signal for the light rail tracks is so close to the road, its sound frequently gets confused for the road crossing. People can often be seen stepping out into the traffic on busy Elizabeth Street after hearing the light rail signal. \u201cThis is one of the most intense intersections in the city,\u201d Driver says. On the other side, the situation is hardly better. At Railway Square, where George Street becomes Broadway, the pedestrian crossing narrows to a very small triangle. From two wide and busy crossings, people are funnelled into a small area with barely enough standing room, as cars and buses whizz dangerously close by. \u201cIt comes historically from the way the trams used to meet and interchange,\u201d Driver says. \u201cIt used to be a big, beautiful flat square, people used to get off the tram and just walk across that square.\u201d But the popularity of cars has widened Broadway, and made the crossing increasingly hostile.

Melbourne: \u2018A bridge that is too low\u2019 The Montague Street bridge needs almost no introduction. Its story can be told in two perfect headlines. From May 2016: Safety upgrade to begin on Melbourne\u2019s accident-prone Montague Street bridge. And June 2016: Upgrade to Montague Street bridge fails to stop truck getting stuck \u2013 again. It is, quite simply, a bridge that is too low. Or, looked at another way, it is a street that frequently bears trucks that are too high. The three-metre-high bridge in South Melbourne has its own dedicated webpage: howmanydayssincemontaguestreetbridgehasbeenhit.com. It\u2019s at 29 at time of publication. Adelaide: \u2018Not enough footpath to walk on\u2019 The bugbear of Daniel Bennett, the South Australian president of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, is how car-centric Adelaide can be. \u201cWe have 300-odd laneways in the city, and in my former role at City of Adelaide we converted a lot of those,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ones that we haven\u2019t done are infuriating because there\u2019s no footpath, there\u2019s a little bit of bitumen and curb, there\u2019s not enough to walk on.\u201d Three in particular stand out: Coromandel Place, French Street and Chesser Street behind Grenfell Street where \u201cmost of the buses come in\u201d. Instead of being comfortable pedestrian spaces, Bennet says, residents are constantly in fear of getting hit by cars. A similar issue is West Terrace, on the west side of the city centre, and how it intrudes on to the CBD. \u201cAdelaide is brilliant because it has this parkland 770 hectares around the city,\u201d Bennet says. \u201cBut there is one bit of the main road that comes into the city, you\u2019ve actually excised a tenth of the parklands by one road \u2013 West Terrace. \u201cIt is impossible to cross, it takes you forever, it is really unfriendly to people trying to cross through it to parklands. If we made it smaller, maybe two or three lanes in each direction as opposed to seven or eight, and pushed all the traffic outside the parklands, you\u2019d solve it.\u201d Brisbane: \u2018Noisy and ugly infrastructure\u2019 \u201cAny Brisbane street in which the roadbed is wider than the bordering buildings are tall is an example of terrible urban design,\u201d says Dorina Pojani, a senior lecturer in urban planning at the University of Queensland.

      "body": "<p>Christmas is not an ideal time for a writer because you have to go home and explain to your family what you do. They all have real jobs, your family. They all do normal things and have normal salaries and are normal. \u201cHow\u2019s \u2026 what is it again, writing?\u201d they ask. And I nod and say: good, yeah. \u201cWhat sort of thing do you write about?\u201d I am picking all of the Bounty bars out of the box of Celebrations as a stalling method. I am trying not to make eye contact with my little cousin, who just told us about his karate brown-and-white belt. The Christmas music seems to have tapered off. My voice breaks a little, goes soft. \u201cJosh Brolin\u2019s sunburned arsehole,\u201d I tell them, quietly. My aunt says she didn\u2019t quite catch that. Could I repeat it? And in a loud voice, directly into Val\u2019s ear, I have to tell her: JOSH BROLIN\u2019S SUNBURNED ARSEHOLE.</p> <p>Listen, Brolin sunburned his arsehole, allegedly, and we need to look into this, so to speak. To set this up: a recent wellness trend is to sun your perineum, because \u2026 I don\u2019t know, the perineum is good at absorbing sunlight? I don\u2019t know. Josh Brolin says he tried it. On Instagram this week, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5ddxy6ggyW/\" title=\"\">he wrote</a>: \u201cTried this perineum sunning that I\u2019ve been hearing about and my suggestion is DO NOT do it as long as I did. My pucker hole is crazy burned and I was going to spend the day shopping with my family and instead I\u2019m icing and using aloe and burn creams because of the severity of the pain.\u201d He then went on to use three premium-quality swearwords in a 15-word sentence before dropping the hashtag \u201c#santamonicafiredepartment\u201d. Johnny Knoxville commented: \u201cTaint\u2019 that a shame.\u201d He\u2019s very famous, Val, OK! He was on Jackass! I know you know what Jackass is!</p> <p>Let\u2019s work through your questions methodically and in order, shall we?</p> <p><strong>Do we truly believe Josh Brolin, Thanos from</strong> <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy, gruff no-eyed everyman and Oscar nominee, burned his tenderness so severely that he had to slide a handful of aloe gel in there and just hope for the best?<br></strong>On the one hand, I do not feel that Brolin did expose his hole directly to the sun. The evidence for this is thus: Brolin is known to be quite a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshbrolin/?hl=en\" title=\"\">weird, anarchic presence on Instagram</a>, a refreshing antidote to the more PR-approved, comments-workshopped, wrinkles-erased work of his peers. Saying you pelted your anus with the raw power of the sun works easily into that; Brolin accompanied the caption with a generic photograph of someone (not him) sunning themselves, anally. It was more a cautionary tale than an actual document of his life as he is living it; if you burned your arsehole, would you tell anyone about it?</p> <p>But then a small part of me believes that, yes, Brolin <em>did</em> expose himself to the sun, and it went wayward. Previous form suggests Brolin is a comfortable nudist; he lives in Los Angeles, where people do that sort of thing; if the sun was there, and the trend to expose your penny to it was prevalent, and you had access to the sort of wide-ranging garden space or balcony that might allow you to do such a thing in relative privacy, would you not try it also? I think everyone around this table can agree that if we had enough sun in this country we would singe ourselves raw under the power of it. No, I <em>won\u2019t</em> lower my voice! I don\u2019t <em>care</em> if I\u2019m talking over the Queen\u2019s speech! Pause it if it\u2019s that important to you!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"835a0f407cdd7ef396290aeecb91c839547c41ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/835a0f407cdd7ef396290aeecb91c839547c41ab/983_125_1859_2236/831.jpg\" alt=\"Shailene Woodley\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shailene Woodley: an advocate for novel ways of absorbing vitamin D.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Swan Gallet/WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How is this the fault of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/15/shailene-woodley-interview-luxury-having-been-actor-since-five\" title=\"\">Shailene Woodley</a> from the doomed YA film series Divergent?<br></strong>It isn\u2019t, directly, but she is a famed pioneer of intimate sunburn, so I am choosing to connect the dots. If you don\u2019t remember Woodley from her pre-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/big-little-lies-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">Big Little Lies</a> days, her previous form was a sort of proto-Paltrow who clattered through press engagements <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/style/shailene-woodley-big-little-lies.html\" title=\"\">talking about nature and moss</a> and the idea of water having chemicals in it and things like that. She was big \u201cI have an oil for that\u201d energy, The Girl In Your Halls Who Wore Harem Pants And Didn\u2019t Talk About Her Dad\u2019s Finance Job. In 2014, <a href=\"https://intothegloss.com/2014/03/shailene-woodley-hair/\" title=\"\">she told Into the Gloss</a> that, well: \u201cI like to give my vagina a little vitamin D. I was reading an article written by a herbalist I studied about yeast infections and other genital issues. She said there\u2019s nothing better than vitamin D. If you\u2019re feeling depleted, go in the sun for an hour and see how much energy you get. Or, if you live in a place that has heavy winters, when the sun finally comes out, spread your legs and get some sunshine.\u201d</p> <p>No, I ... no, I know you can put a good word in for me at the shop, but really I think the writing thing is \u2013</p> <p><strong>What is \u201cperineum sunning\u201d? Is Perineum Sunning married? What is Perineum Sunning\u2019s net worth?<br></strong>As wellness trends go, PS is one of those that sort of is a trend and very much isn\u2019t, in that exactly one wellness blogger (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/metaphysicalmeagan/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Metaphysical Meagan</a>\u201d) has extolled the virtues of it, posting about it in mid-November and saying it was an \u201cancient Taoist practice that originated in the Far East\u201d (ancient Taoists were revolving in their graves at high speed, horned up and furious that modern wellness bloggers are saying that they spent their lives pointing themselves anus-first towards the sun). The New York Post picked up the idea and linked it tenuously to the 1986 book The Tao of Sexology. Basically, no one really thinks this is a good idea and no one really does it. But it only takes one, doesn\u2019t it? It only takes one person to be wellness-influenced into mooning the sun and someone will figure a way to make a billion dollars out of it (\u201cDon\u2019t get caught sunning without your Schurr\u2019s Intimate Crystal\u2122 \u2013 a smooth and comfortable quartz plug that intensifies the sun\u2019s healing rays\u201d).</p> <p>Maybe we are all wrong. Maybe in five years\u2019 time we will all be in the local park, heads down, asses up, saluting the sun in the worst possible way. Maybe I am the idiot and Josh Brolin, tenderly sitting on a bag of ice wrapped in a tea towel, is a galactic-brained pioneer.</p> <p><strong>Wouldn\u2019t you think that flaring your cheeks open and pointing the tender in-between bit at the most powerful force in our universe </strong><strong>would lead, quite naturally, to sunburn</strong><strong>?<br></strong>My concern with this is that the sun is really bad for your skin, even in winter. If you leave the house without sunblock on, you are just asking to age prematurely. And that\u2019s your face I\u2019m talking about. We have not even explored the idea of trying to turn the nozzle round on the Ambre Solaire and honk a mist of factor 50 directly into the depths. If Brolin did expose his piece to the sun, then surely now he must have the anus of an 80- or 90-year-old man, an anus in shreds, an anus on the absolute edge.</p> <p>So the takeaway lesson from this is: probably let\u2019s not sun our perineums. Take a vitamin D tablet if you need sunlight so bad. Yes, Val, I\u2019ll look into adult education. Yes, I know it\u2019s not too late to retrain. Yeah, I \u2013 no, maybe I could look into teaching, something like that. Something normal. I\u2019ll make you proud one day, I promise. I\u2019ll make you stop being so ashamed of me.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Christmas is not an ideal time for a writer because you have to go home and explain to your family what you do. They all have real jobs, your family. They all do normal things and have normal salaries and are normal. \u201cHow\u2019s \u2026 what is it again, writing?\u201d they ask. And I nod and say: good, yeah. \u201cWhat sort of thing do you write about?\u201d I am picking all of the Bounty bars out of the box of Celebrations as a stalling method. I am trying not to make eye contact with my little cousin, who just told us about his karate brown-and-white belt. The Christmas music seems to have tapered off. My voice breaks a little, goes soft. \u201cJosh Brolin\u2019s sunburned arsehole,\u201d I tell them, quietly. My aunt says she didn\u2019t quite catch that. Could I repeat it? And in a loud voice, directly into Val\u2019s ear, I have to tell her: JOSH BROLIN\u2019S SUNBURNED ARSEHOLE. Listen, Brolin sunburned his arsehole, allegedly, and we need to look into this, so to speak. To set this up: a recent wellness trend is to sun your perineum, because \u2026 I don\u2019t know, the perineum is good at absorbing sunlight? I don\u2019t know. Josh Brolin says he tried it. On Instagram this week, he wrote: \u201cTried this perineum sunning that I\u2019ve been hearing about and my suggestion is DO NOT do it as long as I did. My pucker hole is crazy burned and I was going to spend the day shopping with my family and instead I\u2019m icing and using aloe and burn creams because of the severity of the pain.\u201d He then went on to use three premium-quality swearwords in a 15-word sentence before dropping the hashtag \u201c#santamonicafiredepartment\u201d. Johnny Knoxville commented: \u201cTaint\u2019 that a shame.\u201d He\u2019s very famous, Val, OK! He was on Jackass! I know you know what Jackass is! Let\u2019s work through your questions methodically and in order, shall we? Do we truly believe Josh Brolin, Thanos from Guardians of the Galaxy, gruff no-eyed everyman and Oscar nominee, burned his tenderness so severely that he had to slide a handful of aloe gel in there and just hope for the best? On the one hand, I do not feel that Brolin did expose his hole directly to the sun. The evidence for this is thus: Brolin is known to be quite a weird, anarchic presence on Instagram, a refreshing antidote to the more PR-approved, comments-workshopped, wrinkles-erased work of his peers. Saying you pelted your anus with the raw power of the sun works easily into that; Brolin accompanied the caption with a generic photograph of someone (not him) sunning themselves, anally. It was more a cautionary tale than an actual document of his life as he is living it; if you burned your arsehole, would you tell anyone about it? But then a small part of me believes that, yes, Brolin did expose himself to the sun, and it went wayward. Previous form suggests Brolin is a comfortable nudist; he lives in Los Angeles, where people do that sort of thing; if the sun was there, and the trend to expose your penny to it was prevalent, and you had access to the sort of wide-ranging garden space or balcony that might allow you to do such a thing in relative privacy, would you not try it also? I think everyone around this table can agree that if we had enough sun in this country we would singe ourselves raw under the power of it. No, I won\u2019t lower my voice! I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m talking over the Queen\u2019s speech! Pause it if it\u2019s that important to you! How is this the fault of Shailene Woodley from the doomed YA film series Divergent? It isn\u2019t, directly, but she is a famed pioneer of intimate sunburn, so I am choosing to connect the dots. If you don\u2019t remember Woodley from her pre-Big Little Lies days, her previous form was a sort of proto-Paltrow who clattered through press engagements talking about nature and moss and the idea of water having chemicals in it and things like that. She was big \u201cI have an oil for that\u201d energy, The Girl In Your Halls Who Wore Harem Pants And Didn\u2019t Talk About Her Dad\u2019s Finance Job. In 2014, she told Into the Gloss that, well: \u201cI like to give my vagina a little vitamin D. I was reading an article written by a herbalist I studied about yeast infections and other genital issues. She said there\u2019s nothing better than vitamin D. If you\u2019re feeling depleted, go in the sun for an hour and see how much energy you get. Or, if you live in a place that has heavy winters, when the sun finally comes out, spread your legs and get some sunshine.\u201d No, I ... no, I know you can put a good word in for me at the shop, but really I think the writing thing is \u2013 What is \u201cperineum sunning\u201d? Is Perineum Sunning married? What is Perineum Sunning\u2019s net worth? As wellness trends go, PS is one of those that sort of is a trend and very much isn\u2019t, in that exactly one wellness blogger (\u201cMetaphysical Meagan\u201d) has extolled the virtues of it, posting about it in mid-November and saying it was an \u201cancient Taoist practice that originated in the Far East\u201d (ancient Taoists were revolving in their graves at high speed, horned up and furious that modern wellness bloggers are saying that they spent their lives pointing themselves anus-first towards the sun). The New York Post picked up the idea and linked it tenuously to the 1986 book The Tao of Sexology. Basically, no one really thinks this is a good idea and no one really does it. But it only takes one, doesn\u2019t it? It only takes one person to be wellness-influenced into mooning the sun and someone will figure a way to make a billion dollars out of it (\u201cDon\u2019t get caught sunning without your Schurr\u2019s Intimate Crystal\u2122 \u2013 a smooth and comfortable quartz plug that intensifies the sun\u2019s healing rays\u201d). Maybe we are all wrong. Maybe in five years\u2019 time we will all be in the local park, heads down, asses up, saluting the sun in the worst possible way. Maybe I am the idiot and Josh Brolin, tenderly sitting on a bag of ice wrapped in a tea towel, is a galactic-brained pioneer. Wouldn\u2019t you think that flaring your cheeks open and pointing the tender in-between bit at the most powerful force in our universe would lead, quite naturally, to sunburn? My concern with this is that the sun is really bad for your skin, even in winter. If you leave the house without sunblock on, you are just asking to age prematurely. And that\u2019s your face I\u2019m talking about. We have not even explored the idea of trying to turn the nozzle round on the Ambre Solaire and honk a mist of factor 50 directly into the depths. If Brolin did expose his piece to the sun, then surely now he must have the anus of an 80- or 90-year-old man, an anus in shreds, an anus on the absolute edge. So the takeaway lesson from this is: probably let\u2019s not sun our perineums. Take a vitamin D tablet if you need sunlight so bad. Yes, Val, I\u2019ll look into adult education. Yes, I know it\u2019s not too late to retrain. Yeah, I \u2013 no, maybe I could look into teaching, something like that. Something normal. I\u2019ll make you proud one day, I promise. I\u2019ll make you stop being so ashamed of me.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, shares in Glencore have closed down 9% at 216p, its lowest level since October 2016. Worries over the SFO bribery investigation encouraged traders to sell up, says David Madden of CMC Markets. While the case is hanging over the company, traders are likely to steer clear of the stock Glencore was the biggest blue-chip stock in London. Other multinationals also fell, as the surge in the pound will make their overseas earnings less valuable in sterling terms. This means the FTSE 100 has closed 50 points down at 7,137. Packaging firm DS Smith fell 7%, after warning that it faced a \u201cdifficult\u201d trading environment (although profits were still up 30%). The pound is on track to end the day at fresh highs. It\u2019s currently trading at a 31-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.185, and a seven-month high against the US dollar at $1.316. Economics professor Costas Milas has spotted something interesting about the pound (still trading at a seven-month high against the US dollar this afternoon). Web searches for Boris Johnson used to rise when the pound was becoming more volatile -- but currently, the reverse is true. He writes: You are pointing out that sterling hit 1.31 vs the dollar. What has arguably received less attention is the fact that financial markets (in addition to the Canadian Prime Minister) appear to have been\u201ctwo-faced \u201d. Academic research has already established that Google search activity predicts financial markets. The popularity of Boris Johnson (proxied by Google searches on the web) coincides with a surge in sterling\u2019s volatility from early 2016 up to and including the summer of 2019. That is, when Boris (first as a Foreign Secretary, then as a backbencher and then as a new Prime Minister) acted as the leading Brexiteer. Since the beginning of autumn, however, financial markets appear to have changed their mind. Indeed, as the prospect of a new general election together with the prospect of Boris Johnson winning next week\u2019s elections and \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d (despite the very tight deadline of December 2020) increased, the rise in Johnson\u2019s popularity appears to have reduced sterling\u2019s volatility... Shares in Glencore are on track to close at their lowest level since October 2016. The Resolution Foundation think tank have now issued a report into UK wealth, based on this morning\u2019s ONS data. Called \u201cWho owns all the pie?\u201d, it shows clearly how wealth inequality has risen in recent years, as the wealthiest people have benefitted most from higher asset prices. They also show that it\u2019s very hard to simply work your way to wealth, rather than inheriting it: Fifty years ago, someone with a good salary could save enough over the course of their lives to retire with a good amount of wealth to live off. For many people today this is a distant dream: what matters more is the wealth you inherit or marry in to, rather than the income you can set aside over a working lifetime. A middle income family on just over \u00a326,000, for example, would have to save everything for 96 years if they were to reach the wealth of a household in the top 10 per cent of the wealth distribution (whose average wealth is \u00a32.5 million). Even a family just inside the top tenth of the income distribution would have to save for 50 years, making it unrealistic that even the highest-paid can accumulate large amounts of wealth without windfalls from outside. Glencore (-7.4%) is helping to drag the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down. The blue-chip index has now lost 45 points, or 0.65% today, to 7142. That\u2019s also due to the stronger pound, which is weighing on exporters. Glencore, which is headquartered in Baar, Switzerland, is often described as the \u201cmost powerful company you\u2019ve never heard of\u201d. Valued at \u00a331bn, Glencore is the world\u2019s largest mining company by revenue, providing more zinc and cobalt than any other firms, and is also a huge trader of commodities such as oil. It was founded in 1974 as Marc Rich and Co. Rich \u2013 a former child refugee who became a naturalised American citizen after fleeing Nazi-occupied Belgium with his family. Here\u2019s more details: Back in 2017, the Paradise Papers investigation explained how Glencore had secretly loaned $45m to Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, after enlisting him to secure a controversial mining agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We reported that: ..In 2009, Glencore loaned Gertler $45m with the caveat that it would be repayable if agreement with DRC authorities was not reached to secure a mining contract for a company linked to Glencore. Gertler\u2019s notoriety in the resource-rich but conflict-riven and corrupt DRC spans nearly two decades. He was cited by a 2001 UN investigation that said he had given the DRC president, Joseph Kabila, $20m to buy weapons to equip his army against rebel groups in exchange for a monopoly on the country\u2019s diamonds, and a 2013 Africa Progress Panel report said a string of mining deals struck by companies linked to him had deprived the country of more than $1.3bn in potential revenue. Gertler has firmly denied these allegations, and denies there was anything improper about the $45m loan. Here\u2019s the story: In January 2018, it emerged that the US Department of Justice was investigating allegations that Gertler has bribed top officials in the Congo to secure mining rights. The SFO\u2019s inquiry adds to Glencore\u2019s problems, says Bloomberg: The announcement worsens the legal troubles at the company, which is already being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice for possible corruption and money-laundering in Venezuela, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo. NEWSFLASH: Mining and commodities giant Glencore is being probed by Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office. In a statement to the City, Glencore says: Glencore has been notified today that the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has opened an investigation into suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business of the Glencore group. Glencore will co-operate with the SFO investigation. The SFO also released a brief statement, confirming it is looking into \u201csuspected bribery\u201d at Glencore. Following the announcement by Glencore PLC, the SFO confirms it is investigating suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business by the Glencore group of companies, its officials, employees, agents and associated persons. As this is a live investigation we cannot comment further. Shares in Glencore, which both produces raw materials and trades them around the globe, have promptly slumped by 6% in London. Eighteen months ago, Bloomberg reported that the SFO was concerned about Glencore\u2019s activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and its links to Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler. Today\u2019s report also shows that poorer families are more likely to hold financial debt -- as they turn to hire-purchase schemes and credit cards to survive. The ONS says: The least wealthy 50% of households held 36% of total household debt in April 2016 to March 2018, but whilst they held less debt their total debt was a relatively large proportion of their total wealth, with less wealthy households being more likely to have financial debt. Richer households, though, are (obviously) more likely to hold substantial mortgage debt as this chart shows: Worryingly, UK household debt levels have also risen -- to \u00a31.28 trillion in 2016/18 \u2013 up 4% from 2014/16. More than 90% of that is linked to property assets (either mortgages or equity released schemes). But non-mortgage debt has jumped by 11% over the period, meaning the average household had \u00a39,400 of non-mortgage debt. This \u2018financial debt\u2019 has risen by \u00a312bn to \u00a3119bn, from \u00a3107 billion in April 2014 to March 2016. So while some families have become wealthier, others are more indebted. Some of this relates to student loans. But credit facilities, such as hire-purchase loans, have also swelled. The Office for National Statistics explains: Total household financial debt rose by \u00a312 billion (11%) in the latest period, up from \u00a3107 billion in April 2014 to March 2016, with most of the change accounted for by increased hire purchase debt (up by \u00a36 billion) and student loans from the Student Loans Company (up by \u00a37 billion). Some 12.7m households have some form of financial debt, up from 12.4m in 2014-16. Here\u2019s the details of Britons\u2019 debt burden: \u00a335 billion in non-student loans \u00a332 billion in student loans \u00a325 billion in hire purchase \u00a322 billion on credit and store cards \u00a33 billion in overdrafts \u00a31 billion in mail order debts \u00a31 billion in arrears on bills Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201c13 million of us are living in the red \u2013 lugging the burden of non-mortgage debts around with us. The figures are skewed slightly by the \u00a332 billion of student debts \u2013 which the vast majority of graduates will never pay back in full. However, even excluding that we\u2019re carrying \u00a387 billion in loans, credit cards, hire purchase agreements, overdrafts and arrears. It\u2019s an enormous burden of debt and interest to be facing each month, and it keeps rising \u2013 it\u2019s up 11% in the most recent figures. Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation has tweeted about the rise in UK wealth, and wealth inequality: There is also a remarkable divergence in wealth growth across the UK in the last decade. London has seen a huge jump in wealth, but the North East and the East Midlands have both suffered falling wealth. How has the average Londoner become so wealthy? Over to the ONS.... For London, median total wealth has increased in each of the survey periods since July 2006 to June 2008. Between July 2006 to June 2008 and April 2016 to March 2018, median total wealth in London has increased by 78% to \u00a3356,400. Changes in net property and pension wealth are the major factors driving changes to total wealth. For London, median net property wealth has increased by 51% since July 2006 to June 2008, to \u00a3410,000 in April 2016 to March 2018. Pension wealth has increased by 47% to \u00a3102,200. The ONS\u2019s wealth report also shows clearly that wealth inequality has risen in Britain over the last decade. The UK\u2019s Gini coefficient for total wealth, a widely-used measure, has risen from 61% in 2008 to 63%. That means wealth is distributed more unequally than before the financial crisis. On the Gini coefficient, a reading of zero shows totally equal distribution, while 100% shows a totally unequal sharing of the pie. So it\u2019s notable that the Gini coefficient for net financial wealth has risen to 91%, a level that screams inequality. The ONS explains: Some households may be in net financial debt (their debts exceed their assets), many will have relatively modest amounts in savings accounts, while others have many millions in financial investments. It\u2019s official: The wealthiest people in the UK are getting even wealthier. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that UK households grew their combined wealth by 13% between April 2016 and March 2018 (the most recent data). Much of that increase is due to rising asset prices -- which benefits the wealthiest as they tend to own them; either outright, or in their pension pots. Rising property prices have also boosted wealth (but again, that\u2019s only good news if you own your own home, or someone elses...) And that\u2019s why the wealthiest 10% of families got the biggest boost, while the poorest 10% saw little improvement. The ONS says: The total net wealth of private households in Great Britain was \u00a314.6 trillion in April 2016 to March 2018, an increase of 13% in real terms from April 2014 to March 2016, mainly because of increases in private pension and net property wealth. Median household net wealth in Great Britain in April 2016 to March 2018 was \u00a3286,600, an increase of 9% from April 2014 to March 2016, after adjusting for inflation. Total wealth inequality in Great Britain is broadly unchanged in the most recent period, though it has increased since July 2006 to June 2008, based on a number of measures of inequality. Inequality in net property wealth and net financial wealth has increased between July 2006 to June 2008 and April 2016 to March 2018, while inequality in pension wealth has fallen. Average (mean) wealth for all wealth deciles increased in real terms between April 2014 to March 2016 and April 2016 to March 2018, with the higher deciles seeing the biggest increases; the average for the poorest decile increased 3%, and the richest wealth decile increased by 11%. Richard Falkenh\u00e4ll, senior FX strategist at Nordic bank SEB, reckons sterling\u2019s recovery could be short-lived. He fears another cliff-edge Brexit crisis in a year\u2019s time following a Conservative victory, as it will be very hard to agree a new free trade deal quickly. Falkenh\u00e4ll writes: \u201cThe pound continues to gain on the back of opinion polls showing a stable lead for the Conservative party, and markets are now probably almost fully discounting a Tory majority in UK Parliament after the general election. \u201cWhile this would create some certainty around Brexit in the short term as the UK will then leave the withdrawal period and move into the transition period in January 2020, a Conservative win will in fact increase the risk of the UK falling out of the EU without a trade deal by the end of next year (2020). It might be that the GBP recovery could turn out to be quite short-lived.\u201d Earlier today, chancellor Sajid Javid said he was confident that the UK and EU could agree a future relationship before the end of the withdrawal agreement in December 2020. But there\u2019s considerable scepticism about this..... Sales of vans also fell sharply in the UK last month, suggesting businesses are hunkering down until the election is over. New van registrations slumped by 9.6% compared with November 2018, new figures show. That\u2019s the third monthly decline in a row. Registrations of small vans (below 2 tonnes) have tumbled by 24%, while large vans (2.5-3.5 tonnes) are down 11.4%. Pickup sales are up, though. The SMMT\u2019s Mike Hawes blames political uncertainty: \u201cA third consecutive month of decline for new van registrations is concerning, particularly after growth for much of the year. Ongoing political uncertainty doesn\u2019t help inspire business confidence but this is essential if we are to embolden further investment in new vehicles which will go a long way to improving air quality in our towns and cities.\u201d Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the latest general election latest - including some interesting defections from the Brexit party today: Willem Klijnstra, currency analyst at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, has told the Financial Times that a Johnson win next week is \u2018baked in\u2019 to the pound\u2019s current valuation. He says: A Tory-led government is baked in today. The tail risk is that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Klijnstra also points out that a Conservative win would take attention \u201cstraight back to Brexit\u201d -- both the withdrawal from the EU by 31 January and the trade talks. Trade experts doubt the government claim that it can agree a comprehensive deal by the end of 2020, so further tensions next year would weigh on UK assets. The pound has dipped a little since the UK car figures came out, but is still at a 31-month high against the euro at \u20ac1.184. That\u2019s its highest level since Theresa May held her ill-fated snap general election, when opinion polls predicted a solid Conservative win. Investors seem to believe the pollsters are doing a better job this time. As Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank told clients today: Sterling has been supported by investor hopes that a Conservative majority at the election will support a smooth ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament, taking away some of the short-term uncertainty over the Brexit process. The sole poll yesterday came last night and showed a 10pt lead for the Tories - unchanged from the previous poll and in-line with the poll of polls. Next week\u2019s general election hasn\u2019t helped the car industry, says Ian Plummer, commercial director at Auto Trader. Here\u2019s his take on the drop in car sales last month: \u201cManufacturers are coming up against unprecedented cost hurdles as they take the journey towards the electrification of their fleet and also fight to hit the stringent new CO2 emissions regulations next year. Some of the biggest industry stalwarts have recently announced job losses as they look to refocus their businesses to deal with these issues. Compounding that, issues caused by Brexit continue to hinder the industry too; the unsteady value of the pound, consumer uncertainty and the ambiguity around future trading regulations only serve to amplify the enormous pressure manufacturers are under. And in the short term, both the manufacturers and their franchised retailers, still have ambitious targets to meet to reach despite these wider economic challenges. \u201cBrexit, and now the election, is also further dampening consumer buying confidence, making it ever-harder to sell cars. Although electric car sales have risen steadily this year, they only make up a small proportion of the market. Nearly two-thirds of consumers are still plumping for a petrol engine, as this chart shows. That\u2019s why the SMMT are calling for cash incentives, and more electric charging point to encourage customers to switch. A survey earlier this year showed that electric cars are now more affordable than petrol in some countries, as lower taxes, fuel costs and subsidies makes up for a higher purchase price. But some consumers could be put off by the range provided by current models. MG\u2019s ZS EV (\u00a326,995), for example, promises a range of 163 miles on a single charge. Political uncertainty is deterring consumers from buying a new car, says Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive. He\u2019s also calling for more government support for electric cars. \u201cThese are challenging times for the UK new car market, with another fall in November reflecting the current climate of uncertainty. It\u2019s good news, however, to see registrations of electrified cars surging again, and 2020 will see manufacturers introduce plenty of new, exciting models to give buyers even more choice. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go for these vehicles to become mainstream and, to grow uptake further, we need fiscal incentives, investment in charging infrastructure and a more confident consumer.\u201d Newsflash: UK car sales have fallen again, led by yet another slump in diesel demand. Sales dropped 1.3% year-on-year in November, with 156,621 models registered. With just one month to go, car sales are down 2.7% this year compared with 2018. Diesel car sales slumped by 27% year-on-year, as the crackdown on polluting vehicles continues to deter consumers. Petrol rose by 2%. The figures also show that alternatively fuelled vehicles now have a record market share of 10.2%. That\u2019s hybrid, plug-in hybrid or pure electric cars. Reaction to follow.... Over in Germany, the factory slump continues to drag on. German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in October, by 0.4% month-on-month, new government data shows. That means orders are 5.5% lower than a year ago, as the ongoing US-China trade war and slowing global growth hits Europe\u2019s largest economy. The pound was the biggest mover in the foreign exchange market yesterday, as it rallied against other major currencies. With fresh gains this morning, forecasts of a Conservative win next week are lifting the currency, explains Lee Hardman of Japanese bank MUFG: With only a week to go until the UK election, the Tory party still hold a sizeable lead of around 10 percentage points over Labour. It has made market participants increasingly confident to price in a Tory majority and an end to the deadlock in parliament. Boris Johnson set out his agenda yesterday for the first 100 days of a Conservative government. He pledged that legislation to implement his EU withdrawal agreement will be put back before parliament ahead of Christmas as he aims to take the UK out of the EU by the end of January. There are also plans for a February budget which would quickly implement plans to begin raising the threshold for paying national insurance tax. With the pound increasingly pricing in a Tory election victory ahead of the event, there is some risk of \u201cbuy the rumour sell the fact\u201d price action following the announcement of the election result even if the Tories secure a majority as expected. Pound price action would be much more volatile if the opinion polls were to prove misleading. Currency expert Kit Juckes of Societe Generale writes: Sterling rallied on continued optimism about a Conservative win in the General Election and, as one wag put it, an absence of gaffes from Boris Johnson. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With a week to go until the general election, predictions of a Conservative victory are pushing the pound higher. Sterling has hit a fresh 31-month high against the euro this morning, touching \u20ac1.185 for the first time since May 2017. It\u2019s also continuing to climb against the US dollar, touching $1.314 - a seven-month high. Traders are increasingly confident that Boris Johnson will be returned to Downing Street, probably with a working majority that will allow him to push his Brexit deal through parliament by 31 January. The latest YouGov polling gives the Conservatives a nine-point lead, which could be enough to avoid Johnson\u2019s nightmare scenario of another hung parliament. Johnson will be relieved that the NATO summit passed off without Donald Trump wading into UK politics -- beyond denying that he has covetousness desires for the NHS. Overnight, the Conservatives have also wheeled out some pledges designed to woo voters next week, including a tax-cutting budget in February and a boost to education spending. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the pound\u2019s rally shows that the City is expecting an orderly Brexit early next year: The pound broke to the upside yesterday, as President Trump came and went while managing to avoid courting controversy over the NHS, and by virtue of that putting Boris Johnson in a difficult spot. As a result of that currency markets appear to be starting to price out the prospect that Labour might win a majority at next week\u2019s election. Having been so negative on the pound for so long, markets are starting to believe in the prospect that we could well start to see the prospect of an orderly withdrawal from the EU in the next two months, and thus short positions are starting to get squeezed out, sending the currency to its best levels against the euro since before the 2017 election. Also coming up today We find out how many new cars were bought in the UK last month - a poor reading could suggest consumers are cautions ahead of the general election. Oil ministers from the Opec cartel are meeting in Vienna today. They could agree output cuts in an attempt to push crude prices up. Financial markets are still nervous about the prospects of a US-China trade deal, following conflicting noises this week. The clock is ticking towards 15 December, when Washington could impose additional tariffs on Chinese imports. The agenda 9am GMT: UK car sales for November 2pm GMT: Opec meeting: opening session",

Anti-government protesters who have been occupying the square for several weeks, some of whom are critical of Iranian influence in the country, said at least 15 people were stabbed before the militia-linked marchers withdrew by the late afternoon. It was unclear whether the attacks were carried out by Hashd al-Shaabi supporters or, as some protesters speculated, by people working on behalf of the state or another entity trying to sow discord within the anti-government forces.

      "bodyText": "A mural depicting police abuse in a Rio de Janeiro favela has been removed from the walls of a Miami events space after local police reportedly complained. The work, by the Brazilian artist Panmela Castro, showed a black woman being held in a headlock, with the caption: \u201cWoman who filmed abused [sic] by police officers is beaten and arrested.\u201d It was painted on in the parking lot of the Aria 21 venue on Monday as part of a week-long exhibition for Miami Art Week \u2013 but was painted over the following day after managers at the space told Castro police had complained. \u201cI did not imagine this would happen at one of the biggest art fairs in the US. I cried with revulsion,\u201d said Castro, whose works have been exhibited internationally. The mural was based on the experience of a student of Castro\u2019s, who was handcuffed and arrested after filming police officers questioning a man in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Rocinha favela, days after police killed eight people in the neighbourhood. \u201cIt talks about police abuse, so when the Miami police say it has to be removed it is also police abuse,\u201d Castro said. Killings by the notoriously violent police in Rio de Janeiro state have climbed under Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and the state governor, Wilson Witzel, who both campaigned on an iron-fist approach to violent crime. Managers at Aria 21 said they did not want to jeopardise their good relationship with police. \u201cThe commander saw the painting, and he calls us aside and he says: \u2018If you guys really want to do good \u2026 you have to get this out,\u2019\u201d said Jerusa Noveletto, one of Aria 21\u2019s managers. \u201cWe tried to explain that she\u2019s from another country, she\u2019s just trying to show what\u2019s going on there \u2013 but they didn\u2019t want to have that.\u201d She was not sure which police station the message had come from. Alessandra Gold, who runs Aria 21, said Castro was offered the chance to change her work but declined. \u201c[The police] were unsure why we had the message on the wall when we had such an amazing relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have 800 to a thousand people coming through, you have kids and families \u2013 and families of police officers, too \u2013 it is very family-orientated space. Her work was very aggressive.\u201d In an email, Wynwood\u2019s police commander, Daniel Kerr, said there was absolutely no police involvement in the decision to remove the mural, which he said he was not aware of. One Brazilian art specialist said the censorship \u2013 which came days after nine people were trampled to death when police raided a street party in a S\u00e3o Paulo favela \u2013 underlined that police violence is an issue in both countries. \u201cPanmela\u2019s graffiti is a megaphone to denounce to the world what is happening in the poorer regions of big Brazilian cities,\u201d said Ricardo Resende, an art critic from Rio.",

In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no-deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs at the end of this year. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2020?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further potential Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing another tough year in 2020. The latest rise in the national minimum wage in April will also add to costs and hit profits. On the plus side, there are hopes of a boost to the housing market from increased certainty about Brexit after the general election. There are also signs that the shift to online shopping is slowing, potentially easing the pressure on high streets.</p>\n    <p><b>Sarah Butler</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Documents sent to potential buyers say rents for the occupier could be as much as \u00a34m a year.

      "bodyText": "Trevor Noah Donald Trump has spent most of the week in London for Nato\u2019s 70th anniversary gala, a summit of world leaders that is \u201csort of like if the Avengers were extremely concerned about steel tariffs\u201d, said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. Unfortunately for Trump, things got off to a rocky start \u2013 there was a \u201ctesty exchange\u201d with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for one, and Trump had harsh words for Canada. But the worst for Trump was a video which captured Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, and Macron laughing at Trump during a reception. Noah called the video \u201camazing\u201d for two reasons: one, \u201cit\u2019s crazy that we were able to hear a private conversation between major world leaders. Like, did they not know this was happening? \u201cAnd two, that when world leaders get together, they\u2019re gossipy bitches just like the rest of us.\u201d In response, Trump called Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d and announced that he would leave the summit early. The premature departure suggested to Noah that the video \u201churt his feelings. It was like Trump was at a sleepover, and all the other kids turned on him.

It\u2019s good for Trump to come home early, Noah concluded, back to a place \u201cwhere we promise that we will laugh at you to your face\u201d. Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert returned from Thanksgiving break to cover the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s 300-plus page impeachment inquiry report, which said that by pressuring Ukraine, Trump \u201cplaced his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States\u201d. Before the House intelligence committee\u2019s report, the GOP released their own \u201cpre-buttal\u201d in which they concluded that Trump \u201cwas acting on genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine\u201d. \u201cYes, because the two words everyone uses to describe Donald Trump are genuine and reasonable,\u201d Colbert deadpanned, \u201cright after athletic and monogamous\u201d. The Republican claims were bogus, Colbert continued, because \u201ctheir argument is based on the claim that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC server \u2013 an idea that\u2019s been completely debunked as a Russian-fueled conspiracy theory. \u201cPlus, even if Ukraine had meddled in the 2016 election, the proper organization to investigate that is not Rudy Giuliani,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the CBS show FBI is not called My Drunken Personal Attorney.\u201d Colbert also touched on the president\u2019s trip to London to celebrate Nato\u2019s 70th anniversary. \u201cLike most anniversaries, Trump was in a bad mood, wishing he was with a younger eastern European ally,\u201d Colbert explained.

The group was carrying out maintenance work on points.</p> <p>According to the report, the train was approaching Margam on the up-mainline at around 73 mph. Its driver saw three track workers walking away from him on the adjacent down-mainline and, beyond them, three more track workers on the line ahead of his train.</p> <p>\u201cHe sounded the train horn and applied the emergency brakes,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe track workers walking on the down-line became aware of the train approaching from behind them and tried to warn their colleagues as the train passed them.\u201d</p> <p>The train was travelling at about 50 mph when it struck the track workers.</p> <p>Investigators found the three men on the up-line were using a powered impact wrench for loosening and tightening large nuts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"21e25cd29011929da811533e3d34b646385bd08a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21e25cd29011929da811533e3d34b646385bd08a/185_64_1142_1427/800.jpg\" alt=\"Michael \u2018Spike\u2019 Lewis.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael \u2018Spike\u2019 Lewis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cConsequently, all three of the workers were almost certainly wearing ear defenders.

      "bodyText": "There were no formal lookouts when two experienced rail workers were hit and killed on a train mainline, a report has found. Gareth Delbridge, 64, and Michael \u201cSpike\u201d Lewis, 58, were struck on the south Wales mainline by a Swansea to London train on 3 July. An interim report from the Rail Accidents Investigation Branch (RAIB) said a third worker came very close to being hit. The report said the three men were almost certainly wearing ear defenders and were not aware of the train until less than a second before incident on the tracks at Margam, Port Talbot. The RAIB flagged up concerns that the planning paperwork suggested the up-line \u2013 the one the three men were working on \u2013 was going to be closed at 12.30pm for the work to take place but they began work much earlier and the accident happened at 9.52am. The report said the men were part of a group of six Network Rail employees with 185 years experience on the railways between them. The group was carrying out maintenance work on points. According to the report, the train was approaching Margam on the up-mainline at around 73 mph. Its driver saw three track workers walking away from him on the adjacent down-mainline and, beyond them, three more track workers on the line ahead of his train. \u201cHe sounded the train horn and applied the emergency brakes,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe track workers walking on the down-line became aware of the train approaching from behind them and tried to warn their colleagues as the train passed them.\u201d The train was travelling at about 50 mph when it struck the track workers. Investigators found the three men on the up-line were using a powered impact wrench for loosening and tightening large nuts. \u201cConsequently, all three of the workers were almost certainly wearing ear defenders. CCTV images taken from a camera at the front of the train and witness evidence indicate that the workers did not become aware of the train until less than one second before it reached them,\u201d said the report. \u201cThe RAIB\u2019s preliminary conclusion is that the accident occurred because the three track workers were working on a line that was open to traffic, without the presence of formally appointed lookouts to warn them of approaching trains. \u201cAll three workers were almost certainly wearing ear defenders, because one of them was using a noisy power tool, and all had become focused with the task they were undertaking. None of them was aware that a train was approaching them until it was too late to move to a position of safety.\u201d The report added: \u201cThe planning paperwork for the work indicated that the work was to start at 12:30pm, to coincide with the planned blockage of the up mainline. However, witness evidence suggests that there was a widespread belief at the local maintenance depot that there was no need to wait for the planned line blockage in the afternoon, and a general lack of understanding as to how the planning paperwork should be interpreted.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Broken noses, nasty cuts, traumatic brain injury and even death: it sounds like the start of a Quentin Tarantino movie.

A study by experts in the US has found that since the advent of smartphones, injuries linked to mobile phones have shot up, both indirect injuries \u2013 such as those sustained texting while walking \u2013 and those caused by the devices themselves, such as the phone hitting someone in the face or the battery exploding. With some of these injuries posing the risk of long-term complications, the authors of the new research say users should be more aware of the dangers of using their devices while attempting other activities, while there also needs to be better education about how to prevent injuries from the phones themselves. \u201cNobody in their right mind would ever read a book while they are walking, why would they read an entire article on the phone while they are walking?\u201d said Boris Paskhover, chief of facial plastics and reconstructive surgery at Rutgers New Jersey medical school and co-author of the study. But he added: \u201cEveryone does it, everyone. I do it.\u201d Various approaches have been trialled to keep users safe: in Chongqing, China, a stretch of pavement was opened especially for people who use their phones while walking, while in Salzburg airbags have been put on lampposts to raise awareness of the dangers of being distracted by one\u2019s phone. Writing in the journal Jama Otolaryngology, Paskhover and colleagues report how they analysed data from about 100 hospitals in the US, collected between January 1998 and December 2017. In total, the figures suggest just over 2,500 patients arrived at the emergency departments with head and neck injuries related to the use of mobile phones \u2013 a figure the team says equates to about 76,000 cases arriving in emergency departments across the whole US. The team add that cases steadily rose over the years as the devices became more common, but shot up from around 2007 as the first iPhone was released and smartphones became commonplace. By 2016, the team estimate the rate to have reached about 29 new cases per million people each year. \u201cProviding constant access to a variety of applications and internet browsers, these devices have become a necessary but potentially dangerous tool used by most people in the United States,\u201d the authors write. Overall, 33% of the head and neck injuries were to the head itself and almost 33% to the face \u2013 including the nose. Cuts, bruises and internal organ injury \u2013 primarily traumatic brain injury \u2013 were among the most common problems.

About half of such cases were down to people using their phone while driving, while 90 of them involved individuals playing Pok\u00e9mon Go. However, injuries can also be down to the phone itself. \u201cI have had a patient who was lying in bed looking at her phone, and it slipped out of her hand, hit her in the face, broke her nose,\u201d said Paskhover. Such injuries, the team add, are more common than indirect injuries among those under the age of 13, possibly down to situations such as the phone hitting them in the face when struggling over a device with a sibling. In another unusual case, a man in the US was bitten by a snake he trod on when crossing a carpark while looking at his phone, an incident caught on camera in 2015. Paskhover added that the number of indirect phone-related injuries recorded in the latest study was probably an underestimate either because the injury was slight and people did not attend the emergency department, or because they do not report the cause of an injury due to embarrassment. However, Paskhover stressed that users needed to be aware of the risks of mobile phone use. \u201cA fall from upright \u2013 you can still die from that,\u201d he said.",

After Wednesday night\u2019s debacle at Anfield \u2013 the first time Everton have conceded five against Liverpool since Culture Club were No 1 with, aptly enough, Do You Really Want To Hurt Me \u2013 the writing wasn\u2019t so much on the wall as scrawled across the stratosphere in skywriting. From a blue perspective there\u2019s an unfortunate skewed derby dynamic on Merseyside these days \u2013 it\u2019s how Espanyol, 1860 Munich and Racing Club de Paris must feel \u2013 so there\u2019s no shame in being duffed up by this Liverpool side. But it\u2019s not really supposed to be this way, Silva having been furnished with well over \u00a3110m of fresh talent this summer and \u00a3100m-worth of the same in 2018, and his whole top-flight career is beginning to smack of the emperor\u2019s new clothes. Being charitable, Silva\u2019s Premier League win percentage (33.7%) with Hull, Watford and Everton puts him up there with stalwarts like Alan Pardew (34%), Ailsa from Home and Away (33.9%) and Chris Coleman (32.9%).

What next for the Goodison faithful, then? David Moyes, who bid the club a tearful farewell in 2013 after 11 years at the helm and has since gone on to have a storied and glorious time with Manchester United (11 months, sacked), Real Sociedad (12 months, sacked), Sunderland (10 months, resigned) and West Ham (six months, \u201cWe feel that it is right to move in a different direction\u201d), is the frontrunner, which is something of a novelty for him.

Her own back story of single motherhood at 16, saved by a further education college, and Sure Start for her child, is the guarantee that for the first time in years someone who really understands what\u2019s needed will pay more than lip service to toddlers, skills and life chances.</p> <p>All children will gain from Labour\u2019s big uplift in school spending and extra teachers, but the chances are that Rayner would most improve results by focusing on the non-university half.

Grammar schools have expanded, and his free schools were designed for sharp-elbowed parents and religious schools were allowed to select 100% of their pupils. I have seen even low-paid families struggle to pay for extra tuition to help keep their children up with the more affluent.</p> <p>This week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/03/british-schoolchildren-among-least-satisfied-with-their-lives-says-oecd-report\" title=\"\">Pisa results</a> show a moderate improvement in maths and English scores \u2013 good \u2013 though worth noting these children spent their primary years better funded under Labour, where David Blunkett\u2019s introduction of the literacy and numeracy hour created an uplift in scores.</p> <p>When it comes to GCSE results, the rising number of pupils \u201coff-rolled\u201d before they get to them \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/05/off-rolling-hides-true-extent-of-disadvantage-gap-in-schools-study\" title=\"\">the 24,600 conveniently disappeared</a> \u2013 boost many schools\u2019 results.

What of enriching lives?

      "bodyText": "Of all the destructions of the dismal decade, history will surely judge the deliberate downgrading of children the most perverse. \u201cOur children are our future\u201d used to be a tired old bromide trotted out by every politician, but if you look at spending, you would say the old have been the future for the Conservatives. What does it say about Britain that the old took priority with triple-locked pensions, while everything for the young was cut to shreds \u2013 education, benefits, youth services, sure starts, arts, sports \u2013 everything? The \u201cfuture\u201d for the Tories only stretched as far as cajoling oldies into the polling booths at the next election. Since 2010, spending on children has fallen by 10%, making children the most likely to be poor \u2013 and the old the least: contrary to what Boris Johnson told Andrew Marr last weekend, child poverty is rising sharply on current government plans, to nearly 40% by 2022. Angela Rayner, spelling out again Labour\u2019s priorities for children, reminded us she would be an education minister like no other, her emphasis exactly where it\u2019s most needed, on the long tail of failure that drags down national results, the half not destined for university. Her own back story of single motherhood at 16, saved by a further education college, and Sure Start for her child, is the guarantee that for the first time in years someone who really understands what\u2019s needed will pay more than lip service to toddlers, skills and life chances. All children will gain from Labour\u2019s big uplift in school spending and extra teachers, but the chances are that Rayner would most improve results by focusing on the non-university half. Before anyone says magic-money-tree unaffordable, remember the Resolution Foundation judges Labour\u2019s plans would increase the size of the state to the average for similar north European countries. What a polar opposite Rayner would be to all that Michael Gove did, with his endless favouring of top achievers. He toughened GCSEs so top universities could distinguish better between A* candidates. His more finely graded system has, says the Sutton Trust, widened the gap as fewer disadvantaged children now get the top grade 9, compared to those who used to get A*. Grammar schools have expanded, and his free schools were designed for sharp-elbowed parents and religious schools were allowed to select 100% of their pupils. I have seen even low-paid families struggle to pay for extra tuition to help keep their children up with the more affluent. This week\u2019s Pisa results show a moderate improvement in maths and English scores \u2013 good \u2013 though worth noting these children spent their primary years better funded under Labour, where David Blunkett\u2019s introduction of the literacy and numeracy hour created an uplift in scores. When it comes to GCSE results, the rising number of pupils \u201coff-rolled\u201d before they get to them \u2013 the 24,600 conveniently disappeared \u2013 boost many schools\u2019 results. Unsurprisingly, it has been impossible to recruit enough teachers; training targets have been missed for the last seven years. The relentless orders, tick-boxes and inspections, with an overly rigid curriculum, has turned them into stressed-out automatums. Look at the price children paid for Gove\u2019s Gradgrind regime. Pisa found exceptional joylessness in British children, the UK alone in having almost half our children regularly feeling sad and not able to say, \u201cmy life has a clear meaning and purpose.\u201d Children\u2019s mental health has worsened severely, with one in eight needing help. Look at all that\u2019s been lost of those things that might make children happy: the selling off of playgrounds and sports grounds, with closed or price-hiked leisure centres and virtually no youth services. The children\u2019s commissioner finds: \u201cWe have the least physically active generation of children ever.\u201d Look how the arts are vanishing from many schools. Music entries for GCSE have dropped by over a fifth, and only half of children take any arts subject as drama, dance, art and music. What of enriching lives? Or, in Gradgrind mode, learning the disciplines imposed by performance? Rayner\u2019s free breakfasts will do much more than measurably increase the technical attainment of the poorest. They are a welcome into school as a kindly nurturing place each morning for every child, as is keeping schools open for after-school and holiday play. The Child Poverty Action Group and Thomas Coram Research Unit\u2019s research into child hunger is shocking, as children tell of stabbing hunger pains, and meal-skipping parents pretending they have eaten.

The leader of the Black Panthers and his girlfriend, Gwen Fontaine, were on the final part of a journey that had been masterminded by the most important production team in the New Hollywood era: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/14/bert-schneider\" title=\"\">Bert Schneider</a>, Bob Rafelson and Steve Blauner (AKA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/30/dennis-hopper-friend-maverick-artist\" title=\"\">BBS Productions</a>). Five years earlier, the trio had upended the movie industry with Easy Rider.

But Newton and Fontaine struggled in the choppy sea, eventually scrambling ashore where they were picked up by the Cuban authorities. Drenched and anonymous to their would-be saviours, it wasn\u2019t the hero\u2019s welcome the Black Panthers leader anticipated. But it might have been BBS\u2019s most audacious production.</p> <p>It was far from the only unlikely connection between New Hollywood and the Black Panthers.

Seberg\u2019s career looked set to continue with big roles on either side of the Atlantic, but her association with black radicals and the Panthers would put her in the crosshairs of the FBI.</p> <p>In October 1968, Seberg was on the same flight as the former heroin addict turned revolutionary Hakim Jamal, who was married to a cousin of Malcolm X. Based in Compton, Los Angeles, Jamal acted as a fixer for the Black Panthers to meet with Hollywood royalty such as Marlon Brando. Jamal and Seberg would develop a close relationship \u2013 the Seberg biopic paints it as a sexual one, but her biographer Garry McGee claims it was platonic \u2013 with the actor becoming a key supporter of radical causes in Los Angeles. </p> <p>After starring in the air-disaster turkey Airport, Seberg transferred $5,000 to Jamal\u2019s account. She bought a bus for his Compton school, and in April 1969 hosted a fundraiser at her home. Paul Newman and Vanessa Redgrave attended, as did Joanne Woodward, Lee Marvin and Jane Fonda who \u2013 before she became infamous after <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/03/warmovies200803\" title=\"\">raising her fist in the black power salute while on the Oscars red carpet in 1970</a> \u2013 donated $1,000 to the school. Seberg\u2019s support of leftwing political movements and donations to the Black Panther party were deemed enough to make her \u201ca social nuisance\u201d in the eyes of the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover. </p> <p>In Seberg, the FBI is represented by Vince Vaughn\u2019s clownish agent and his morally compromised partner, played by Jack O\u2019Connell.

      "bodyText": "Huey P Newton was rowing towards the Cuban coastline in a dinghy with only one oar when it capsized. The leader of the Black Panthers and his girlfriend, Gwen Fontaine, were on the final part of a journey that had been masterminded by the most important production team in the New Hollywood era: Bert Schneider, Bob Rafelson and Steve Blauner (AKA BBS Productions). Five years earlier, the trio had upended the movie industry with Easy Rider. Now they were attempting to do to American life what they had done to Hollywood: brazenly tear up the rulebook and redistribute power. The producers had clandestinely shuttled Newton to Mexico, then convinced a Colombian smuggler \u2013 known only as \u201cthe Pirate\u201d \u2013 to take the black radical, who was on the run after being accused of shooting a 17-year-old sex worker, into Cuban waters. But Newton and Fontaine struggled in the choppy sea, eventually scrambling ashore where they were picked up by the Cuban authorities. Drenched and anonymous to their would-be saviours, it wasn\u2019t the hero\u2019s welcome the Black Panthers leader anticipated. But it might have been BBS\u2019s most audacious production. It was far from the only unlikely connection between New Hollywood and the Black Panthers. In the late 60s and early 70s, dozens of actors, producers and directors would flirt with the revolutionary group \u2013 funding them, championing them and chronicling their rise and fall. The story of Newton and Schneider\u2019s shambolic but ultimately successful bromance is on its way to becoming a TV series in the US with the original magazine story written by Joshuah Bearman \u2013 the same journalist who recounted the real-life storytale that became the Oscar winner Argo \u2013 being adapted into a limited series. Meanwhile, Seberg \u2013 the Jean Seberg biopic starring Kristen Stewart as the American starlet \u2013 is released in the UK next month. It tells the story of the star who was plucked out of obscurity in Marshalltown, Iowa after a talent search and became a darling of the French New Wave \u2013 starring in Otto Preminger\u2019s Saint Joan in 1957 and then Jean Luc-Godard\u2019s Breathless in 1960. Seberg\u2019s career looked set to continue with big roles on either side of the Atlantic, but her association with black radicals and the Panthers would put her in the crosshairs of the FBI. In October 1968, Seberg was on the same flight as the former heroin addict turned revolutionary Hakim Jamal, who was married to a cousin of Malcolm X. Based in Compton, Los Angeles, Jamal acted as a fixer for the Black Panthers to meet with Hollywood royalty such as Marlon Brando. Jamal and Seberg would develop a close relationship \u2013 the Seberg biopic paints it as a sexual one, but her biographer Garry McGee claims it was platonic \u2013 with the actor becoming a key supporter of radical causes in Los Angeles. After starring in the air-disaster turkey Airport, Seberg transferred $5,000 to Jamal\u2019s account. She bought a bus for his Compton school, and in April 1969 hosted a fundraiser at her home. Paul Newman and Vanessa Redgrave attended, as did Joanne Woodward, Lee Marvin and Jane Fonda who \u2013 before she became infamous after raising her fist in the black power salute while on the Oscars red carpet in 1970 \u2013 donated $1,000 to the school. Seberg\u2019s support of leftwing political movements and donations to the Black Panther party were deemed enough to make her \u201ca social nuisance\u201d in the eyes of the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover. In Seberg, the FBI is represented by Vince Vaughn\u2019s clownish agent and his morally compromised partner, played by Jack O\u2019Connell. They are told they must carry on hounding the actor because the orders come \u201cstraight from the top\u201d \u2013 meaning Hoover, who would sign off on the release of information to a gossip column in Hollywood that indicated that Seberg was pregnant with Jamal\u2019s child. It was a lie \u2013 she had in fact got pregnant after a fling with a young Mexican actor \u2013 but it spread before she\u2019d had a chance to explain the situation to her French husband, Romain Gary, driving a wedge between them. Seberg had a miscarriage in 1970 \u2013 the stress and paranoia that she endured having possibly contributed to it \u2013 and a mental breakdown. In a 1974 interview with the New York Times, Seberg discussed leaving the world of the black radicals behind \u2013 not because of the FBI intimidation, but because she felt her breakdown had made her a burden. \u201cI\u2019ve analysed the fact that I\u2019m not equipped to participate absolutely and totally,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a very, very bad mental breakdown, and now I realise I wouldn\u2019t want a person like me in a group I was a member of, as Groucho Marx would put it.\u201d She also discussed returning home with her dead baby to prove the child\u2019s ethnicity. \u201cWe opened the coffin and took 180 photographs, and everybody in Marshalltown who was curious what colour the baby was got a chance to check it out,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of them came to look.\u201d Seberg remained in Paris where her mental health problems continued. At 40 she was found dead in her car, after an apparent suicide. The Seberg case showed the lengths the FBI would go to in order to sabotage those associated with the Panthers, but it also highlighted the pull of the group.

Brando was a boost for the Panthers because he raised their profile, but he was also a way to financially prop up an organisation that was constantly having to find bail money and needed cash to support a rapidly expanding operation. A donor to the Panthers\u2019 cause, Brando gave the eulogy at the funeral of Bobby Hutton, a teenage Panther who was killed in April 1968 by the Oakland police while trying to surrender. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stand up and make a speech because you\u2019ve been listening to white people for 400 years,\u201d he said, before duly going on to give a speech in which he decried living standards for black Americans.

The list of celebrity donors to the group reads like a who\u2019s who of New (and old) Hollywood. Liz Taylor and Richard Burton signed cheques. Fonda solicited for donations to the Panthers at Taylor\u2019s Oscars party in 1970. Mia Farrow, Shirley MacLaine and Barbra Streisand all contributed. But the relationship was not a one-way street: the group found inspiration from the new breed of risk-taking film-makers. As Newton became more unpredictable and isolated as the Panthers\u2019 leader, he turned to The Godfather and would extol \u201cits protagonists\u2019 machiavellian cunning and ruthlessness\u201d. Newton also loved Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song \u2013 Melvin Van Peebles\u2019s groundbreaking 1971 film about a hustler who becomes a revolutionary and runs away to Mexico \u2013 which had more than a slight resemblance to his own story.

Howard Alk\u2019s American Revolution 2 follows the Panthers after the unrest at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago as its leadership attempts to form an alliance with poor, disenfranchised whites. Alk\u2019s The Murder of Fred Hampton serves as an \u201cexpos\u00e9 of state-sponsored anti-black terror\u201d, with the documentary maker attempting to reveal the extent of the FBI\u2019s involvement in the young, charismatic leader\u2019s death. David Weiss\u2019s No Vietnamese Ever Called Me Nigger makes the link between the black liberation and anti-war movements, while documenting the anti-Vietnam-war march on the United Nations in 1967. Perhaps the most potent Panthers documentary is Agn\u00e8s Varda\u2019s 27-minute portrait, which captures the energy of the nascent movement in Oakland during the summer of 1968. Stokely Carmichael, Eldridge Cleaver and Kathleen Cleaver articulately unpack the Panthers\u2019 Marxist ideology, while other female Panthers explain the importance of wearing their hair naturally.

      "bodyText": "Documentary film-makers operating in some of the most dangerous countries in the world are having their work disrupted and security compromised by a Trump administration edict that forces them to disclose their social media activities when applying to enter the US, a new lawsuit claims. The US homeland security and state departments were sued in a federal court in Washington on Thursday over a rule change that the plaintiffs argue could put film-makers in personal peril. The suit concerns a registration requirement introduced in May that affects more than 14 million visa applicants each year, obliging them to disclose all social media behavior including the pseudonymous handles they use to protect their identity. The legal action has been brought by two US-based documentary film organizations that collaborate with international directors and producers. The films created through these networks often deal with highly sensitive subjects such as political dissent and corruption. \u201cIn many cases, our partners can be thought of as activists with cameras. Many work with various kinds of risk \u2013 physical, political or other forms of persecution,\u201d said Oliver Rivers, a director of one of the plaintiff groups, Doc Society which is headquartered in New York and London. Under the rule change, film-makers wanting to come to the US to work with Doc Society or its fellow plaintiff, the Los Angeles-based International Documentary Association (IDA), must fill out electronic visa application forms in which they are required to state which of 20 social media platforms they have used in the past five years. The platforms include Facebook, Flickr, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube as well as several sites in China and other countries. In each case, the applicant must divulge the social handle they post under, effectively forcing them to break their anonymity and hand the information over to the US government. The DHS and state department are known to store the data for up to 100 years after an applicant\u2019s date of birth and are allowed to share the intelligence with other federal and state agencies as well as \u201cinternational government agencies\u201d. In effect, the rule change permits the US government to hand over personal information on foreign film-makers to the very government bodies who they might be investigating in their documentary work. It also amounts to a massive new form of surveillance. \u201cThe registration requirement is the linchpin of a far-reaching and unconstitutional surveillance regime that permits the government to monitor the online activities of millions of visa applicants, and to continue monitoring them even after they\u2019ve entered the United States,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight Institute which along with the Brennan Center is legally representing the film groups. The plaintiffs are petitioning the federal court to block the social media disclosure provision on grounds that it unlawfully infringes the free speech rights of the film-makers and subjects them to arbitrary and capricious government action. They argue that if the requirement is allowed to stand it will place a chill on the political activities and creativity of the artists. \u201cOur partners are telling us that they have already begun to censor themselves online or alternatively cancel their plans to come to the US, and both of those are extremely disturbing,\u201d Rivers said. At the time that the rule change was made, Twitter strongly opposed it. The platform said that it \u201ccould have a chilling effect on free speech and the willingness of people who use Twitter to engage in free expression and conversation\u201d. The lawsuit refers to an unnamed Turkish film-maker who belongs to IDA who has decided not to come to the US because he fears handing over his social media identifier. It cites another IDA member from Syria who is in particular danger because they use pseudonymous online accounts to share views on political and social issues. Among those who are now reining in their social media speech is a film-maker who pseudonymously comments on the Trump administration, the lawsuit says. The legal challenge lands at a time when international film-making is enjoying something of a golden era. This week For Sama, the documentary about life under siege in Aleppo at the heart of the Syrian war, swept the awards at the British independent film awards. But the terrain remains challenging for many directors who rely on anonymity to mitigate the extreme risks they are taking.

The company is the world\u2019s biggest commodity trader, buying and selling everything from oil to cotton, wheat and sugar. It operates in more than 50 countries and also has a significant mining operation for gold, silver, platinum, nickel, iron and aluminium.</p> <p>The announcement of the SFO probe is the latest setback for Glencore, which is already being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/03/glencore-subpoena-us-department-of-justice\">investigated by the US Department of Justice</a> for alleged money laundering and corruption in Nigeria, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Africa\u2019s biggest copper producer, dating back to 2007.</p> <p>The announcement of a UK enquiry had been widely expected in mining circles, following a Bloomberg report in May that stated that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-18/glencore-said-to-face-u-k-bribery-probe-over-congo-dealings-jhbxhab4\">the SFO was preparing to open a formal bribery investigation</a> into Glencore and its work with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler and the leader of DRC.</p> <p>Gertler\u2019s notoriety in the DRC, which is rich in resources but riven by conflict, spans nearly two decades. He is reported to have made billions from being the unofficial gatekeeper to natural resources deals in the central African country. His friendship with the nation\u2019s former president Joseph Kabila \u2013 who was head of state from 2001 until earlier this year \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/19/glencorexstrata-faces-questions-drc-deals-dan-gertler\">has long been a source of controversy</a>.</p> <p>Gertler was cited by a <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/report-panel-experts-illegal-exploitation-natural-resources-and\">2001 UN investigation</a> that said he had given Kabila $20m to buy weapons to equip his army against rebel groups in exchange for a monopoly on the country\u2019s diamonds.</p> <p>The Israeli was also named in a <a href=\"http://www.africaprogresspanel.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013_APR_Equity_in_Extractives_25062013_ENG_HR.pdf\">2013 Africa Progress Panel report</a> that said a string of mining deals struck by companies linked to him had deprived the country of more than $1.3bn in potential revenue.</p> <p>In 2017, leaked documents that formed part of the Panama Papers investigation showed how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/revealed-glencore-secret-loan-drc-mining-rights-paradise-papers\">Glencore had secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars to Gertler</a> after it enlisted him to secure a controversial mining agreement in the DRC.</p> <p>The tycoon has repeatedly stated that all allegations of illegal behaviour are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/28/paradise-papers-businessman-african-bribery-inquiry-dan-gertler\">\u201cfalse and without any basis whatsoever\u201d</a>, that he \u201crejects them absolutely\u201d, and that he transacts business \u201cfairly and honestly, and strictly according to the law\u201d.</p> <p>Glencore has also developed a controversial reputation of its own.</p> <p>The company was founded in 1974 by the commodities trader and financier Marc Rich, who in 1983 was indicted on charges described by the then US attorney for New York, Rudolph Giuliani, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/26/marc-rich-commodities-trader-fugitive-dies\">\u201cthe biggest tax evasion case in United States history\u201d</a>.</p> <p>He was also charged with buying millions of barrels of oil from Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis, flouting a ban on \u201ctrading with the enemy\u201d. He fled to Switzerland and remained on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list until he was controversially pardoned by Bill Clinton in the final hours of his presidency in 2001.</p> <p>By then, Rich had long lost control of the company following a management buyout in 1993.</p> <p>Under its billionaire chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, the company grew to become the world\u2019s biggest commodity trader, supplying the raw materials used in products from cars to smartphones.</p> <p>When it floated on the London stock exchange in May 2011 it was valued at \u00a338bn but the shares, which were then priced at 530p each, have never been worth as much since.</p> <p>Many of Glencore\u2019s executives have left in the past year. This week, <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/mining/not-many-of-us-old-guys-left-glencore-ceo-hints-he-may-leave-sooner-than-expected\">Glasenberg hinted</a> that he could leave the company soon.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into suspicions of bribery at mining and commodity trading group Glencore. The SFO said \u201cit is investigating suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business by the Glencore group of companies, its officials, employees, agents and associated persons\u201d. In a statement, the \u00a330bn company added: \u201cGlencore has been notified today that the Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business of the Glencore group.\u201d Glencore, which is listed on the London stock exchange but has its headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, said it would cooperate with the investigation. Its share price fell by 9% on the news to close at 216.9p, a three-year low. The company is the world\u2019s biggest commodity trader, buying and selling everything from oil to cotton, wheat and sugar. It operates in more than 50 countries and also has a significant mining operation for gold, silver, platinum, nickel, iron and aluminium. The announcement of the SFO probe is the latest setback for Glencore, which is already being investigated by the US Department of Justice for alleged money laundering and corruption in Nigeria, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Africa\u2019s biggest copper producer, dating back to 2007. The announcement of a UK enquiry had been widely expected in mining circles, following a Bloomberg report in May that stated that the SFO was preparing to open a formal bribery investigation into Glencore and its work with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler and the leader of DRC. Gertler\u2019s notoriety in the DRC, which is rich in resources but riven by conflict, spans nearly two decades. He is reported to have made billions from being the unofficial gatekeeper to natural resources deals in the central African country. His friendship with the nation\u2019s former president Joseph Kabila \u2013 who was head of state from 2001 until earlier this year \u2013 has long been a source of controversy. Gertler was cited by a 2001 UN investigation that said he had given Kabila $20m to buy weapons to equip his army against rebel groups in exchange for a monopoly on the country\u2019s diamonds. The Israeli was also named in a 2013 Africa Progress Panel report that said a string of mining deals struck by companies linked to him had deprived the country of more than $1.3bn in potential revenue. In 2017, leaked documents that formed part of the Panama Papers investigation showed how Glencore had secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars to Gertler after it enlisted him to secure a controversial mining agreement in the DRC. The tycoon has repeatedly stated that all allegations of illegal behaviour are \u201cfalse and without any basis whatsoever\u201d, that he \u201crejects them absolutely\u201d, and that he transacts business \u201cfairly and honestly, and strictly according to the law\u201d. Glencore has also developed a controversial reputation of its own. The company was founded in 1974 by the commodities trader and financier Marc Rich, who in 1983 was indicted on charges described by the then US attorney for New York, Rudolph Giuliani, as \u201cthe biggest tax evasion case in United States history\u201d. He was also charged with buying millions of barrels of oil from Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis, flouting a ban on \u201ctrading with the enemy\u201d. He fled to Switzerland and remained on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list until he was controversially pardoned by Bill Clinton in the final hours of his presidency in 2001. By then, Rich had long lost control of the company following a management buyout in 1993. Under its billionaire chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, the company grew to become the world\u2019s biggest commodity trader, supplying the raw materials used in products from cars to smartphones. When it floated on the London stock exchange in May 2011 it was valued at \u00a338bn but the shares, which were then priced at 530p each, have never been worth as much since. Many of Glencore\u2019s executives have left in the past year. This week, Glasenberg hinted that he could leave the company soon.",

      "bodyText": "My mum came to the UK from India in 1973, after a chunk of time spent in Uganda, when she was only 13. Colonialism shaped her life, and that of my grandparents; growing up in Newcastle, it was the backdrop to mine too. I\u2019d heard plenty about empire and anticolonial movements at home, but during 14 years in the UK\u2019s state education system I learned almost nothing about it. Now, over a decade later, little has changed: new research suggests that there still isn\u2019t much systematic teaching about empire. The national curriculum says young people are supposed to learn about \u201chow Britain has influenced, and been influenced by the wider world\u201d, but when it comes to a central part of this country\u2019s history, there can be near silence. It\u2019s contained in one-month of learning, or hived off from the \u201ccore curriculum\u201d in the form of optional modules. Why does this matter? A leaked draft of the independent review into the Windrush scandal earlier this year showed one reason. It recommended that all Home Office staff should \u201clearn about the history of the UK and its relationship with the rest of the world, including Britain\u2019s colonial history\u201d. If we were all taught about colonial history in school, we\u2019d learn at a young age that many of the people who came here from colonies and former colonies did so as citizens, not as immigrants. We\u2019d discuss how so-called immigration policies introduced from the 1960s onward were designed to make it more difficult for people of colour to come to this country, and we\u2019d examine the forms of resistance that came with this. In a manner similar to the implementation of the anti-Jewish Aliens Act of 1905, successive governments treated minorities as a threat to the UK. They enacted what the academic Gurminder Bhambra calls \u201cpolicies of racialisation\u201d. \u201cIf we understood that,\u201d she told me, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t just shift the boundary of citizen and migrant to include people from (former) colonies. To say that I\u2019m not a migrant is not a lack of solidarity with those who are migrants ... If we were to accept that I am British, then that would mean that we would have to think differently about migration in the present.\u201d History is not stuck in the past. What we remember, and how, helps us understand who we are. Learning about empire \u2013 from the brutal suppression of Kenya\u2019s Mau Mau uprising to WEB Du Bois\u2019 work on colonialism \u2013 would mean understanding that colonialists created race and the racial hierarchy to control and govern colonies around the world. Unpicking how and why race was constructed would make for a more sophisticated discussion about racism now and chip away at the idea that this was ever an exclusively \u201cwhite\u201d country. It might also mean people on either side of the Brexit divide pausing before they demand \u201cwe\u201d \u201ctake back control\u201d or lament that the UK was a \u201ctolerant\u201d country before the EU referendum. In a sanitised version of history that is spouted by politicians such as Boris Johnson, the UK grew rich not because of exploitation and resource extraction, because of an innate ability to progress. This colonial thinking persists; the \u201cbackward\u201d became the \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d, while the lives and knowledge of some are still considered more important than others. Four billion people are not poor because of some unhappy accident or an inherent failing; legacies of colonialism, extractive capitalist economies and racialised hierarchies of power produce poverty. Against a history where supremacy often meant mastering the environment for profit \u2013 decimating indigenous communities in the process \u2013 it\u2019s not by chance that the climate crisis now impacts those least responsible for it. As part of its race and faith strategy, the Labour party has committed to setting up an Emancipation Education Trust, which would ensure migration, colonialism and this country\u2019s multiracial past are taught in schools. So too would the legacy of slavery, including \u201chow it interrupted a rich and powerful black history which is also British history\u201d. Some regard teaching about colonialism as simply too political, as if the way we tell history now is somehow neutral. Relative quiet in our schools is paired with politicians glorifying empire as its realities are erased; nostalgia and amnesia sitting side by side. Britain\u2019s bloody colonial history is weighed up as both good and bad; the railways v the Bengal famine. One the UK can take credit for; the other is too far in the past to have much to do with \u201cus\u201d. This country is the saviour, never really an oppressor. In this election there is a chance to change this narrative. It\u2019s not about guilt or one-dimensional stereotypes: if histories of exclusion, colonialism and the fierce resistance to much of this were more widely known, it could mean a more nuanced, inclusive understanding of the present. \u2022 Maya Goodfellow is a writer and academic, and the author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats",

As inventors find new uses for the versatile material, demand is growing a hefty 18% per year. The use of nanocellulose for packaging and construction can help remove carbon dioxide, a primary contributor to climate change, from the atmosphere, and reduce demand for environment-harming plastics.

Recent research in the US has shown that pollen of sunflowers and relatives, though not as nutritionally valuable as pollen from other plants, appears to reduce the severity of a gut infection that decreases reproductive success in bumblebees. If this research were to lead to mass plantings of sunflowers, it could adversely affect other wild bees that depend on more nutritious plants or on host-parasite interactions to thrive.</p> <p><strong>Long-horned trouble</strong></p> <p>The Asian long-horned tick arrived in the US in 2017, bringing a most unwelcome guest: a bacterium that kills cattle.

      "bodyText": "What are the biggest emerging opportunities and threats the coming year holds for efforts to conserve biodiversity? Nearly two dozen scientists, conservation professionals and future scanners recently came together to answer that question as part of an annual \u201chorizon scan\u201d led by Cambridge University conservation biologist William Sutherland. The group narrowed a list of 89 issues to 15 emerging or anticipated trends that have a strong potential to benefit or harm living things but are not yet on the radar for most conservationists. Here are their top picks, published in the journal Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution. Cellulose, for better and worse Cellulose, one of the main components of wood, is proving to be remarkably useful when broken into nano-sized bits. As inventors find new uses for the versatile material, demand is growing a hefty 18% per year. The use of nanocellulose for packaging and construction can help remove carbon dioxide, a primary contributor to climate change, from the atmosphere, and reduce demand for environment-harming plastics. But it could also increase pressure to turn diverse forests into plantations bereft of biodiversity, and otherwise disrupt habitat. Forests as fuel The European Union has adopted a directive classifying wood as a renewable energy source and has plans to dramatically increase renewables\u2019 share of the energy mix by 2030. Ironically, these moves are spurring actions that are seen as detrimental from both climate change and biodiversity perspectives: The import of wood into the EU from countries such as the US and Canada has increased in recent years and there are concerns for disruption of forest habitat in Europe as well. A lawsuit is challenging the classification but the problem could worsen if countries outside the EU follow suit. Better buds for bees? Bees and other pollinators have been in big trouble lately as changing land use and perils such as pesticides and disease decimate their populations. Recent research in the US has shown that pollen of sunflowers and relatives, though not as nutritionally valuable as pollen from other plants, appears to reduce the severity of a gut infection that decreases reproductive success in bumblebees.

The 33 refugees, among them families from Cameroon, Afghanistan and Togo, arrived in Rome on Wednesday night and will be hosted by the Vatican and the Sant\u2019Egidio charity. \u201cWe have the money, let\u2019s begin with ourselves \u2026 let\u2019s open our rectories, convents and monasteries to at least one family each from the Lesbos refugee camps so that we can empty them all,\u201d Krajewski said after landing at Fiumicino airport, in Rome, with the group from Lesbos. \u201cI have seen terrible situations in the camps.\u201d The population in the island\u2019s camps has increased from 7,000 in May to more than 15,000, of whom 800 are unaccompanied children, Krajewski said. \u201cThere is no hope for them stuck in Greece, where they are living in dramatic conditions. This is a problem for Europe and is shameful.\u201d The Vatican\u2019s latest \u201chuman corridor\u201d mission from Lesbos was implemented following the approval of Greek authorities and the Italian interior ministry. Pope Francis, who has likened migrant facilities on Lesbos to \u201cconcentration camps\u201d, brought back 12 Syrian families after visiting the island in 2016. They were temporarily housed by the Vatican before being helped to integrate into society by Sant\u2019Egidio. Ten more people will be transferred to Italy from Lesbos by the end of the year. Greece has been repeatedly castigated by rights groups and the Council of Europe over the conditions in refugee camps across its islands. On Thursday a fire broke out in a container housing a family of five Afghans in the Kara Tepe camp on Lesbos, killing a 27-year-old woman. Other camp residents managed to safely evacuate the children \u2013 an infant, a three-year-old and a five-year-old. The children\u2019s mother was found dead after the fire was extinguished. Their father suffered smoke inhalation. A fire broke out at the crowded Moria camp in Lesbos in September killing a woman from Afghanistan and triggering clashes between refugees and police. The facility has been hit by several fires since the EU struck a deal with Turkey in 2016 to stem the flow of migrants, with a woman and child dying in a blaze that year. In November Greece\u2019s centre-right government, which came to power in July, announced plans to close the three largest migrant camps on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos and replace them with facilities on the mainland that campaigners compared to detention centres. The government has vowed to relocate 20,000 asylum seekers to camps on the mainland by early 2020. It has also passed a law tightening asylum requirements and pledged to increase border controls. Krajewski was named almoner, a job that Pope Francis transformed into a hands-on charitable mission, in 2013. He has worked discreetly, for the most part, for the poor for years. However, in May this year he made headlines after climbing down a manhole and breaking a seal to restore electricity to a building in Rome where 250 homeless people were living. The move prompted an angry reaction from the far-right politician Matteo Salvini, then the deputy prime minister.",

      "body": "<p>Three men who were convicted nearly 50 years ago on the evidence of a corrupt police officer have finally had their names cleared by senior judges.</p> <p>Upholding an appeal against conviction by Winston Trew, Sterling Christie and George Griffiths \u2013 who, with Constantine Boucher, were part of the \u201cOval Four\u201d \u2013 the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, told them: \u201cOur regret is that it has taken so long for this injustice to be remedied.\u201d</p> <p>The men were arrested in March 1972 by a group of undercover police officers at Oval Underground station and accused of \u201cnicking handbags\u201d on the tube. They were beaten in the police cells and then charged with attempting to steal, theft, and assault of the police.</p> <p>After a five-week Old Bailey trial, at which none of the supposed theft \u201cvictims\u201d appeared and the police relied on highly disputed \u201cconfessions\u201d, all four were convicted and jailed for two years. The arrests occurred when \u201cmugging\u201d was a high-profile issue and routinely blamed on young black men. The defendants became known as the Oval Four and the case became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, with demonstrations and marches in south London where the men lived.</p> <p>Judy Khan QC, for the appellants, described the case as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and told the court that Derek Ridgewell, the detective sergeant in the British Transport Police who had led the arrests, had himself been jailed after his conviction in 1978 of conspiracy to steal mailbags. She said the case had been referred to the court of appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, whose case worker Anona Bisping had carried out \u201cthorough and detailed work\u201d. The Crown Prosecution Service supported the appeal.</p> <p>Both Trew and Christie, 69, attended the case with their families and heard Burnett, sitting with Mrs Justice McGowan and Sir Roderick Evans, declare their convictions as \u201cunsustainable\u201d. Griffiths, 67, who now lives abroad, was not present because of family commitments, and Boucher has not yet been traced.</p> <p>Outside court a delighted Trew said: \u201cI have lived with this case for every day of my life and I have never given up.\u201d He said he would celebrate by \u201cnever having to think of that man Ridgewell again. That man didn\u2019t just steal mailbags, he stole lives.\u201d His wife, Hyacinth, said: \u201cNow I can exhale!\u201d</p> <p>The chair of the CCRC, Helen Pitcher, said: \u201cWe are delighted for Mr Trew, Mr Christie and Mr Griffiths and pleased that the court agreed with our assessment that the misconduct of DS Ridgewell rendered their convictions unsafe. It is a good example of what we do at the CCRC.\u201d</p> <p>The successful appeal come after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/winston-trew-to-clear-his-name\">years of research into the case by Trew</a>. After he was released from prison, he became a youth worker, took a degree in social sciences at the North East London Polytechnic (now the University of East London) and became a lecturer at South Bank University. He had a stroke in 2003 and, as part of his recovery, used the Freedom of Information Act to examine his case.</p> <p>He discovered that Ridgewell had died in prison in 1982 while serving a seven-year sentence for conspiring to steal mailbags. Trew published his findings in the book, Black for a Cause, published in 2010.</p> <p>Ridgewell, who had previously served with the Southern Rhodesian (now Zimbabwean) police, had also taken part in the arrests of other young black men who became known as the Stockwell Six, the Waterloo Four and the Tottenham Court Road Two.</p> <p>The last of those cases was thrown out in 1973 by the trial judge, Gwyn Morris, who said: \u201cI find it terrible that here in London people using public transport should be pounced upon by police officers without a word that they are police officers.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cmugging squad\u201d was disbanded and Ridgewell was quietly moved to a post investigating theft on trains through which he met two career criminals with whom he would split the proceeds from stolen mailbags.</p> <p>Eventually he was arrested himself and jailed.

      "bodyText": "Three men who were convicted nearly 50 years ago on the evidence of a corrupt police officer have finally had their names cleared by senior judges. Upholding an appeal against conviction by Winston Trew, Sterling Christie and George Griffiths \u2013 who, with Constantine Boucher, were part of the \u201cOval Four\u201d \u2013 the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, told them: \u201cOur regret is that it has taken so long for this injustice to be remedied.\u201d The men were arrested in March 1972 by a group of undercover police officers at Oval Underground station and accused of \u201cnicking handbags\u201d on the tube. They were beaten in the police cells and then charged with attempting to steal, theft, and assault of the police. After a five-week Old Bailey trial, at which none of the supposed theft \u201cvictims\u201d appeared and the police relied on highly disputed \u201cconfessions\u201d, all four were convicted and jailed for two years. The arrests occurred when \u201cmugging\u201d was a high-profile issue and routinely blamed on young black men. The defendants became known as the Oval Four and the case became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, with demonstrations and marches in south London where the men lived. Judy Khan QC, for the appellants, described the case as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and told the court that Derek Ridgewell, the detective sergeant in the British Transport Police who had led the arrests, had himself been jailed after his conviction in 1978 of conspiracy to steal mailbags. She said the case had been referred to the court of appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, whose case worker Anona Bisping had carried out \u201cthorough and detailed work\u201d. The Crown Prosecution Service supported the appeal. Both Trew and Christie, 69, attended the case with their families and heard Burnett, sitting with Mrs Justice McGowan and Sir Roderick Evans, declare their convictions as \u201cunsustainable\u201d. Griffiths, 67, who now lives abroad, was not present because of family commitments, and Boucher has not yet been traced. Outside court a delighted Trew said: \u201cI have lived with this case for every day of my life and I have never given up.\u201d He said he would celebrate by \u201cnever having to think of that man Ridgewell again. That man didn\u2019t just steal mailbags, he stole lives.\u201d His wife, Hyacinth, said: \u201cNow I can exhale!\u201d The chair of the CCRC, Helen Pitcher, said: \u201cWe are delighted for Mr Trew, Mr Christie and Mr Griffiths and pleased that the court agreed with our assessment that the misconduct of DS Ridgewell rendered their convictions unsafe. It is a good example of what we do at the CCRC.\u201d The successful appeal come after years of research into the case by Trew. After he was released from prison, he became a youth worker, took a degree in social sciences at the North East London Polytechnic (now the University of East London) and became a lecturer at South Bank University. He had a stroke in 2003 and, as part of his recovery, used the Freedom of Information Act to examine his case. He discovered that Ridgewell had died in prison in 1982 while serving a seven-year sentence for conspiring to steal mailbags. Trew published his findings in the book, Black for a Cause, published in 2010. Ridgewell, who had previously served with the Southern Rhodesian (now Zimbabwean) police, had also taken part in the arrests of other young black men who became known as the Stockwell Six, the Waterloo Four and the Tottenham Court Road Two. The last of those cases was thrown out in 1973 by the trial judge, Gwyn Morris, who said: \u201cI find it terrible that here in London people using public transport should be pounced upon by police officers without a word that they are police officers.\u201d The \u201cmugging squad\u201d was disbanded and Ridgewell was quietly moved to a post investigating theft on trains through which he met two career criminals with whom he would split the proceeds from stolen mailbags. Eventually he was arrested himself and jailed. Asked by the governor at Ford prison how he became involved, Ridgewell\u2019s response was: \u201cI just went bent.\u201d At the age of 37 he had a heart attack in jail and died. Last year, another man, Stephen Simmons, who had been framed by Ridgewell for stealing mailbags in the 1970s, successfully appealed against his conviction and was assisted by Trew\u2019s research. After that appeal, Trew applied to the CCRC for his own case to be reviewed. The other two defendants, Griffiths and Boucher, could not be traced initially. Griffiths was in the United States when he learned of the appeal through the Guardian\u2019s report and the CCRC added his name to the appeal. \u201cIt changed the directions of our lives but I\u2019m a survivor and I don\u2019t really look at it from the point of view of being a victim,\u201d Griffiths told the Guardian. He now lives between Jamaica, the US and London. \u201cWhat I endured has tempered me,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have a saying in Jamaica: \u2018It takes iron to sharpen iron\u2019.\u201d Because he was younger than the other three, he was sent to borstal rather than jail. Trew\u2019s parents came to England in the early 1950s as part of the Windrush generation, his father having been a police officer in Jamaica. After leaving school and while on a government training course in electrical engineering, he became involved in politics. In 1970, he joined the Fasimbas (Young Lions), the youth wing of an organisation called the South East London Parents\u2019 Organisation.

The posts stoke deep hatred of Islam across the western world and influence politics in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US by amplifying far-right parties including Australia\u2019s One Nation and vilifying Muslim politicians such as US Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar. The network has also targeted leftwing politicians at critical points in national election campaigns, posting false stories about the UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. The revelations show how Facebook has failed to stop clandestine actors from using its platform to run coordinated disinformation and hate campaigns. The network uncovered by the Guardian has operated with relative impunity even since Mark Zuckerberg offered his apology to the US Senate after the Cambridge Analytica and Russian interference scandals. When the Guardian notified Facebook of its investigation, the company removed several pages and accounts \u201cthat appeared to be financially motivated\u201d, a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThese pages and accounts violated our policy against spam and fake accounts by posting clickbait content to drive people to off-platform sites. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow people to misrepresent themselves on Facebook and we\u2019ve updated our inauthentic behaviour policy to further improve our ability to counter new tactics. \u201cOur investigations are continuing and, as always, we\u2019ll take action if we find any violations.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s investigation has revealed that the Israel-based group gains access to existing rightwing and far-right Facebook pages by approaching local administrators and offering to act as editors who could bring new content and increase reach. Once they gain access, the Israeli administrators publish identical posts almost simultaneously to the network\u2019s 21 Facebook pages, which have a combined 1 million followers around the globe. Queensland University of Technology researchers worked with the Guardian to confirm that the Facebook posts are being distributed by a single source across the 21 pages, probably using auto-scheduling software. The network published 5,695 coordinated posts receiving 846,424 likes, shares or comments in October alone, Guardian analysis shows. In total, the network has published at least 165,000 posts and attracted 14.3m likes, shares or comments. Australia\u2019s first female Muslim senator, Mehreen Faruqi, felt the full force of the network in August last year, when 10 of its pages launched coordinated posts inciting their 546,000 followers to attack her for speaking in parliament against racism. This prompted what Faruqi described as a \u201chorrific feeding frenzy of racism, fake news and hate\u201d. She says the network represents a \u201cnew level of far-right organisation and coordination\u201d. \u201cBy allowing racist and misleading posts, social media giants like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are profiteering from the proliferation of hate speech and abuse,\u201d Faruqi said. A spokesperson for Facebook told the Guardian: \u201cNobody can advocate or advertise hate or violence on Facebook and we remove any violations as soon as we become aware.\u201d In the UK, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who in May said he had been forced to employ 24-hour police protection after repeated threats on social media, has been targeted by the network hundreds of times. The posts falsely claimed Khan said terror attacks were \u201cpart and parcel of living in a big city\u201d after the 2017 attack on Westminster and that British people should \u201cleave London if they do not want to experience a terror attack\u201d. The posts have attracted abusive and violent comments. Those behind the network have gone to great lengths to hide their identity. But Guardian Australia\u2019s investigation has connected the operation to one known man in Tel Aviv, who goes by the username Ariel1238a.",

Each time a local page-owner agrees to let one of the Israeli administrators in, they become unwitting though not necessarily unwilling participants in the globally coordinated distribution of online hate.</p> \n<p>Some page-owners, like Villereal, who runs Pissed off Deplorables, had no idea their new Israeli counterparts were making money from the following they had built.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little disheartening to sit here and think I\u2019ve been doing this for two years and I haven\u2019t made a dime, and I allowed someone to come in who\u2019s built the little back channel but they\u2019re going to use my clientele to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s like I own the store, I built it and everything like that, and you\u2019re the one profiting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Those behind the network went to great lengths to hide their identities, concealing personal information from websites and using different Facebook profiles when contacting the owners of existing far-right pages.</p> \n<p>But by following a trail of digital breadcrumbs, the Guardian\u2019s investigation traced the network back to a key player: a man going by the username Ariel1238a.</p> \n<h2>Finding Ariel</h2> \n<p>In December 2017, Ariel1238a made a seemingly benign request for help on an obscure search engine optimisation forum.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for more ways to monetize my site,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy niche is about politics.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the past two years, the same username has popped up regularly on similar web forums.</p> \n<p>Writing in broken English, Ariel1238a frets about drops in his click-through rate, the inability to host \u201cviolent content\u201d alongside advertising sourced through Google AdSense, and the low revenue return per-click on native advertising site Taboola. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with the profits they bring,\u201d he told one forum.</p> \n<p>He also complains about Facebook\u2019s efforts to crack down on \u201cfake news\u201d. When the social media giant announced in April that it would step up its efforts to combat misinformation on the site, Ariel wrote: \u201cFacebook has released another step on the way to its end, matter of time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ariel1238a is not a web expert. He asks rudimentary questions including how to set up a business email domain and increase traffic to his sites. Yet his websites, he tells the forums, serve \u201cleading countries\u201d including the UK, US, Australia and Canada and have, he boasts, \u201csomthing like 1m pageviews per month\u201d.</p> \n<p>The posts give no suggestion that Ariel1238a will become a driving force behind a wave of anti-Islamic hate across Facebook.</p> \n<p>In fact, online profiles linked to Ariel1238a betray no political or ideological position at all. Instead, his digital footprint suggests that before he turned to exploiting the far-right\u2019s obsession with Islam for profit, he had for years engaged in a number of unsophisticated online money-making schemes.</p> \n<p>A now dormant account on a blog-publishing service links him to a \u201cfree sex dating\u201d site, a \u201creligious dating\u201d site and a fan page for the fourth season of the Israeli Big Brother television series. He has dabbled in online directories for gyms in Tel Aviv, Botox injections, an online sim card store and a site described simply as \u201cOnline sex | Camera sex\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Ariel1238a is not a web expert. He asks rudimentary questions including how to set up a business email domain and increase traffic to his sites.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Using web archiving services and domain registry information, the Guardian has been able to confirm the username Ariel1238a belongs to Ariel Elkaras, a 30-something jewellery salesman and online operator living on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Soon after the Guardian contacted Elkaras for comment, several of the network\u2019s websites were either taken down or had large amounts of content removed. The public posts on his Facebook profile were also removed.</p> \n<p>Elkaras did not respond to multiple requests for comment via email and phone, but the Guardian was able to track him down.</p> \n<p>When we turned up at his apartment in a town near Tel Aviv in Israel, an older woman answered the door. She called out to Elkaras, who arrived wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants.</p> \n<p>Through a translator, Elkaras denied knowledge of or involvement in the network but said he had once been \u201cincluded in a group, something about Israel\u201d. He refused to answer questions about his job, other than to confirm he dealt with computers. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s not your business,\u201d he said. \u201c[The network] is nothing related to me.\u201d</p> \n<p>When the Guardian asked about the username Ariel1238a, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He closed the door, but shortly after followed a reporter out on to the street and demanded to know how the Guardian had found him.</p> \n<p>Elkaras was the only real person the Guardian was able to connect to the operation. We were unable to verify whether Rochale, Tehila, or the other names used by the Facebook profiles that contacted page administrators, were the names of real people.</p> \n<p>Messages obtained by the Guardian show Rochale telling a local page administrator she doesn\u2019t know how to make money online and that she doesn\u2019t know who runs the websites she sources her content from.</p> \n<p>\u201cI only share posts on your page because this topic is important to me,\u201d she wrote.</p> \n<p>While initially describing Tehila as \u201ca Pam Geller type\u201d, Devito later admitted he had never actually seen or spoken to her. Asked how he knew she was real, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t, to be brutally honest.\u201d</p> \n<p>Of the page administrators who returned requests for comment from the Guardian, only one claimed to have physically seen Tehila via Skype but declined to provide evidence. Asked how he knew he was speaking to a woman, the administrator, who declined to reveal his identity, said: \u201cIt sure looked like one.\u201d</p> \n<p>None of the page administrators the Guardian spoke to for this story were aware that the Israeli group was making money from the scheme, or that their pages were part of a larger network.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t upfront about it because as much as I saw in the message ... there was no talk about making money,\u201d a pro-Trump page administrator based in Nigeria told the Guardian.</p> \n<h2>Political influence and Facebook\u2019s failures</h2> \n<p>In April last year, Zuckerberg sat before an army of cameras and offered a mea culpa to the world.</p> \n<p>Facebook, still reeling from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, had failed its users, Zuckerberg said.

And it was my mistake.\u201d</p> \n<p>Two months later, the Israeli-based network gained access to its 13th far-right Facebook page, expanding the already sizeable audience for its disinformation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"273a9a89900a8122cb209c1e4e442312f4b02848\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/273a9a89900a8122cb209c1e4e442312f4b02848/0_0_4844_3229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testifies before the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testifies before the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee in April 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The network has operated with relative impunity for almost two years.</p> \n<p>\u201cBelieve it or not she hasn\u2019t done anything to get the page in trouble,\u201d Devito said of his Israeli administrator. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten anything from Facebook that \u2018you\u2019ve been posting inappropriate content that\u2019s violated our community standards\u2019 or anything of the sort. I\u2019ve been very fortunate in that regard.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the network grew, so did its ability to influence the thinking of voters. By the time the Australian election came around in May, the pages were providing a significant platform for far-right candidates, including One Nation and Fraser Anning, a senator widely condemned for calling for a \u201cfinal solution\u201d to immigration.</p> \n<p>The network boosted Anning and One Nation with 401 posts in the lead-up to the election, which attracted 82,025 likes, 18,748 comments and 33,730 shares.</p> \n<p>A One Nation spokesman, James Ashby, said the network would not benefit the party, and engagement on leader Pauline Hanson\u2019s personal page was far greater. \u201cI would suggest the 401 posts you refer to has attracted a nanoscopic number of likes, comments and shares in comparison,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for Anning said he was previously unaware of the network and did not believe it had helped his campaign.</p> \n<p>It was a similar story in Canada. In the lead-up to the October election, the network pushed out 80 coordinated posts critical of Trudeau that were liked, shared or commented on 30,000 times.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the network has savaged Corbyn. More than 510 coordinated posts have attacked the Labour leader since mid-2016, attracting 15,384 likes, 17,148 comments and 16,406 shares.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/facebookapp/videos/942418432620984/\">Facebook\u2019s own definition of \u201ccoordinated inauthentic activity\u201d</a> reads like a blueprint for the network the Guardian has uncovered.</p> \n<p>\u201cCoordinated inauthentic behaviour is when groups of pages or people work together to mislead others about who they are or what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Facebook\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, explained last year. \u201cWe might take a network down for making it look like it\u2019s being run from one part of the world, when in fact it\u2019s being run from another.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis could be done for ideological purposes or it could be financially motivated. For example, spammers might seek to convince people to click on a link to visit their page or to read their posts.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Villereal said he had not heard from Facebook since the Israel-based administrator began distributing content from his page.</p> \n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had no notifications from Facebook or anything like that about the content they\u2019re posting: like spam risk or fake accounts or community violations or anything like that.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Faked news, real consequences</h2> \n<p>In March this year, a 55-year-old Donald Trump supporter from upstate New York, Patrick Carlineo, placed a call to the office of Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar.</p> \n<p>After getting through to a staff member, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/19/ilhan-omar-pleads-compassion-man-threatened-her-life-letter\">accused Omar of being a terrorist before saying</a>: \u201cWhy are you working for her, she\u2019s a [expletive] terrorist. Somebody ought to put a bullet in her skull. Back in the day, our forefathers would have put a bullet in her [expletive].\u201d</p> \n<p>Carlineo, who pleaded guilty to placing the call last month, had for years been allowed to post violent and racist content to Facebook. In April, the Guardian revealed how he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/16/facebook-allowed-violent-posts-by-man-charged-with-ilhan-omar-death-threat\">frequently used the platform to taunt Muslims, attacking them with racist slurs and saying he wished he could confront a group of Muslim politicians with \u201ca bucket of pig blood\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>The call was not an isolated attack. A Somali American, Omar, 37, is one of the first Muslim women in Congress and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/ilhan-omar-hijab-congress-headwear\">first to wear a hijab in the House chamber</a>.

In April the congresswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/14/ilhan-omar-trump-9-11-september\">said</a> she faced an increase in death threats after Donald Trump accused her of downplaying the September 11 attacks.</p> \n<p>She is also the most frequent target of the network. In the past two years, the Israeli group has pushed out more than 1,400 posts targeting Omar across the 21-page network which in turn have been \u201cshared\u201d more than 30,000 times.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Facebook\u2019s complacency is a threat to our democracy,\u201d Omar told the Guardian. \u201cIt has become clear that they do not take seriously the degree to which they provide a platform for white nationalist hate and dangerous misinformation in this country and around the world. And there is a clear reason for this: they profit off it. I believe their inaction is a grave threat to people\u2019s lives, to our democracy and to democracy around the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>In November, a major study into Islamophobia from Charles Sturt University in Australia found a significant jump in the number of violent attacks against Muslim people, particularly women wearing head coverings.</p> \n<p>Faruqi, a frequent target of abuse on and offline, said the far-right was relying on social media to \u201clegitimise their hate and recruit\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cMuslim women politicians tick both of their misogyny and racism boxes, so I end up as a target of a lot of their racist content,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve experienced a huge increase in racist and abusive social media comments, emails, phone calls and even handwritten letters since I\u2019ve been in the public eye. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that many of the people behind these vile messages are emboldened by others on social media and Facebook pages like this.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>With David Smith in Washington</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The message from Israel arrived on an otherwise unremarkable afternoon for 36-year-old Beau Villereal. At his family\u2019s sprawling 42-acre property outside Live Oak in Florida\u2019s rural north, Villereal sat alone in his bedroom trawling for news about Donald Trump to share on the rightwing Facebook page he runs with his mother and father. The messenger, who gave her name as Rochale, asked Villereal to make her an editor of Pissed off Deplorables, a self-described \u201cpro-America page\u201d that feeds its thousands of followers a steady diet of pro-Trump, anti-Islam content. \u201cI totally understand you,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m from Israel and this is ... really important to me to share the truth. \u201cPlease give me a chance for a day.\u201d About 1,000 miles north in Staten Island, New York City, Ron Devito was tapping away on his laptop to the 20,000 followers of his pro-Trump Facebook page, Making America 1st, when he received a similar message, this time from someone using the name Tehila. \u201cShe pitched to me that she was a good editor, she could provide some good content to increase likes and views on the page,\u201d Devito told the Guardian. \u201cCould I just give her a chance and let her post her stuff, right? So I figured, \u2018What the heck, give it a shot\u2019.\u201d Villereal and Devito weren\u2019t the only ones. Over the past two years, a group of mysterious Israel-based accounts has delivered similar messages to the heads of at least 19 other far-right Facebook pages across the US, Australia, the UK, Canada, Austria, Israel and Nigeria. A Guardian investigation can reveal those messages were part of a covert plot to control some of Facebook\u2019s largest far-right pages, including one linked to a rightwing terror group, and create a commercial enterprise that harvests Islamophobic hate for profit. This group is now using its 21-page network to churn out more than 1,000 coordinated faked news posts per week to more than 1 million followers, funnelling audiences to a cluster of 10 ad-heavy websites and milking the traffic for profit. The posts stoke deep hatred of Islam across the western world and influence politics in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US by amplifying far-right parties such as Australia\u2019s One Nation and vilifying Muslim politicians such as the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the US congresswoman Ilhan Omar. The network has also targeted leftwing politicians at critical points in national election campaigns. It posted false stories claiming the UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Jews were \u201cthe source of global terrorism\u201d and accused the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, of allowing \u201cIsis to invade Canada\u201d. The revelations show Facebook has failed to stop clandestine actors from using its platform to run coordinated disinformation and hate campaigns. The network has operated with relative impunity even since Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s apology to the US Senate following the Cambridge Analytica and Russian interference scandals. When the Guardian notified Facebook of its investigation, the company removed several pages and accounts \u201cthat appeared to be financially motivated\u201d, a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThese pages and accounts violated our policy against spam and fake accounts by posting clickbait content to drive people to off-platform sites,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow people to misrepresent themselves on Facebook and we\u2019ve updated our inauthentic behaviour policy to further improve our ability to counter new tactics.\u201d But this comes too late for some of the network\u2019s victims. Australia\u2019s first female Muslim senator, Mehreen Faruqi, felt the full force of the network in August last year, when 10 of its pages launched coordinated posts inciting their 546,000 followers to attack her for speaking in parliament against racism. The posts prompted what Faruqi described as a \u201chorrific feeding frenzy of racism, fake news and hate\u201d, soliciting vile comments like \u201cput your burka on \u2013 and shut the fuck up!\u201d, \u201cdeport the whining bitch\u201d and \u201cRevoke citizenship and Deport\u201d. Faruqi said the network represented a \u201cnew level of far-right organisation and coordination\u201d, and she places the blame squarely on social media companies. \u201cBy allowing racist and misleading posts, social media giants like Facebook \u2026 are profiteering from the proliferation of hate speech and abuse,\u201d Faruqi said. \u201cFacebook could do much more and shut these pages down but so long as they continue to profit from the reach and engagement, they don\u2019t seem to be interested in decisive action.\u201d A spokesperson for Facebook told the Guardian: \u201cNobody can advocate or advertise hate or violence on Facebook and we remove any violations as soon as we become aware.\u201d \u2018The perfect foot soldiers\u2019 It begins with a single post, curated by Israel-based administrators. The post typically has an attention-grabbing headline and links to an article that mimics the style of a legitimate news story. It employs a blend of distorted news and total fabrication to paint Muslims as sharia-imposing terrorists and child abusers, whose existence poses a threat to white culture and western civilisation. It is then published almost simultaneously to the network\u2019s 21 Facebook pages, which have a combined 1 million followers across the globe. The content is so predictable that even Devito once complained to his Israeli counterpart. \u201cI told her flat out, \u2018you\u2019re a one-trick pony\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Islam, Islam, Islam, Islam and more Islam. Like, enough with the Islam already, we get it.\u201d The Guardian conducted an analysis to confirm the extent of coordination across the network, checking where posts were identical in content and similar in publication time across different pages. The network published 5,695 coordinated posts at its height in October 2019, receiving 846,424 likes, shares or comments in that month alone. In total, the network has published at least 165,000 posts and attracted 14.3 million likes, shares or comments. The content is amplified further by other far-right Facebook pages, including those run by the rightwing UK Independence party (Ukip), who share it organically. The posts link back to one of 10 near-identical websites masquerading as news sites with generic titles like \u201cThe Politics Online\u201d and \u201cFree Press Front\u201d. Ad-heavy and poorly designed, the websites feature \u201cstories\u201d that usually combine slabs of copied text intermingled with unsourced opinion and graphic imagery. The Guardian worked with researchers from Queensland University of Technology\u2019s digital media research centre, who conducted an analysis of the order in which identical posts appeared across the 21 Facebook pages. Their analysis indicates a single entity is coordinating the publication of content across the Facebook pages, likely using automatic scheduling software, and that a single entity controls the websites that receive traffic from the posts. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious looking at the websites, the way that they\u2019re structured, the way that they\u2019re sharing design and code, and the way they share Google site IDs, that they\u2019re all interconnected with each other,\u201d said QUT professor Axel Bruns, one of Australia\u2019s leading internet researchers. \u201cThey\u2019re just cheap sites to set up, cheap sites to run \u2026 It\u2019s not very sophisticated and it\u2019s just brute force, to push all this stuff out.\u201d Bruns and his colleagues believe the motivation is commercial, and that hatred, division and political influence may be byproducts of the pursuit of profit. \u201cHere\u2019s a bunch of people who \u2013 they\u2019re not stupid but they\u2019re highly prone to clicking on content that reflects their already held beliefs, especially content that is highly emotive and contains polarising and extreme material,\u201d said Timothy Graham, a senior lecturer on social network analysis at QUT. \u201cThese people are great for business. If you get them to come to your website, they\u2019re not going to [look closely at] the content, they\u2019re going to click through and keep [sharing] it. They\u2019re the perfect foot soldiers.\u201d \u2018You\u2019re the one profiting\u2019 The network wasn\u2019t always so extensive. The delivery of coordinated content began in 2016 through just a few pages in Israel and the US. From 2018 onwards, the network began approaching the administrators of large, pre-existing Facebook pages across Australia, Austria, Canada, the US and the UK, promising content that would help grow their audiences. In March 2018, the network gained access to a Canadian pro-Israel page dubbed Never Again Canada, which has 232,000 followers. A previous BuzzFeed News investigation into Never Again Canada showed it was regularly sharing content about the Jewish Defence League, an FBI-designated rightwing terror group, and coordinating content with other pages. The network reached its peak in October this year with coordination across 21 pages. Each time a local page-owner agrees to let one of the Israeli administrators in, they become unwitting though not necessarily unwilling participants in the globally coordinated distribution of online hate. Some page-owners, like Villereal, who runs Pissed off Deplorables, had no idea their new Israeli counterparts were making money from the following they had built. \u201cIt\u2019s a little disheartening to sit here and think I\u2019ve been doing this for two years and I haven\u2019t made a dime, and I allowed someone to come in who\u2019s built the little back channel but they\u2019re going to use my clientele to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s like I own the store, I built it and everything like that, and you\u2019re the one profiting.\u201d Those behind the network went to great lengths to hide their identities, concealing personal information from websites and using different Facebook profiles when contacting the owners of existing far-right pages. But by following a trail of digital breadcrumbs, the Guardian\u2019s investigation traced the network back to a key player: a man going by the username Ariel1238a. Finding Ariel In December 2017, Ariel1238a made a seemingly benign request for help on an obscure search engine optimisation forum. \u201cI\u2019m looking for more ways to monetize my site,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy niche is about politics.\u201d For the past two years, the same username has popped up regularly on similar web forums. Writing in broken English, Ariel1238a frets about drops in his click-through rate, the inability to host \u201cviolent content\u201d alongside advertising sourced through Google AdSense, and the low revenue return per-click on native advertising site Taboola. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with the profits they bring,\u201d he told one forum. He also complains about Facebook\u2019s efforts to crack down on \u201cfake news\u201d. When the social media giant announced in April that it would step up its efforts to combat misinformation on the site, Ariel wrote: \u201cFacebook has released another step on the way to its end, matter of time.\u201d Ariel1238a is not a web expert. He asks rudimentary questions including how to set up a business email domain and increase traffic to his sites. Yet his websites, he tells the forums, serve \u201cleading countries\u201d including the UK, US, Australia and Canada and have, he boasts, \u201csomthing like 1m pageviews per month\u201d. The posts give no suggestion that Ariel1238a will become a driving force behind a wave of anti-Islamic hate across Facebook. In fact, online profiles linked to Ariel1238a betray no political or ideological position at all. Instead, his digital footprint suggests that before he turned to exploiting the far-right\u2019s obsession with Islam for profit, he had for years engaged in a number of unsophisticated online money-making schemes. A now dormant account on a blog-publishing service links him to a \u201cfree sex dating\u201d site, a \u201creligious dating\u201d site and a fan page for the fourth season of the Israeli Big Brother television series. He has dabbled in online directories for gyms in Tel Aviv, Botox injections, an online sim card store and a site described simply as \u201cOnline sex | Camera sex\u201d. Using web archiving services and domain registry information, the Guardian has been able to confirm the username Ariel1238a belongs to Ariel Elkaras, a 30-something jewellery salesman and online operator living on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Soon after the Guardian contacted Elkaras for comment, several of the network\u2019s websites were either taken down or had large amounts of content removed. The public posts on his Facebook profile were also removed. Elkaras did not respond to multiple requests for comment via email and phone, but the Guardian was able to track him down. When we turned up at his apartment in a town near Tel Aviv in Israel, an older woman answered the door. She called out to Elkaras, who arrived wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants. Through a translator, Elkaras denied knowledge of or involvement in the network but said he had once been \u201cincluded in a group, something about Israel\u201d. He refused to answer questions about his job, other than to confirm he dealt with computers. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s not your business,\u201d he said. \u201c[The network] is nothing related to me.\u201d When the Guardian asked about the username Ariel1238a, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He closed the door, but shortly after followed a reporter out on to the street and demanded to know how the Guardian had found him. Elkaras was the only real person the Guardian was able to connect to the operation. We were unable to verify whether Rochale, Tehila, or the other names used by the Facebook profiles that contacted page administrators, were the names of real people. Messages obtained by the Guardian show Rochale telling a local page administrator she doesn\u2019t know how to make money online and that she doesn\u2019t know who runs the websites she sources her content from. \u201cI only share posts on your page because this topic is important to me,\u201d she wrote. While initially describing Tehila as \u201ca Pam Geller type\u201d, Devito later admitted he had never actually seen or spoken to her. Asked how he knew she was real, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t, to be brutally honest.\u201d Of the page administrators who returned requests for comment from the Guardian, only one claimed to have physically seen Tehila via Skype but declined to provide evidence. Asked how he knew he was speaking to a woman, the administrator, who declined to reveal his identity, said: \u201cIt sure looked like one.\u201d None of the page administrators the Guardian spoke to for this story were aware that the Israeli group was making money from the scheme, or that their pages were part of a larger network. \u201cThey weren\u2019t upfront about it because as much as I saw in the message ... there was no talk about making money,\u201d a pro-Trump page administrator based in Nigeria told the Guardian. Political influence and Facebook\u2019s failures In April last year, Zuckerberg sat before an army of cameras and offered a mea culpa to the world. Facebook, still reeling from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, had failed its users, Zuckerberg said. The company had struggled to stop its platform being used for coordinated political interference and the spread of disinformation and hate. \u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. And it was my mistake.\u201d Two months later, the Israeli-based network gained access to its 13th far-right Facebook page, expanding the already sizeable audience for its disinformation. The network has operated with relative impunity for almost two years. \u201cBelieve it or not she hasn\u2019t done anything to get the page in trouble,\u201d Devito said of his Israeli administrator. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten anything from Facebook that \u2018you\u2019ve been posting inappropriate content that\u2019s violated our community standards\u2019 or anything of the sort. I\u2019ve been very fortunate in that regard.\u201d As the network grew, so did its ability to influence the thinking of voters. By the time the Australian election came around in May, the pages were providing a significant platform for far-right candidates, including One Nation and Fraser Anning, a senator widely condemned for calling for a \u201cfinal solution\u201d to immigration. The network boosted Anning and One Nation with 401 posts in the lead-up to the election, which attracted 82,025 likes, 18,748 comments and 33,730 shares. A One Nation spokesman, James Ashby, said the network would not benefit the party, and engagement on leader Pauline Hanson\u2019s personal page was far greater. \u201cI would suggest the 401 posts you refer to has attracted a nanoscopic number of likes, comments and shares in comparison,\u201d he said. A spokesman for Anning said he was previously unaware of the network and did not believe it had helped his campaign. It was a similar story in Canada. In the lead-up to the October election, the network pushed out 80 coordinated posts critical of Trudeau that were liked, shared or commented on 30,000 times. In the UK, the network has savaged Corbyn. More than 510 coordinated posts have attacked the Labour leader since mid-2016, attracting 15,384 likes, 17,148 comments and 16,406 shares. Facebook\u2019s own definition of \u201ccoordinated inauthentic activity\u201d reads like a blueprint for the network the Guardian has uncovered. \u201cCoordinated inauthentic behaviour is when groups of pages or people work together to mislead others about who they are or what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Facebook\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, explained last year. \u201cWe might take a network down for making it look like it\u2019s being run from one part of the world, when in fact it\u2019s being run from another. \u201cThis could be done for ideological purposes or it could be financially motivated. For example, spammers might seek to convince people to click on a link to visit their page or to read their posts.\u201d But Villereal said he had not heard from Facebook since the Israel-based administrator began distributing content from his page. \u201cI haven\u2019t had no notifications from Facebook or anything like that about the content they\u2019re posting: like spam risk or fake accounts or community violations or anything like that.\u201d Faked news, real consequences In March this year, a 55-year-old Donald Trump supporter from upstate New York, Patrick Carlineo, placed a call to the office of Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar. After getting through to a staff member, he accused Omar of being a terrorist before saying: \u201cWhy are you working for her, she\u2019s a [expletive] terrorist. Somebody ought to put a bullet in her skull. Back in the day, our forefathers would have put a bullet in her [expletive].\u201d Carlineo, who pleaded guilty to placing the call last month, had for years been allowed to post violent and racist content to Facebook. In April, the Guardian revealed how he had frequently used the platform to taunt Muslims, attacking them with racist slurs and saying he wished he could confront a group of Muslim politicians with \u201ca bucket of pig blood\u201d. The call was not an isolated attack. A Somali American, Omar, 37, is one of the first Muslim women in Congress and the first to wear a hijab in the House chamber. Since her election, she has been a lightning rod for attacks from the right. Political opponents have pushed conspiracy theories and shared violent content about her on social media. In April the congresswoman said she faced an increase in death threats after Donald Trump accused her of downplaying the September 11 attacks. She is also the most frequent target of the network. In the past two years, the Israeli group has pushed out more than 1,400 posts targeting Omar across the 21-page network which in turn have been \u201cshared\u201d more than 30,000 times. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Facebook\u2019s complacency is a threat to our democracy,\u201d Omar told the Guardian. \u201cIt has become clear that they do not take seriously the degree to which they provide a platform for white nationalist hate and dangerous misinformation in this country and around the world. And there is a clear reason for this: they profit off it. I believe their inaction is a grave threat to people\u2019s lives, to our democracy and to democracy around the world.\u201d In November, a major study into Islamophobia from Charles Sturt University in Australia found a significant jump in the number of violent attacks against Muslim people, particularly women wearing head coverings. Faruqi, a frequent target of abuse on and offline, said the far-right was relying on social media to \u201clegitimise their hate and recruit\u201d. \u201cMuslim women politicians tick both of their misogyny and racism boxes, so I end up as a target of a lot of their racist content,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced a huge increase in racist and abusive social media comments, emails, phone calls and even handwritten letters since I\u2019ve been in the public eye. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that many of the people behind these vile messages are emboldened by others on social media and Facebook pages like this.\u201d \u2022 With David Smith in Washington",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Labor party\u2019s national president, Wayne Swan, will issue a call to arms for progressive parties to fight back against misinformation proliferating on digital platforms, declaring nothing can be off the table \u201cincluding breaking up the social media platforms where the concentration of their market power is damaging society\u201d. Swan will use a conference hosted by the Chifley Research Centre to foreshadow that over the next 12 months, the ALP will bring together a \u201ccoalition of centre-left and progressive parties from across the globe to drive this debate forward and take action to check the domination of firms such as Facebook\u201d. According to a copy of his speech seen by Guardian Australia, Swan will argue progressive and centre-left parties have been flatfooted in responding to the \u201cdisruption and chaos\u201d that social media giants have enabled, \u201cand we haven\u2019t done enough to share our experiences and coordinate our responses across borders\u201d. \u201c2020 must be the year when we change this,\u201d the party president will say. Swan\u2019s comments come as the Guardian reveals that an Israel-based group has covertly gained control of 21 popular far-right Facebook pages, using them in a coordinated way to deliver distorted and false information to more than 1m followers across the world. The network has operated with relative impunity for more than two years, publishing more than one thousand posts a week, and disseminating large volumes of material in the lead-up to the May election that vilified Muslim politicians Anne Aly and Mehreen Faruqi, and promoted One Nation and Fraser Anning. The intervention from Labor\u2019s president also follows the establishment of a new select committee of the Australian parliament to examine foreign interference through social media. The committee will inquire into and report on the risks posed to Australia\u2019s democracy by foreign interference through social media platforms \u2013 including Facebook, Twitter and WeChat \u2013 and report in the new year. Swan in his speech to the Chifley conference will argue the conservative side of politics internationally is \u201csmashing progressive political parties in organised social media, particularly under the radar communications disguised as political news or non-politically motivated views\u201d. He will say the rise of the digital platforms has created an environment where news consumers self-select information, which has \u201ccontributed to the rise of echo chambers and filter bubbles\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no shared media experience any more, and misinformation can spread online quickly, easily and virtually unchallenged,\u201d Swan will say. \u201cSecondly, hostile and bad-faith actors can weaponise controversial and misleading information at will to sow division and create chaos in our politics.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He says Labor\u2019s experience in the May election of the death tax fake news that circulated on Facebook during the campaign \u201cwarped\u201d the policy debate. Conservatives on social media \u201ceffectively circulated false claims about a Labor death tax\u201d, he says. \u201cMore and more people across the world are waking up to the threat posed to democracy by the social media giants, and a global problem requires a global response.\u201d Swan says three principles should inform efforts to rebalance the public square. \u201cFirst \u2013 the social media giants should be recognised for what they are, which is publishers. \u201cSecond \u2013 as publishers, the social media giants need to take responsibility for ensuring that the content on their platforms isn\u2019t riddled with misinformation or hate. Third \u2013 a step change is required in the level of transparency and accountability that the social media giants are held to around how they collect, store, use and share our data; including who they are partnering with, and how their algorithms are shaping user behaviour.\u201d He says breaking up the platforms must be an option to consider. \u201cWithout these essential reforms it becomes harder and harder to win the battle of ideas and be an effective machine for changing hearts and minds as well as a machine for winning elections. \u201cWe need a continuous campaign to reinforce the importance of using the power of collective action through communities, workplaces, unions and governments, to improve the standard of living and build a better society.\u201d Labor has already urged the joint standing committee on electoral matters to investigate whether the digital behemoths are having a negative impact on Australian democracy after Facebook demoted but refused to take down fake news about the \u201cdeath tax\u201d circulating during the May election. Guardian Australia revealed as part of an investigation into the death tax misinformation that the Labor campaign pressed Facebook repeatedly to deal with the false claims shared on the platform during the federal election, and escalated their complaints in the final week. But the social media giant declined to play censor. Simon Milner, the Singapore-based vice-president of the social media giant in the Asia-Pacific, told Labor after the election in correspondence seen by Guardian Australia: \u201cWe do not agree that it is our role to remove content that one side of a political debate considers to be false.\u201d In an interview with Guardian Australia in August, the ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, blasted Facebook\u2019s practices, and said the social media giant should have removed the bogus death tax claims given its own independent fact-checking processes had found the material to be false. Sims said Facebook had the capability to deal with the proliferation of fake news on the platform, but the social media behemoth is instead \u201cpalming off responsibility\u201d to protect its bottom line. The industry body representing Google, Facebook and Twitter has already rejected the ACCC\u2019s proposal for an industry code of conduct to fight fake news, warning that the recommendation would turn Australia\u2019s media regulator into the truth police.",

This is not one of them. Put the sourdough back. Step away from the worthy loaves. The crisp sandwich is meant to be an uninhibited pig-out, which will be ruined by using earnest wholemeal or ostensibly healthy seeded breads.

These fragile breads fall apart at the first flash of a butter knife. Ideally, you want to forcibly squash the top layer of your sandwich down as you make it, to mould it around the crisps, so it neatly retains them as you eat. For that, you need relatively dense squishy bread, such as Jackson\u2019s white bloomer or \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/buying-12-things-means-youre-5391826\" title=\"\">if you can stomach the company\u2019s \u00a325,000 donation to the Conservative party in 2010 </a>\u2013 perhaps the world\u2019s best crisp-sandwich bread, Warburtons toastie loaf.</p> <p>If using a less politically compromised cob, bap or roll, avoid those with firm crusts that require you to tear at them. You will scatter crisp shrapnel everywhere. In that regard, a baguette is the least-practical crisp sandwich bread. Do not think about toasting your bread. This is already a dry sandwich.</p> <h2><strong>Spread</strong></h2> <p>Like many of the best things in life, a crisp sandwich needs lubrication. Ultimately, you will slather your slice with what you can afford. Margarine does a job, particularly on a crisp sandwich. It oils the wheels of mastication without positively boosting flavour. But if you do have a pound or three spare, HTE is unbending in its view that butter is one of the best investments in the supermarket chiller cabinet.

But you also want those flavours delivered at the heightened, entirely artificial, level of intensity that only the cleverest boffins of the food-industrial complex can achieve using ingenious combinations of yeast extract, citric acid, garlic powder, dried cheese \u201ccheese flavour\u201d and umami disodium 5\u2019-ribonucleotide.</p> <p>The crisp-sandwich-filling sweet spot, then, is to be found in a mainline bag of Walkers (other brands are available) or, another marginal but important gain, in slightly thicker ridge-cut crisps such as Seabrook ascending to the \u2013 <em>fans self</em>! \u2013 positively hunky McCoy\u2019s. Firm and muscular, yet given to melting greasily in the mouth, the all-powerful salt and vinegar McCoy\u2019s is, perhaps, the ultimate crisp sandwich filling.</p> <p>Note: never use ready-salted crisps. Too parsimonious. There isn\u2019t a war on.

      "body": "<p>Tony Brooker, who has died aged 94, was a pioneer of computer programming and education. He designed and implemented the world\u2019s first high-level programming language, at Manchester University, and was later founding professor of computer science at Essex University.</p> <p>In 1947, when Brooker took up his first academic post, as assistant lecturer in engineering mathematics at Imperial College, University of London, computers were in the air. He joined Professor KD Tocher and another student, Sidney Michaelson, in building the Icce (Imperial College Computing Engine, pronounced \u201cicky\u201d). In 1949 Brooker became a research assistant at the Cambridge University mathematical laboratory and took charge of its differential analyser, a prewar analogue computer.</p> <p>This machine was made obsolete following the completion in May 1949 of the laboratory\u2019s Edsac, the world\u2019s first practical electronic digital computer. Brooker switched his interest to computer programming, under the tutelage of David Wheeler, then a research student and later a professor in the laboratory. The two collaborated to produce a scheme to simplify mathematical programming.</p> <p>Brooker was a keen rock climber; after a weekend climbing in north Wales, he called in at the computing machine laboratory of Manchester University to check out its developments. He introduced himself to the staff, among them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alan-turing\" title=\"\">Alan Turing</a>. This resulted in the offer of a lectureship in 1951, which he accepted, not least for the proximity to Snowdonia.</p> <p>Although nominally deputy director of the laboratory, Turing was so absorbed by his own research that he failed to help other people use the Manchester computer. The machine was formidably difficult to program, typically taking two weeks for a novice to get to grips with. Brooker designed a simplified programming system, the Manchester Autocode, which was introduced early in 1954.

      "bodyText": "Tony Brooker, who has died aged 94, was a pioneer of computer programming and education. He designed and implemented the world\u2019s first high-level programming language, at Manchester University, and was later founding professor of computer science at Essex University. In 1947, when Brooker took up his first academic post, as assistant lecturer in engineering mathematics at Imperial College, University of London, computers were in the air. He joined Professor KD Tocher and another student, Sidney Michaelson, in building the Icce (Imperial College Computing Engine, pronounced \u201cicky\u201d). In 1949 Brooker became a research assistant at the Cambridge University mathematical laboratory and took charge of its differential analyser, a prewar analogue computer. This machine was made obsolete following the completion in May 1949 of the laboratory\u2019s Edsac, the world\u2019s first practical electronic digital computer. Brooker switched his interest to computer programming, under the tutelage of David Wheeler, then a research student and later a professor in the laboratory. The two collaborated to produce a scheme to simplify mathematical programming. Brooker was a keen rock climber; after a weekend climbing in north Wales, he called in at the computing machine laboratory of Manchester University to check out its developments. He introduced himself to the staff, among them Alan Turing. This resulted in the offer of a lectureship in 1951, which he accepted, not least for the proximity to Snowdonia. Although nominally deputy director of the laboratory, Turing was so absorbed by his own research that he failed to help other people use the Manchester computer. The machine was formidably difficult to program, typically taking two weeks for a novice to get to grips with. Brooker designed a simplified programming system, the Manchester Autocode, which was introduced early in 1954. The system was fully described on two sides of foolscap, took just half a day to learn, and allowed many more casual users to get results from the machine. He later developed the Mercury Autocode for the university\u2019s next computer. Manchester University\u2019s most ambitious computer project, begun in 1959, was the Atlas (when it was installed in 1963 it was briefly the world\u2019s fastest). By this time high-level programming languages had begun to proliferate and the new computer would need to offer half a dozen different ones.

But unions say introducing a \u201cuniversal\u201d system for all will mean millions of workers in both the public and private sectors must work beyond the legal retirement age of 62 or face a severe drop in the value of their pensions.</p> <p>The row cuts to the heart of Macron\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/15/macron-finds-elitist-tag-hard-to-shake-but-he-has-the-upper-hand\">presidential project</a> and his pledge to deliver the biggest transformation of the French social model and welfare system since the postwar era. Since his election in 2017, Macron has leaned towards a Nordic style of \u201cflexi-security\u201d in which the labour market is loosened and the focus is on changing from a rigid work code to a society of individuals moving between jobs.</p> <p>Pension reform is the latest step for Macron after he overhauled labour rules and changed the unemployment system, but it has always been an extremely sensitive topic in France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbf00927c5a2c045c2114a5135eb934edf3caa68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbf00927c5a2c045c2114a5135eb934edf3caa68/0_0_5471_3647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wave the flags of French trade union General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and carry a mocked coffin as they take part in a demonstration to protest against the pension overhauls, in Marseille\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wave the flags of French trade union General Confederation of Labour in Marseille.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clement Mahoudeau/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Macron\u2019s approval ratings, at about 30%, have improved since the height of last year\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests\">gilets jaunes</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests\"> anti-government protests</a>. But while many French voters agree that the pensions system should be changed, they are not sure the pro-business president can be trusted to do it. A recent Ifop poll found 76% of French people back pensions reform, but 64% do not trust the government to pull it off.</p> <p>Unusually, the protest strike is going ahead before the full details of any pensions changes are known. A consultation process is still under way and parliament will not debate proposals until 2020.</p> <p>Tensions are running high after months of anti-government protests by the gilets jaunes, amid a general feeling in France that life is hard and public services are declining.

      "bodyText": "Emmanuel Macron is facing the biggest strikes of his presidency, as French rail workers, air-traffic controllers, teachers and public sector staff staged walkouts and took to the streets against proposed changes to the pension system. Rail services almost ground to a halt, with 82% of drivers on strike and at least 90% of regional trains cancelled, amid fears that the open-ended transport disruption could continue for days. In Paris, 11 out of the 16 metro lines were shut, forcing commuters to scramble to hire bikes and scooters. Many schools were closed and even some police unions warned of \u201csymbolic\u201d closures of certain police stations. Shops along the route of a march in Paris were advised to close in case of violence on the edges of the demonstration. About half of the scheduled Eurostar trains between Paris and London have been cancelled. Tourists were turned away at the Eiffel Tower because of the strike. The standoff is a crucial test for the centrist French president, whose planned overhaul of the pensions system was a key election promise. The government argues that unifying the pensions system \u2013 and getting rid of the 42 \u201cspecial\u201d regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris Opera staff \u2013 is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the French population ages. But unions say introducing a \u201cuniversal\u201d system for all will mean millions of workers in both the public and private sectors must work beyond the legal retirement age of 62 or face a severe drop in the value of their pensions. The row cuts to the heart of Macron\u2019s presidential project and his pledge to deliver the biggest transformation of the French social model and welfare system since the postwar era. Since his election in 2017, Macron has leaned towards a Nordic style of \u201cflexi-security\u201d in which the labour market is loosened and the focus is on changing from a rigid work code to a society of individuals moving between jobs. Pension reform is the latest step for Macron after he overhauled labour rules and changed the unemployment system, but it has always been an extremely sensitive topic in France. Macron\u2019s approval ratings, at about 30%, have improved since the height of last year\u2019s gilets jaunes anti-government protests. But while many French voters agree that the pensions system should be changed, they are not sure the pro-business president can be trusted to do it. A recent Ifop poll found 76% of French people back pensions reform, but 64% do not trust the government to pull it off. Unusually, the protest strike is going ahead before the full details of any pensions changes are known. A consultation process is still under way and parliament will not debate proposals until 2020. Tensions are running high after months of anti-government protests by the gilets jaunes, amid a general feeling in France that life is hard and public services are declining. A poll last month by Viavoice for Lib\u00e9ration found 89% of French people felt the country was experiencing a \u201csocial crisis\u201d. Beyond trade unions, there is an angry grassroots base of rail workers and other state workers keen to put pressure on the government. It is not certain how long the transport strike will continue. At Place de la R\u00e9publique in central Paris, Didier Dupir from Lyon was among firefighters from the Sud trade union staging an unusual protest by sleeping outside in tents despite freezing temperatures. He was protesting over staffing levels, remuneration and pensions. \u201cI\u2019ve been a firefighter for 20 years and I\u2019ve never slept out on a demonstration like this before,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about getting proper recognition from the government for what firefighters do. People are very sensitive to the state of public services.\u201d Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant for Viavoice pollsters, said the public mood was of distrust rather than defiance, with people wanting pension reform but not confident in the government to carry it out. \u201cWhat\u2019s certain is we\u2019re in a climate of real social tension today, which goes beyond pensions. Our study in Lib\u00e9ration found almost unanimity \u2013 89% \u2013 of French people thinking we\u2019re living through a social crisis, but also 64% said they felt Macron didn\u2019t understand those social difficulties \u2026 That mood of social crisis will hang over this strike action.\u201d Chau said that since the gilets jaunes protests, Macron\u2019s top-down approach to changing the French system had altered, with the government now appearing to engage in more public consultation.

Discharged from the force after being raped on a stakeout, tough-nut cop Kaja (Marta Nieradkiewicz) is lured back to the coast by the Central Bureau of Investigation to help bring down drug baron Kawecki (Andrzej Seweryn). The silver-fox plutocrat has mastered the art of hiding in plain sight: the well-to-do head of the Solid Gold bank, he launders his money through a posh restaurant and butters up Warsaw politicians for favours.</p> <p>Director Jacek Bromski manages the curious combination of being both too impatient to push his case and too slow to make us care. The initial sexual assault, a series of attention-drawing murders, Kawecki\u2019s dealers later bringing their takings directly to the bank \u2013 either Gydnia\u2019s criminal class are completely foolhardy, or the plausibility police need to have a closer look at Bromski\u2019s script. At the same time, he seems only half-interested in Kaja, who starts out loaded with Lisbeth Salander attitude, kickboxing a wine-bar creep to the ground, until the story meanders away from her.</p> <p>Bromski\u2019s preoccupations belatedly turn out to be more wintry. Only generating intermittent heat from the investigation itself, his focus shifts to whether \u2013 given the political interests on whose toes it treads \u2013 the investigation will take place at all. Here, Kaja\u2019s seasoned boss Nowicki (played with crinkled, phlegmatic reserve by Kieslowski regular Janusz Gajos) takes the reins. He indicts Kawecki\u2019s \u201cdictatorial\u201d lust for power, but admits to Kaja that, in his eagerness to nail the businessman, he has become a dictator himself. There is tragedian\u2019s meat here \u2013 but Bromski never fully carves it up.</p> <p>\u2022 Solid Gold is released in the UK on 6 December.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPl3vcijRA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vHPl3vcijRA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Corruption runs yet again all the way to the top \u2013 but this even-paced, overlong Polish thriller barely musters a shrug about it, let alone sell Baltic port Gydnia as a kind of James Ellroy-esque helltown. Discharged from the force after being raped on a stakeout, tough-nut cop Kaja (Marta Nieradkiewicz) is lured back to the coast by the Central Bureau of Investigation to help bring down drug baron Kawecki (Andrzej Seweryn). The silver-fox plutocrat has mastered the art of hiding in plain sight: the well-to-do head of the Solid Gold bank, he launders his money through a posh restaurant and butters up Warsaw politicians for favours. Director Jacek Bromski manages the curious combination of being both too impatient to push his case and too slow to make us care. The initial sexual assault, a series of attention-drawing murders, Kawecki\u2019s dealers later bringing their takings directly to the bank \u2013 either Gydnia\u2019s criminal class are completely foolhardy, or the plausibility police need to have a closer look at Bromski\u2019s script. At the same time, he seems only half-interested in Kaja, who starts out loaded with Lisbeth Salander attitude, kickboxing a wine-bar creep to the ground, until the story meanders away from her. Bromski\u2019s preoccupations belatedly turn out to be more wintry. Only generating intermittent heat from the investigation itself, his focus shifts to whether \u2013 given the political interests on whose toes it treads \u2013 the investigation will take place at all. Here, Kaja\u2019s seasoned boss Nowicki (played with crinkled, phlegmatic reserve by Kieslowski regular Janusz Gajos) takes the reins. He indicts Kawecki\u2019s \u201cdictatorial\u201d lust for power, but admits to Kaja that, in his eagerness to nail the businessman, he has become a dictator himself. There is tragedian\u2019s meat here \u2013 but Bromski never fully carves it up. \u2022 Solid Gold is released in the UK on 6 December.",

Although there were some changes in behaviour during the study \u2013 one person complained they had had to restrict their viewing of online porn while the study was taking place \u2013 the researchers believe most people largely forgot their phones were being recorded.

      "body": "<p>Ever wondered what people really get up to on their phones? To understand what news the British public are reading and watching during this election, the Guardian has partnered with research agency Revealing Reality to conduct an in-depth study of the phone usage of six individuals.</p> <p>Each of the volunteers had their entire phone screen usage recorded as a video file for three days at the end of November, which was then analysed for election-related material. In addition to the broad conclusions, this is what we learned about each person, who agreed for their cases to be discussed using a pseudonym. The findings offer a snapshot, rather than a representative sample, of how Britons are consuming news in the 2019 election.</p> <p><strong>Fiona, 22, student, Bolton</strong></p> <p>A Brexit-backing fan of Boris Johnson who feels Jeremy Corbyn is a threat to security, Fiona is one of the most obsessive case studies the analysts had ever seen, regularly reading news articles to the end from sites including the Daily Telegraph, Guardian, and BBC website.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/fiona-zip/giv-3902XTYqjEV4s1be/\" data-alt=\"Fiona\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/fiona-zip/giv-3902XTYqjEV4s1be/\">Fiona</a> </figure>  <p>Fiona sees articles on Brexit-backing Facebook groups and places an emphasis on fact-checking and consuming alternative points of view for her own benefit. But she adopts a different stance for her public social media profiles, seeking out pieces with provocative headlines and sharing them on Facebook to provoke left-wing friends into arguments.</p> <p>The analysts observed her take this approach when she shared a story about Corbyn\u2019s wealth. She explained that a military veteran she knew had told her the Labour leader was a millionaire. This prompted her to google Corbyn\u2019s net worth, navigating between different search results from outlets such as the Sun. She said it took her a while to find the information, but she eventually stopped on the far-right JihadiWatch website, as the numbers on its article matched information she had heard before.</p> <p>She used this information as the basis of a Facebook post attacking Corbyn and his wife for being hypocrites \u2013 which sparked heated arguments between her Facebook friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"449ea5f0a96426a0e8cd46c103a37e54d90fdddc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/449ea5f0a96426a0e8cd46c103a37e54d90fdddc/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiona's phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Election Monitoring Fiona</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Revealing Reality/The Guardian Design Team</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Shazi, 37, health worker, Sheffield</strong><br>A remain-backing Corbyn fan, Shazi only became interested in politics in recent years and did not grow up consuming traditional news outlets.

She strongly believes that the mainstream media is negative and untrustworthy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/shazi-zip/giv-39023bdoFaCy1aQA/\" data-alt=\"shazi\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/shazi-zip/giv-39023bdoFaCy1aQA/\">shazi</a> </figure>  <p>Because she was politicised by social action campaigns around housing, she largely follows fellow Labour activists. As a result her entire news consumption is almost exclusively pro-Labour and anti-Conservative activist material \u2013 with Paul Mason\u2019s Twitter account and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Twitter account among her main sources of news. This is mixed with a smattering of BBC news headlines that she will read but she very rarely clicks the links.</p> <p>The analysts observed her activity on the night of the Question Time leaders\u2019 debate specials in Sheffield. Rather than watch any footage from inside the BBC event where the audience questions party leaders, she experienced the event by watching video after video posted by activists outside the venue of the crowd chanting Corbyn\u2019s name.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6dbebd0b9c8374102fc5282595d99f38b88b6c25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dbebd0b9c8374102fc5282595d99f38b88b6c25/0_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shazi's phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Election Monitoring Shazi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Revealing Reality/The Guardian Design Team</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Audrey, 59, administrator, Norfolk<br></strong>A social conservative from a Labour-supporting family, Audrey only started voting a decade ago and has limited interest in politics or news \u2013 complaining the news is often offputting because it is too extreme.

Audrey replied with an angry emoji without reading the piece, which was being shared in her friendship group.</p> <p>Her only source of mainstream news comes through occasional use of the news aggregator app Upday, which is pre-installed on Samsung phones and pushes headlines from mainstream outlets such as Metro.co.uk or HuffPost to users. The analysts concluded Audrey\u2019s exposure to political news tends to happen more by chance \u2013 either via Upday and via friends on Facebook \u2013 it would not be unusual for her to sometimes see very little about the election, and on one of the days she took part she only came across one election-related piece of content.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe4e6a3731d18c223c2ffa517057bb7f64579a5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe4e6a3731d18c223c2ffa517057bb7f64579a5d/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audrey's phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Election Monitoring Audrey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Revealing Reality/The Guardian Design Team</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Charlie, 37, accounts clerk, Sunderland<br></strong>A former Lib Dem and UKIP voter who backed leave in the referendum, he is tempted to vote for Johnson \u201cbecause he feels Boris will get Brexit done\u201d but is worried the Tories want to \u201cline their pockets\u201d. His main desire is more funding for public services such as the NHS \u2013 although he\u2019s aware Labour are offering more money than the Conservatives, he doesn\u2019t believe Corbyn will be able to keep his promise. However, this view was challenged when he saw a viral video on Facebook of doctors from the NHS talking about the impact that Tory cuts had had on the health service \u2013 prompting him to doubt his assessment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/charlie-zip/giv-39022Rp16447FTRE/\" data-alt=\"charlie\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/charlie-zip/giv-39022Rp16447FTRE/\">charlie</a> </figure>  <p>He rarely watched television news but would sometimes watch Newsnight or Question Time on his phone, listening to the latter on audio-only at work to keep him in touch with the views of the wider public.</p> <p>Although he saw a handful of headlines from the BBC and Sky News, he did not click on any of them. Instead, the analysts found Charlie consumed his limited amount of news mainly through memes and photos shared by friends on Facebook \u2013 sometimes attacking mainstream media bias but also posts mocking Diane Abbott and a post from a Facebook page called \u2018Bloke Diary\u2019 celebrating Johnson saying the word \u201cboobies\u201d at a school.

Although she sometimes read the Evening Standard, she had tried to cut down since George Osborne became editor because \u201ca free newspaper shouldn\u2019t be political\u201d.</p> <p>Although she read up on the ITV leaders\u2019 debate after seeing an Instagram story post from a friend, she was not heavily involved.

      "bodyText": "Ever wondered what people really get up to on their phones? To understand what news the British public are reading and watching during this election, the Guardian has partnered with research agency Revealing Reality to conduct an in-depth study of the phone usage of six individuals. Each of the volunteers had their entire phone screen usage recorded as a video file for three days at the end of November, which was then analysed for election-related material. In addition to the broad conclusions, this is what we learned about each person, who agreed for their cases to be discussed using a pseudonym. The findings offer a snapshot, rather than a representative sample, of how Britons are consuming news in the 2019 election. Fiona, 22, student, Bolton A Brexit-backing fan of Boris Johnson who feels Jeremy Corbyn is a threat to security, Fiona is one of the most obsessive case studies the analysts had ever seen, regularly reading news articles to the end from sites including the Daily Telegraph, Guardian, and BBC website. Fiona sees articles on Brexit-backing Facebook groups and places an emphasis on fact-checking and consuming alternative points of view for her own benefit. But she adopts a different stance for her public social media profiles, seeking out pieces with provocative headlines and sharing them on Facebook to provoke left-wing friends into arguments. The analysts observed her take this approach when she shared a story about Corbyn\u2019s wealth. She explained that a military veteran she knew had told her the Labour leader was a millionaire. This prompted her to google Corbyn\u2019s net worth, navigating between different search results from outlets such as the Sun. She said it took her a while to find the information, but she eventually stopped on the far-right JihadiWatch website, as the numbers on its article matched information she had heard before. She used this information as the basis of a Facebook post attacking Corbyn and his wife for being hypocrites \u2013 which sparked heated arguments between her Facebook friends. Shazi, 37, health worker, Sheffield A remain-backing Corbyn fan, Shazi only became interested in politics in recent years and did not grow up consuming traditional news outlets. She doesn\u2019t own a TV and doesn\u2019t read newspapers, with her news consumption almost entirely existing of reading Twitter. She strongly believes that the mainstream media is negative and untrustworthy. Because she was politicised by social action campaigns around housing, she largely follows fellow Labour activists. As a result her entire news consumption is almost exclusively pro-Labour and anti-Conservative activist material \u2013 with Paul Mason\u2019s Twitter account and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Twitter account among her main sources of news. This is mixed with a smattering of BBC news headlines that she will read but she very rarely clicks the links. The analysts observed her activity on the night of the Question Time leaders\u2019 debate specials in Sheffield. Rather than watch any footage from inside the BBC event where the audience questions party leaders, she experienced the event by watching video after video posted by activists outside the venue of the crowd chanting Corbyn\u2019s name. Audrey, 59, administrator, Norfolk A social conservative from a Labour-supporting family, Audrey only started voting a decade ago and has limited interest in politics or news \u2013 complaining the news is often offputting because it is too extreme. She voted leave in the EU referendum to reduce immigration and \u201cBritish people would have to do the jobs\u201d. She is considering voting Conservative for the first time because \u201cBoris would get Brexit done\u201d. Her views are shaped heavily by friends on Facebook, where two individuals regularly post anti-Labour memes with crude photoshops of Corbyn and text-heavy graphics with titles such as \u201cEnoch Powell Was Right?\u201d. One day a friend shared a like to the site \u201cUKUpdates.co.uk\u201d, which had copied and pasted a news story from the Sun with the headlines \u201cJeremy Corbyn to give all EU Migrants the right to bring their families to the UK\u201d under a picture of the Labour leader. Audrey replied with an angry emoji without reading the piece, which was being shared in her friendship group. Her only source of mainstream news comes through occasional use of the news aggregator app Upday, which is pre-installed on Samsung phones and pushes headlines from mainstream outlets such as Metro.co.uk or HuffPost to users. The analysts concluded Audrey\u2019s exposure to political news tends to happen more by chance \u2013 either via Upday and via friends on Facebook \u2013 it would not be unusual for her to sometimes see very little about the election, and on one of the days she took part she only came across one election-related piece of content. Charlie, 37, accounts clerk, Sunderland A former Lib Dem and UKIP voter who backed leave in the referendum, he is tempted to vote for Johnson \u201cbecause he feels Boris will get Brexit done\u201d but is worried the Tories want to \u201cline their pockets\u201d. His main desire is more funding for public services such as the NHS \u2013 although he\u2019s aware Labour are offering more money than the Conservatives, he doesn\u2019t believe Corbyn will be able to keep his promise. However, this view was challenged when he saw a viral video on Facebook of doctors from the NHS talking about the impact that Tory cuts had had on the health service \u2013 prompting him to doubt his assessment. He rarely watched television news but would sometimes watch Newsnight or Question Time on his phone, listening to the latter on audio-only at work to keep him in touch with the views of the wider public. Although he saw a handful of headlines from the BBC and Sky News, he did not click on any of them. Instead, the analysts found Charlie consumed his limited amount of news mainly through memes and photos shared by friends on Facebook \u2013 sometimes attacking mainstream media bias but also posts mocking Diane Abbott and a post from a Facebook page called \u2018Bloke Diary\u2019 celebrating Johnson saying the word \u201cboobies\u201d at a school. A keen gamer, he is considered to be one of the most politically engaged individuals in his social group and friends often ask him who they should vote for. Lucy, 29, events manager, London A self-described left-wing remain voter who is not actively involved in politics, she is deciding whether to vote for Lib Dem or Labour in this election. Her main sources of political news are word-of-mouth discussions at work and the BBC news app, which she likes to scroll repeatedly while rarely clicking on election-related headlines. However, she also encountered pro-Labour content through social media, such as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Instagram account \u2013 where she enjoyed pictures of the Labour leader baking a cake. Although she sometimes read the Evening Standard, she had tried to cut down since George Osborne became editor because \u201ca free newspaper shouldn\u2019t be political\u201d. Although she read up on the ITV leaders\u2019 debate after seeing an Instagram story post from a friend, she was not heavily involved. The analysts concluded that \u201cthroughout the three days she saw very little content that was not in line with her own views\u201d. Rosie, 24, London, works for an NGO An active Labour party member and remain voter, the majority of content that Rosie sees on Twitter is supportive of the Labour Party campaign. Most of Rosie\u2019s information relating to the election comes to her via Twitter - where she follows a wide range of commentators, news outlets, MPs and political parties, as well as friends, colleagues and other personal contacts. However, she often reads headlines and joins in discussions on social media without clicking articles. As a campaigner she listens to political podcasts and reads the Politico morning newsletter, meaning she consumes an unusually large amount of political content compared to most Britons. While she saw social media posts from a variety of sources, those on the Conservatives\u2019 side were predominantly from party sources, while those on Labour\u2019s side also included personal support, either from journalists or influencers.",

It means her return home is sad, but the poignancy is more to do with the end of a friendship than a farewell to childhood. \u2022 At Hull Truck theatre, until 4 January.",

It is a sign that the Tory right is in the ascendancy, and those deemed \u201cmoderate\u201d (so even-handed and sensible that they will happily strip disabled people of their benefits) have been purged. The document gives them free rein to ride roughshod over Britain\u2019s poorest people. Yet the Tories insist that this is all a conspiracy. We are invited to believe that, granted a parliamentary majority, rightwing politicians defined by their ideological fervour will skip a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to implement their lifelong, defining beliefs.</p> <p>This deceit is nothing new for British Conservatism. Let us recall the 1979 Tory manifesto: surely here was the founding ideological document of Thatcherism, setting out the party\u2019s grand masterplan to refashion British society and overturn the postwar consensus established by the 1945 Labour government. It was no such thing. As one <a href=\"https://www.open.edu/openlearn/people-politics-law/the-conservative-manifesto-then-and-now\" title=\"\">political academic puts it</a>, Thatcher\u2019s \u201cgovernment either cleverly concealed the true extent of its liberalising intentions or \u2013 more likely \u2013 only gained full confidence in the idea of unleashing \u2018market forces\u2019 once safely installed at No 10\u201d. Another suggests its commitments were largely \u201ccompatible with other postwar Conservative manifestos\u201d, and attempted to counter Labour\u2019s attempts \u201cto portray Mrs Thatcher as a dangerous extremist\u201d.</p> <p>And what about now? Let us consider Dominic Raab, whose rightwing views frighten some of his own colleagues. Here is a man who <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dominic-raab-nhs-privatisation-general-election-hospitals-conservatives-manifesto-a9230606.html\" title=\"\">co-authored a pamphlet</a> arguing that the \u201ccurrent monolith\u201d of the NHS should be \u201cbroken up\u201d, while \u201cnew nonprofit and private operators should be allowed into the service, and, indeed should compete on price\u201d. Translated into non-wonk speak, this is privatisation. The foreign secretary has also <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dominic-raab-eu-worker-rights-employee-protection-uk-economy-a8440511.html\" title=\"\">denounced British employment legislation</a> as a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d for the economy, favouring instead hire-and-fire rules. And again, another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">book he co-authored</a> \u2013 Raab is nothing if not prolific \u2013 alongside fellow cabinet ministers Priti Patel and Liz Truss, denounced British workers as \u201cthe worst idlers in the world\u201d and proposed scrapping workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>As Maya Angelou once said: \u201cWhen people show you who they are, believe them.\u201d Brexit, for them, is not principally about reconfiguring Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU, but rather scrapping what they call red tape and we call workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections. The same applies to Boris Johnson, who once lambasted the NHS as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theredroar.com/2019/12/exclusive-clip-boris-johnson-called-for-break-up-of-monolithic-monopolistic-nhs/\" title=\"\">top-down monopolistic healthcare</a>\u201d and advocated <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-called-nhs-patients-21018692\" title=\"\">introducing charges for NHS services</a>. We should heed the words of ex-Conservative prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/05/john-major-nhs-risk-brexit-pythons-johnson-and-gove\" title=\"\">John Major, who declared</a> that \u201cthe NHS is about as safe\u201d with Johnson and his colleagues as a \u201cpet hamster would be with a hungry python\u201d. Michael Gove, he suggested, desired to privatise the NHS: and indeed the cabinet minister is the co-author of a book that described the NHS as \u201cno longer relevant in the 21st century\u201d, instead arguing that Britain\u2019s most important institution should be replaced by private healthcare companies.</p> <p>The Tory party should not be accused of a scarcity of ideas, but rather of being dishonest about its intentions. Johnson and his allies know their heartfelt beliefs are not popular with the general public; they are also aware that Labour\u2019s domestic policies on public ownership and raising taxes for the rich enjoy widespread support. It is for this purpose that they deploy Brexit as a distraction and so run down the clock with stunts such as picking fights with Channel 4 News. They will do anything to deflect from Labour\u2019s programme and the failure to state their own in detail.</p> <p>There are fundamental differences with 1980s Thatcherism, of course. Back then, the Tories intended to embed a new political consensus by granting a short-term boost to the living standards of a layer of the population, principally through right-to-buy and share ownership. But this was an unsustainable bubble; one that built a new social order that condemned the next generation to insecurity and stagnating living standards. It\u2019s a phenomenon I encountered in Stoke-on-Trent at the weekend: a middle-aged woman confessed she had done rather well out of Thatcher, mainly because of right-to-buy. But she spoke of her son, unable to afford to buy his own home, instead paying through his nose to a private landlord; and of his girlfriend, who studied for a university degree and has the vast debt to show for it, and is now stuck in a low-paid, low-skilled job. It is the experience of her son\u2019s generation that explains why Tory support has imploded among the young.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/29/michael-gove-political-horror-show-chills-soul-stormzy\">Michael Gove is the political horror show that chills my soul | Mark O\u2019Connell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This time around, there is nothing left to sell, no meaningful short-term bungs to offer. Instead, the Tories rely on an authoritarian rightwing populism to fill the vacuum. Their hope is that this will appeal to working-class voters in Stoke-on-Trent, Doncaster and Bolton whose economic views are rooted firmly on the left. They make sure to keep shtum about their true intentions, believing Brexit demagoguery is a means to deflect from policies that threaten the living standards and rights of leave-supporting voters in the small towns of the Midlands, the north and Wales.</p> <p>And so here is a warning. The Tory manifesto is a blank cheque, not an empty sheet. The Tory rightwingers are ravenous vultures circling over the remnants of Britain\u2019s creaking public realm and hard-won social rights. Their ambitions are not lacking, merely disguised. And if they secure the majority they crave, soon there will be nothing worthwhile left of Britain for them to feast on.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

As one political academic puts it, Thatcher\u2019s \u201cgovernment either cleverly concealed the true extent of its liberalising intentions or \u2013 more likely \u2013 only gained full confidence in the idea of unleashing \u2018market forces\u2019 once safely installed at No 10\u201d. Another suggests its commitments were largely \u201ccompatible with other postwar Conservative manifestos\u201d, and attempted to counter Labour\u2019s attempts \u201cto portray Mrs Thatcher as a dangerous extremist\u201d. And what about now? Let us consider Dominic Raab, whose rightwing views frighten some of his own colleagues. Here is a man who co-authored a pamphlet arguing that the \u201ccurrent monolith\u201d of the NHS should be \u201cbroken up\u201d, while \u201cnew nonprofit and private operators should be allowed into the service, and, indeed should compete on price\u201d. Translated into non-wonk speak, this is privatisation. The foreign secretary has also denounced British employment legislation as a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d for the economy, favouring instead hire-and-fire rules. And again, another book he co-authored \u2013 Raab is nothing if not prolific \u2013 alongside fellow cabinet ministers Priti Patel and Liz Truss, denounced British workers as \u201cthe worst idlers in the world\u201d and proposed scrapping workers\u2019 rights. As Maya Angelou once said: \u201cWhen people show you who they are, believe them.\u201d Brexit, for them, is not principally about reconfiguring Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU, but rather scrapping what they call red tape and we call workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections. The same applies to Boris Johnson, who once lambasted the NHS as \u201ctop-down monopolistic healthcare\u201d and advocated introducing charges for NHS services. We should heed the words of ex-Conservative prime minister John Major, who declared that \u201cthe NHS is about as safe\u201d with Johnson and his colleagues as a \u201cpet hamster would be with a hungry python\u201d. Michael Gove, he suggested, desired to privatise the NHS: and indeed the cabinet minister is the co-author of a book that described the NHS as \u201cno longer relevant in the 21st century\u201d, instead arguing that Britain\u2019s most important institution should be replaced by private healthcare companies. The Tory party should not be accused of a scarcity of ideas, but rather of being dishonest about its intentions. Johnson and his allies know their heartfelt beliefs are not popular with the general public; they are also aware that Labour\u2019s domestic policies on public ownership and raising taxes for the rich enjoy widespread support. It is for this purpose that they deploy Brexit as a distraction and so run down the clock with stunts such as picking fights with Channel 4 News. They will do anything to deflect from Labour\u2019s programme and the failure to state their own in detail. There are fundamental differences with 1980s Thatcherism, of course. Back then, the Tories intended to embed a new political consensus by granting a short-term boost to the living standards of a layer of the population, principally through right-to-buy and share ownership. But this was an unsustainable bubble; one that built a new social order that condemned the next generation to insecurity and stagnating living standards. It\u2019s a phenomenon I encountered in Stoke-on-Trent at the weekend: a middle-aged woman confessed she had done rather well out of Thatcher, mainly because of right-to-buy. But she spoke of her son, unable to afford to buy his own home, instead paying through his nose to a private landlord; and of his girlfriend, who studied for a university degree and has the vast debt to show for it, and is now stuck in a low-paid, low-skilled job. It is the experience of her son\u2019s generation that explains why Tory support has imploded among the young. This time around, there is nothing left to sell, no meaningful short-term bungs to offer. Instead, the Tories rely on an authoritarian rightwing populism to fill the vacuum. Their hope is that this will appeal to working-class voters in Stoke-on-Trent, Doncaster and Bolton whose economic views are rooted firmly on the left. They make sure to keep shtum about their true intentions, believing Brexit demagoguery is a means to deflect from policies that threaten the living standards and rights of leave-supporting voters in the small towns of the Midlands, the north and Wales. And so here is a warning. The Tory manifesto is a blank cheque, not an empty sheet. The Tory rightwingers are ravenous vultures circling over the remnants of Britain\u2019s creaking public realm and hard-won social rights. Their ambitions are not lacking, merely disguised. And if they secure the majority they crave, soon there will be nothing worthwhile left of Britain for them to feast on. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<h2><strong>50. John Fahey</strong></h2> <h2>The First Noel</h2> <p>Tiring of the fact that no one wanted to buy albums of experimental American primitive guitar music, but they bought White Christmas every year, John Fahey recorded an album of Christmas instrumentals. It was, by a margin, his bestselling record. Atypical of his work, but beautiful.</p> <h2><strong>49. The Sonics</strong></h2> <h2>Don\u2019t Believe in Christmas</h2> <p>The Sonics believed some folks liked the taste of straight strychnine, so of course they didn\u2019t believe in Christmas. What happened when they stayed up late to try to catch a glimpse of Santa? \u201cWell, sure enough, don\u2019t ya know / The fat boy didn\u2019t show.\u201d Cheeky so-and-sos.</p> <h2><strong>48. Emmy the Great &amp; Tim Wheeler</strong></h2> <h2>Christmas Day (I Wish I Was Surfing)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Emmy the Great and Tim Wheeler - Christmas Day (I Wish I Was Surfing)\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dBHjen9Jz2o\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Sounding much more like Ash than Emmy the Great \u2013 and the loudest, most raucous thing on their 2011 Christmas album \u2013 this is a song that sounds joyous, but is really about the desire to escape, to anywhere that isn\u2019t cold. So long as it\u2019s not alone.</p> <h2><strong>47. Little Joey Farr</strong></h2> <h2>Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Christmas</h2> <p>Rock\u2019n\u2019roll and rockabilly are a treasure trove of Christmas novelty numbers (try Marlene Paula\u2019s I Want To Spend Xmas with Elvis), but we\u2019ve only got room for one. So, given Christmas is all about the kids, bless their souls, let\u2019s have a song by an actual kid who promptly disappeared from the pop world.</p> <h2><strong>46. Lou Rawls</strong></h2> <h2>Santa Claus Is Comin\u2019 to Town</h2> <p>One imagines this would be the soundtrack to Don Draper\u2019s Christmas \u2013 as creamy as eggnog, with a supple swing that\u2019s nagging but not unobtrusive, it\u2019s exactly the sound of an idealised Christmas from the 60s. Rawls made a ton of Christmas albums, but his first from 1967 is the best.</p> <h2><strong>45. Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Rudy Sarzo</strong><strong> &amp; Simon Wright</strong></h2> <h2>God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen</h2> <p>How would Christmas sound reimagined by Black Sabbath? Almost exactly as you would imagine, to be honest. The most oddly foreboding of all the big Christmas songs suits the grinding and roaring. And it helps, naturally, that it contains a reference to \u201cSatan\u2019s power\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>44. Saint Etienne</strong></h2> <h2>I Was Born on Christmas Day</h2> <p>From fire and brimstone to prosecco and chocolate, bursting with optimism for the winter: \u201cGetting groovy after Halloween / Mid-November, got back on the scene / I\u2019m so glad that I just got my pay / I was born on Christmas Day!\u201d A song as sweet as a selection box.</p> <h2><strong>43. The Free Design</strong></h2> <h2>Close Your Mouth (It\u2019s Christmas)</h2> <p>Probably the song that goes on in Don Draper\u2019s apartment after Lou Rawls, when the hip young kids have arrived. \u201cGet to know the people in your house,\u201d they sing. \u201cYou might like them.\u201d Draper knocks back a whisky, raises an eyebrow and shakes his head.</p> <h2><strong>42. Sally Shapiro</strong></h2> <h2>Anorak Christmas</h2> <p>A gorgeous bauble from the mid-00s wave of Scandinavian music that crossed electropop with the feyest indie. Sally falls in love on a Tuesday before Christmas, \u201cat a gig with a band that we both liked\u201d. But will she end up by herself \u201cor in the perfect kiss\u201d?</p> <h2><strong>41. Solomon Burke</strong></h2> <h2>Presents for Christmas</h2> <p>The king of rock\u2019n\u2019soul pitches himself somewhere between a revivalist preacher and Santa Claus: \u201cWe want to give out a present to everybody this Christmas! All around the world for every man, woman, boy and girl!\u201d he exclaims in the intro. One of the few artists whose spoken sections routinely rival the songs (track down a copy of Soul Alive! if you don\u2019t believe me).</p> <h2><strong>40. Joy Zipper</strong></h2> <h2>Christmas Song</h2> <p>Blank-faced and affectless, here\u2019s Christmas for the shoegazers from the duo briefly toasted at the start of the last decade. Kevin Shields and David Holmes produced, and you can bet Beach House were listening.</p> <h2><strong>39. Neil Halstead</strong></h2> <h2>The Man in the Santa Suit</h2> <p>Truthfully, this version is only here because the Fountains of Wayne original \u2013 an homage to the Kinks\u2019 Father Christmas \u2013 isn\u2019t on Spotify. But what a perfect, sad song: \u201cAnd he\u2019s a big red cherry / But it\u2019s hard to be merry / When the kids are all laughing / Saying: \u2018Hey, it\u2019s Jerry Garcia.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><strong>38. The Everly Brothers</strong></h2> <h2>Christmas Eve Can Kill You</h2> <p>The Man in the Santa Suit is a laughfest compared to this Everly Brothers number from 1972, about a hitcher alone the night before Christmas. Organ and pedal steel sound like the wind whistling through the trees as our hero trudges on: \u201cThe sound of one man walkin\u2019 through the snow can break your heart.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>37. Santo &amp; Johnny</strong></h2> <h2>Twistin\u2019 Bells</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Santo and Johnny \u2013 Twistin' Bells\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X9C_TGOGMT0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Do we need cheering up? I think we do. Thank goodness, then, for the twangy guitars of Brooklyn duo Santo &amp; Johnny, the gaudy, overlit shop window that contrasts with the stark loneliness of the Everly Brothers.</p> <h2><strong>36. Run-DMC</strong></h2> <h2>Christmas in Hollis</h2> <p>Hip-hop hasn\u2019t been a huge source of Christmas songs, but Run-DMC were on top of it back in the first golden age. What would you do if you found Santa\u2019s wallet on Hollis Avenue? It\u2019s a perennial question. Run decides its best to post it back; he is rewarded for his honesty.</p> <h2><strong>35. Shirley </strong><strong>&amp; Dolly Collins</strong></h2> <h2>The Gower Wassail</h2> <p>Two of the greatest British folk voices combine for a drinking song that, if we\u2019re honest, is unlikely to be ringing out in pubs this Christmas. The asceticism of the British folk tradition can be a useful astringent amid the sleigh bells and tinsel.</p> <h2><strong>34. Tracey Thorn</strong></h2> <h2>Snow in Sun</h2> <p>Originally from Scritti Politti\u2019s sublime 2006 album White Bread, Black Beer and reworked by Thorn on her gorgeous album Tinsel and Lights \u2013 which is enough to qualify it as a Christmas song \u2013 here is a featherlight breath of winter to freshen your face.</p> <h2><strong>33. Mahalia Jackson</strong></h2> <h2>Go Tell It on the Mountain</h2> <p>You can\u2019t really have Christmas without acknowledging that someone significant was born on 25 December \u2013 and not just Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne. The queen of gospel wants you to spread the news far and wide, and she imparts her message with due gravitas.</p> <h2><strong>32. Big Star</strong></h2> <h2>Jesus Christ</h2> <p>Big Star\u2019s Third is the least likely album to contain a Christmas song, but amid the desperation and despair was this huge burst of fervour. Did Alex Chilton mean it? Was it a joke? Its effect is magnified by the music that surrounds it on the rest of the album.</p> <h2><strong>31. Calexico</strong></h2> <h2>Green Grows the Holly</h2> <p>Gorgeous and stern, and undoubtedly the best adaptation by an Americana band of any poem written by Henry VIII. The horns bloom, like the flowers of the song, turning something indisputably English into a desert lament.</p> <h2><strong>30. Jimmy McGriff</strong></h2> <h2>Winter Wonderland</h2> <p>McGriff opens with a squall of organ that doesn\u2019t lead you to believe Christmas is coming anytime soon, then takes Winter Wonderland at such a leisurely pace that it takes a moment to recognise it. (If you like this, try Jimmy Smith\u2019s Christmas \u201964 as well.)</p> <h2><strong>29. Sharon Jones &amp; the Dap-Kings</strong></h2> <h2>Ain\u2019t No Chimneys in the Projects</h2> <p>When you live in poverty, certain logistical problems come to mind. Namely, if you\u2019re in a big public housing block, how does Santa get the presents underneath the tree? A fabulous addition to the long line of socially conscious soul and funk Christmas music.</p> <h2><strong>28. Sons of Heaven</strong></h2> <h2>When Was Jesus Born?</h2> <p>We all know the answer, but when it\u2019s posed this beautifully, in such impeccable close harmony, the obviousness of the question can be forgiven. There are many versions of this, but it\u2019s a hard song to do anything but beautifully.</p> <h2><strong>27. Thea Gilmore</strong></h2> <h2>Listen, the Snow Is Falling</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Thea Gilmore Listen the Snow is Falling\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xjpNkTvE59s\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Yoko Ono\u2019s is the original version and Galaxie 500\u2019s rendition is more celebrated, but Thea Gilmore gets the perfect ratio of iciness to wonder \u2013 it sounds like a Christmas tree, if such a thing were possible. The 2009 album Strange Communion is highly recommended.</p> <h2><strong>26. The Temptations</strong></h2> <h2>Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer</h2> <p>Oh, wrap yourself in the blanket of those glorious voices! Motown took Christmas seriously, with the result that you could probably do this list entirely from Motown tracks. This one gets selected because what is really a fairly dismal song is transformed by a perfect arrangement.</p> <h2><strong>25. Clarence Carter</strong></h2> <h2>Back Door Santa</h2> <p>Pure Christmas filth. Back Door Santa can \u201cmake all the little girls happy / While the boys are out to play.\u201d But don\u2019t mistake him for Father Christmas: \u201cI ain\u2019t like old Saint Nick / He don\u2019t come but once a year.\u201d I dare you not to dance, though.</p> <h2><strong>24. Ramones</strong></h2> <h2>Danny Says</h2> <p>Merry Christmas (I Don\u2019t Want to Fight Tonight) is better known as a Ramones Christmas song, but the sublime Danny Says gets the nod, qualifying on the grounds that the desperate, lonely band are stuck on the road deep in winter and \u201cit ain\u2019t Christmas if there ain\u2019t no snow\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>23. Cristina</strong></h2> <h2>Things Fall Apart</h2> <p>No matter how bad your Christmas is, it\u2019s not as bad as Cristina\u2019s. Mind you, given it\u2019s the early 80s New York art underground, she was probably forbidden from liking something so bourgeois. Even a party can\u2019t cheer her: \u201cI caught a cab back to my flat / And wept a bit and fed the cat.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>22. Joni Mitchell</strong></h2> <h2>River</h2> <p>Joni Mitchell is bereft, too, on this gorgeous piano ballad, when Christmas just makes her mourn her relationship and flee Laurel Canyon for her home in Canada, where there might be a frozen river she could skate away on, away from everything.</p> <h2><strong>21. David Banner</strong></h2> <h2>The Christmas Song</h2> <p>Completing the mini-run of joyless Christmases, here\u2019s the most joyless of all \u2013 when the only way to pay for Christmas is to rob and deal and kill. The climactic \u201cjingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\u201d is not intended as cause for celebration.</p> <h2><strong>20. Lindstr\u00f8m</strong></h2> <h2>Little Drummer Boy</h2> <p>Hans-Peter Lindstr\u00f8m takes almost 43 minutes to assemble a Christmas song \u2013 from electronic squiggles, through the martial drumbeat, to the melody coming in at eight minutes. It then spends a further 25 minutes warping and mutating, picking up and discarding musical phrases, before exploding orgasmically in its final 10 minutes or so.</p> <h2><strong>19. William Bell</strong></h2> <h2>Every Day Will Be a Holiday</h2> <p>It doesn\u2019t actually mention Christmas, but gets counted \u2013 and not just by me \u2013 as a Christmas song because of the little horn lift from Jingle Bells, for it being about being lonely waiting for his baby to come home (presumably for Christmas), and because its B-side was Please Come Home For Christmas. It\u2019s also a fabulous piece of Stax soul.</p> <h2><strong>18. Belle and Sebastian</strong></h2> <h2>O Come, O Come Emmanuel</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Belle and Sebastian - O Come, O Come Emmanuel\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6s25qJVER_U\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>On the 2000 charity album It\u2019s a Cool Cool Christmas \u2013 which was pretty strong \u2013 Belle and Sebastian took on the most beautiful of all the Christmas hymns. Something so delicate suited them. Also recommended: El Vez merging Feliz Navidad and Public Image.</p> <h2><strong>17. The Staple</strong><strong> Singers</strong></h2> <h2>Who Took the Merry Out of Christmas?</h2> <p>The Staple Singers are worried: too many wars, too much space exploration means people are \u201csearching for light and can\u2019t seem to find the right star\u201d. Jesus isn\u2019t just another baby boy, they warn. So show some respect. Glorious.</p> <h2><strong>16. The Watersons</strong></h2> <h2>Sound, Sound Your Instruments of Joy</h2> <p>Just listen to the voices: this is Christmas as it must have sounded when it was a religious festival in the depths of winter, rather than an excuse to rack up debt. Make your own fun! Maybe weave an Action Man out of three pieces of straw! And yet it\u2019s so beautiful.</p> <h2><strong>15. Eartha Kitt</strong></h2> <h2>Santa Baby</h2> <p>We\u2019re into the start of the big songs now, and Eartha Kitt\u2019s contribution is the precise opposite of the Watersons\u2019 vision of Christmas. She wants a sable, a convertible, a yacht, a platinum mine \u2026 She wants every sensation. And what\u2019s Jesus got to do with anything?</p> <h2><strong>14. Otis Redding</strong></h2> <h2>White Christmas</h2> <p>Who knew the most famous Christmas hit of all could be so emotionally wrought? Where Bing Crosby sounded as if he was fondly pondering his Christmas, Otis sounds like he\u2019s breaking into a sweat trying to will it into existence through sheer force of desire.</p> <h2><strong>13. The Pretenders</strong></h2> <h2>2000 Miles</h2> <p>Sometimes simple is best: Robbie McIntosh\u2019s guitar playing on the Pretenders\u2019 1984 hit is a model of folk-rock restraint, taking from the Byrds, and offsetting Chrissie Hynde\u2019s voice and lyric with a sense that everything, somehow, is going to be OK.</p> <h2><strong>12. Bob Seger and the Last Heard</strong></h2> <h2>Sock It to Me Santa</h2> <p>\u201cSanta\u2019s got a brand new bag!\u201d hollers Bob Seger, who was a Detroit R&amp;B shouter years before he became a heartland American beard rocker. Sock It to Me Santa is a fabulous explosion \u2013 garage rock and soul brought together into something made for the best bar in the city on Christmas Eve.</p> <h2><strong>11. Wham!</strong></h2> <h2>Last Christmas</h2> <p>A big Christmas hit that was unlike previous UK seasonal singles \u2013 it wasn\u2019t wrapped in sleigh bells, there was nothing consciously novelty about it.

      "bodyText": "50. John Fahey The First Noel Tiring of the fact that no one wanted to buy albums of experimental American primitive guitar music, but they bought White Christmas every year, John Fahey recorded an album of Christmas instrumentals. It was, by a margin, his bestselling record. Atypical of his work, but beautiful. 49. The Sonics Don\u2019t Believe in Christmas The Sonics believed some folks liked the taste of straight strychnine, so of course they didn\u2019t believe in Christmas. What happened when they stayed up late to try to catch a glimpse of Santa? \u201cWell, sure enough, don\u2019t ya know / The fat boy didn\u2019t show.\u201d Cheeky so-and-sos. 48. Emmy the Great &amp; Tim Wheeler Christmas Day (I Wish I Was Surfing) Sounding much more like Ash than Emmy the Great \u2013 and the loudest, most raucous thing on their 2011 Christmas album \u2013 this is a song that sounds joyous, but is really about the desire to escape, to anywhere that isn\u2019t cold. So long as it\u2019s not alone. 47. Little Joey Farr Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Christmas Rock\u2019n\u2019roll and rockabilly are a treasure trove of Christmas novelty numbers (try Marlene Paula\u2019s I Want To Spend Xmas with Elvis), but we\u2019ve only got room for one. So, given Christmas is all about the kids, bless their souls, let\u2019s have a song by an actual kid who promptly disappeared from the pop world. 46. Lou Rawls Santa Claus Is Comin\u2019 to Town One imagines this would be the soundtrack to Don Draper\u2019s Christmas \u2013 as creamy as eggnog, with a supple swing that\u2019s nagging but not unobtrusive, it\u2019s exactly the sound of an idealised Christmas from the 60s. Rawls made a ton of Christmas albums, but his first from 1967 is the best. 45. Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Rudy Sarzo &amp; Simon Wright God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen How would Christmas sound reimagined by Black Sabbath? Almost exactly as you would imagine, to be honest. The most oddly foreboding of all the big Christmas songs suits the grinding and roaring. And it helps, naturally, that it contains a reference to \u201cSatan\u2019s power\u201d. 44. Saint Etienne I Was Born on Christmas Day From fire and brimstone to prosecco and chocolate, bursting with optimism for the winter: \u201cGetting groovy after Halloween / Mid-November, got back on the scene / I\u2019m so glad that I just got my pay / I was born on Christmas Day!\u201d A song as sweet as a selection box. 43. The Free Design Close Your Mouth (It\u2019s Christmas) Probably the song that goes on in Don Draper\u2019s apartment after Lou Rawls, when the hip young kids have arrived. \u201cGet to know the people in your house,\u201d they sing. \u201cYou might like them.\u201d Draper knocks back a whisky, raises an eyebrow and shakes his head. 42. Sally Shapiro Anorak Christmas A gorgeous bauble from the mid-00s wave of Scandinavian music that crossed electropop with the feyest indie. Sally falls in love on a Tuesday before Christmas, \u201cat a gig with a band that we both liked\u201d. But will she end up by herself \u201cor in the perfect kiss\u201d? 41. Solomon Burke Presents for Christmas The king of rock\u2019n\u2019soul pitches himself somewhere between a revivalist preacher and Santa Claus: \u201cWe want to give out a present to everybody this Christmas! All around the world for every man, woman, boy and girl!\u201d he exclaims in the intro. One of the few artists whose spoken sections routinely rival the songs (track down a copy of Soul Alive! if you don\u2019t believe me). 40. Joy Zipper Christmas Song Blank-faced and affectless, here\u2019s Christmas for the shoegazers from the duo briefly toasted at the start of the last decade. Kevin Shields and David Holmes produced, and you can bet Beach House were listening. 39. Neil Halstead The Man in the Santa Suit Truthfully, this version is only here because the Fountains of Wayne original \u2013 an homage to the Kinks\u2019 Father Christmas \u2013 isn\u2019t on Spotify. But what a perfect, sad song: \u201cAnd he\u2019s a big red cherry / But it\u2019s hard to be merry / When the kids are all laughing / Saying: \u2018Hey, it\u2019s Jerry Garcia.\u2019\u201d 38. The Everly Brothers Christmas Eve Can Kill You The Man in the Santa Suit is a laughfest compared to this Everly Brothers number from 1972, about a hitcher alone the night before Christmas. Organ and pedal steel sound like the wind whistling through the trees as our hero trudges on: \u201cThe sound of one man walkin\u2019 through the snow can break your heart.\u201d 37. Santo &amp; Johnny Twistin\u2019 Bells Do we need cheering up? I think we do. Thank goodness, then, for the twangy guitars of Brooklyn duo Santo &amp; Johnny, the gaudy, overlit shop window that contrasts with the stark loneliness of the Everly Brothers. 36. Run-DMC Christmas in Hollis Hip-hop hasn\u2019t been a huge source of Christmas songs, but Run-DMC were on top of it back in the first golden age. What would you do if you found Santa\u2019s wallet on Hollis Avenue? It\u2019s a perennial question. Run decides its best to post it back; he is rewarded for his honesty. 35. Shirley &amp; Dolly Collins The Gower Wassail Two of the greatest British folk voices combine for a drinking song that, if we\u2019re honest, is unlikely to be ringing out in pubs this Christmas. The asceticism of the British folk tradition can be a useful astringent amid the sleigh bells and tinsel. 34. Tracey Thorn Snow in Sun Originally from Scritti Politti\u2019s sublime 2006 album White Bread, Black Beer and reworked by Thorn on her gorgeous album Tinsel and Lights \u2013 which is enough to qualify it as a Christmas song \u2013 here is a featherlight breath of winter to freshen your face. 33. Mahalia Jackson Go Tell It on the Mountain You can\u2019t really have Christmas without acknowledging that someone significant was born on 25 December \u2013 and not just Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne. The queen of gospel wants you to spread the news far and wide, and she imparts her message with due gravitas. 32. Big Star Jesus Christ Big Star\u2019s Third is the least likely album to contain a Christmas song, but amid the desperation and despair was this huge burst of fervour. Did Alex Chilton mean it? Was it a joke? Its effect is magnified by the music that surrounds it on the rest of the album. 31. Calexico Green Grows the Holly Gorgeous and stern, and undoubtedly the best adaptation by an Americana band of any poem written by Henry VIII. The horns bloom, like the flowers of the song, turning something indisputably English into a desert lament. 30. Jimmy McGriff Winter Wonderland McGriff opens with a squall of organ that doesn\u2019t lead you to believe Christmas is coming anytime soon, then takes Winter Wonderland at such a leisurely pace that it takes a moment to recognise it. (If you like this, try Jimmy Smith\u2019s Christmas \u201964 as well.) 29. Sharon Jones &amp; the Dap-Kings Ain\u2019t No Chimneys in the Projects When you live in poverty, certain logistical problems come to mind. Namely, if you\u2019re in a big public housing block, how does Santa get the presents underneath the tree? A fabulous addition to the long line of socially conscious soul and funk Christmas music. 28. Sons of Heaven When Was Jesus Born? We all know the answer, but when it\u2019s posed this beautifully, in such impeccable close harmony, the obviousness of the question can be forgiven. There are many versions of this, but it\u2019s a hard song to do anything but beautifully. 27. Thea Gilmore Listen, the Snow Is Falling Yoko Ono\u2019s is the original version and Galaxie 500\u2019s rendition is more celebrated, but Thea Gilmore gets the perfect ratio of iciness to wonder \u2013 it sounds like a Christmas tree, if such a thing were possible. The 2009 album Strange Communion is highly recommended. 26. The Temptations Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer Oh, wrap yourself in the blanket of those glorious voices! Motown took Christmas seriously, with the result that you could probably do this list entirely from Motown tracks. This one gets selected because what is really a fairly dismal song is transformed by a perfect arrangement. 25. Clarence Carter Back Door Santa Pure Christmas filth. Back Door Santa can \u201cmake all the little girls happy / While the boys are out to play.\u201d But don\u2019t mistake him for Father Christmas: \u201cI ain\u2019t like old Saint Nick / He don\u2019t come but once a year.\u201d I dare you not to dance, though. 24. Ramones Danny Says Merry Christmas (I Don\u2019t Want to Fight Tonight) is better known as a Ramones Christmas song, but the sublime Danny Says gets the nod, qualifying on the grounds that the desperate, lonely band are stuck on the road deep in winter and \u201cit ain\u2019t Christmas if there ain\u2019t no snow\u201d. 23. Cristina Things Fall Apart No matter how bad your Christmas is, it\u2019s not as bad as Cristina\u2019s. Mind you, given it\u2019s the early 80s New York art underground, she was probably forbidden from liking something so bourgeois. Even a party can\u2019t cheer her: \u201cI caught a cab back to my flat / And wept a bit and fed the cat.\u201d 22. Joni Mitchell River Joni Mitchell is bereft, too, on this gorgeous piano ballad, when Christmas just makes her mourn her relationship and flee Laurel Canyon for her home in Canada, where there might be a frozen river she could skate away on, away from everything. 21. David Banner The Christmas Song Completing the mini-run of joyless Christmases, here\u2019s the most joyless of all \u2013 when the only way to pay for Christmas is to rob and deal and kill. The climactic \u201cjingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\u201d is not intended as cause for celebration. 20. Lindstr\u00f8m Little Drummer Boy Hans-Peter Lindstr\u00f8m takes almost 43 minutes to assemble a Christmas song \u2013 from electronic squiggles, through the martial drumbeat, to the melody coming in at eight minutes. It then spends a further 25 minutes warping and mutating, picking up and discarding musical phrases, before exploding orgasmically in its final 10 minutes or so. 19. William Bell Every Day Will Be a Holiday It doesn\u2019t actually mention Christmas, but gets counted \u2013 and not just by me \u2013 as a Christmas song because of the little horn lift from Jingle Bells, for it being about being lonely waiting for his baby to come home (presumably for Christmas), and because its B-side was Please Come Home For Christmas. It\u2019s also a fabulous piece of Stax soul. 18. Belle and Sebastian O Come, O Come Emmanuel On the 2000 charity album It\u2019s a Cool Cool Christmas \u2013 which was pretty strong \u2013 Belle and Sebastian took on the most beautiful of all the Christmas hymns. Something so delicate suited them. Also recommended: El Vez merging Feliz Navidad and Public Image. 17. The Staple Singers Who Took the Merry Out of Christmas? The Staple Singers are worried: too many wars, too much space exploration means people are \u201csearching for light and can\u2019t seem to find the right star\u201d. Jesus isn\u2019t just another baby boy, they warn. So show some respect. Glorious. 16. The Watersons Sound, Sound Your Instruments of Joy Just listen to the voices: this is Christmas as it must have sounded when it was a religious festival in the depths of winter, rather than an excuse to rack up debt. Make your own fun! Maybe weave an Action Man out of three pieces of straw! And yet it\u2019s so beautiful. 15. Eartha Kitt Santa Baby We\u2019re into the start of the big songs now, and Eartha Kitt\u2019s contribution is the precise opposite of the Watersons\u2019 vision of Christmas. She wants a sable, a convertible, a yacht, a platinum mine \u2026 She wants every sensation. And what\u2019s Jesus got to do with anything? 14. Otis Redding White Christmas Who knew the most famous Christmas hit of all could be so emotionally wrought? Where Bing Crosby sounded as if he was fondly pondering his Christmas, Otis sounds like he\u2019s breaking into a sweat trying to will it into existence through sheer force of desire. 13. The Pretenders 2000 Miles Sometimes simple is best: Robbie McIntosh\u2019s guitar playing on the Pretenders\u2019 1984 hit is a model of folk-rock restraint, taking from the Byrds, and offsetting Chrissie Hynde\u2019s voice and lyric with a sense that everything, somehow, is going to be OK. 12. Bob Seger and the Last Heard Sock It to Me Santa \u201cSanta\u2019s got a brand new bag!\u201d hollers Bob Seger, who was a Detroit R&amp;B shouter years before he became a heartland American beard rocker. Sock It to Me Santa is a fabulous explosion \u2013 garage rock and soul brought together into something made for the best bar in the city on Christmas Eve. 11. Wham! Last Christmas A big Christmas hit that was unlike previous UK seasonal singles \u2013 it wasn\u2019t wrapped in sleigh bells, there was nothing consciously novelty about it. Perhaps George Michael had been paying close attention to some of the great US Christmas soul singles, because this was a heartbreak song that just happened to be set in December. 10. Darlene Love Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) A Christmas Gift to You from Phil Spector codified the sound of Christmas: maximal, filled with signifiers of the season (there is nowhere sleigh bells can\u2019t be draped). Darlene Love\u2019s Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) was the standout on a record on which the quality didn\u2019t drop from start to finish. 9. Wizzard I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday Roy Wood\u2019s enduring contribution to the season owed a huge debt to Phil Spector \u2013 there\u2019s almost certainly a kitchen sink section at work somewhere in the mix \u2013 but it transcends imitation by its sheer verve. It was recorded in summer, with the studio air conditioning turned down to make everyone feel wintry. Attention to detail, right there. 8. Slade Merry Xmas Everybody Christmas 1973 brought not just Wizzard but the most enduring of all British Christmas singles. Forty-six years later, people still bellow \u201cIt\u2019s CHRISTMAS!\u201d in Noddy Holder\u2019s face, which, apparently, gets a little wearisome. The whole thing was Jim Lea\u2019s mum\u2019s idea \u2013 why didn\u2019t Slade have a song they could release every year? She got her wish. 7. Donny Hathaway This Christmas It wasn\u2019t a hit at the time, but took off when it was included on a 1991 reissue of the 1968 Atco compilation Soul Christmas. To which you can only say: why did it take the world so long to notice? It\u2019s a Christmas song that stands up regardless of the season. And according to the publishing body Ascap, it\u2019s now the 30th most performed Christmas song of all time in the US. 6. Tom Waits Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis Probably not one to play when you\u2019re unwrapping the presents. A character study that begins grimly, then offers hope, as the narrator says things are getting better \u2013 before ripping the rug away without ceremony. Do you want to know the truth of it, she asks: \u201cCharley, hey, I\u2019ll be eligible for parole come Valentine\u2019s day.\u201d 5. Marvin Gaye Purple Snowflakes A song so beautiful it\u2019s almost otherworldly \u2013 Marvin Gaye\u2019s flawless falsetto, the unexpected chord changes, the sense of mystery. Yet it\u2019s wrapped up in the most comforting of Christmas imagery \u2013 chestnuts roasting, blankets of white \u2013 without ever explaining why the snowflakes are purple. 4. The Waitresses Christmas Wrapping Like Cristina\u2019s Things Fall Apart, Christmas Wrapping was originally written for the Z\u00e9 label\u2019s 1981 compilation \u2013 the most punching-above-its-weight Christmas comp ever. It\u2019s a fabulous stream of consciousness, during which Patty Donahue talks herself from wanting to miss Christmas to knowing she can\u2019t miss Christmas, that bursts into joy at its horn refrain. 3. Low Just Like Christmas Low\u2019s 1999 Christmas EP \u2013 released as a \u201cgift\u201d to fans \u2013 was one of the most unexpected seasonal delights: ascetic indie band embracing the season without irony. Its lead track was a joy, the discomfort of touring reminding them of when they were young, and it feeling just like Christmas. Just two verses, and a repeated refrain \u2013 perfect. 2. The Pogues Fairytale of New York There\u2019s almost nothing left to be said about Fairytale of New York, a song that has been impossible to avoid for more than 30 years. Such is the strength of the songwriting and the grace of the performance that, despite the overexposure, it feels fresh every single time. That a scrappy folk-punk band produced something that will endure as long as Christmas itself is a real Christmas miracle. 1. Mariah Carey All I Want for Christmas Is You The best Christmas songs should only work at Christmas. They should make you feel festive, in the same way that the 174th repeat of The Snowman does. They should work anywhere \u2013 in shopping centres, in bars, pumping out of PAs in gig venues after the band has gone off, on the radio in a cafe, in your home or on your headphones. All I Want for Christmas Is You is all of those things. It\u2019s a shameless pastiche of Phil Spector that\u2019s so brazen and joyful and simple \u2013 it took Carey and Walter Afanasieff only 15 minutes to write \u2013 that it transcends its lack of originality.

      "body": "<p>As Dave Eggers\u2019s novella begins, the citizens of the great ship Glory are electing a new captain.

Happily, the weekend before I saw Ahmed, I heard a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2IN8wYqQ6E\">single</a> from the first Who album in many years. The song is Pete Townshend\u2019s take on the world\u2019s most infamous prison: \u201cDown in Guant\u00e1namo, we still got the ball and chain. That pretty piece of Cuba, designed to cause men pain.\u201d The censors will never allow Ahmed to hear the song, and my own imitation of Roger Daltrey\u2019s growl was a poor substitute. Yet Ahmed and the other men were thrilled that someone remembered they existed.</p> <p>At the same time, Amazon has released The Report, starring Adam Driver as Senate staffer Daniel J Jones. Jones worked for Senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening), investigating the use of Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (\u201cEITs\u201d), which the CIA vehemently claimed did not amount to torture. All one really needs to know is that the Gestapo\u2019s euphemism for torture was <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2007/05/-versch-auml-rfte-vernehmung/228158/\">Versch\u00e4rfte Vernehmung</a>, which translates as \u201cEnhanced Interrogation\u201d.

Yet the film is gripping and \u2013 as far as it goes \u2013 compellingly accurate. I likewise spent long hours in a windowless room reviewing classified evidence, and I empathise with Driver\u2019s descent into paranoia when would-be whistleblowers accost him beside the concrete pillars of the subterranean Agency garage. As he encounters proof of the torture, the most incriminating papers begin to disappear. This prompts him to leak one document to a senator, who then reveals it in a public hearing. In turn, the CIA tries to have Driver prosecuted, and starts bugging the senators themselves in their cover-up.</p> <p>The movie does not flinch from the torture to which the prisoners were subjected. Throughout, the action cuts from Langley and Capitol Hill to dark cells in Thailand and Afghanistan where American interrogators are inflicting unspeakable pain and suffering upon the men they (often wrongly) believe to be terrorists. It is exceptionally rare for a film to show US personnel torturing their captives, and the film-makers are to be commended for their courage.</p> <p>The concluding battle comes between Senator Feinstein and President Barack Obama, the constitutional law scholar who insists on replacing Driver\u2019s massive tome with a heavily redacted \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d.</p> <p>I discussed the film with Ahmed. Indeed, I told him that watching closely as the camera pans around the CIA basement I saw his picture pinned to the wall. He acknowledged it would be hard to tell the whole story of CIA torture in two hours, but felt that The Report missed some important details.</p> <p>In the \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d Ahmed is listed as one of 17 victims whose torture was \u201cunauthorised\u201d. The film might have considered whether torture is morally more or less acceptable if it has been \u201cauthorised\u201d by the president. The larger omission is in the report itself. Daniel Jones did not talk to any of the victims: Ahmed asked how we would feel if an inquest into genocide in Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia looked no further than the diaries of the murderers?</p> <p>Ahmed will not be allowed to see the film in Guant\u00e1namo, but he has read the actual \u201cExecutive Summary,\u201d as he appears in it several times. He was surprised that some CIA agents concluded he was not Hassan Ghul just 24 hours after he was originally kidnapped. Why, then, did they render him to the Dark Prison in Kabul? There, he endured more than 540 days of torture (he did not keep count, but the report helpfully told him). He learned that at some point in his misery, the US captured the real Hassan Ghul and brought him to the same prison. Ghul was \u201ccooperative\u201d and spent only two days there. He was later released back to Pakistan and went back to his terrorism, before being killed by a drone in 2012.

      "body": "<p>The lines in my DeKalb county, Georgia, polling site wrapped around the corner. Each of the hopeful voters in our predominantly black election district waited about two hours, alternately sitting, standing and passing the time with southern pleasantries, moments away from voting for America\u2019s first black president. And it wasn\u2019t yet the official voting day.</p> <p>I had gone home from my graduate studies in New York City to vote early. I knew Barack Obama wasn\u2019t perfect, but he offered a bold vision following the financial crisis \u2013 and that\u2019s what we needed. I was back in Harlem when election day results trickled in. We witnessed the unimaginable. Barack Obama became president, turning my deep southern state of Georgia purple and somehow convincing white blue-collar workers in a handful of swing states to choose him over a Republican.</p> <p>At a campus watch party \u2013 among the generation that would later be identified as hapless, capitalism-killing millennials \u2013 we felt unadulterated joy. Media outlets circled around what they considered the epicenter of black life on 125th Street in Harlem, capturing the thousands of people who descended on to the streets to dance. We blocked traffic and exchanged high-fives with strangers, ignoring the mist that was swelling our straightened hair. The hope Obama promised was omnipresent and lasted for days. Then 2009 happened.</p> <p>We graduated into the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/reader-center/great-recession-college-graduates-impact.html\">worst job market in a generation</a>, threatening our ability to pay back our college and post-graduate debts. Obama filled his cabinet with financial industry operatives. We saw a bailout for banks and big business that dwarfed the stimulus of American households. Despite middle-class trappings, economic insecurity hit me and much of our generation hard. Back home, my mother and I struggled to pay for a home that mortgage lenders targeted with a subprime mortgage. We saw Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, Michael Brown and Rekia Boyd shot and killed. We saw the beer summit and respectability politics. Despite doing many things \u201cright\u201d, it wasn\u2019t enough. Homes in our mostly black neighborhood outside of Atlanta still have not recovered. Justice for the victims of police and vigilante violence has still been unserved. Banks are <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-bank-bailouts-20161107-story.html\">still being bailed out</a>.</p> <p>In hushed circles \u2013 dinner parties and barber shops, group chats and family gatherings \u2013 the relatively universal enthusiasm for Obama tapered as his presidency came to a close. Hope for many of us has been replaced with resignation. For those who still believe in participating in electoral politics, there is inherent compromise with our decisions as a national minority. The radical and progressive among us know we can\u2019t get everything we want through federal politics. But we want someone who acknowledges the need for structural change and will at least try to fight for it.</p> <p>So when the California senator Kamala Harris announced her bid for the presidency, women at the intersections of a marginalized race and class had to consider what this meant for us. We saw the recording of her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HZjLnj7WGM\">mocking organizers</a> who want more schools and fewer prisons. We saw her <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-08-05/kamala-harris-police-shootings-black-lives-matter\">silence on progressive policing legislation</a> as a prosecutor while embracing her role as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/23/18184192/kamala-harris-president-campaign-criminal-justice-record\">top cop</a>\u201d. We saw that she branded herself as tough on crime in the midst of Black Lives Matter. We saw the big money fundraisers and waffling on Medicare for All. We saw social policies but no desire to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-election.html\">restructure society</a>\u201d, despite grotesque wealth inequality and America\u2019s racial caste system. In a time when people want moral clarity and black Americans are struggling for a firm economic footing, these mixed messages would never win.</p> <p>Her subsequent <a href=\"https://medium.com/@KamalaHarris/i-am-suspending-my-campaign-today-6dca8cefb252\">suspension</a> of her 2020 presidential bid on Tuesday makes us consider those same intersections. Thus, assessments of her campaign failures cannot be reduced to her identity alone. Like Obama\u2019s wink and nod to the financial sector, despite his populist campaign rhetoric, Harris\u2019s wink and nod to those existing power structures throughout her career have been telling. For many younger black voters, this meant lending their support to other candidates who have campaigned on progressive policies or withholding support for a particular candidate altogether. In a September <a href=\"https://www.essence.com/feature/black-womens-roundtable-survey-results-2019/\">Essence poll</a>, most black women aged 18-34 were unsure of their vote, followed by nearly 19% of them supporting the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. Harris followed at 17%. Among black voters in South Carolina, support among the candidates without the former vice-president Joe Biden in the race has Sanders in the lead, followed by Warren and then Harris, according to a <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_sc_102319/\">Monmouth poll</a>.</p> <p>Harris\u2019s inability to capture significant black support does not preclude that if she were white and a man, she would have probably gone farther. Biden was the liberal face of the Democrats\u2019 tough on crime posturing since the Reagan era.

      "bodyText": "The lines in my DeKalb county, Georgia, polling site wrapped around the corner. Each of the hopeful voters in our predominantly black election district waited about two hours, alternately sitting, standing and passing the time with southern pleasantries, moments away from voting for America\u2019s first black president. And it wasn\u2019t yet the official voting day. I had gone home from my graduate studies in New York City to vote early. I knew Barack Obama wasn\u2019t perfect, but he offered a bold vision following the financial crisis \u2013 and that\u2019s what we needed. I was back in Harlem when election day results trickled in. We witnessed the unimaginable. Barack Obama became president, turning my deep southern state of Georgia purple and somehow convincing white blue-collar workers in a handful of swing states to choose him over a Republican. At a campus watch party \u2013 among the generation that would later be identified as hapless, capitalism-killing millennials \u2013 we felt unadulterated joy. Media outlets circled around what they considered the epicenter of black life on 125th Street in Harlem, capturing the thousands of people who descended on to the streets to dance. We blocked traffic and exchanged high-fives with strangers, ignoring the mist that was swelling our straightened hair. The hope Obama promised was omnipresent and lasted for days. Then 2009 happened. We graduated into the worst job market in a generation, threatening our ability to pay back our college and post-graduate debts. Obama filled his cabinet with financial industry operatives. We saw a bailout for banks and big business that dwarfed the stimulus of American households. Despite middle-class trappings, economic insecurity hit me and much of our generation hard. Back home, my mother and I struggled to pay for a home that mortgage lenders targeted with a subprime mortgage. We saw Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, Michael Brown and Rekia Boyd shot and killed. We saw the beer summit and respectability politics. Despite doing many things \u201cright\u201d, it wasn\u2019t enough. Homes in our mostly black neighborhood outside of Atlanta still have not recovered. Justice for the victims of police and vigilante violence has still been unserved. Banks are still being bailed out. In hushed circles \u2013 dinner parties and barber shops, group chats and family gatherings \u2013 the relatively universal enthusiasm for Obama tapered as his presidency came to a close. Hope for many of us has been replaced with resignation. For those who still believe in participating in electoral politics, there is inherent compromise with our decisions as a national minority. The radical and progressive among us know we can\u2019t get everything we want through federal politics. But we want someone who acknowledges the need for structural change and will at least try to fight for it. So when the California senator Kamala Harris announced her bid for the presidency, women at the intersections of a marginalized race and class had to consider what this meant for us. We saw the recording of her mocking organizers who want more schools and fewer prisons. We saw her silence on progressive policing legislation as a prosecutor while embracing her role as a \u201ctop cop\u201d. We saw that she branded herself as tough on crime in the midst of Black Lives Matter. We saw the big money fundraisers and waffling on Medicare for All. We saw social policies but no desire to \u201crestructure society\u201d, despite grotesque wealth inequality and America\u2019s racial caste system. In a time when people want moral clarity and black Americans are struggling for a firm economic footing, these mixed messages would never win. Her subsequent suspension of her 2020 presidential bid on Tuesday makes us consider those same intersections. Thus, assessments of her campaign failures cannot be reduced to her identity alone. Like Obama\u2019s wink and nod to the financial sector, despite his populist campaign rhetoric, Harris\u2019s wink and nod to those existing power structures throughout her career have been telling. For many younger black voters, this meant lending their support to other candidates who have campaigned on progressive policies or withholding support for a particular candidate altogether. In a September Essence poll, most black women aged 18-34 were unsure of their vote, followed by nearly 19% of them supporting the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. Harris followed at 17%. Among black voters in South Carolina, support among the candidates without the former vice-president Joe Biden in the race has Sanders in the lead, followed by Warren and then Harris, according to a Monmouth poll. Harris\u2019s inability to capture significant black support does not preclude that if she were white and a man, she would have probably gone farther. Biden was the liberal face of the Democrats\u2019 tough on crime posturing since the Reagan era. Michael Bloomberg entered the race with a racist stop-and-frisk policy and broken windows policing on his administration\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar was a tough-on-crime prosecutor. The South Bend mayor, Pete Buttigieg, undermined black criminal justice demands as mayor of a small town where racial inequality exceeds national rates. But their roles in regressive criminal justice policy have not significantly impacted their campaigns. This does not mean Harris deserves a revisionist history as a progressive champion because she\u2019s enduring a systemically racist system. It does not mean she gets a pass for frequently conservative positions among the Democratic field. Rather, none of them should. As a woman who is also black and professional, there was an expectation to support Kamala. I don\u2019t confuse her sorority call with random \u201cscreeching\u201d, having had Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority members and HBCU alums ever-present in my life. I have witnessed close black female friends make it into the big law halls of Paul Weiss, the host for the high-dollar fundraiser that she cancelled upon retiring her presidential campaign.

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, invaded Syrian territory which was being defended by three other Nato allies \u2013 the United States, Great Britain and France.

But the EU faces serious challenges, from Brexit to democratic erosion in member states like Hungary and Poland. Nato\u2019s future cannot be divorced from the future of the European project \u2013 keeping the continent united and free. For Europeans, that means not taking for granted what they\u2019ve built in the EU. For the United States, that means building a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the EU, as my Center for American Progress colleague Max Bergmann <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2019/10/31/476483/embrace-the-union/\">suggests</a>.</p> <p>Third, Nato must have the right Russia strategy.

Drivers would presumably repay these debts by, well, driving for Uber. The program, versions of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/28/uber-announces-deeper-push-into-financial-services-with-uber-money.html\">which have already been rolled out in India, Brazil</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/28/uber-announces-deeper-push-into-financial-services-with-uber-money.html\"> and Peru</a>, has not yet been launched in the US, and Uber has declined to discuss its details in the press. But the loans are clearly part of a broader push the company is making, through its new <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/newsroom/introducing-uber-money/\">Uber Money subsidiary</a>, into giving drivers access to financial products such as bank accounts and credit cards.</p> <p>Access, however, tends to come at a price. We don\u2019t yet know anything about the terms of Uber\u2019s loans. But given the company\u2019s business model, the extreme financial pressures it is facing, and its history of exploiting workers, we should fear the possibility that its loan program will create a cruel new form of digital peonage. Peonage, which was used as a replacement for outright slavery in the post-civil-war American south, is a system of economic exploitation in which workers are compelled to work to pay off debts to their employers. Uber\u2019s update to this system may be delivered via smartphone, but as the California state assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LorenaSGonzalez/status/1169741774408929280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1169741774408929280&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2019%2F9%2F6%2F20853357%2Fuber-driver-direct-loans-payday-small-lorena-gonzalez-ab5\">tweeted</a>, it could still be \u201cf*cking feudalism\u201d.</p> <h2>Preyed upon by Uber in the past</h2> <p>Aslam, a full-time Uber driver, is one of the workers who received Uber\u2019s notification about the loan program. His initial response was relief: as a new refugee to the US, he has had trouble securing loans, and to support his family of five, he frequently needs more money than he can make driving 60 hours a week. A small loan obtained effortlessly through his Uber app could help him make ends meet without the shame of having to ask family and friends.</p> <p>The more he thought about it, though, the more Aslam was troubled by the loan offer. He had been preyed upon by Uber\u2019s financial products in the past: after buying a car through Uber\u2019s vehicle financing program, he had watched with mounting anxiety as Uber\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674970847\">inscrutable black box algorithms</a> whittled away at his effective hourly wage, making it almost impossible to repay his auto loan. And he wasn\u2019t alone. Just last year, Uber was fined <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/uber-agrees-pay-20-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-recruited\">$20</a><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/uber-agrees-pay-20-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-recruited\">m</a><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/uber-agrees-pay-20-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-recruited\"> by the Federal Trade Commission for misleading drivers</a> about its vehicle financing programs. Like Aslam, most drivers earned significantly less than the company promised, and many received higher interest rates on their car loans and leases than they should have.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The program also has the potential to drag drivers into a new, highly predatory financial system</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The only reason Aslam is still driving for Uber, despite low earnings, long hours and high stress, is because he owes money on his vehicle. Each week, Aslam\u2019s car payment is automatically deducted by Uber from his income. Sometimes late at night, when he\u2019s desperate to stop working, he calculates how much of his income will be left after accounting for this deduction \u2013 and then forces himself to keep driving.</p> <p>Uber Money claims it is driven by a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/28/uber-announces-deeper-push-into-financial-services-with-uber-money.html\">\u201cmission of giving people access to the type of financial services they were excluded from</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/28/uber-announces-deeper-push-into-financial-services-with-uber-money.html\">\u201d</a>, and indeed, this payday loan program, alongside their debit and credit cards, are targeted at those, like Aslam, who are most economically disenfranchised. But rather than extend wealth and opportunity, access to payday loans and credit cards often represents what sociologists have called <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2329496516686620?journalCode=scua\">predatory inclusion</a> \u2013 bringing historically marginalized groups into the economic system in ways that recreate and entrench existing inequalities.</p> <p>While it\u2019s true that Uber\u2019s loan service will be offered to people otherwise shut out of the banking system, depending on how it is structured, the program also has the potential to drag drivers into a new, highly predatory financial system. Although we don\u2019t yet know what interest rates the company will charge, Uber\u2019s business model gives it the incentive, and the means, to use the loans to trap drivers in debt and keep them behind the wheel.</p> <h2>Maintaining coercive control</h2> <p>How would a potentially predatory system fit into Uber\u2019s larger goals? Since the company went public in May, its <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-stocks/flood-of-trades-sends-uber-to-record-low-as-insiders-allowed-to-sell-idUSKBN1XG24W\">stock has dropped precipitously</a>. Meanwhile, it continues to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/technology/uber-earnings-loss.html\">hemorrhage money</a>, losing more than $5.2bn in just the second quarter of this year. In order to increase its value and eventually turn a profit, the company has to push drivers to make the company more money by working longer and for less. It would almost certainly be easier to force drivers to do this if they owed a debt to Uber. Such digital <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/tpt/slavery-by-another-name/themes/peonage/\">peonage</a> could be made much more exploitative by the company\u2019s use of data to determine ride prices and driver earnings. For example Uber could reduce the per-ride earnings of indebted drivers so that they have to drive even more hours to pay back what they owe.</p> <p>Perversely, a program that forces people to work more hours for fewer dollars could also help Uber retain drivers \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/20/only-4-percent-of-uber-drivers-remain-after-a-year-says-report.html\">something that the company has struggled to do</a> but that is crucial to its long-term profitability. If the company designs their financial offerings so that drivers must continue to work for Uber in order to pay off their Uber debts or to maintain access to their Uber bank accounts, the company could lock workers in. If the only way you can have a bank account is to drive for Uber, then you might just continue to drive for the company even if you want to stop.</p> <p>Finally, in California and a growing number of other states, <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/AB5-gig-work-bill-All-your-questions-answered-14441764.php\">a new legal test</a> has redefined who is a legal employee and therefore entitled to basic benefits like the minimum wage and overtime protections. The more Uber diversifies its earnings away from transportation services alone \u2013 the more it is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20884800/uber-app-announcement-ubereats-safety-transit-updates\">\u201can operating system for your life\u201d</a> and not a taxi company with an app \u2013 the more likely its workers will be considered independent contractors, who aren\u2019t owed any such benefits.</p> <p>At the same time, though, Uber\u2019s payday loans could help the company maintain coercive control over its supposedly independent workforce. With data on how much drivers must earn to survive, Uber can personalize interest, calibrate exactly how long a driver must work to pay that interest, and push him to \u2013 and perhaps past \u2013 his limits.

Now she is embroiled in a fight against Republicans in the state that is being watched across the country. Flaherty and a fellow student are challenging a Republican-backed law that is making it harder for many out-of-state students and other temporary residents to cast a ballot in a state with outsized national influence. The lawsuit has been endorsed by the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic presidential hopefuls. But last week, Flaherty and her colleague Caroline Casey hit another obstacle when the US district judge Joseph LaPlante denied a request to block the law just months before the primary elections. New Hampshire is a small swing state where both local and state-wide races can be decided by razor-thin margins. Donald Trump lost the state to Hillary Clinton by just 2,736 votes in 2016. The same year, Maggie Hassan, also a Democrat, defeated Kelly Ayotte for a Senate seat by just 1,017 votes. The Democratic primary in February and general election in November are expected to be closely fought. Republicans in the state have complained about college students voting before. \u201cThey are kids voting liberal, voting their feelings, with no life experience,\u201d William O\u2019Brien, a Republican and then the New Hampshire house speaker, said in 2011. There are nationwide efforts to restrict the surging student vote, but the party says the new law is merely intended to bring New Hampshire in line with other states. The law, which went into effect on 1 July, mandates that anyone who has registered to vote and intends to drive while living in the state must obtain a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license and register their vehicle within 60 days of signing up. The ACLU of New Hampshire, which is bringing the suit, contends that in fact many states allow out-of-state students and other transient people, such as military personnel, to vote and exempts them from the requirement to get an in-state license, said the ACLU lawyer Gilles Bissonnette.

      "body": "<p>Parents at a public school district in Maryland have won a major victory for student privacy: tech companies that work with the school district now have to purge the data they have collected on students once a year. Experts say the district\u2019s \u201cData Deletion Week\u201d may be the first of its kind in the country.</p> <p>It\u2019s not exactly an accident that schools in Montgomery county, in the suburbs of Washington DC, are leading the way on privacy protections for kids. The large school district is near the headquarters of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. It\u2019s a place where many federal employees, lawyers and security experts send their own kids.</p> <p>As digital surveillance of American students expands rapidly in schools across the country, sparking new debates over tradeoffs between privacy and safety, Montgomery county is a revealing example of what protections some of the nation\u2019s most well-informed, privacy-savvy parents think their children need.</p> <p>Like thousands of American public school districts, Montgomery county gives students laptops and has hired tech companies to track students\u2019 activities on those computers, including monitoring what they search for and what websites they visit.</p> <p>This digital surveillance \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/school-student-surveillance-bark-gaggle\">booming industry</a> \u2013 is marketed as a way to keep kids safe from school shootings and self-harm. It also generates detailed data on individual children. Montgomery county parents fear that data might someday be used against their kids.</p> <p>This is not a distant worry. Teenagers are already facing consequences for private behavior online. In 2017, Harvard <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/\">rescinded the admissions of at least </a><a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/\">10 incoming students</a> for sharing racist and obscene jokes in a private Facebook group chat. This year, Harvard <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/6/18/parkland-student-rescinded-harvard-2023/\">rescinded an offer of admission</a> to Kyle Kashuv, a conservative activist from Parkland, Florida, because of <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/6/18/parkland-student-rescinded-harvard-2023/\">racist comments he had made</a> in text messages and a shared Google Doc as a 16-year-old, a decision that sparked a heated national debate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/02/school-surveillance-us-schools-safety-shootings\">Clear backpacks, monitored emails: life for US students under constant surveillance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Parents across the US told the Guardian that they were afraid about having detailed educational data about their children \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/02/school-surveillance-us-schools-safety-shootings\">how quickly they complete their homework</a> \u2013 being fed into the enormous black box of the data mining industry. Companies have long gathered, traded and sold vast quantities of data on individuals\u2019 online behavior and consumer purchases, information that is also combined with public voter data and used to create targeted political advertising. Individuals have little way to know how their data is shared from one company to another, and no power to prevent giant, frequent data breaches.</p> <p>By requiring tech companies to delete data they collect on schoolchildren once a year, parent activists in Montgomery county said they hope to shield kids from being held accountable in adulthood for youthful mistakes, as well as to guard them from exploitation by what one parent termed \u201cthe student data surveillance industrial complex\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t want any of this stuff hanging out and then being used against kids when they apply to college</p> <footer> <cite>Bradley Shear, attorney and parent</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Montgomery county public schools tested Data Deletion Week last year and <a href=\"https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/schools/mcps-student-data-deletion-week-begins-monday/\">publicly launched the program</a> this past August.</p> <p>While not all student data is deleted that week, the district works to clean much of students\u2019 digital slates over the summer, including data collected by Google and by GoGuardian, which tracks students\u2019 web searches, according to Peter Cevenini, the district\u2019s chief technology officer.</p> <p>The district demands more than a vague assurance from tech companies that the data has been erased: \u201cThey send us a certification that officially confirms legally that the information has been deleted from their servers,\u201d Cevenini said.</p> <p>GoGuardian has already submitted its formal certification; the district is still waiting for formal certification from Google, Cevenini said.</p> <p>One of the parent leaders of the Data Deletion Week campaign was Bradley Shear, an attorney who specializes in social media and privacy policy. Shear said he was attending a conference for privacy law scholars in Washington a few years ago when he received a phone call from his son\u2019s teacher informing him that the second-grader was in trouble for having Googled the song Fuck You, by CeeLo Green, on his school laptop.</p> <p>Shear said he was certain that his son had not searched for the song on purpose, and that the auto-complete function in Google search was to blame. But the incident prompted him to try to make sure that GoGuardian, which the school pays to monitor students\u2019 search and website visits, would delete the data it had collected on his son.</p> <p>The response he eventually got from the tech company in 2017, a pledge to delete or \u201cde-identify\u201d his child\u2019s data, was not enough for Shear.

      "bodyText": "Parents at a public school district in Maryland have won a major victory for student privacy: tech companies that work with the school district now have to purge the data they have collected on students once a year. Experts say the district\u2019s \u201cData Deletion Week\u201d may be the first of its kind in the country. It\u2019s not exactly an accident that schools in Montgomery county, in the suburbs of Washington DC, are leading the way on privacy protections for kids. The large school district is near the headquarters of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. It\u2019s a place where many federal employees, lawyers and security experts send their own kids. As digital surveillance of American students expands rapidly in schools across the country, sparking new debates over tradeoffs between privacy and safety, Montgomery county is a revealing example of what protections some of the nation\u2019s most well-informed, privacy-savvy parents think their children need. Like thousands of American public school districts, Montgomery county gives students laptops and has hired tech companies to track students\u2019 activities on those computers, including monitoring what they search for and what websites they visit. This digital surveillance \u2013 a booming industry \u2013 is marketed as a way to keep kids safe from school shootings and self-harm. It also generates detailed data on individual children. Montgomery county parents fear that data might someday be used against their kids. This is not a distant worry. Teenagers are already facing consequences for private behavior online. In 2017, Harvard rescinded the admissions of at least 10 incoming students for sharing racist and obscene jokes in a private Facebook group chat. This year, Harvard rescinded an offer of admission to Kyle Kashuv, a conservative activist from Parkland, Florida, because of racist comments he had made in text messages and a shared Google Doc as a 16-year-old, a decision that sparked a heated national debate. Parents across the US told the Guardian that they were afraid about having detailed educational data about their children \u2013 like how quickly they complete their homework \u2013 being fed into the enormous black box of the data mining industry. Companies have long gathered, traded and sold vast quantities of data on individuals\u2019 online behavior and consumer purchases, information that is also combined with public voter data and used to create targeted political advertising. Individuals have little way to know how their data is shared from one company to another, and no power to prevent giant, frequent data breaches. By requiring tech companies to delete data they collect on schoolchildren once a year, parent activists in Montgomery county said they hope to shield kids from being held accountable in adulthood for youthful mistakes, as well as to guard them from exploitation by what one parent termed \u201cthe student data surveillance industrial complex\u201d. Montgomery county public schools tested Data Deletion Week last year and publicly launched the program this past August. While not all student data is deleted that week, the district works to clean much of students\u2019 digital slates over the summer, including data collected by Google and by GoGuardian, which tracks students\u2019 web searches, according to Peter Cevenini, the district\u2019s chief technology officer. The district demands more than a vague assurance from tech companies that the data has been erased: \u201cThey send us a certification that officially confirms legally that the information has been deleted from their servers,\u201d Cevenini said. GoGuardian has already submitted its formal certification; the district is still waiting for formal certification from Google, Cevenini said. One of the parent leaders of the Data Deletion Week campaign was Bradley Shear, an attorney who specializes in social media and privacy policy. Shear said he was attending a conference for privacy law scholars in Washington a few years ago when he received a phone call from his son\u2019s teacher informing him that the second-grader was in trouble for having Googled the song Fuck You, by CeeLo Green, on his school laptop. Shear said he was certain that his son had not searched for the song on purpose, and that the auto-complete function in Google search was to blame. But the incident prompted him to try to make sure that GoGuardian, which the school pays to monitor students\u2019 search and website visits, would delete the data it had collected on his son. The response he eventually got from the tech company in 2017, a pledge to delete or \u201cde-identify\u201d his child\u2019s data, was not enough for Shear. As a policy expert who had worked to pass social media privacy laws in states across the country, Shear said, he knew that \u201cde-identified\u201d data could usually be re-identified again. He decided to push for district-wide changes in how GoGuardian and other companies retain children\u2019s data, including working to educate and organize other parents to push the school district to change its policies and require tech companies to regularly delete student data. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to keep for ever what these kids are searching for online, or what\u2019s in their Gchats,\u201d Shear said. \u201cEven when data is supposed to only be used for one purpose, it will be used for other purposes,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any of this stuff hanging out and then being used against kids when they apply to college.\u201d Shear met with district officials to discuss his concerns, and he soon found allies on the district\u2019s active parent-teacher association, which has an entire committee dedicated to \u201csafe technology\u201d issues. One parent on the safe tech committee, who asked that her name not be used to protect her son\u2019s privacy, had an experience similar to Shear\u2019s. She said her then eight-year-old son typed in \u201csave the land\u201d when doing a book report on conservation, \u201cand up came the Ku Klux Klan \u2026 \u2018Save the land, join the Klan.\u2019 He didn\u2019t know what that was,\u201d she said. When she talked to the teacher and suggested wiping the search from her son\u2019s browser history, the teacher said that would not be possible, the parent recalled. If anyone was building a digital footprint of her son\u2019s behavior, the parent said, there would now be a visit to a Klan site in it. \u201cKids are curious. They\u2019re just going to plug in some key words thinking that they\u2019re funny, and it just might stick,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my child to do whatever he wants to do with his career and his life,\u201d said Ellen Zavian, a George Washington University law professor and another of the parent advocates. \u201cIf he wants to run for office, something he did in second grade shouldn\u2019t hold him back. If he wants to apply for college, he should have no data that the colleges have bought that would provide a negative data point. \u201cMy goal is to have my son have the smallest [data] footprint to give him the largest opportunity,\u201d she said. Not a simple process Even with broad parental support, demanding that companies delete student data was not a simple process, Shear said. Parents had to work with the school district to understand what the district had agreed to in its contracts with different technology companies, and to figure out if the contract language needed to be changed. The parents also wanted tech companies not simply to say they had deleted student data, but to certify that they had done so in an official letter to the district. \u201cIt was a complicated process,\u201d Shear said. \u201cIt was not something that was so simple.\u201d While parent fears over student data and privacy are \u201cnewer concerns\u201d for school districts, the pushback that the district heard from a few parent activists also amounted to \u201ckind of universal concerns\u201d, and school officials decided to \u201cget ahead of the game and see how we can address them\u201d, Cevenini, the district\u2019s chief technology officer, said. Amelia Vance, the director of education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum, said that, as far as she is aware, Montgomery county is the only American school district to have implemented an annual Data Deletion Week, although parent activists across the country have pushed for other student privacy laws at the state level. Deleting records of students\u2019 online behavior on a regular basis is a \u201cfabulous\u201d choice, Vance said, but doing it just once a year might not be frequent enough. Video surveillance footage is often deleted once a month, just long enough to be clear if there\u2019s an incident that needs to be reviewed, she said, and a similar 30-day time period might also be appropriate for students\u2019 online behavior. While there are good reasons for schools to monitor students\u2019 internet usage \u2013 like making sure that \u201cstudents aren\u2019t being radicalized on YouTube\u201d or \u201cviewing totally inappropriate content\u201d, Vance said, that monitoring can also be \u201cincredibly invasive\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a reflection of every aspect of kids\u2019 lives today,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is every question they ask in their brain and type into Google to see if there\u2019s an answer. It\u2019s every chat message that they type to their friends, every essay they write for English class.\u201d But school districts also may face some barriers in developing Data Deletion Week policies, she said, including different state data retention laws, and parents\u2019 and students\u2019 desire to be able to save some of their school projects from frequent data purges. Shear, the attorney who led the push for Data Deletion Week, said he sees the rapid growth of the school surveillance industry as a \u201chuge issue\u201d and one that needed much more attention from students and their families. \u201cMost parents don\u2019t understand these issues until something happens,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really care about something until you\u2019re discriminated against, or until you lose out to another person based on something you might never even have thought of.\u201d The Montgomery county parent activists acknowledged that their push to change their district\u2019s policies benefited from the expertise of the Washington-area parents involved, which included not only attorneys but people with expertise in security, privacy and politics. Having that kind of expertise behind a parent privacy campaign \u201cis unusual\u201d, Zavian said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean that other communities can\u2019t pull on those resources.

The idea of it is simple: bring university students and prison-based students in a classroom to share experiences and learning. Courses have ranged from criminology, to literary criticism, to philosophy and theology. At the heart of every course is a belief that you can\u2019t learn everything from books, that experience is a form of expertise, and that in sharing and understanding the experiences of all we can find fresh insight.</p> <p>I was a student in the Law, Justice, and Society course at HM prison Grendon in 2018-2019. From practising lawyers, lecturers, and judges, we learned about how the law works in practice, the role of race and class in law, and how the law can be changed. But as I grapple with Jack and Saskia\u2019s deaths, I have returned to Nobody Cares, a published poetry anthology resulting from a Learning Together course on creative writing held at Whitemoor prison. In it Ricardo, a poet living at Whitemoor, writes of \u201caccepting / that together we learn and that by learning together we will prosper and / overcome\u201d. This captures the project\u2019s spirit.</p> <p>It would be wrong to make all this sound too sombre. The classes were often hilarious, full of larger-than-life characters giving short shrift to over-academic explanations of \u201cstuff that is obvious\u201d. Once, after struggling to grapple with the complexities of an electric tea urn, I was castigated for my failure to enrol for a degree in basic common sense.</p> <p>In particular, Learning Together taught me to resist easy binaries of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d people, a division that can be encouraged by the media. People in prisons may have done terrible things \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t capable of bringing good into the world. Behind the stories of my classmates were often tales of neglect and institutional failure, making it impossible not to reflect on the circumstances that had contributed to our radically different lives. The discussions also reminded me that people who aren\u2019t in prison have made mistakes too, sometimes major ones, and often it\u2019s chance or our privilege that have kept those people out of prison and on a different path.</p> <p>This is not to overlook or minimise my classmates\u2019 crimes or the impact on their victims. It is, however, to suggest a shared responsibility to advocate for a justice system that sees the good in people whom some may wish to cast out as being irredeemably bad.</p> <p>At the core of Learning Together is a message of mutual interdependence \u2013 how, by learning together, we become enmeshed in others\u2019 futures in ways that can drive positive change. The students at Grendon often remarked on how the project had given them a newfound capacity to build and sustain meaningful relationships. It made many of us see ourselves differently. At our end of course celebration, one student shared that: \u201cI never believed that I could have conversations with people from a university. I\u2019ve shown myself and my family that I can.\u201d</p> <p>At the same event, founders Amy and Ruth spoke about a \u201cpolitics of love\u201d that underpins the Learning Together project. Rather than romantic love, I take this to mean what James Baldwin describes as a \u201cstate of being\u201d that recognises the inherent worth and dignity of all. In a prison context in which people are defined by, and reminded constantly of, the worst things they\u2019ve ever done this is a radical sentiment. It is no coincidence that it was Learning Together alumni who put themselves in danger to confront Khan. They were defending a community in which they were genuinely valued.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/03/london-bridge-attack-2019-not-stop-work-prisoners-tackle-terrrorism\">The London Bridge attack must not stop our vital work to tackle terrorism | Pen Mendon\u00e7a</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is all too easy to jump to the rhetoric of \u201ctough on crime\u201d in the aftermath of such a tragedy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/03/tory-london-bridge-jack-merritt-saskia-jones-rehabilitation\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson has been especially quick to do that</a>.

This would require not only more funding for rehabilitative programmes (although that is sorely needed), but also a broader commitment to seeing incarcerated people as more than their worst actions.</p> <p>Longer prison sentences may soothe immediate, understandable feelings of fear and anger, but that\u2019s only temporary. The better way to go would be to recognise Friday\u2019s attack as one targeting hope.

      "bodyText": "For those of us involved with the Learning Together community, the deaths of our friends and colleagues Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones have been hard to bear. This has been made even harder by our sense that \u2013 amid the cynical politicking, against the wishes of Jack\u2019s family \u2013 the values that Learning Together stands for are being overlooked. Friday\u2019s attack was reported as an incident of indiscriminate terrorism. But it was perpetrated at a Learning Together conference. The victims worked for Learning Together. It was an assault on the whole idea of prisoner rehabilitation \u2013 an attack on education, and the hope for self-betterment that it inspires. Kneejerk calls to \u201clock them up and throw away the key\u201d by rightwing newspapers and politicians end up reinforcing one of the aims of Usman Khan\u2019s violence. Formed in 2014, Learning Together has since grown to involve 600 university and prison students during this year alone. The idea of it is simple: bring university students and prison-based students in a classroom to share experiences and learning. Courses have ranged from criminology, to literary criticism, to philosophy and theology. At the heart of every course is a belief that you can\u2019t learn everything from books, that experience is a form of expertise, and that in sharing and understanding the experiences of all we can find fresh insight. I was a student in the Law, Justice, and Society course at HM prison Grendon in 2018-2019. From practising lawyers, lecturers, and judges, we learned about how the law works in practice, the role of race and class in law, and how the law can be changed. But as I grapple with Jack and Saskia\u2019s deaths, I have returned to Nobody Cares, a published poetry anthology resulting from a Learning Together course on creative writing held at Whitemoor prison. In it Ricardo, a poet living at Whitemoor, writes of \u201caccepting / that together we learn and that by learning together we will prosper and / overcome\u201d. This captures the project\u2019s spirit. It would be wrong to make all this sound too sombre. The classes were often hilarious, full of larger-than-life characters giving short shrift to over-academic explanations of \u201cstuff that is obvious\u201d. Once, after struggling to grapple with the complexities of an electric tea urn, I was castigated for my failure to enrol for a degree in basic common sense. In particular, Learning Together taught me to resist easy binaries of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d people, a division that can be encouraged by the media. People in prisons may have done terrible things \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t capable of bringing good into the world. Behind the stories of my classmates were often tales of neglect and institutional failure, making it impossible not to reflect on the circumstances that had contributed to our radically different lives. The discussions also reminded me that people who aren\u2019t in prison have made mistakes too, sometimes major ones, and often it\u2019s chance or our privilege that have kept those people out of prison and on a different path. This is not to overlook or minimise my classmates\u2019 crimes or the impact on their victims. It is, however, to suggest a shared responsibility to advocate for a justice system that sees the good in people whom some may wish to cast out as being irredeemably bad. At the core of Learning Together is a message of mutual interdependence \u2013 how, by learning together, we become enmeshed in others\u2019 futures in ways that can drive positive change. The students at Grendon often remarked on how the project had given them a newfound capacity to build and sustain meaningful relationships. It made many of us see ourselves differently. At our end of course celebration, one student shared that: \u201cI never believed that I could have conversations with people from a university. I\u2019ve shown myself and my family that I can.\u201d At the same event, founders Amy and Ruth spoke about a \u201cpolitics of love\u201d that underpins the Learning Together project. Rather than romantic love, I take this to mean what James Baldwin describes as a \u201cstate of being\u201d that recognises the inherent worth and dignity of all. In a prison context in which people are defined by, and reminded constantly of, the worst things they\u2019ve ever done this is a radical sentiment. It is no coincidence that it was Learning Together alumni who put themselves in danger to confront Khan. They were defending a community in which they were genuinely valued. It is all too easy to jump to the rhetoric of \u201ctough on crime\u201d in the aftermath of such a tragedy. Boris Johnson has been especially quick to do that. But a more considered approach \u2013 an approach that also honours Jack and Saskia \u2013 would be to think about how Learning Together\u2019s values could inform the justice system as a whole. This would require not only more funding for rehabilitative programmes (although that is sorely needed), but also a broader commitment to seeing incarcerated people as more than their worst actions. Longer prison sentences may soothe immediate, understandable feelings of fear and anger, but that\u2019s only temporary. The better way to go would be to recognise Friday\u2019s attack as one targeting hope. And it is hope \u2013 that projects like Learning Together engender \u2013 that we must do our utmost to preserve. \u2022 Jake Thorold is a university student who participated in the Learning Together programme",

But it was just five years ago that the 18-year-old had only ever had home schooling. At the time that was her only option, as conflict raged outside near the contentious border between Pakistan and Afghanistan where she lived. Since then Muhibzada has transitioned from a young refugee waiting to travel to the US to a college-bound teenager at a high school in Cleveland, Ohio. Helping her on that journey has been a not-for-profit, Refugee Response, which creates programs to address the needs of the 2,500 refugees who have settled in the city since 2008, and is one of 25 organizations the Guardian is highlighting in its City Champions project. Nationally, Donald Trump\u2019s administration has cut the refugee program to admit the fewest number of people in its nearly 40-year history, with a ceiling of 18,000 people announced for the coming year. Refugee officers, resettlement groups and advocates say the government has effectively stopped the program and, in October, not a single refugee was resettled in the US. But, while the administration\u2019s drastic cuts to the refugee program have caused dozens of resettlement offices to close down, because Refugee Response is not directly tied to the government\u2019s resettlement program, it has doubled in size in the past two years. \u201cI think it\u2019s a testament to the work our teams do and the need for it in the community,\u201d said Patrick Kearns, Refugee Response\u2019s executive director.

Pat Lam has done remarkably well at Bristol but Kidney came out on top on Sunday with a coaching masterclass.</p> <p>The World Cup showed the difference high-calibre coaches make. Premier League football is going through one of its more frequently recurring phases where a few matches without a victory means questions are asked about a manager\u2019s future, never mind that the riches enjoyed by that league mean even the smallest club have the means to assemble a talented, competitive squad.</p> <p>An unsuccessful streak is seen as evidence the players at that club are not good enough, but as Carwyn James observed before taking the 1971 Lions to New Zealand, where they were expected to come a distant second to the All Blacks, the successful coach makes his players believe they are better than they are. The reverse tends to be true at struggling sides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"634ca2e2bdf28f2bed663ac9d54a2629372092c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/634ca2e2bdf28f2bed663ac9d54a2629372092c1/0_58_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Declan Kidney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Declan Kidney produced a coaching masterclass in London Irish\u2019s draw with Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dennis Goodwin/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leicester, after staring relegation in the face last season, should be wondering why they, and not Northampton, did not make a move for Chris Boyd, who coached the Hurricanes to the 2016 Super Rugby title. The New Zealander arrived in England just before the start of last season at the club that had been, in playing terms, the Premiership\u2019s most conservative and risk-averse.</p> <p>Seeking contact rather than space had brought them success earlier in the decade, but that had long faded and they were muddling along in the bottom half before approaching a coach who encouraged players to look for space and play with their heads up. It took a while for players to acclimatise to the winds of change and when the Saints were beaten by Leicester at Twickenham 14 months ago, it was their 16th defeat in 22 Premiership matches: relegation form.</p> <p>They have won seven of their last nine and, if Boyd himself says there is still a way to go and Saturday\u2019s Champions Cup match at home to Leinster should reveal how far, they are far removed from the highly structured automatons that he inherited. Bath are another who should take note, a club not short on ability that play by numbers on a bog of a pitch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/03/warren-gatland-premiership-final-lions-2021-south-africa\">Warren Gatland wants Premiership final moved to accommodate Lions in 2021</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unless Irish or Worcester collapse a giant will go down. If the table reads the same with five rounds to go as it does now, they will be twitching in boardrooms. If it is hard to see anyone advocating ring-fencing to prevent Saracens from dropping into the Championship, although clubs who told Saracens to accept their punishment and not appeal should now take their own advice and regard that matter as closed while Premiership Rugby polices this season\u2019s cap, Leicester, and their army of fans, going down would be another matter. The cost would be felt by everyone.</p> <p>Do Leicester, a club whose slow, steady decline became precipitous because problems were not addressed, deserve saving? This could be the most enthralling, ghoulish relegation battle yet, an attraction the Pro14 lacks. In France, Stade Fran\u00e7ais are bottom of the pile in the Top 14, the grandees laid low; with the recent investment into the game something could be done about bolstering the Championship to better prepare teams for promotion.</p> <p>Bristol could have gone back to the top of the table last Sunday on points difference from Northampton. Lam still has work to do but he was an inspired appointment. What separates the top from the bottom (taking out Saracens) is coaching: the right appointment provides a better return than any marquee player.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><em>This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-breakdown\" title=\"\"><strong><em>To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions</em></strong></a>.</p> <p></p>",

Premier League football is going through one of its more frequently recurring phases where a few matches without a victory means questions are asked about a manager\u2019s future, never mind that the riches enjoyed by that league mean even the smallest club have the means to assemble a talented, competitive squad. An unsuccessful streak is seen as evidence the players at that club are not good enough, but as Carwyn James observed before taking the 1971 Lions to New Zealand, where they were expected to come a distant second to the All Blacks, the successful coach makes his players believe they are better than they are. The reverse tends to be true at struggling sides. Leicester, after staring relegation in the face last season, should be wondering why they, and not Northampton, did not make a move for Chris Boyd, who coached the Hurricanes to the 2016 Super Rugby title. The New Zealander arrived in England just before the start of last season at the club that had been, in playing terms, the Premiership\u2019s most conservative and risk-averse. Seeking contact rather than space had brought them success earlier in the decade, but that had long faded and they were muddling along in the bottom half before approaching a coach who encouraged players to look for space and play with their heads up. It took a while for players to acclimatise to the winds of change and when the Saints were beaten by Leicester at Twickenham 14 months ago, it was their 16th defeat in 22 Premiership matches: relegation form. They have won seven of their last nine and, if Boyd himself says there is still a way to go and Saturday\u2019s Champions Cup match at home to Leinster should reveal how far, they are far removed from the highly structured automatons that he inherited. Bath are another who should take note, a club not short on ability that play by numbers on a bog of a pitch. Unless Irish or Worcester collapse a giant will go down. If the table reads the same with five rounds to go as it does now, they will be twitching in boardrooms. If it is hard to see anyone advocating ring-fencing to prevent Saracens from dropping into the Championship, although clubs who told Saracens to accept their punishment and not appeal should now take their own advice and regard that matter as closed while Premiership Rugby polices this season\u2019s cap, Leicester, and their army of fans, going down would be another matter. The cost would be felt by everyone. Do Leicester, a club whose slow, steady decline became precipitous because problems were not addressed, deserve saving? This could be the most enthralling, ghoulish relegation battle yet, an attraction the Pro14 lacks. In France, Stade Fran\u00e7ais are bottom of the pile in the Top 14, the grandees laid low; with the recent investment into the game something could be done about bolstering the Championship to better prepare teams for promotion. Bristol could have gone back to the top of the table last Sunday on points difference from Northampton. Lam still has work to do but he was an inspired appointment. What separates the top from the bottom (taking out Saracens) is coaching: the right appointment provides a better return than any marquee player. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Doctors told him it would not respond to treatment and they would need to amputate.</p> <p>\u201cI thought about suicide several times,\u201d says Nasser, 28, a former blacksmith. \u201cI was wishing the Israeli soldier [who shot me] had killed me with the bullet.\u201d</p> <p>Nasser refused to consent to amputation and is now on his second round of a six-week course of Vancomycin, a last-resort antibiotic for fighting MRSA.</p> <p>Infection rates are high in conflict zones, where bullets or other debris often pierce the skin and treatment is delayed or inadequate. Now, doctors from M\u00e9decins San Fronti\u00e8res face a further complication to recovery rates: \u201chorrifying levels\u201d of antibiotic resistance in its trauma clinics across the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cThere are patients from Iraq, Yemen, Palestine and Syria where they have had acute injury as a result of conflict and they have had inadequate follow-up,\u201d says Clair Mills, one of MSF\u2019s medical directors. \u201cThese are patients with fractures that have never healed, or with chronic nerve injuries from burns.

Of those with infections, 62% have multi-resistant organisms like MRSA.</p> <p>Such infections further complicate the treatment of complex fractures. Patients must be isolated, which takes a huge psychological toll.</p> <p>Dr Mohammed Abu Mughaiseeb, of MSF in Gaza, says: \u201cInfections of the bone are very difficult. The micro-organism is embedded within the bone. These patients will have to have three to five surgeries over three years to fix the injury. Many of them need to be isolated in a special room with special precautions for patients and for workers.</p> <p>\u201cIf patients are not treated properly, they could end up with amputation. It is a very sensitive topic.\u201d</p> <p>No one can enter the isolation unit of al-Awda hospital without wearing scrubs. Nasser\u2019s room has two beds and a TV. One of the beds is for visitors but he hasn\u2019t had any, he says. The injury has taken a toll on his relationships as well as his earnings. He now receives a small amount from a Qatari charity, which has been helping those injured during the protests.</p> <p>\u201cI feel pain all the time, the pain doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d says Nasser. \u201cI went through a difficult time psychologically as a result of the injury. My relationship with my family is bad. I thought about suicide many times. I was depressed. I went to the border many times and got close to the fence, but I wasn\u2019t shot.\u201d</p> <p>Before coming to the trauma clinic, Nasser spent nine weeks in intensive care at a health ministry hospital.

      "bodyText": "When Jihad Nasser arrived at al-Awda trauma clinic in Gaza, he was hoping doctors could finally stop his pain. A gunshot wound in his right leg had not been not healing properly. The news, however, was bad. The complex bone fracture he had suffered was badly infected with MRSA. Doctors told him it would not respond to treatment and they would need to amputate. \u201cI thought about suicide several times,\u201d says Nasser, 28, a former blacksmith. \u201cI was wishing the Israeli soldier [who shot me] had killed me with the bullet.\u201d Nasser refused to consent to amputation and is now on his second round of a six-week course of Vancomycin, a last-resort antibiotic for fighting MRSA. Infection rates are high in conflict zones, where bullets or other debris often pierce the skin and treatment is delayed or inadequate. Now, doctors from M\u00e9decins San Fronti\u00e8res face a further complication to recovery rates: \u201chorrifying levels\u201d of antibiotic resistance in its trauma clinics across the Middle East. \u201cThere are patients from Iraq, Yemen, Palestine and Syria where they have had acute injury as a result of conflict and they have had inadequate follow-up,\u201d says Clair Mills, one of MSF\u2019s medical directors. \u201cThese are patients with fractures that have never healed, or with chronic nerve injuries from burns. Where people have injuries to bone, the majority are coming in with antibiotic-resistant organisms.\u201d In Gaza, the number of Palestinians shot by Israeli forces in clashes at the border since protests began on 30 March 2018 has declined significantly since May, when 6,000 people were killed or injured. Last year, MSF tripled its capacity in Gaza because it was believed that most patients might be suffering from multi-resistant organisms like MRSA.Until April, however, doctors lacked the specialised labs to test their theory. Since then, bone and tissue biopsies have shown that 83% of patients seen by MSF in Gaza have infections. Of those with infections, 62% have multi-resistant organisms like MRSA. Such infections further complicate the treatment of complex fractures. Patients must be isolated, which takes a huge psychological toll. Dr Mohammed Abu Mughaiseeb, of MSF in Gaza, says: \u201cInfections of the bone are very difficult. The micro-organism is embedded within the bone. These patients will have to have three to five surgeries over three years to fix the injury. Many of them need to be isolated in a special room with special precautions for patients and for workers. \u201cIf patients are not treated properly, they could end up with amputation. It is a very sensitive topic.\u201d No one can enter the isolation unit of al-Awda hospital without wearing scrubs. Nasser\u2019s room has two beds and a TV. One of the beds is for visitors but he hasn\u2019t had any, he says. The injury has taken a toll on his relationships as well as his earnings. He now receives a small amount from a Qatari charity, which has been helping those injured during the protests. \u201cI feel pain all the time, the pain doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d says Nasser. \u201cI went through a difficult time psychologically as a result of the injury. My relationship with my family is bad. I thought about suicide many times. I was depressed. I went to the border many times and got close to the fence, but I wasn\u2019t shot.\u201d Before coming to the trauma clinic, Nasser spent nine weeks in intensive care at a health ministry hospital. MSF doctors stopped him killing himself, he says. \u201cNow I wish to be healed and return to normal life.\u201d In Gaza, antibiotics are available over the counter at pharmacies without a prescription. This leads to misuse, with the drugs frequently used when they are not needed, treatment courses not completed, or inadequate doses taken \u2013 all of which increase the risk of bacteria developing resistance. In addition, Gaza\u2019s health system has been weakened by a decade of blockades and lacks good quality antibiotics and adequate surveillance. Dr Mohammed Barayka, an antibiotic specialist at the al-Awda hospital, says patients are tested if they are suspected of having antimicrobial resistance. \u201cWhen doctors feel the patient suffers from constant pain, the wound does not heal and there\u2019s fever at night, we do a bone biopsy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe used to send the samples to a lab in Tel Aviv, Israel but now we send them to a health ministry hospital in Gaza. We get the results after five to seven days.\u201d In the majority of cases the tests are positive, he says. \u201cMRSA is widespread in the Gaza strip. \u201cWe had one case of a 17-year-old boy who had received the protocol three times, but his body didn\u2019t heal the wounds and he lost his leg.\u201d At least 170 Palestinians became permanently disabled as a result of gunshot wounds in the first year of the border protests, mainly due to amputation, according to World Health Organization data. Mohamoud Awad, a psychologist, says some suffer such physical and psychological pain that they go to the border of Gaza and Israel, in hope of being shot dead by an Israeli sniper. \u201cEvery injury causes trauma to the patients and it depends on each one and the support they receive,\u201d says Awad. \u201cThey become nervous. They talk to us constantly about family problems. Their financial problems get worse after injury. Many complain that friends have been cured of their injuries but they are still infected.

In this context, it\u2019s heartening to see a few pioneers such as La Belle \u00c9poque and A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, which suggest to audiences that they themselves can control the narrative, rather than be controlled by it, and that - rather than requiring an army of servants, a full set of Infinity Stones or the Force, all it will take is emotional honesty and clear-eyed thinking. \u2022 Jumanji: The Next Level is released in UK cinemas on 13 December. A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood is released on 31 January.",

He said the chances of that were \u201cextremely remote\u201d but dodged several opportunities to rule it out.</p> \n<p>He claimed the outline of a free trade agreement had already been worked out, saying: \u201cBy the end of 2020, we will have agreed and finalised the trade deal, a very ambitious, deep, comprehensive free trade agreement.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tory ambitions to pass a tax-cutting, post-Brexit budget within 100 days of taking office have been dismissed by opposition parties, who cast doubt on the feasibility of the timetable.

But I think the polling industry also has questions to answer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/12/polls-2019-election\">After the failures of recent years, can the polls be trusted in 2019? | Patrick Sturgis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/onora_o_neill_what_we_don_t_understand_about_trust.htmlAll/discussion\" title=\"\">best set of principles</a> for judging whether statistics are being communicated in a trustworthy fashion come from the philosopher Onora O\u2019Neill. She says that statisticians should make their work accessible, intelligible, usable and assessable.</p> <p>How does the polling industry do according to these standards? YouGov\u2019s recent MRP poll (it stands for multilevel regression and post-stratification) can serve as a high-water mark. As a piece of statistics communication it surpasses the rest of the polling published so far in this campaign: it comes with a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/uk-general-election-2019/\" title=\"\">nice website</a>, accessibly formatted <a href=\"https://yg-infographics-data.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ZAfbtHgj42wx4reHnaMtbBamoKdMxkFMpz4gnWMjiZCUAxDX66MsCB38K/2019_data/party_constituency_vote_shares.csv\" title=\"\">results</a> and a <a href=\"https://yg-infographics-data.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ZAfbtHgj42wx4reHnaMtbBamoKdMxkFMpz4gnWMjiZCUAxDX66MsCB38K/2019_data/MRP_Tables_2019_Election_Public_Release.pdf\" title=\"\">detailed document</a> explaining its methodology. Yet according to O\u2019Neill\u2019s criteria, even this analysis falls short.</p> <p>YouGov may have released constituency-level results, but other, more important, parts of its analysis remain inaccessible. The company has not shared the data that went into its analysis, or the code that implements it, so it is impossible to check it for errors or compare YouGov\u2019s approach against alternatives.</p> <p>The explanatory material on the website is helpful, but this isn\u2019t enough to make YouGov\u2019s analysis acceptably intelligible. It doesn\u2019t spell out how exactly its models used demographic traits to predict voting behaviour \u2013 a crucial part of multiple regression \u2013 or what assumptions it made about how many people have all those traits in order to carry out its post-stratification. </p> <p>Absolute clarity is important here because, like other statistical techniques, multilevel regression and post-stratification are highly sensitive to modelling choices where there is no obvious right answer. Before the 2016 US election <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/20/upshot/the-error-the-polling-world-rarely-talks-about.html\" title=\"\">the New York Times</a> asked four respected teams of pollsters to predict the Trump-Clinton spread in Florida based on the same opinion poll. The results ranged from Trump ahead by one to Clinton ahead by four. None of the analyses were bad, they just made different judgment calls. This shows that in order to understand any opinion poll analysis, we need to know exactly what choices the pollsters made at every stage.</p> <p>How might people use YouGov\u2019s analysis? Well, many people have probably seen it as a way to predict constituency results in the election. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t possible: the results are merely snapshots of the week of 20-27 November, when the polling took place, and do not try to capture how public opinion will change between then and election day. This is a big problem because there aren\u2019t many sources of information about constituency-level public opinion, so people are bound to be tempted to misuse YouGov\u2019s results. It may caution against using its results as forecasts, but that\u2019s no excuse for putting such easily misinterpreted numbers into the public sphere in the first place.</p> <p>As for O\u2019Neill\u2019s last requirement, YouGov\u2019s analysis is impossible to assess. The natural way to test its model would be to use it to predict unseen survey responses, but with the data and code kept out of reach, no one outside the company can do this.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that even this poll fails to meet the standards of statistics communication. So what could YouGov and the rest of the polling industry do to be more trustworthy?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/20/polls-public-opinion-polling-industry\">The polling industry doesn\u2019t measure public opinion \u2013 it produces it | Richard Seymour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The best thing would be for the industry to make all its analysis reproducible by sharing its data and code online, following the standard practices of open-source software development. That would enable any interested person with a computer to run the same analysis.

      "bodyText": "Election campaigns are always full of statistical discord, but this one has been particularly acrimonious. Misleading bar charts, selective publication, dubious tactical voting recommendations and outright fake research are all in the news, and the mantra \u201ctrust no poll\u201d is resounding on social media. Questions are understandably being asked about the contributions of the media, political parties and electoral regulators to the poor level of public discussion of public opinion. But I think the polling industry also has questions to answer. The best set of principles for judging whether statistics are being communicated in a trustworthy fashion come from the philosopher Onora O\u2019Neill. She says that statisticians should make their work accessible, intelligible, usable and assessable. How does the polling industry do according to these standards? YouGov\u2019s recent MRP poll (it stands for multilevel regression and post-stratification) can serve as a high-water mark. As a piece of statistics communication it surpasses the rest of the polling published so far in this campaign: it comes with a nice website, accessibly formatted results and a detailed document explaining its methodology. Yet according to O\u2019Neill\u2019s criteria, even this analysis falls short. YouGov may have released constituency-level results, but other, more important, parts of its analysis remain inaccessible. The company has not shared the data that went into its analysis, or the code that implements it, so it is impossible to check it for errors or compare YouGov\u2019s approach against alternatives. The explanatory material on the website is helpful, but this isn\u2019t enough to make YouGov\u2019s analysis acceptably intelligible. It doesn\u2019t spell out how exactly its models used demographic traits to predict voting behaviour \u2013 a crucial part of multiple regression \u2013 or what assumptions it made about how many people have all those traits in order to carry out its post-stratification. Absolute clarity is important here because, like other statistical techniques, multilevel regression and post-stratification are highly sensitive to modelling choices where there is no obvious right answer. Before the 2016 US election the New York Times asked four respected teams of pollsters to predict the Trump-Clinton spread in Florida based on the same opinion poll. The results ranged from Trump ahead by one to Clinton ahead by four. None of the analyses were bad, they just made different judgment calls. This shows that in order to understand any opinion poll analysis, we need to know exactly what choices the pollsters made at every stage. How might people use YouGov\u2019s analysis? Well, many people have probably seen it as a way to predict constituency results in the election. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t possible: the results are merely snapshots of the week of 20-27 November, when the polling took place, and do not try to capture how public opinion will change between then and election day. This is a big problem because there aren\u2019t many sources of information about constituency-level public opinion, so people are bound to be tempted to misuse YouGov\u2019s results. It may caution against using its results as forecasts, but that\u2019s no excuse for putting such easily misinterpreted numbers into the public sphere in the first place. As for O\u2019Neill\u2019s last requirement, YouGov\u2019s analysis is impossible to assess. The natural way to test its model would be to use it to predict unseen survey responses, but with the data and code kept out of reach, no one outside the company can do this. It\u2019s clear that even this poll fails to meet the standards of statistics communication. So what could YouGov and the rest of the polling industry do to be more trustworthy? The best thing would be for the industry to make all its analysis reproducible by sharing its data and code online, following the standard practices of open-source software development. That would enable any interested person with a computer to run the same analysis. It would then be possible to catch polling firms\u2019 errors by picking through their code, and to assess their models against fresh data. Perhaps members of the public could even build on the polling industry\u2019s work to produce forecasts that people can actually use, taking into account how public opinion changes over time. In short, opinion polling would become more trustworthy. Thanks to modern software, there is no technical barrier to making opinion poll analysis reproducible; only a minimal amount of extra work would be involved. The objection I anticipate from the polling industry is that its analyses depend on secret proprietary data that is simply too valuable to share. Valuable to whom? It\u2019s mainly valuable to the polling companies themselves, helping them differentiate themselves from their competitors while also providing a handy excuse for ducking some scrutiny. But is that really worth sacrificing our trust in opinion polls? It\u2019s not surprising the public discussion about opinion polls is in such a bad state, when even the best polls fail to meet reasonable standards of trustworthy statistics communication.

None of these topics warranted comment or were \u201ctoo much\u201d. But this was clearly different. I had breached a code.</p> <p>This code didn\u2019t simply dictate that I should not share something so personal, but something that was innately female. I had revealed too much that in turn revealed I was actually a woman. One with a cervix that was about to rise and open; breasts that were about to leak. Parts of me that I normally kept muffled inside skin or cloth.</p> <p>When I first discovered I was pregnant, I abided by the three-month rule, expecting the world of words to open up to me on the dot of 12 weeks, when it was decreed safe to speak. In those lonely, silent weeks, I scurried around in the shadows of the internet where the other silent, just-pregnant women met in forums and on message boards. I hid in the pages of books that spelled out the weirdness and the brutality and the wonder.</p> <p>And pregnancy is all of those things. Aside from the 4am existential psych-outs, there is the all-day, everyday stuff. I sit with it, it in me, 24 hours a day. I keep my face straight in meetings, on the bus, in the cinema, while something wriggles and wiggles inside my hollowed-out middle. His foot is on my bladder, his skull is in my ribs and I smile and pretend there isn\u2019t an about-to-be boy fighting against my bones and organs. That this isn\u2019t the single most insane thing I have ever experienced. Because the truth is that the crumbs I leave in public on social media are barely 1% of the dialogue in my mind. And still, it\u2019s <em>too much</em>.</p> <p>The days of biting down on a leather strap may be over, but the silence expected of women isn\u2019t. The preferred option is that we traverse the nine months with gob zipped, pelvis set stoically towards the brow of the hill. We will reappear on the other side, smiling, still not talking about what we have just experienced to get our baby safely from the inside to the outside, where it now sits on our sore hip.</p> <p>To the not-rude man on Twitter: does it help if I say that yes, it\u2019s something like that bit in Alien? No? Sorry, that\u2019s all I have got for you.</p> <p><em>Terri White is the editor of Empire magazine</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When I read the message from the man on Twitter, I felt the instant inching of shame. It wasn\u2019t what you would call rude. If he was asked, he would probably have called it \u201chelpful\u201d. \u201cYou mention you\u2019re pregnant way too much on here these days,\u201d it said. He only came to my account for the \u201cfilm stuff\u201d \u2013 not beyond reason, given I am the editor of a film magazine. Nevertheless, as well as \u201cfilm stuff\u201d, I also talk about poverty, politics and domestic violence. I have sent a staggering number of tweets about cheese triangles. None of these topics warranted comment or were \u201ctoo much\u201d. But this was clearly different. I had breached a code. This code didn\u2019t simply dictate that I should not share something so personal, but something that was innately female. I had revealed too much that in turn revealed I was actually a woman. One with a cervix that was about to rise and open; breasts that were about to leak. Parts of me that I normally kept muffled inside skin or cloth. When I first discovered I was pregnant, I abided by the three-month rule, expecting the world of words to open up to me on the dot of 12 weeks, when it was decreed safe to speak. In those lonely, silent weeks, I scurried around in the shadows of the internet where the other silent, just-pregnant women met in forums and on message boards. I hid in the pages of books that spelled out the weirdness and the brutality and the wonder. And pregnancy is all of those things. Aside from the 4am existential psych-outs, there is the all-day, everyday stuff. I sit with it, it in me, 24 hours a day. I keep my face straight in meetings, on the bus, in the cinema, while something wriggles and wiggles inside my hollowed-out middle. His foot is on my bladder, his skull is in my ribs and I smile and pretend there isn\u2019t an about-to-be boy fighting against my bones and organs. That this isn\u2019t the single most insane thing I have ever experienced. Because the truth is that the crumbs I leave in public on social media are barely 1% of the dialogue in my mind. And still, it\u2019s too much. The days of biting down on a leather strap may be over, but the silence expected of women isn\u2019t. The preferred option is that we traverse the nine months with gob zipped, pelvis set stoically towards the brow of the hill. We will reappear on the other side, smiling, still not talking about what we have just experienced to get our baby safely from the inside to the outside, where it now sits on our sore hip. To the not-rude man on Twitter: does it help if I say that yes, it\u2019s something like that bit in Alien? No? Sorry, that\u2019s all I have got for you.

The Customer Union for Ethical Banking said the agreement would give it influence with the Co-operative Bank\u2019s leadership, and help the group rally support for its long-term goal of returning the lender to cooperative ownership. The union \u2013 which has 1,200 members \u2013 grew out of the Save Our Bank campaign, which formed following the bank\u2019s near collapse in 2013. That year, the bank revealed a \u00a31.5bn hole in its accounts and had to be rescued by hedge funds. It was eventually bought out completely, in 2017, after a group of US hedge funds \u2013 including Silver Point Capital, GoldenTree, Anchorage Capital, Blue Mountain and Cyrus Capital \u2013 backed a second rescue deal worth \u00a3700m. Those funds, as well as asset manager Invesco, now hold an 85% stake in the bank. The lender also suffered a major blow after secret footage emerged of the bank\u2019s chairman Paul Flowers \u2013 dubbed the \u201ccrystal Methodist\u201d \u2013 that led to him pleading guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine in 2014. \u201cInitially there was a lot of concern.

Reading Irenosen Okojie\u2019s stories is more like taking an old\u2011fashioned megadose: familiar reality peels away to reveal a world of bizarre transformations, stutters in time, encounters between gods and humans, and the fragmentation, or even the dissolution, of the self.</p> <p>Okojie\u2019s first novel, <em>Butterfly Fish</em>, begins with an empty bottle of palm wine rolling down a London street, presumably a nod to the 1952 novel by the Nigerian writer Amos Tutuola, <em>The Palm-Wine Drinkard</em>, in which an alcoholic young man makes a journey into the afterlife. That novel, which lies splayed open on a table in one story in <em>Nudibranch</em>, and which blends everyday life in Nigeria with the fantastical and phantasmagorical, is a spiritual ancestor to Okojie\u2019s work. Her fiction includes mundane elements \u2013 an Ikea sofa, a tower block, an Asda chiller cabinet \u2013 but can, at any moment, be overrun by the surreal or supernatural: the tower block is haunted, the chiller cabinet contains the severed head of a time-travelling monk, and atop the Ikea sofa crouches an animal with \u201ca green head, blank human eyes and a crocodile\u2019s tail\u201d, the embodiment of a woman\u2019s loneliness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You need to pay attention when you embark on one of Okojie\u2019s stories, because things can get very strange very\u00a0quickly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You need to pay attention when you embark on one of Okojie\u2019s stories, because things can get very strange very quickly. \u201cFilamo\u201d, one of the wildest and best in the collection, begins: \u201cThe last monk told the tongue that holding a naked sheep\u2019s head underwater would undo it all.\u201d The suggestion is of some sort of ritual, which abound in Okojie\u2019s work, but a summary of the story\u2019s events \u2013 monks exploit wormholes to travel through time collecting artefacts from various ages, while saints Peter, Augustine and Christopher are deployed to keep an eye on them like some kind of ecclesiastical internal affairs unit \u2013 doesn\u2019t convey its powerful and singular effect. This resides less in what actually happens (it took me two readings to begin to work that out) and more in its evocation of the fundamental weirdness of Christian symbolism:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>St Peter was missing an ear, yet had a small translucent dragon\u2019s wing growing against a rib. St Augustine had lost a finger on his left hand but had two hearts, one pumping blood, the other mercury, so much so his tongue became silvery at particular angles. St Christopher had lost an eye and gained a filmy yellow fish iris, which cried seawater no matter his mood.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The other highlights are \u201cMangata\u201d, which describes an albino architect\u2019s return from London to his hometown in Mozambique to build a series of water fountains, its tense atmosphere building towards a horrific climax, and \u201cDune Dunelm\u201d, about a rootless chef called Canelo. Here Okojie transforms Rapa Nui (the Polynesian name for Easter Island) into a space somewhere between geographical reality and a manifestation of the psyche, as resonant objects from Canelo\u2019s life \u2013 \u201chis brain scans \u2026 the red paintbrush he\u2019d used to paint the walls of his first apartment \u2026 a photograph of his mother\u201d \u2013 begin washing up on the shore. The territory Okojie occupies here abuts that of JG Ballard\u2019s <em>The Terminal Beach</em>, another story in which a man reckons with his past on a deserted Pacific island.</p> <p>One of the pleasures of her stories is their unpredictability: it\u2019s often difficult to say where a sentence will end up, let alone a paragraph or an entire scene. Sometimes, however, the writing is more obscure than I think it intends to be. Image-making is Okojie\u2019s great strength, but its potency can get lost in tangled sentences, or similes that confuse rather than make the thing they are describing more vivid. In \u201cZinzi from Boketto\u201d, for example, she writes that the misshapenness of a circus performer\u2019s hunchback is accentuated for the troupe\u2019s shows, but what does it add to say that this larger hump looks \u201cas if one-eyed creatures grew inside, reaching for their lost sight\u201d? Near the start of the same story \u201cZinzi from Boketto\u201d, for example, we encounter the following sentence, one of several in the book I find impossible to understand:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Rising up as though ready to break from the carriage of squealing oddities to scour the rooftops for iridescent particles of past nights the woman had left behind, while the carriage was sucked into the vortex, Halmin reduced to a mouth in his top hat and the woman using the reins to drag people from the carriage into sudden embraces.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In other stories we find \u201ccavernous caves\u201d, \u201cgeneric, non-specific advice\u201d; \u201ca small smattering\u201d. The occasional tautology is hardly unforgivable, but these are emblematic of an unfinished quality that mars parts of this collection. Okojie displays a poet\u2019s verve for creating unusual combinations of words, but sometimes they, and these stories, are some distance away from their final and most effective iterations. That is frustrating, because, like the nudibranch molluscs of the title story, her work is also notable for its \u201cextraordinary colours and striking forms\u201d.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Nudibranch is published by Dialogue (RRP \u00a314.99).

The territory Okojie occupies here abuts that of JG Ballard\u2019s The Terminal Beach, another story in which a man reckons with his past on a deserted Pacific island. One of the pleasures of her stories is their unpredictability: it\u2019s often difficult to say where a sentence will end up, let alone a paragraph or an entire scene. Sometimes, however, the writing is more obscure than I think it intends to be. Image-making is Okojie\u2019s great strength, but its potency can get lost in tangled sentences, or similes that confuse rather than make the thing they are describing more vivid. In \u201cZinzi from Boketto\u201d, for example, she writes that the misshapenness of a circus performer\u2019s hunchback is accentuated for the troupe\u2019s shows, but what does it add to say that this larger hump looks \u201cas if one-eyed creatures grew inside, reaching for their lost sight\u201d? Near the start of the same story \u201cZinzi from Boketto\u201d, for example, we encounter the following sentence, one of several in the book I find impossible to understand: Rising up as though ready to break from the carriage of squealing oddities to scour the rooftops for iridescent particles of past nights the woman had left behind, while the carriage was sucked into the vortex, Halmin reduced to a mouth in his top hat and the woman using the reins to drag people from the carriage into sudden embraces. In other stories we find \u201ccavernous caves\u201d, \u201cgeneric, non-specific advice\u201d; \u201ca small smattering\u201d. The occasional tautology is hardly unforgivable, but these are emblematic of an unfinished quality that mars parts of this collection. Okojie displays a poet\u2019s verve for creating unusual combinations of words, but sometimes they, and these stories, are some distance away from their final and most effective iterations. That is frustrating, because, like the nudibranch molluscs of the title story, her work is also notable for its \u201cextraordinary colours and striking forms\u201d. \u2022 Nudibranch is published by Dialogue (RRP \u00a314.99).

The Michigan environmental attorney Jim Olson, who did not represent Osceola township but has previously battled Nestl\u00e9 in court, said any claim that the Swiss multinational is a public water utility \u201cis ludicrous\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this lays bare is the extent to which private water marketers like Nestl\u00e9, and others like them, go [in] their attempts to privatize sovereign public water, public water services, and the land and communities they impact,\u201d Olson said.</p> <p>The ruling, made on Tuesday, could also lead state environmental regulators to reconsider permits that allow Nestl\u00e9 to pump water in Michigan.</p> <p>The Osceola case stems from Nestle\u2019s attempt to increase the amount of water it pulls from a controversial wellhead in nearby Evart from about 250 gallons per minute to 400 gallons per minute. It needs to build the pump in a children\u2019s campground in Osceola township to transport the increased load via a pipe system.</p> <p>The township in 2017 rejected the plans based on its zoning laws, and Nestl\u00e9 subsequently sued. A lower court wrote in late 2017 that water was essential for life and bottling water was an \u201cessential public service\u201d that met a demand, which trumped Osceola township\u2019s zoning laws.</p> <p>However, a three-judge panel in the appellate court reversed the decision.</p> <p>The appellate judges acknowledged that water was \u201cessential to life\u201d, but wrote that the context in which water is sold also had to be considered. Marketing bottled water in an area where tap water is available is unessential.</p> <p>\u201cThe circuit court\u2019s conclusion that [Nestl\u00e9\u2019s] commercial water bottling operation is an \u2018essential public service\u2019 is clearly erroneous,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cOther than in areas with no other source of water, bottled water is not essential.\u201d</p> <p>The court noted that infrastructure that provides essential public services included electrical substations, sewage facilities or other similar structures. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s pumping station does not fit in that category.</p> <p>The judges also disagreed with Nestle\u2019s argument that it represented a \u201cpublic water supply\u201d. They said state law \u201cunambiguously\u201d implies public water supplies are \u201cconveyed to a site through pipes\u201d while nonessential water is provided in bottles.</p> <p>\u201cWe conclude that [Nestl\u00e9\u2019s] proposed booster-pump facility is not a \u2018public water supply\u2019 under [Michigan law],\u201d the court wrote.</p> <p>Osceola township\u2019s attorney, William Fahey, told the Guardian it was clear that Nestle\u2019s bottling operation \u201cis a commercial purpose\u201d and the pump was prohibited by the township\u2019s zoning laws. He said Nestl\u00e9 could appeal to the Michigan supreme court, or it could attempt to build the pump elsewhere in the township.</p> <p>In a statement to the <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/12/03/nestle-ice-mountain-bottled-water-osceola-court-of-appeals-zoning/2598332001/\">Detroit Free Press</a>, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s natural resource manager, Arlene Anderson-Vincent, said the company believes \u201cthe plan we proposed met the Township\u2019s site plan and special land use standards\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe will evaluate our possible next steps in the legal process,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The court\u2019s determination could also have an impact on the state permit that allows Nestl\u00e9 to increase its extraction load to 400 gallons per minute. The Michigan department of environment, Great Lakes and energy (EGLE) issued the permit in part because it determined Nestl\u00e9 provided an essential public service and was not damaging the local water table.</p> <p>Several Native American tribes and the environmental attorney Ross Hammersley are challenging the permit in state administrative court. Hammersley told the Guardian the appellate court finding that Nestl\u00e9 is not a public water source could help in his case, as could remarks about the company\u2019s impact on the water table.</p> <p>\u201c[Nestl\u00e9] extracting water and sending it to other places where it cannot return to the water table, and, critically, doing so faster than the aquifer can replenish, is an \u2018irretrievable\u2019 depletion unless the pumping is reduced or halted,\u201d the judges wrote.</p> <p>The administrative court\u2019s ruling is expected early next year, but Olson already views the latest decision as a \u201chuge victory\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn the context of the larger question, \u2018Who owns the water?\u2019 \u2013 in this round, the state and public do, because selling containerized water for profit is simply private, not public,\u201d Olson said.</p>",

The Michigan environmental attorney Jim Olson, who did not represent Osceola township but has previously battled Nestl\u00e9 in court, said any claim that the Swiss multinational is a public water utility \u201cis ludicrous\u201d. \u201cWhat this lays bare is the extent to which private water marketers like Nestl\u00e9, and others like them, go [in] their attempts to privatize sovereign public water, public water services, and the land and communities they impact,\u201d Olson said. The ruling, made on Tuesday, could also lead state environmental regulators to reconsider permits that allow Nestl\u00e9 to pump water in Michigan. The Osceola case stems from Nestle\u2019s attempt to increase the amount of water it pulls from a controversial wellhead in nearby Evart from about 250 gallons per minute to 400 gallons per minute. It needs to build the pump in a children\u2019s campground in Osceola township to transport the increased load via a pipe system. The township in 2017 rejected the plans based on its zoning laws, and Nestl\u00e9 subsequently sued. A lower court wrote in late 2017 that water was essential for life and bottling water was an \u201cessential public service\u201d that met a demand, which trumped Osceola township\u2019s zoning laws. However, a three-judge panel in the appellate court reversed the decision. The appellate judges acknowledged that water was \u201cessential to life\u201d, but wrote that the context in which water is sold also had to be considered. Marketing bottled water in an area where tap water is available is unessential. \u201cThe circuit court\u2019s conclusion that [Nestl\u00e9\u2019s] commercial water bottling operation is an \u2018essential public service\u2019 is clearly erroneous,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cOther than in areas with no other source of water, bottled water is not essential.\u201d The court noted that infrastructure that provides essential public services included electrical substations, sewage facilities or other similar structures. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s pumping station does not fit in that category. The judges also disagreed with Nestle\u2019s argument that it represented a \u201cpublic water supply\u201d. They said state law \u201cunambiguously\u201d implies public water supplies are \u201cconveyed to a site through pipes\u201d while nonessential water is provided in bottles. \u201cWe conclude that [Nestl\u00e9\u2019s] proposed booster-pump facility is not a \u2018public water supply\u2019 under [Michigan law],\u201d the court wrote. Osceola township\u2019s attorney, William Fahey, told the Guardian it was clear that Nestle\u2019s bottling operation \u201cis a commercial purpose\u201d and the pump was prohibited by the township\u2019s zoning laws. He said Nestl\u00e9 could appeal to the Michigan supreme court, or it could attempt to build the pump elsewhere in the township. In a statement to the Detroit Free Press, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s natural resource manager, Arlene Anderson-Vincent, said the company believes \u201cthe plan we proposed met the Township\u2019s site plan and special land use standards\u201d. \u201cWe will evaluate our possible next steps in the legal process,\u201d she said. The court\u2019s determination could also have an impact on the state permit that allows Nestl\u00e9 to increase its extraction load to 400 gallons per minute. The Michigan department of environment, Great Lakes and energy (EGLE) issued the permit in part because it determined Nestl\u00e9 provided an essential public service and was not damaging the local water table. Several Native American tribes and the environmental attorney Ross Hammersley are challenging the permit in state administrative court. Hammersley told the Guardian the appellate court finding that Nestl\u00e9 is not a public water source could help in his case, as could remarks about the company\u2019s impact on the water table. \u201c[Nestl\u00e9] extracting water and sending it to other places where it cannot return to the water table, and, critically, doing so faster than the aquifer can replenish, is an \u2018irretrievable\u2019 depletion unless the pumping is reduced or halted,\u201d the judges wrote. The administrative court\u2019s ruling is expected early next year, but Olson already views the latest decision as a \u201chuge victory\u201d. \u201cIn the context of the larger question, \u2018Who owns the water?\u2019 \u2013 in this round, the state and public do, because selling containerized water for profit is simply private, not public,\u201d Olson said.",

      "bodyText": "Angus Taylor has doubled down on his assertion he saw and met the American author Naomi Wolf during his time at Oxford University, while demanding she apologise for accusing him of antisemitism. In a rowdy and rancorous final question time for 2019, the embattled minister for emissions reduction shrugged off a request from Wolf that he formally correct the Hansard record of his first speech, where he recalled the author living \u201ca couple of doors down the corridor\u201d at Oxford in 1991, and also recounted an anecdote about graduate students, mostly from the north-east of America, \u201cdeciding we should abandon the Christmas tree in the common room because some people might be offended\u201d. Wolf insists she did not live at Oxford in 1991, and was not part of any move by students to cancel Christmas. The author contacted Taylor\u2019s office on Wednesday night in an effort to extract a correction. On Thursday she expressed astonishment that Taylor had demanded an apology from her. \u201cI have to say I\u2019m quite taken aback by what you\u2019re telling me,\u201d Wolf told the ABC on Thursday. \u201cI think it\u2019s very inappropriate, and very wrong.\u201d Taylor \u2013 who has been under intense pressure during the final two sitting weeks of the year because of a police investigation into a doctored document deployed in a political attack he launched against the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore \u2013 was asked during the final question time why he wouldn\u2019t correct the record about Wolf. Rather than retreating and issuing a correction, Taylor dug in, although his locution was slightly different on Thursday to the description in his first speech. \u201cOf course I recall seeing and meeting Ms Wolf at New College in Oxford during my time there,\u201d the minister told parliament. \u201cShe began her studies there in the mid-80s and she finished at Oxford only a couple of years ago.\u201d Taylor also demanded Wolf apologise to him for her claim that he had engaged in \u201cantisemitic dog whistling\u201d for associating her with students campaigning against Christmas. \u201cNow my speech to the parliament six years ago did not say she was involved in the war on Christmas,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI want to say this, her accusation of antisemitism is wrong and deeply offensive to me and my family. Mr Speaker, my grandmother was Jewish and my belief in Judeo-Christian values is deeply held. I call for her to apologise for these unsubstantiated and outrageous accusations.\u201d Wolf said on Thursday she did not live down the hall from Taylor in 1991, she lived in New York, and spent much of that year on a book tour. She also said she had never campaigned against Christmas, and she stood by her argument that the anecdote in Taylor\u2019s first speech was antisemitic. \u201cI stand by what I said.\u201d \u201cI really object to my name and reputation being misused by an elected official to tell a false story,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think it was inappropriate to say I was somewhere I wasn\u2019t, doing something I wasn\u2019t doing.\u201d She said to the best of her recollection she had never met Taylor. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who he was until three days ago when I was alerted to these lies about me. \u201cI didn\u2019t pick this fight, [he] decided to say things about me that are simply and categorically not true. It\u2019s up to him as an elected official to correct the record.\u201d The public fight between Taylor and Wolf came on a particularly rancorous final day in the parliament. The House of Representatives chamber was suspended briefly just before question time after Labor objected to the Morrison government gagging debate on an amended version of a union integrity bill that was defeated in the Senate last week. Labor used question time to ask the prime minister repeatedly why he believed the normal rules of accountability did not apply to him. One question put to the prime minister cited the gagging of the union bill, misleading parliament, phoning the New South Wales police commissioner during the investigation into Taylor and inviting the Hillsong pastor Brian Houston to the White House. Scott Morrison hit back, declaring it was \u201cquestion time, not smear time\u201d. He also accused Labor of attacking his Christian faith. In the melee, Taylor accused Labor of attaching itself to Wolf\u2019s \u201cantisemitic accusations\u201d and that \u201cshows just how low they\u2019re prepared to go\u201d. Labor demanded Taylor withdraw and the minister complied. In relation to the doctored document deployed against Moore, Taylor has said repeatedly, including in parliament this week, that neither he, nor \u201cany members of my staff, altered the [council] documents in question\u201d. The minister said he will cooperate with the police investigation. Federal parliament rose for the summer on Thursday night and will return next February.",

Western Australia has promised to fast-track its laws following the release of footage on Israeli television this week that showed cattle on several stations in northern WA bellowing while having their horns removed, staggering and panting following horn removal or castration, and being kicked in the face by station workers. One station worker, whose face and voice have been distorted, can be heard saying: \u201cNobody uses pain killer. Too expensive, too much hassle.\u201d None of the stations were identified by Israel-based animal rights organisation Sentient, which conducted the investigation. But the managers of one station came forward on Thursday to say they had launched an independent investigation to identify those responsible for the abuse.

RSPCA Australia said mandatory pain relief was \u201cthe very least the cattle industry must do\u201d to repair its national and international reputation. The RSPCA\u2019s senior scientific officer for farm animals, Melina Tensen, said the cattle being dehorned in the footage were \u201cclearly in extreme pain and distress\u201d. \u201cThe outright animal abuse shown by these workers is appalling, and completely unacceptable,\u201d she said.

Many walks to work are now lined with homeless people. Our disabled neighbours are trapped indoors without social care. The local library and children\u2019s centre have likely closed their doors. But watch a news bulletin of a leader on the campaign trail or flick through the front pages and you would hardly know it. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/labour-plan-to-tackle-rip-off-britain-would-save-families-6700?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\" title=\"\">John McDonnell gave a speech</a> this week highlighting children living in poverty on the run-up to Christmas, it was notable how little traction it got.</p> <p>Even the NHS, which has played a significant part in campaigning, had its biggest moment when framed in terms of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/corbyn-trump-nhs-never-be-for-sale-labour\" title=\"\">Brexit trade deal</a> rather than underfunding. It is resulting in a bizarre shadow of an election campaign, as if we are sleepwalking through the most important vote in a generation with no real sense of what\u2019s at stake.</p> <p>Labour, now edging closer in the polls, has the right policies. But with only days left, it needs to fully win the argument.</p> <p>This means convincing the electorate that something better is possible.

      "bodyText": "A decade of austerity has shrunk the British state to such a degree that it is no longer able to fulfil its basic functions. Just ask the cancer patient waiting for treatment or the teacher shutting school early on a Friday because they can\u2019t afford to keep it open. A winter election should, in theory, be ripe for highlighting such social crises. Food banks are reporting running out of supplies, as the last six months has seen a record number of people turn to them for emergency meals. More than half of hospitals have opened extra beds to help them cope with what\u2019s been described as \u201cthe worst winter [for the NHS] since modern records began\u201d. At least 135,000 children will be homeless and living in temporary accommodation across Britain on Christmas day \u2013 the highest number for 12 years. The five-week period people have to wait before receiving benefits with universal redit will result in some families being destitute over the holiday, while the Salvation Army has warned hundreds of homeless people will die as temperatures plummet.And yet there\u2019s been a remarkable lack of attention to these issues in the campaign so far. An election that was always doomed to be dominated by Brexit has become a soulless affair, in which soaring poverty or crumbling services are given little more than a shrug. Many walks to work are now lined with homeless people. Our disabled neighbours are trapped indoors without social care. The local library and children\u2019s centre have likely closed their doors. But watch a news bulletin of a leader on the campaign trail or flick through the front pages and you would hardly know it. When John McDonnell gave a speech this week highlighting children living in poverty on the run-up to Christmas, it was notable how little traction it got. Even the NHS, which has played a significant part in campaigning, had its biggest moment when framed in terms of a Brexit trade deal rather than underfunding. It is resulting in a bizarre shadow of an election campaign, as if we are sleepwalking through the most important vote in a generation with no real sense of what\u2019s at stake. Labour, now edging closer in the polls, has the right policies. But with only days left, it needs to fully win the argument. This means convincing the electorate that something better is possible. It is clear there is an urgent need for change, from the Resolution Foundation warning that child poverty could hit a 60-year high if Boris Johnson gets elected, to the NHS considering rationing tests and treatments. But dire forecasts alone never win an election. Just as people become resigned to an economic system that is failing them, there is a risk that large chunks of the public have endured a decade of cuts wrecking services and have no faith there is another way. Labour need to set out not only the extent of creeping poverty and broken services, but explain that they are entirely possible to fix.

Tackling the money issue is another key battle. Throughout this campaign, we have repeatedly been warned about the cost of Labour\u2019s long-term spending plans, but considerably less is said about the price tag of Tory cuts that will end up costing the state more in the long run. Children living in B&amp;Bs is inhumane but it also hugely wasteful; last year, councils had to pay out \u00a31.1bn on temporary accommodation as a cocktail of benefit cuts and unaffordable housing hit \u2013 a 78% increase from five years ago. Meanwhile, the colossal failure of universal credit has cost the public purse almost \u00a32bn , while pointless costly hospital admissions have rocketed as social care and disability benefits are pulled away. Labour\u2019s ideal message is that, far from a safe pair of hands, the Conservatives are the party of financial incompetence.

Your main email address, phone number, credit card number and car number plate don\u2019t change very often. Good luck changing, or disguising, your fingerprint and face recognition data. \u201c<a href=\"https://apnews.com/bf75dd1c26c947b7826d270a16e2658a\">Gait recognition</a>\u201d is already being used in China. You can run but you can\u2019t hide.</p> <p>Today, we are past the stage where it\u2019s a technology problem. Only governments can protect our privacy by banning the collection of data and giving us the rights both to prevent its collection without explicit permission, and to delete data that has already been collected. The EU\u2019s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) was a baby step in the right direction. BOWM also mentions <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/vermonts-new-data-privacy-law\">Vermont\u2019s data privacy law</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/07/eff-illinois-supreme-court-protect-biometric-privacy\">Illinois Biometric Information Protection Act</a> (BIPA) and next year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/lawmakers-must-not-let-internet-association-weaken-california-consumer-privacy-act\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA). We need many more things like this, but I don\u2019t expect we\u2019ll get them in the UK \u2013 especially not if we\u2019re outside the EU.</p> <p>In any case, the game looks like moving on from browser-based surveillance to exploiting data from smartphones, smart watches and \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things\">Internet of Things</a>\u201d devices, with smart cars and smart roads to come. And rather than just flogging you stuff, the new threats include manipulating behaviour, as Shoshana Zuboff discusses at length in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=age+of+surveillance+capitalism\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Browser choices</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0269fcf9186be72b3730db216e2316183684f4b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0269fcf9186be72b3730db216e2316183684f4b6/58_0_1283_770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla firefox logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Try the Mozilla Firefox browser if you\u2019d like to try and avoid Google\u2019s Chrome or the open-source Chromium technology it is built on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mozilla</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Google pioneered surveillance capitalism and it still dominates the market. According to Ghostery privacy extension-maker Cliqz, quoted in BOWM, Google collects data on more than 80% of measured web traffic, which is far more than Facebook or anybody else. It\u2019s not enough to avoid Chrome and Google\u2019s web properties because its trackers are on most other popular sites as well. You should therefore install <a href=\"https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996\">Google\u2019s \u201copt out\u201d cookie</a> in your browsers and pause data collection in <a href=\"https://myactivity.google.com/\">My Activity</a>.</p> <p>There are lots of alternatives to Google Chrome, the main one being Mozilla\u2019s Firefox. It\u2019s the only major browser that is fully open source and not controlled by one of the web giants. It has some privacy features built in, such as tracking protection, and \u201ccontainers\u201d that can isolate privacy-threatening websites from other tabs. <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers\">Multi-account containers</a> let you operate two or more Twitter, email, Facebook or other accounts from a single browser.</p> <p>But Firefox aims to provide ordinary users with a good online experience, where websites work as intended. If you take privacy more seriously, you will want to install a few extensions, and <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/make-your-firefox-browser-a-privacy-superpower-with-these-extensions/\">Mozilla has some recommendations</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor</a>, the original anti-surveillance browser, is based on an old, heavily modified version of Firefox. However, it is more complicated to set up, and uses distributed relays to hide your internet address, which makes it rather slow. It\u2019s less suitable for ordinary users.</p> <p>Most other browsers are now, like Chrome, based on Google\u2019s open source Chromium. Once enough web developers started coding for Chrome instead of for open standards, it became arduous and expensive to sustain alternative browser engines. Chromium-based browsers now include Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, the Epic Privacy Browser and next year\u2019s new Microsoft Edge.</p> <p>True to its name, <a href=\"https://www.epicbrowser.com/\">Epic</a> tries to maximise your privacy. It defaults to a sort of private-browsing mode, anonymises searches and clears browsing data when you quit. Epic has removed several Google features that could leak sensitive data including URL checks, URL tracking and error reporting. You will lose some features, such as auto-translation and spell checking. But there are often trade-offs between privacy and convenience, and Epic is still worth a look.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been using the <a href=\"https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download\">beta version of Chr/Edge</a> and recommend it as your second or third browser, because Microsoft has put a lot of effort into de-Googling the Chromium code. Microsoft may get some personal data in return, but I already use Windows 10, Defender, Outlook, OneDrive and Microsoft Office as a paying customer, not as an unwilling victim. Also, Microsoft\u2019s business is based on selling software and services, not, like Google\u2019s, on surveillance.</p> <p>People who disagree are welcome to use Linux (free) or buy a Mac (expensive), but the <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/121815_dod_windows10_memo.pdf\">US Defense Department</a> and most major corporations are using Windows 10.</p> <h2><strong>Extensions and plugins</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3036a7db91b4b4a463c1ec9dd7bf0ea11007fae2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3036a7db91b4b4a463c1ec9dd7bf0ea11007fae2/100_0_1000_600/1000.png\" alt=\"The EFF\u2019s Privacy Badger browser extension is a good place to start.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The EFF\u2019s Privacy Badger browser extension is a good place to start.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EFF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bennett Cyphers, co-author of BOWM, works on the EFF\u2019s privacy-oriented browser extension, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/privacybadger\">Privacy Badger</a>.

The last two also work on Android smartphones and Apple iPhones.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/\">Ghostery</a> doesn\u2019t block anything by default, but you can set it to block things you don\u2019t like and either whitelist sites or unblock certain services (eg Disqus, in my case) as required.

Also, it\u2019s now open source and owned by a German company, Cliqz, in which Mozilla has invested.</p> <p>Raymond Hill\u2019s <a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/README.md\">uBlock Origin</a> is a general-purpose blocker, and what it blocks depends on the lists installed. EasyPrivacy and the Malware domain lists are among the ones installed by default. If you want to block trackers or analytics systems, as Ghostery does, you will need to add more <a href=\"https://filterlists.com/\">filter lists</a>. Otherwise, be careful not to confuse uBlock Origin with either uBlock.org or AdBlock. uBlock Origin is efficient, non-commercial, open source, and completely free.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\">HTTPS Everywhere</a> tries to make your browser use an encrypted connection, where websites provide the option. It\u2019s a joint project by the EFF and Tor, and it\u2019s also available for Firefox on Android. It can run into problems with \u201cmixed content\u201d pages where some elements are sent securely (https) while others are sent insecurely (http), but it generally works pretty well.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t cost anything to try different browsers and different extensions, except a little time. However, bear in mind that, like smartphone apps, extensions can compromise your privacy instead of enhancing it. Always uninstall any you don\u2019t really need.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question? Email it to <a href=\"mailto:ask.jack@theguardian.com\">Ask.Jack@theguardian.com</a></strong></p>",

Good luck changing, or disguising, your fingerprint and face recognition data. \u201cGait recognition\u201d is already being used in China. You can run but you can\u2019t hide. Today, we are past the stage where it\u2019s a technology problem. Only governments can protect our privacy by banning the collection of data and giving us the rights both to prevent its collection without explicit permission, and to delete data that has already been collected. The EU\u2019s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) was a baby step in the right direction. BOWM also mentions Vermont\u2019s data privacy law, the Illinois Biometric Information Protection Act (BIPA) and next year\u2019s California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We need many more things like this, but I don\u2019t expect we\u2019ll get them in the UK \u2013 especially not if we\u2019re outside the EU. In any case, the game looks like moving on from browser-based surveillance to exploiting data from smartphones, smart watches and \u201cInternet of Things\u201d devices, with smart cars and smart roads to come. And rather than just flogging you stuff, the new threats include manipulating behaviour, as Shoshana Zuboff discusses at length in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. Browser choices Google pioneered surveillance capitalism and it still dominates the market. According to Ghostery privacy extension-maker Cliqz, quoted in BOWM, Google collects data on more than 80% of measured web traffic, which is far more than Facebook or anybody else. It\u2019s not enough to avoid Chrome and Google\u2019s web properties because its trackers are on most other popular sites as well. You should therefore install Google\u2019s \u201copt out\u201d cookie in your browsers and pause data collection in My Activity. There are lots of alternatives to Google Chrome, the main one being Mozilla\u2019s Firefox. It\u2019s the only major browser that is fully open source and not controlled by one of the web giants. It has some privacy features built in, such as tracking protection, and \u201ccontainers\u201d that can isolate privacy-threatening websites from other tabs. Multi-account containers let you operate two or more Twitter, email, Facebook or other accounts from a single browser. But Firefox aims to provide ordinary users with a good online experience, where websites work as intended. If you take privacy more seriously, you will want to install a few extensions, and Mozilla has some recommendations. Tor, the original anti-surveillance browser, is based on an old, heavily modified version of Firefox. However, it is more complicated to set up, and uses distributed relays to hide your internet address, which makes it rather slow. It\u2019s less suitable for ordinary users. Most other browsers are now, like Chrome, based on Google\u2019s open source Chromium. Once enough web developers started coding for Chrome instead of for open standards, it became arduous and expensive to sustain alternative browser engines. Chromium-based browsers now include Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, the Epic Privacy Browser and next year\u2019s new Microsoft Edge. True to its name, Epic tries to maximise your privacy. It defaults to a sort of private-browsing mode, anonymises searches and clears browsing data when you quit. Epic has removed several Google features that could leak sensitive data including URL checks, URL tracking and error reporting. You will lose some features, such as auto-translation and spell checking. But there are often trade-offs between privacy and convenience, and Epic is still worth a look. I\u2019ve been using the beta version of Chr/Edge and recommend it as your second or third browser, because Microsoft has put a lot of effort into de-Googling the Chromium code. Microsoft may get some personal data in return, but I already use Windows 10, Defender, Outlook, OneDrive and Microsoft Office as a paying customer, not as an unwilling victim. Also, Microsoft\u2019s business is based on selling software and services, not, like Google\u2019s, on surveillance. People who disagree are welcome to use Linux (free) or buy a Mac (expensive), but the US Defense Department and most major corporations are using Windows 10. Extensions and plugins Bennett Cyphers, co-author of BOWM, works on the EFF\u2019s privacy-oriented browser extension, Privacy Badger. It\u2019s a good option for most users. It\u2019s lenient to begin with, but learns as it goes along. People who want something more aggressive can try Ghostery, Redmorph or Disconnect. The last two also work on Android smartphones and Apple iPhones. Ghostery doesn\u2019t block anything by default, but you can set it to block things you don\u2019t like and either whitelist sites or unblock certain services (eg Disqus, in my case) as required. Ghostery\u2019s data sharing \u201cis solely related to tracking technologies\u201d and it\u2019s turned off by default. Also, it\u2019s now open source and owned by a German company, Cliqz, in which Mozilla has invested. Raymond Hill\u2019s uBlock Origin is a general-purpose blocker, and what it blocks depends on the lists installed. EasyPrivacy and the Malware domain lists are among the ones installed by default. If you want to block trackers or analytics systems, as Ghostery does, you will need to add more filter lists. Otherwise, be careful not to confuse uBlock Origin with either uBlock.org or AdBlock. uBlock Origin is efficient, non-commercial, open source, and completely free. HTTPS Everywhere tries to make your browser use an encrypted connection, where websites provide the option. It\u2019s a joint project by the EFF and Tor, and it\u2019s also available for Firefox on Android. It can run into problems with \u201cmixed content\u201d pages where some elements are sent securely (https) while others are sent insecurely (http), but it generally works pretty well. It doesn\u2019t cost anything to try different browsers and different extensions, except a little time. However, bear in mind that, like smartphone apps, extensions can compromise your privacy instead of enhancing it. Always uninstall any you don\u2019t really need. Have you got a question?

But that\u2019s offensive and ridiculous. \u201cPete Buttigieg opposes Medicare for All for the same reason that Nancy Pelosi, Sherrod Brown and almost every Democrat who flipped a House seat in 2018 oppose it \u2013 it\u2019s bad policy and terrible politics.\u201d",

Stick a fork in me. Done. The <strong>House and the Senate have adjourned</strong>.</p> <p>That\u2019s the <strong>end of another sitting year</strong>. It\u2019s been a rollercoaster. Thankfully, I\u2019ve only been trapped on it for the past week. That\u2019s been more than enough, let me assure you. </p> <p>Loyal readers, thank you so much for sticking with us throughout. Just want to pay tribute to the incredible <strong>Amy Remeikis, Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp</strong>. Feeding this beast is an almighty effort. </p> <p>This week\u2019s blog will have been a window into the steady disintegration of my mind. But it\u2019s only been four days. Amy and co do it all year. </p> <p>Just to recap the day\u2019s events. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Angus Taylor</strong> decided to double down on his fight with *checks notes* <strong>Naomi Wolf,</strong> calling for her to apologise for inferring he was antisemitic after he inferred she was at war with <strong>Christmas</strong> during their <strong>Oxford</strong> years. Wolf also doubled down, saying Taylor had his facts wrong and was peddling divisive lies about her.</li> <li>The government rammed its <strong>union bashing bill</strong> through the lower house this morning, gagging debate, and causing outrage all round by not letting the opposition speak on the bill. <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> likened it to totalitarianism. <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> said unions were full of thugs, so who cares. </li> <li>There was continuing fallout to the <strong>repeal of medevac</strong>. Human rights groups continued to criticise the decision and <strong>Labor and the Greens continued</strong> to demand an explanation of <strong>Jacqui Lambie\u2019s</strong> deal with the government. New Zealand prime minister <strong>Jacinda Ardern</strong> said her offer of resettlement was still on the table but said Australia had not approached her government for talks in recent days. </li> <li>Morrison announced a <strong>raft of machinery of government changes</strong>, reducing the number of <strong>departments from 18 to 14</strong> and getting rid of <strong>five departmental secretaries</strong>. The overhaul was criticised for concentrating power and undermining the cabinet system. It also saw the promotion of Andrew Metcalfe, Morrison\u2019s old immigration secretary. </li> </ul> <p>Thanks again. </p> <p>Merry Christmas from the blog.

He reckons he did see Wolf at Oxford, despite her saying she was on the other side of the world at the time. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course I recall seeing and meeting Ms Wolf at New College in Oxford during my time there. She began her studies there in the mid-80s and she finished at Oxford only a couple of years ago. Now my speech to the parliament six years ago did not say she was involved in the war on Christmas. I want to say this, her accusation of antisemitism is wrong and deeply offensive to me and my family. Mr Speaker, my grandmother was Jewish and my belief in Judeo-Christian values is deeply held. I call for her to apologise for these unsubstantiated and outrageous accusations. The fact that the Labor party has attached itself to antisemitic accusations shows just how low they\u2019re prepared to go. </p> </blockquote> <p>The last bit provokes uproar. <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> wants him to withdraw the accusation that Labor is antisemitic, which didn\u2019t really make any logical sense. </p> <p>Taylor withdraws. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-05T07:36:33.188Z\">at 7.36am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de881ec8f08eef22867db60\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-05T04:05:48.806Z\">4.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1202430936651952130\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Prime Minister Scott Morrison arrives for the last <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/qt?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#qt</a> of 2019 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GuardianAus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/knausc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@knausc</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@murpharoo</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PoliticsLive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PoliticsLive</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hEU6WqK8Ra\">https://t.co/hEU6WqK8Ra</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zHwNYioQ5F\">pic.twitter.com/zHwNYioQ5F</a></p>&mdash; Mikearoo (@mpbowers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1202430936651952130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 5, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1202431550857416704\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Battle of the football ties in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/qt?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#qt</a> Sharks VS Rabbitohs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GuardianAus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@murpharoo</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/knausc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@knausc</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PoliticsLive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PoliticsLive</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hEU6WqK8Ra\">https://t.co/hEU6WqK8Ra</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/m6DNt0aOJl\">pic.twitter.com/m6DNt0aOJl</a></p>&mdash; Mikearoo (@mpbowers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1202431550857416704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 5, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5de880288f08eef22867db5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-05T04:00:15.849Z\">4.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Morrison continues: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I understand the leader of the opposition is very angry, Mr Speaker, and he\u2019s angry because the government is standing up for those who don\u2019t want to see thuggery and bullying in their workplace, particularly against women, Mr Speaker. </p> </blockquote> <p>He accuses Labor of<strong> attempting to attack his faith,</strong> which prompts uproar from Labor.

He\u2019s speaking about changes to the public service. The Australian reported this morning that he was \u201c<strong>poised to put an axe through the public service</strong> today with plans to dramatically cut the number of government departments with another round of mandarins set for the chopping block\u201d.</p> <p>Morrison announces he will reduce the <strong>number of government departments from 18 to 14</strong>. He says the APS will need to provide services more \u201cefficiently and effectively\u201d.</p> <p>This sounds very much like a <strong>standard machinery of government change</strong>. Departments being renamed and subsumed into others. You know, the type we do every few years for some reason. </p> <p>Every time this happens, I can only think of all the corporate merchandise that\u2019s suddenly become redundant due to departmental name changes. I\u2019m weird, I know. But what do they do with it all? So many spare pens. We could use them over here at the Guardian, just FYI, if departments are feeling charitable.</p> <p>So far he\u2019s named changes to the education, agriculture, environment and industry portfolios. We\u2019ll have a full list of changes shortly. </p> <p>Morrison says he wants a public service that \u201cis very much focused on implementation\u201d. <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They [public servants] should expect from us clear direction, and we should continue to expect from them being able to continue to discharge their duties in the incredibly professional way they do. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T23:59:48.372Z\">at 11.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de841588f08e7796de8ce44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T23:42:04.958Z\">11.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mick Keelty</strong>, the inspector general of the <strong>Murray-Darling basin water resources</strong>, spoke to ABC radio a little earlier about just what the government has asked him to do. Keelty was tasked with a review of water sharing arrangement amid damaging protests for the Nationals in Canberra this week. </p> <p>He\u2019s asked precisely what he\u2019s actually going to do: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In plain speak, whilst there\u2019s been a lot of attention focussed on the Murray-Darling basin plan, what the federal minister David Littleproud was able to broker this week, and to his great credit ... without jumping to a conclusion is what is happening now is the inquiry will actually properly define what the problem is. Is the problem the Murray-Darling basin plan and the operations of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, or is it something deeper than that? </p> <p>Were the plans [the water sharing agreements] developed at a period of time where the inflows, particularly from the northern basin, were actually happening? And of course for the past two years, they haven\u2019t been happening there\u2019s nothing in the northern basin coming through and feeding into the system. </p> </blockquote> <p>Keelty is asked how the protesters, <strong>previously furious at Littleproud</strong> and the Nationals, came away feeling comfortable with the result. He said the protesters were not <strong>promised any additional water as a result of the review</strong>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nobody has promised more water.

You don\u2019t measure whether someone is in need of healthcare ... by whether they are in hospital. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T22:23:58.575Z\">at 10.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de822df8f08e7796de8cd71\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T21:36:02.219Z\">9.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The day to come</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So what exactly are we expecting from today? </p> <ul> <li>Well, it\u2019s another day of parliament, so of course we can expect another <strong>Angus Taylor</strong> controversy. And lo and behold, it\u2019s not yet hit 8.30am, and there\u2019s already something unfolding. <strong>Naomi Wolf</strong>, the well-known US author, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/05/naomi-wolf-angus-taylor-formal-correction-christmas-tree-row\">is on the warpath</a> against the minister over his misrepresentation of an alleged encounter they had at <strong>Oxford University in their student days</strong>. That encounter happened, in Taylor\u2019s telling, at a time when Wolf was on the other side of the ocean. We\u2019ll bring you a bit more about that in a moment. On another Taylor front, there were reports yesterday naming the staffer said to have obtained and distributed the document with dodgy figures about the City of Sydney council\u2019s travel expenditure. Expect more of a pursuit on that from Labor. </li> <li>We\u2019re also anticipating more fallout from the <strong>medevac repeal</strong> yesterday. The critical question remains: what did <strong>Jacqui</strong><strong> Lambie</strong> secure from the government in <strong>exchange for her crucial vote</strong>? There\u2019s been some suggestion that she\u2019s won an agreement from the government to pursue the resettlement of refugees from Manus and Nauru. But she\u2019s staying silent on the whole thing, and the government is insisting there is \u201cno secret deal\u201d.</li> <li>The <strong>Murray-Darling basin</strong> is continuing to cause headaches for the Nationals. The government has announced a <strong>review of water sharing in the Murray-Darling</strong>. The protesters have left Canberra with a sense of victory. But the question remains: what will the review actually achieve? How will it deliver more water for those without any? Have the Nationals actually resolved the issue? </li> <li>The <strong>poor school </strong><strong>results</strong> out yesterday are still prompting reaction this morning. <strong>Tanya Plibersek </strong>has been out this morning saying the focus must be on teacher investment, through professional development and mentoring. The government says throwing more money at the problem is not working. </li> <li>There\u2019s another <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/gladys-liu-demanded-liberal-party-pay-back-her-100k-donation-20191204-p53gvp.html\">report out this morning in the Sydney Morning Herald</a> about <strong>Gladys Liu</strong>, reporting that she asked the Liberal party to give her back a donation of at least $100,000. The report claims Liu says the donation she gave was a loan. <br></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T22:24:45.428Z\">at 10.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de821a08f08eef22867d931\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T21:18:51.135Z\">9.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Happy <strong>last sitting day of the year</strong>! </p> <p>It\u2019s a momentous occasion.

      "bodyText": "Rightio. Stick a fork in me. Done. The House and the Senate have adjourned. That\u2019s the end of another sitting year. It\u2019s been a rollercoaster. Thankfully, I\u2019ve only been trapped on it for the past week. That\u2019s been more than enough, let me assure you. Loyal readers, thank you so much for sticking with us throughout. Just want to pay tribute to the incredible Amy Remeikis, Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. Feeding this beast is an almighty effort. This week\u2019s blog will have been a window into the steady disintegration of my mind. But it\u2019s only been four days. Amy and co do it all year. Just to recap the day\u2019s events. Angus Taylor decided to double down on his fight with *checks notes* Naomi Wolf, calling for her to apologise for inferring he was antisemitic after he inferred she was at war with Christmas during their Oxford years. Wolf also doubled down, saying Taylor had his facts wrong and was peddling divisive lies about her. The government rammed its union bashing bill through the lower house this morning, gagging debate, and causing outrage all round by not letting the opposition speak on the bill. Anthony Albanese likened it to totalitarianism. Scott Morrison said unions were full of thugs, so who cares. There was continuing fallout to the repeal of medevac. Human rights groups continued to criticise the decision and Labor and the Greens continued to demand an explanation of Jacqui Lambie\u2019s deal with the government. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern said her offer of resettlement was still on the table but said Australia had not approached her government for talks in recent days. Morrison announced a raft of machinery of government changes, reducing the number of departments from 18 to 14 and getting rid of five departmental secretaries. The overhaul was criticised for concentrating power and undermining the cabinet system. It also saw the promotion of Andrew Metcalfe, Morrison\u2019s old immigration secretary. Thanks again. Merry Christmas from the blog. Stay safe. The UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, has released a statement expressing its disappointment at the repeal of the medevac legislation on Wednesday. It has also urged the government to accept the New Zealand offer to resettle refugees. \u201cSince its commencement earlier this year, the medevac mechanism had proven to be a timely, effective and often life-saving safeguard,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cAfter more than six years of uncertainty regarding solutions, UNHCR is extremely concerned that the health situation of asylum seekers and refugees will continue to deteriorate. \u201cIn the absence of the now repealed medevac mechanisms, UNHCR urges the government of Australia to continue utilising pre-existing legislative processes in a good faith effort to evacuate individuals in need of urgent medical treatment. \u201cAs Australia retains responsibility for people forcibly transferred under its offshore arrangements, UNHCR urges the government of Australia to find appropriate solutions including taking up the longstanding offer by New Zealand to resettle refugees and to prevent further harm.\u201d In spillover Senate estimates, jobs department officials have revealed that businesses which take a jobseeker on in a PaTH internship do not need to host for the full four weeks to be paid $1,000 for the placement \u2013 only five days. The top five businesses providing PaTH internships are: Yacoub family trust, AHS hospitality, Coles, Woolworths and Hog\u2019s Breath Caf\u00e9. Officials said the employment rate (that is, the proportion of interns who get proper employment at the end of the placement) for those five businesses is 53.8%, compared with 60.8% for all providers offering more than 10 internships. Anthony Albanese gives his version of the love-in speech. He signs it off with: As Naomi Wolf would say, have a lovely Christmas. Better things are happening in the Senate. Trust me. Scott Morrison is summing up the year in the lower house as we reach the end of the sitting year. He thanks the public for returning the Coalition to government and speaks of the great challenges Australians have faced in terms of natural disasters this year. This is the time when everyone pretends to be nice to everyone else. So that we all leave with warm fuzzy feelings in our hearts. Yay. Scott Morrison says to Anthony Albanese: It is also fitting of this time of the year to extend to the leader of the opposition and his family my very best wishes for Christmas and the holiday season. Whether he\u2019ll be watching re-runs of old footy games or I\u2019ll be, who knows. But I do hope he has a wonderful Christmas and New Year period with his family... and a bit of rest. Haha, yeah. Who knows? No one\u2019s watching old footy re-runs. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Labor\u2019s Mark Butler is pointing out the bizarre nature of Angus Taylor\u2019s statement on Naomi Wolf in parliament today. He tells the ABC: I\u2019m not sure who knows better than her where she was in 1991. Instead Angus Taylor doubled down, he not only said she was there in 1991. He told question time that she\u2019d been there since the mid-1980s until a few years ago. The Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman and the Labor MP Anne Aly are on the ABC. They\u2019re asked whether they think question time today was an edifying display. Spoiler alert: nah, it wasn\u2019t. Zimmerman says it\u2019s the name calling and the heat that people object to. I think question time generally is something most Australians struggle to come to terms with. Aly says it fails at its core objective of actually getting answers. I\u2019m in that category of people who had never watched question time before I came to parliament. I went into my first question time with a pen and paper thinking we were actually going to get answers. Wolf says she had never heard of Taylor before three days ago. I\u2019ve never met this man. I didn\u2019t know who he was until three days ago when I was alerted to these lies about me. Particularly at the time of her book\u2019s release: Respectfully to Mr Taylor, I wasn\u2019t paying attention to him, whoever he is. She\u2019s asked if there\u2019s a stalemate. I didn\u2019t pick this fight, [he] decided to say things about me that are simply and categorically not true. It\u2019s up to him as an elected official to correct the record. Wolf: As a woman, I find it objectionable that I\u2019m having to document my entire life.... he should apologise and more importantly, this is not about me, he should correct the record. She sticks to her guns on the charge of antisemitism. I do think that\u2019s antisemitic. I stand by what I said. She says the comments were clearly religiously divisive and false. Wolf responds to Taylor\u2019s statement that his grandmother is Jewish. I mean, respectfully, I\u2019m glad he comes from such a diverse family. As I said earlier, I have no argument with his family. I do think it was inappropriate to say I was somewhere I wasn\u2019t, doing something I wasn\u2019t doing. She insists she was not in Oxford, despite Angus Taylor\u2019s repeated claim that he remembers meeting her there. She holds up a list of the bookseller list for that year, and it shows her book at No 13. She also refers to a friend who can confirm she was not in Oxford that year. I shouldn\u2019t have to identify where I was. He has said things that are completely, provably wrong. There are multiple eyewitnesses. Naomi Wolf has conducted an interview with the ABC. She said her phone call with Angus Taylor\u2019s office was not \u201cheated\u201d, but was firm. I think that I was firmly requesting a correction because Angus Taylor has made statements about me in very public forums misstating that I was among graduate students at Oxford in 1991 who were campaigning against Christmas. She says a profile in the Australian Financial Review on Taylor, which repeated the claim, is currently being corrected by the newspaper. I wasn\u2019t there in 1991, I was in New York, I had written what many people think is a very important feminist text. I was touring all over the world with it... and I\u2019ve never campaigned against Christmas. She continues: I really object to my name and reputation being misused by an elected official to tell a false story. Wolf responds to Taylor\u2019s attack in parliament today. Taylor asked her to apologise for calling him antisemitic. She says: I have to say I\u2019m quite taken aback by what you\u2019re telling me. I think it\u2019s very inappropriate, and very wrong. The government\u2019s plans to merge the family court have hit a bit of a snag. The proposal to merge the federal and federal circuit courts was condemned by the Law Council of Australia and other legal groups which warned earlier this week that it risked \u201cvictims of family violence falling through the cracks\u201d. The Senate has set a reporting date on the legislation by November 2020. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, says this has \u201ceffectively put a one-year hold\u201d on the plan. Dreyfus: Mr Porter stunned many in the family court sector in May last year when he announced plans to destroy the family court on the basis of a six-week desktop review by a firm of consultants. Earlier this year, a comprehensive report by the Australian Law Reform Commission \u2013 which the government commissioned and is still to respond to \u2013 totally contradicted the attorney general by recommending the creation of an entirely new court system and greater specialisation in the family law system. The Morrison government has not responded to that ALRC report. Instead Mr Porter reached agreement with One Nation to hold yet another inquiry into the family law system. Albanese moves on to Angus Taylor. He wonders whether the Naomi Wolf scandal might \u201cget up on TV tonight\u201d. I think it might, I think it might. Because the extraordinary attack on Naomi Wolf, who was in New York, not a roomie, at college in the United Kingdom at the time. At that very year she had the number one bestselling book in the world! Like, this wasn\u2019t someone obscure, and what did he do? He ripped into her. Nothing to see here. She should apologise. To him! to him! Like he\u2019s the victim... and this prime minister keeps running a protection racket for this bloke. It is the witness protection program that this man has. Question time ends. Anthony Albanese leaps up to speak. He says Scott Morrison is acting as though he\u2019s been on a \u201cvictory lap\u201d since the election and had won 100% of the vote. We\u2019re not a one-party state, he says. This is a democracy. This is the greatest jackboot administration that we have seen, and today in sacking five departmental heads, what they have also done is centralised power at the centre. Because when you have multiple cabinet ministers with a single department... all power gets centralised to prime minister and cabinet. The fact is that this government regards democracy as an inconvenience, one that can be dismissed at any time. Things are deteriorating here. Lots of anger, lots of bile. Lots of insults followed by withdrawals. Urgh. Pull the plug already. Mark Butler turns the attack to Angus Taylor. He asks a question that mentions allegations Taylor lied about going to Oxford with the US author Naomi Wolf, who Taylor spoke about in the context of students warring on Christmas and wanting to remove a Christmas tree from their common room. Taylor comes out swinging. He reckons he did see Wolf at Oxford, despite her saying she was on the other side of the world at the time. Of course I recall seeing and meeting Ms Wolf at New College in Oxford during my time there. She began her studies there in the mid-80s and she finished at Oxford only a couple of years ago. Now my speech to the parliament six years ago did not say she was involved in the war on Christmas. I want to say this, her accusation of antisemitism is wrong and deeply offensive to me and my family. Mr Speaker, my grandmother was Jewish and my belief in Judeo-Christian values is deeply held. I call for her to apologise for these unsubstantiated and outrageous accusations. The fact that the Labor party has attached itself to antisemitic accusations shows just how low they\u2019re prepared to go. The last bit provokes uproar. Anthony Albanese wants him to withdraw the accusation that Labor is antisemitic, which didn\u2019t really make any logical sense. Taylor withdraws. Morrison continues: I understand the leader of the opposition is very angry, Mr Speaker, and he\u2019s angry because the government is standing up for those who don\u2019t want to see thuggery and bullying in their workplace, particularly against women, Mr Speaker. He accuses Labor of attempting to attack his faith, which prompts uproar from Labor. Morrison: That\u2019s what you did, that\u2019s what you did. Tony Burke is furious and says that attack is \u201cvery personal\u201d and should be withdrawn. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, asks Scott Morrison why he doesn\u2019t believe in integrity and accountability, before rattling off a series of examples. The treatment of the union bill this morning, misleading parliament, his phone call over the NSW police investigation into Angus Taylor, why he was sacked as chief executive of Tourism Australia, and why he invited Brian Houston to the White House. The question prompts shouts of \u201csmear\u201d, \u201csmear\u201d, \u201cno policy\u201d and \u201cmuckraking\u201d from the government benches. Morrison repeats a line from earlier this week. This is question time, it\u2019s not smear time. Tanya Plibersek asks why Scott Morrison has lied about reducing funding for Tafe. He responds: As the member would know, funding for Tafe is provided by state and territory governments ... so the member can\u2019t come and say things that are simply untrue. Scott Morrison is asked a question on what he is doing to increase the number of nurses in aged care facilities. I will take that matter up, and make sure I get an answer, Mr Speaker. He speaks about the aged care royal commission. It is very distressing what was reported in that report, and as that report reflected this deals with issues that have been endemic that have been in the aged care sector for a very long time and the government is seeking to address the issues in aged care, which are serious and substantial. Morrison says they are increasing the number of aged care places, and reducing the use of chemical restraints and the number of young people ending up in care. A couple of economic questions from Labor. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, asks why we have falling investment, a weakening economy, flat wages and rising unemployment, when the government promised to build a stronger economy. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg: The shadow treasurer referred to investment. I can confirm that under the Coalition that investment outside of the mining sector has increased 34% since we\u2019ve come to office, or over 5% per year. Now under the Labor party, investment outside of the mining sector fell by 10% during their time in office. Heaps of gesticulating for the dixers. Andrew Laming giving it a red hot animated go with his \u201cdown, down, Labor debt down\u201d line to Josh Frydenberg. Albanese asks again about the government\u2019s rushing through of the union-busting bill this morning without debate. Why does this prime minister not respect the democratic process? Morrison says the bill was debated extensively last week. This issue, this matter of dealing with thuggish, militant unionism is something the Australian people wanted us to address. We stand up for what we believe in. This matter has been through this place before, it\u2019s been up in the Senate before. It went through some 15 or 16 hours of debate in the other place, Mr Speaker. He continues: I will stand up against thugs, Mr Speaker. The Labor party stands up for thugs. Last day of school vibes going on here. Couple of Labor MPs have been booted, including Joel Fitzgibbon. Michael McCormack leaps up. He\u2019s had a running war with Fitzgibbon all week. Well the average IQ of the chamber just went up, see you Joel, have a nice Christmas mate. Albanese asks the prime minister, Scott Morrison, why he has failed to bring on legislation following the banking royal commission but broke precedents to ram through the union-busting legislation this morning. Morrison said: I introduced the laws that ensured the banking executives who did the wrong thing should be punted forever. That\u2019s what I did, Mr Speaker, and those opposite sought to frustrate it. He said \u201cugly militant unionism should have no place in this country\u201d. Morrison gets a tough one from his backbenches. Australia is the best country in the world, as we all know, so tell us why you\u2019re so great etc etc. Question time is upon us. Anthony Albanese says the government won\u2019t support freedom of speech, won\u2019t support freedom to protest and now won\u2019t support debate in parliament. He refers to the union-busting legislation that was pushed through the lower house without debate. When the prime minister talks about quiet Australians, doesn\u2019t he actually mean silent Australians? Morrison says: On the night of the election, I thanked all those Australians who go about their lives honestly decently with their aspirations. They\u2019re the Australians our government spoke directly to, Mr Speaker. Morrison says Albanese has spent his political career focussed on the \u201cbubble of this place\u201d and the \u201ctawdry drama of Canberra\u201d. The mystery of the missing bills, by Mike Bowers. OK, I\u2019m calling it. Speech of the week goes to Tim Watts. Hands down. Watts is the Labor MP who last week tweeted about Angus Taylor\u2019s first speech and its references to Naomi Wolf and a plot to remove a Christmas tree from their Oxford common room. The US author has since slammed Taylor\u2019s speech as wildly inaccurate and ethnically divisive. \u201cThe response was, well, unexpected,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a cautionary tale straight [from] Aesop\u2019s Fables that summed up the minister\u2019s career to date. You could call it: the boy who cried Wolf.\u201d I\u2019ll let Watts, who read from a mock book of fairy tales, do the rest. Here\u2019s how it goes. Once there was a grasslands boy who wanted to be prime minister. One day for no comprehensible reason, the boy who wanted to be prime minister shouted \u2018Wolf, Wolf, Wolf, Wolf, there\u2019s a Wolf trying to steal Christmas\u2019. But when people looked, there was no wolf. Later, the boy who wanted to be prime minister sang out again \u2018a man from Yass, a man from Yass, a man from Yass asked me to protect my grasslands from meddling environmental regulation\u2019. But when the people looked, there was no man from Yass. Later, the boy who wanted to be prime minister sang out again \u2018a junketeering mayor, a junketeering mayor, a junketeering mayor spending millions of dollars on flights\u2019. But when the people looked, there was no junketeering mayor. One day, the boy who wanted to be prime minister was lying in his grasslands when a taskforce Garrad came upon him. The boy who wanted to be prime minister shouted \u2018a smear, a smear, a smear\u2019. But when the people looked, there was no smear. One day, the boy who cried Wolf will tell the truth. But well, that bit hasn\u2019t happened here yet. But if you believe in fairy tales, maybe one day it will. Labor is moving a motion saying the government\u2019s attempts to push the union-busting bill through without debate was \u201canti-democratic\u201d. Better still is this bit of the motion: This is a prime ministerial tantrum, with the prime minister of Australia behaving like a juvenile schoolyard bully just because he didn\u2019t get his way last week. Yeah, dunno, but not sure the government will go for this one. We\u2019re now moving through the votes for the government\u2019s union-busting bill. The Community and Public Sector Union, the main union representing public servants, said the changes announced by the prime minister today will do nothing to enhance service delivery. The union says the major review of the public service, conducted by David Thodey, did not suggest creating new super departments, and instead suggested the opposite. The CPSU national secretary, Melissa Donnelly, said: It is clear that the prime minister is out of ideas. First he borrowed Services Australia from the NSW government, now super-departments. Moving buildings and merging departments does not fix the service crisis created by his own government. We know that since 2013 18,908 or 11.4% of public service jobs have been cut under successive Liberal governments, causing enormous damage to the capacity of the commonwealth to deliver policy and essential services that all Australians rely upon. This change will not do anything to address the 48 million unanswered calls to DHS in 2017/2018 or the further 5.3 million calls abandoned out of frustration. These are not the actions of a good government. This won\u2019t change the delays in the family court, and it won\u2019t change the challenges our CSIRO face. Rightio. Well, now the speaker has done a bit of digging. And it turns out there were in fact copies of the bills in the House, despite all of that. Speaker Tony Smith says: I\u2019ve been able to ascertain some facts, I realise emotions are running high. I can report that notwithstanding the view ... that there were no bills present. That was not correct. I have checked. There were bills present. I\u2019m not going to have an argument about this. Prior to the ringing of the bells there were 25 copies, Smith says. Another 40 copies were being brought in. More were being printed. Enough for everyone! Mike Bowers captured the government benches as they attempted to gag debate and pass union-busting legislation on the last sitting day of the year. He\u2019s still in the chamber and tells me the clerks and attendants are running around, pointing at to a pile on the desk, and saying they were there all along. Anthony Albanese is responding to that mess in the House as we speak. This is a prime minister who doesn\u2019t want scrutiny from the media, he doesn\u2019t want scrutiny from the parliament either. And we\u2019ve seen this today. Albanese likens the government\u2019s actions to a \u201ctotalitarian state\u201d. We have now had the parliament shut down because the government is incapable of running a basic democratic process. Here they run in, they gag debate, they refuse to allow anyone to speak, to push through legislation. To what end? So that they can make a point that even though they lost in the Senate last week, they won in the House today. Right, well, that was a bit of a circus. My head is still spinning. Just to recap: the government sought to move quickly on its union-busing legislation this morning, suspending usual business to get straight to it. then it tried to gag debate in a way Tony Burke described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d. then the vote was called. But the opposition said it had not seen a copy of the bill it was supposed to be voting on. The government said there were copies in the chamber, but Labor insisted it hasn\u2019t seen them. it prompted uproar. Labor are and were outraged. All the while, MPs are unable to stand to speak during the division, so they\u2019re sitting down with pieces of paper or books on their head as a signal they have the call. Speaker Tony Smith considers the issue momentarily. He decides that, yes, people probably should have access to copies of the legislation they are voting on. Fair, I would have thought. He suspends the vote for 15 minutes to get copies. Anthony Albanese has called a press conference. The vote is being called off momentarily so we can all cool our heads. We\u2019ve suspended sitting for about 15 minutes to sort it all out. We\u2019re now stuck in the lower house in a very bizarre situation. Labor are saying they do not have copies of the union-busting legislation they are voting on. The government says it brought 60 copies in yesterday. The speaker, Tony Smith, initially demands legislation be brought in. Then there\u2019s confusion because he receives updated advice saying the copies of the legislation were previously in the chamber. Stay tuned. There\u2019s an interesting development in the Senate. Labor has moved (with government support I gather) to establish a new select committee into foreign interference in democracy through social media. Chris and I (and other colleagues at Guardian Australia) have been very attentive to this fake news/misinformation phenomenon having looked deeply into the death tax campaign on Facebook during the May election. Here\u2019s the meat of the motion that\u2019s about to be moved by the Labor senator Jenny McAllister. (1) That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media, be established to inquire into and report on the risk posed to Australia\u2019s democracy by foreign interference through social media, with particular reference to: (a) use of social media for purposes that undermine Australia\u2019s democracy and values, including the spread of misinformation; (b) responses to mitigate the risk posed to Australia\u2019s democracy and values, including by the Australian Government and social media platforms; (c) international policy responses to cyber-enabled foreign interference and misinformation; (d) the extent of compliance with Australian laws; and (e) any related matters. (2) That the committee present its final report on or before the second sitting day of May 2022. This inquiry will be one to watch in the new year. Incidentally, Labor has also asked the JSCEM (the joint parliamentary committee on electoral matters) to look at the role of misinformation on the platforms as part of the inquiry it does every election cycle into the conduct of the last federal election. Strange scenes in the lower house. Members are unable to stand to speak, so are signalling they want the call by placing a book or paper on their head. Drama down in the house. The government is returning its union-busting \u201censuring integrity\u201d bill, which was defeated on Friday after a shock last-minute switch by One Nation. The bill is currently before the lower house again. But the Coalition is trying to gag debate. It prompts uproar in the chamber. Labor leader Anthony Albanese says the government is attempting to use gag orders that were never intended to limit debate for partisan or party political reasons. It is my view that the government is using this provision to shut down democratic debate in this parliament and it is an abuse of our democratic processes. Tony Burke says the government\u2019s actions are unprecedented. What is happening right now is a change in the role of this house... as to whether it is a parliamentary debating chamber or whether it is only here for the voice of the prime minister and his chosen ministers. Albanese says Labor is being asked to vote on legislation it hasn\u2019t seen. We are being asked now to vote on legislation which I don\u2019t have, there are no copies anywhere. how can we possibly do that. is it within standing orders for us to be voting on legislation, I don\u2019t know what it is. It is appropriate for us to be voting on this without having copies of it? Reports in the Channel Nine newspapers this morning confirmed the government is pressing ahead with plans to privatise Australia\u2019s visa processing services. The shadow assistant immigration minister, Andrew Giles, was out on the hustings this morning, saying the position leaves 2,000 workers going into Christmas in fear of losing their jobs. This is isn\u2019t good enough we know that this is a terrible idea. We know this because everyone has been saying so. This is an absolutely friendless proposal. Former secretaries of the immigration department have referred to the risks to the integrity of our system, risks also to national security. The Community and Public Sector Union has warned that this could be the new robodebt implemented. And we know what will happen in Australia, because we\u2019ve seen what has happened in the UK with their visa system that has been privatised. We\u2019ve seen massive cuts to services and the creation of a two-tier system, where people who can afford to pay get a fast track system. In Australia we\u2019re not hearing enough about why the government is doing this. The United Firefighters Union was at Parliament House this morning speaking out about the effects of climate change and the extending and intensifying the fire season. From their statement: The United Firefighters Union of Australia passed a unanimous resolution at its national council in Canberra demanding a national approach that would allow firefighting to operate seamlessly across borders, improving the compatibility and capacity of different state and territory services, and boosting the number of professional firefighters. The national council of the UFU passed the resolution calling for an \u201curgent phase-out of coal, oil, and gas\u201d because they are \u201cdriving more dangerous and intense fires\u201d. The UFU national president, Greg McConville, said: Now is absolutely the time to talk about climate change and the ever more intense fires being fought by our members. We are stretched to breaking point. The fire season is longer and more intense than ever. We need to begin work now to boost the nation\u2019s firefighting capacity and make it truly interoperable. Interesting point on the machinery of government changes from Markus Mannheim. Stephen Jones, the shadow assistant treasurer, is on Sky News saying Morrison should accept the New Zealand deal to get children off Manus Island and Nauru. He rejects the government\u2019s insistence that there are no more kids there. Jones urged Morrison to be \u201cpragmatic\u201d and take the NZ deal. The politics of it are toxic and the humanity of it gets left out when the politics gets injected into it. The PM announcing an overhaul of the public service, courtesy of Mike Bowers. The PM\u2019s office has just released a more detailed list of those changes. They will take effect from February. Here\u2019s the full list: The creation of the Department of Education, Skills and Employment, which will consolidate the current Department of Education; and the current Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business. The creation of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, which will consolidate: the current Department of Agriculture; and environment functions from the current Department of the Environment and Energy. The creation of the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, which will consolidate: the current Department of Industry, Innovation and Science; energy functions from the current Department of the Environment and Energy; and small business functions from the current Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business. The creation of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications, which will consolidate: the current Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development; and the current Department of Communications and the Arts. The Department known as Services Australia (formerly known as the Department of Human Services) will be established as a new Executive Agency, within the Social Services Department. Just to recap on those machinery of government changes: the education and employment departments are being merged the agriculture department is combining with the environment department energy will be merged with the industry, innovation and science department The communications and arts portfolio is being merged with infrastructure and transport department A few interesting tidbits there. Energy is being decoupled from environment. But emissions reduction stays with energy. Just to reiterate, the PM is proposing no costs savings and no job losses, aside from the five departmental secretaries. Morrison is asked whether the government will consider New Zealand\u2019s offer to take refugees from Manus and Nauru. We\u2019ve always been very aware of the New Zealand government\u2019s offer. The government will continue to implement its policies as we\u2019ve set them out. Scott Morrison says he has full confidence in Angus Taylor. What Angus has done in the past six months to get the big stick legislation through, to ensure the dodgy late payment fees that are charged by energy companies, they\u2019re all gone. The policy performance of Angus Taylor is not under question. Morrison says this is not a \u201csavings measure\u201d. So department secretaries and others will undertake the normal things that they do in managing their budgets. This isn\u2019t about any cost saving measures. I expect frankly all departmental secretaries to be maximising efficiencies. Morrison says there will be no change to ministerial portfolios. I\u2019m very pleased, very pleased, with the performance of all my ministers. Morrison announces we\u2019re losing five departmental secretaries as part of the shake-up. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is speaking to the media. He\u2019s speaking about changes to the public service. The Australian reported this morning that he was \u201cpoised to put an axe through the public service today with plans to dramatically cut the number of government departments with another round of mandarins set for the chopping block\u201d. Morrison announces he will reduce the number of government departments from 18 to 14. He says the APS will need to provide services more \u201cefficiently and effectively\u201d. This sounds very much like a standard machinery of government change. Departments being renamed and subsumed into others. You know, the type we do every few years for some reason. Every time this happens, I can only think of all the corporate merchandise that\u2019s suddenly become redundant due to departmental name changes. I\u2019m weird, I know. But what do they do with it all? So many spare pens. We could use them over here at the Guardian, just FYI, if departments are feeling charitable. So far he\u2019s named changes to the education, agriculture, environment and industry portfolios. We\u2019ll have a full list of changes shortly. Morrison says he wants a public service that \u201cis very much focused on implementation\u201d. They [public servants] should expect from us clear direction, and we should continue to expect from them being able to continue to discharge their duties in the incredibly professional way they do. Mick Keelty, the inspector general of the Murray-Darling basin water resources, spoke to ABC radio a little earlier about just what the government has asked him to do. Keelty was tasked with a review of water sharing arrangement amid damaging protests for the Nationals in Canberra this week. He\u2019s asked precisely what he\u2019s actually going to do: In plain speak, whilst there\u2019s been a lot of attention focussed on the Murray-Darling basin plan, what the federal minister David Littleproud was able to broker this week, and to his great credit ... without jumping to a conclusion is what is happening now is the inquiry will actually properly define what the problem is. Is the problem the Murray-Darling basin plan and the operations of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, or is it something deeper than that? Were the plans [the water sharing agreements] developed at a period of time where the inflows, particularly from the northern basin, were actually happening? And of course for the past two years, they haven\u2019t been happening there\u2019s nothing in the northern basin coming through and feeding into the system. Keelty is asked how the protesters, previously furious at Littleproud and the Nationals, came away feeling comfortable with the result. He said the protesters were not promised any additional water as a result of the review. Nobody has promised more water. There is no more water to give under the current rules. That has been exhaustively examined by both the commonwealth and the individuals involved. But there is water around. The prime minister has just called a press conference for 10.30am. Stick with us. On the Murray Darling, Nationals MP Damian Drum is saying the water-sharing agreements between the states are outdated. He hopes the review by Mick Keelty, the Murray-Darling inspector general, will improve them. These agreements have been in place for over 100 years. But the water regime that now exists ... so much of the water used to be used next to the storage, now the users of the water are 400km away from the storage. Drum was out the front of parliament with Barnaby Joyce a little earlier this week, copping an earful from farmers. He says: The Nationals have got to lead the way because people expect us to fix it. they don\u2019t expect the Liberals to fix it, they don\u2019t expect Labor to fix it, and they know the Greens will only make it worse. Greens senator Nick McKim urges the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to pick up the phone and talk to Jacinda Ardern for the \u201csake of humanity\u201d. In regard to prime minister Morrison, I think he needs to pick up the phone. Make the arrangement with New Zealand. There is no need for him to wait until the US arrangements have concluded. You can walk and chew gum at the same time. I\u2019d urge him to do that for the sake of humanity. Ardern is asked whether New Zealand would consider preventing asylum seekers who go to NZ on resettlement would be prevented from later coming to Australia. She says: If that was a scenario to be created, it would be created by Australia and ultimately it would be in their own domestic policy ... It would be a matter for them. During the interview, Ardern mentions multiple times the deportation of New Zealand citizens from Australia, an issue that has caused much angst across the Tasman. Ardern is asked whether she would want something in return for accepting refugees. She says: That is not how we operate our relationship. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has spoken to Sky News. She said NZ\u2019s offer was still on the table. Yes, that has not changed, but as I say the ball is obviously in Australia\u2019s court. She says Australia has not approached NZ about the deal recently. No discussions at that level and as I say ... as far as I\u2019m concerned we are still in the same status quo. On to other things. Adam Bandt is planning to move to suspend standing orders in the lower house. He wants the house to note that the medevac repeal deal was done in secret. Naomi Wolf is really going after Angus Taylor on this one. I\u2019ll let her tweets do the talking. My colleague Helen Davidson has just filed on further developments in the unlikely stoush between Angus Taylor and the US author Naomi Wolf: Naomi Wolf has reignited her stoush with Australia\u2019s energy minister, Angus Taylor, publishing what she said was a transcript of a phone call with his office. On Thursday morning the US author said she had recorded a call to Taylor\u2019s parliamentary office requesting a \u201cformal correction\u201d to the Hansard record of his maiden speech, asking that Taylor \u201ctell Parliament please that I was not campaigning against Xmas in any way?\u201d Taylor referred to Wolf in his maiden speech to parliament in 2013 while recounting an anecdote about \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and a dispute over a Christmas tree at Oxford University in 1991, when he was a Rhodes scholar. When Wolf was alerted to the speech on Monday she pointed out that she was not at Oxford in 1991 and accused the minister of \u201cantisemitic dogwhistling\u201d. On Thursday Wolf said Taylor\u2019s staffer had told her that all media who had reported on the story had been given the advice that she was not campaigning against Christmas. \u201cCan I have evidence?\u201d Wolf said. The spokesman responded: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, obviously we can\u2019t prove that has been provided.\u201d The fallout is continuing from the Australian government\u2019s repeal of medevac laws. Australia is now being urged to take New Zealand\u2019s offer to accept 150 refugees from Manus and Nauru a year. We mentioned earlier that there is speculation that Jacqui Lambie was pursuing resettlement when she gave her vote to the government. David Manne, executive director of the Refugee &amp; Immigration Legal Centre, said there was no logic to the government\u2019s refusal to accept the NZ offer. He described suggestions that it would create a \u201cpull\u201d factor for people wanting to come to Australia as \u201cspurious\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any rational sense,\u201d he told Sky News. Manne also dismisses the government\u2019s figures showing that most of those who came to Australia through medevac are not in hospital. We\u2019ve reported already that medevac is designed for assessment and healthcare, not just acute hospital care, so it\u2019s not surprising. Manne makes a similar point: When someone is sick, sometimes they\u2019re in hospital, sometimes they\u2019re not. You don\u2019t measure whether someone is in need of healthcare ... by whether they are in hospital. So what exactly are we expecting from today? Well, it\u2019s another day of parliament, so of course we can expect another Angus Taylor controversy. And lo and behold, it\u2019s not yet hit 8.30am, and there\u2019s already something unfolding. Naomi Wolf, the well-known US author, is on the warpath against the minister over his misrepresentation of an alleged encounter they had at Oxford University in their student days. That encounter happened, in Taylor\u2019s telling, at a time when Wolf was on the other side of the ocean. We\u2019ll bring you a bit more about that in a moment. On another Taylor front, there were reports yesterday naming the staffer said to have obtained and distributed the document with dodgy figures about the City of Sydney council\u2019s travel expenditure. Expect more of a pursuit on that from Labor. We\u2019re also anticipating more fallout from the medevac repeal yesterday. The critical question remains: what did Jacqui Lambie secure from the government in exchange for her crucial vote? There\u2019s been some suggestion that she\u2019s won an agreement from the government to pursue the resettlement of refugees from Manus and Nauru. But she\u2019s staying silent on the whole thing, and the government is insisting there is \u201cno secret deal\u201d. The Murray-Darling basin is continuing to cause headaches for the Nationals. The government has announced a review of water sharing in the Murray-Darling. The protesters have left Canberra with a sense of victory. But the question remains: what will the review actually achieve? How will it deliver more water for those without any? Have the Nationals actually resolved the issue? The poor school results out yesterday are still prompting reaction this morning. Tanya Plibersek has been out this morning saying the focus must be on teacher investment, through professional development and mentoring. The government says throwing more money at the problem is not working. There\u2019s another report out this morning in the Sydney Morning Herald about Gladys Liu, reporting that she asked the Liberal party to give her back a donation of at least $100,000. The report claims Liu says the donation she gave was a loan. Happy last sitting day of the year! It\u2019s a momentous occasion. Who knows what else parliament can achieve today? It\u2019s already denied doctor-led medical care to those we\u2019ve condemned to remote islands for daring to seek asylum. Hard to top, even for this bunch, you\u2019d think. But I digress. Alongside the fallout from medevac, there\u2019s plenty of issues on the boil. Angus Taylor. The Murray-Darling basin.The fallout from medevac. Chinese government influence. Stick with us and we\u2019ll get through it all together.",

      "body": "<p>By the first week of March 1915, food supplies inside the besieged fortress of Przemy\u015bl were almost exhausted. Most of the horses that could be spared had been eaten. Bran, sawdust and bone meal were used to eke out the dwindling stock of flour. Cats were nowhere to be seen \u2013 they too had been eaten. A middle-sized dog fetched 20 crowns, if its owner could be persuaded to part with it. Even mice were being traded. The hospital was filled to overflowing with collapsing people. As one of the doctors tending them observed, the most shocking thing about the starving was their indifference to their fate. \u201cThey silently and without complaint accept a cold place in the hospital, drink the slop which passes here for tea; the next day, they are moved to the morgue.\u201d</p> <p>One of the marvels of Alexander Watson\u2019s study of the bitter struggle for the fortress in 1914-1915 is his juxtaposition of magisterial technical analysis with scenes of timeless misery. The concrete and steel gun emplacements with their turrets, the fast-firing field artillery and the little wooden aeroplanes that flew in and out of the tiny fortress airstrip were all new, but the stench, the terror, the darkness, hunger and isolation were as old as the art of siege itself.</p> <p>In the last years before the outbreak of the first world war, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/09/holocaust-diary-renia-spiegel\" title=\"\">Przemy\u015bl </a>, now on the south-eastern edge of Poland near the border with Ukraine, was a high-functioning, multicultural, central European fortress on the eastern marches of the Austro-Hungarian empire. There were attractive cafes and restaurants, theatres and concert halls, lively newspapers catering to a range of ethnicities and political tastes, German, Polish and Ukrainian secondary schools and diverse religions. For all their modernity in technical terms, the two immense concentric rings of fortifications that surrounded the city felt more like reminders of the distant past than warnings of future peril.</p> <p>Within weeks of the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914, Przemy\u015bl was awash with Habsburg troops making their way towards the Russian armies. When the Russians broke the Habsburg advance, the city filled with the wounded. By 17 September, the Russians had surrounded the city and the first siege began. A renewed Habsburg offensive pushed the front back, briefly relieving the fortress, but the Russians rallied. On 8 October, a second and much more arduous siege began. It would end only when the Austro-Hungarian garrison capitulated to the Russians on 22 March 1915.</p> <p>Watson lucidly charts the progress of the military campaigns on both sides, deftly situating the struggle for Przemy\u015bl within the larger history of the eastern front. He is sharply critical of the Habsburg command, highlighting their incompetence and the recklessness with which they squandered the lives of their men. Sensible precautions were sacrificed to antiquated ideas of manliness in combat. Cavalry and infantrymen were pushed forward into withering fire. The digging of foxholes was discouraged on the grounds that it \u201cencouraged cowardice\u201d. Towards the end of the second siege, the starving inhabitants of the fortress were harassed by the Habsburg command into mounting an assault on the Russian lines, even though the chance of a breakout was zero. When the order to retreat was finally sounded, the few who had not already been shot dead or wounded were so exhausted that even under heavy enemy fire they could only limp or crawl back to their starting positions. The main villain of the piece is the Austrian chief of the general staff, General Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, a belligerent martinet who had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/08/first-world-war-causes-deliberate-accident\" title=\"\">pressed for war at every opportunity </a>and proceeded to fail at virtually every task he faced. Vain, arrogant, incapable of learning from his mistakes and shockingly insensitive to the suffering of his men, he was the most important single architect of the disasters that befell Przemy\u015bl.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>As elsewhere in areas that came under Russian control during the war, the Jews were singled out for special punishment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is much more to this book than an empathetic and evocative campaign history. Watson uses the fortress city like a jeweller\u2019s glass to show how war distorted and transformed the pre-war civilian world, poisoning it with a spirit of vendetta and ideological hatred that would not swiftly dissipate.</p> <p>The first non-combatant victims were the Ruthenes, speakers of various Ukrainian dialects who were suspected by the Austro-Hungarian military authorities of favouring the cause of the Russians. On the retreat towards Przemy\u015bl, an infantry regiment of Hungarian <em>Landsturm</em> strung up dozens of Ruthenes from trees at the side of the road. Further atrocities took place inside the fortified rings. As one commander reminisced: \u201cThere were some [Ruthenian] villages in which the entire population had to be hanged, because they pulled out Russian rifles \u2026 and fired salvos at us.\u201d</p> <p>Once the Russians were in control, a new wave of repressions began. There were attacks on Ukrainian \u201cGreek Catholic\u201d clergy, whose presence offended the incoming Russian Orthodox authorities. The occupation army embarked on a policy of \u201cRussification\u201d, whose purpose was to restore the region to its supposedly \u201cprimordial\u201d Russian condition. And, as elsewhere in the areas that came under Russian control during the war, the Jews were singled out for special punishment. There were repeated waves of arrests, public whippings and forced labour services performed before crowds of impassive Poles and Ruthenians. Sons were made to hang their fathers, before being hanged in turn; 17,000 Jews were simply deported eastward without charges of any kind.</p> <p>Watson\u2019s handling of these horrors is never gratuitous. In reconstructing in such detail the violence of the war years, he proposes an important rethinking of the history of central Europe in the 20th century. By contrast with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/09/bloodlands-stalin-timothy-snyder-review\" title=\"\">Timothy Snyder, whose <em>Bloodlands</em> </a>connects the phenomenon of ideological ultraviolence with the conflict between Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 40s, Watson backdates the inception of ethnic cleansing and racial atrocity to the era of the first world war, when the clashing protagonists were not newfangled totalitarian states, but empires of the old type. Once it was broken, the civility of the old Przemy\u015bl, in which diverse communities, for all their squabbling, had rubbed along tolerably well, did not return.</p> <p>The power of this book lies in Watson\u2019s ability to always connect such large claims to the experiences of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2007/nov/07/historybooks\" title=\"\"> the people who carried this war on their backs</a>. His eye falls on all those trapped in the fortress \u2013 the doctors, airmen, merchants, troops entrenched inside the great rings of the fortress, and the sex workers and girlfriends who hoped through love affairs or trysts with officers to lay hands on food they could take to share with their families. And when the siege was over, in March 1915, more than 100,000 troops and civilians of Przemy\u015bl made their way into Russian captivity, most of them fetching up deep in Asian Russia, where around a fifth died. One survivor, who had been 12 at the time of the siege, recalled his father\u2019s return home in 1921: \u201cHe came in at the door buckled like a centenarian.\u201d</p> <p>Watson\u2019s splendid book combines great evocative power (and flashes of sharp humour) with the ethical authority of the best history writing. The story it tells is unsettling, because it resists any attempt to encompass the death and violence of war within a narrative of redemption. It recalls instead a war that never really ended, but rather spilled out into cascades of further violence whose toxic effects are still with us today.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Christopher Clark\u2019s The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 is published by Penguin.

A middle-sized dog fetched 20 crowns, if its owner could be persuaded to part with it. Even mice were being traded. The hospital was filled to overflowing with collapsing people. As one of the doctors tending them observed, the most shocking thing about the starving was their indifference to their fate. \u201cThey silently and without complaint accept a cold place in the hospital, drink the slop which passes here for tea; the next day, they are moved to the morgue.\u201d One of the marvels of Alexander Watson\u2019s study of the bitter struggle for the fortress in 1914-1915 is his juxtaposition of magisterial technical analysis with scenes of timeless misery. The concrete and steel gun emplacements with their turrets, the fast-firing field artillery and the little wooden aeroplanes that flew in and out of the tiny fortress airstrip were all new, but the stench, the terror, the darkness, hunger and isolation were as old as the art of siege itself. In the last years before the outbreak of the first world war, Przemy\u015bl , now on the south-eastern edge of Poland near the border with Ukraine, was a high-functioning, multicultural, central European fortress on the eastern marches of the Austro-Hungarian empire. There were attractive cafes and restaurants, theatres and concert halls, lively newspapers catering to a range of ethnicities and political tastes, German, Polish and Ukrainian secondary schools and diverse religions. For all their modernity in technical terms, the two immense concentric rings of fortifications that surrounded the city felt more like reminders of the distant past than warnings of future peril. Within weeks of the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914, Przemy\u015bl was awash with Habsburg troops making their way towards the Russian armies. When the Russians broke the Habsburg advance, the city filled with the wounded. By 17 September, the Russians had surrounded the city and the first siege began. A renewed Habsburg offensive pushed the front back, briefly relieving the fortress, but the Russians rallied. On 8 October, a second and much more arduous siege began. It would end only when the Austro-Hungarian garrison capitulated to the Russians on 22 March 1915. Watson lucidly charts the progress of the military campaigns on both sides, deftly situating the struggle for Przemy\u015bl within the larger history of the eastern front. He is sharply critical of the Habsburg command, highlighting their incompetence and the recklessness with which they squandered the lives of their men. Sensible precautions were sacrificed to antiquated ideas of manliness in combat. Cavalry and infantrymen were pushed forward into withering fire. The digging of foxholes was discouraged on the grounds that it \u201cencouraged cowardice\u201d. Towards the end of the second siege, the starving inhabitants of the fortress were harassed by the Habsburg command into mounting an assault on the Russian lines, even though the chance of a breakout was zero. When the order to retreat was finally sounded, the few who had not already been shot dead or wounded were so exhausted that even under heavy enemy fire they could only limp or crawl back to their starting positions. The main villain of the piece is the Austrian chief of the general staff, General Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, a belligerent martinet who had pressed for war at every opportunity and proceeded to fail at virtually every task he faced. Vain, arrogant, incapable of learning from his mistakes and shockingly insensitive to the suffering of his men, he was the most important single architect of the disasters that befell Przemy\u015bl. There is much more to this book than an empathetic and evocative campaign history. Watson uses the fortress city like a jeweller\u2019s glass to show how war distorted and transformed the pre-war civilian world, poisoning it with a spirit of vendetta and ideological hatred that would not swiftly dissipate. The first non-combatant victims were the Ruthenes, speakers of various Ukrainian dialects who were suspected by the Austro-Hungarian military authorities of favouring the cause of the Russians. On the retreat towards Przemy\u015bl, an infantry regiment of Hungarian Landsturm strung up dozens of Ruthenes from trees at the side of the road. Further atrocities took place inside the fortified rings. As one commander reminisced: \u201cThere were some [Ruthenian] villages in which the entire population had to be hanged, because they pulled out Russian rifles \u2026 and fired salvos at us.\u201d Once the Russians were in control, a new wave of repressions began. There were attacks on Ukrainian \u201cGreek Catholic\u201d clergy, whose presence offended the incoming Russian Orthodox authorities. The occupation army embarked on a policy of \u201cRussification\u201d, whose purpose was to restore the region to its supposedly \u201cprimordial\u201d Russian condition. And, as elsewhere in the areas that came under Russian control during the war, the Jews were singled out for special punishment. There were repeated waves of arrests, public whippings and forced labour services performed before crowds of impassive Poles and Ruthenians. Sons were made to hang their fathers, before being hanged in turn; 17,000 Jews were simply deported eastward without charges of any kind. Watson\u2019s handling of these horrors is never gratuitous. In reconstructing in such detail the violence of the war years, he proposes an important rethinking of the history of central Europe in the 20th century. By contrast with Timothy Snyder, whose Bloodlands connects the phenomenon of ideological ultraviolence with the conflict between Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 40s, Watson backdates the inception of ethnic cleansing and racial atrocity to the era of the first world war, when the clashing protagonists were not newfangled totalitarian states, but empires of the old type. Once it was broken, the civility of the old Przemy\u015bl, in which diverse communities, for all their squabbling, had rubbed along tolerably well, did not return. The power of this book lies in Watson\u2019s ability to always connect such large claims to the experiences of the people who carried this war on their backs. His eye falls on all those trapped in the fortress \u2013 the doctors, airmen, merchants, troops entrenched inside the great rings of the fortress, and the sex workers and girlfriends who hoped through love affairs or trysts with officers to lay hands on food they could take to share with their families. And when the siege was over, in March 1915, more than 100,000 troops and civilians of Przemy\u015bl made their way into Russian captivity, most of them fetching up deep in Asian Russia, where around a fifth died. One survivor, who had been 12 at the time of the siege, recalled his father\u2019s return home in 1921: \u201cHe came in at the door buckled like a centenarian.\u201d Watson\u2019s splendid book combines great evocative power (and flashes of sharp humour) with the ethical authority of the best history writing. The story it tells is unsettling, because it resists any attempt to encompass the death and violence of war within a narrative of redemption. It recalls instead a war that never really ended, but rather spilled out into cascades of further violence whose toxic effects are still with us today. \u2022 Christopher Clark\u2019s The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 is published by Penguin.

      "bodyText": "A mile east of the Lu\u00eds I Bridge in the middle of a residential neighbourhood in Porto, Portugal\u2019s second city, sits a bleak and decaying building. Initially a three-storey car park, then a thriving shopping centre, the building has more recently suffered from years of neglect. Its walls are sprayed with graffiti and plastered with stickers, and the windows are blacked out. But listen closely and you can hear the windows rattle to the sound of drums and electric guitars from dozens of rock, funk, blues and jazz bands. Diogo Azevedo, singer of the thrash metal band Jarda, is one of an estimated 300 musicians and artists who helped turn Centro Comercial Stop \u2013 known as Stop \u2013 into a unique, and controversial, music studio complex. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the underground scene in Porto,\u201d Azevedo says, attractive to its bohemian occupants, but a headache for city hall. Porto\u2019s authorities claim the building is illegal: it was never intended to be a music studio, they say, and it fails to comply with modern safety requirements. The musicians feel differently. For the past 10 years they have battled to keep the building open, citing its cultural relevancy at a time when locals feel they\u2019ve been priced out of the city by the ever-increasing demand from tourism. \u201cWe have so many friends here,\u201d Azevedo says. \u201cWe rehearse, jam. It ends up being a waste if this place was demolished to be one of many other hotels in Porto.\u201d The car park first became a mall in 1982, one of dozens that sprouted like mushrooms across the city following the collapse of the Second Republic. Locals flocked to the cinema and top-floor dance hall. But new, larger, out-of-town complexes in the 1990s saw many of Porto\u2019s businesses, customers and residents relocate to the suburbs. Shutters were pulled down over large areas of the city. Helena Fernandes remembers her first visit to the abandoned mall. \u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cI saw how shopping was in the golden days and this was empty.\u201d Fernandes, 44, is president of Batucada Radical, a Brazilian street percussion band. \u201cWe came here because nobody wanted us in other places,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are very loud. We stayed for six months rehearsing in one place, and people asked us to get out. We were like nomads.\u201d In Stop they saw an opportunity. They negotiated cheap rates and, along with other musicians, transformed the storefronts in amateur rehearsal and recording studios. \u201cBands came here to rehearse because it was very cheap,\u201d says Nuno Mendes, 45, a musician and producer based on the building\u2019s second floor. \u201cNo one wanted to come here, because it has these hallways [with] drug addicts; it started to be a bit underground. People came here because they could make some noise. \u201cIt was crazy. There were lots of heavy metal bands that started \u2013 rock, punk. The building trembled. It\u2019s weird because your neighbour is the one who blows out your ears. You get louder, then your neighbour gets louder \u2013 it was like a war. Who plays louder!\u201d Many of the musical groups are collectives \u2013 Fernandes\u2019 began with 20 members but now has more than 100. The venue, she says, has been \u201ca turning point\u201d for the group. \u201cWith rents as they are now, it would be impossible to get a place like this,\u201d she says. The artists\u2019 appetite for loud music, late-night drinking and in some cases antisocial behaviour have somewhat strained relations with the local community. \u201cIt was like a Noah\u2019s Ark where all the animals were inside,\u201d says Jorge Prendas, a coordinator at the music venue Casa da M\u00fasica, which rented two studios in Stop. \u201cPolice went there three or four times to close it. They had a very good argument: it was not safe.\u201d But authorities couldn\u2019t close it, because of a quirk: the building has never had an owner, so legal responsibility fell on the dozens of individual landlords of the various retail spaces. The sales of these shopfronts, however, were unregulated, and authorities in many cases don\u2019t know the owners, let alone how to track them down. Without clear ownership or maintenance, the building slid into disrepair. The escalator and air conditioning clunked to a halt, toilets were badly damaged and water leaked from ceilings. To improve acoustics, musicians glued cardboard egg cartons and sponges to walls, but this only amplified the fire risk \u2013 in a building with no fire exits or sprinklers, at a time when unsafe electrical usage in the building was surging. \u201cThe [electrics were] very old and not reliable,\u201d Prendas says. \u201cYou had one plug and 20 instruments in that plug [and] lots and lots of adapters.\u201d By 2010, with rumours spreading that the then mayor\u2019s patience was wearing thin, dozens of musicians formed the Pro-Stop Association and reached out to Prendas. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have authorisation to do musical rehearsals there and they didn\u2019t have the license for the building,\u201d he says. \u201c[Casa da M\u00fasica] wanted to promote their image \u2013 to show that we are on the side of the musicians and artists.\u201d The group was called StopEstra (from \u201cStop\u201d and \u201corchestra\u201d), and for its launch it staged a 21-band performance across the city, performing nonstop for six hours before convening at Casa da M\u00fasica the next night as a unified 100-piece rock band. The British composer and director Tim Steiner, who conducted the group that evening, says the experience was \u201can extraordinary thing\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been working for 30 years in community-grounded music projects around the world and there\u2019s nothing like StopEstra\u201dsays Steiner, a former professor at the London Guildhall School of Music. \u201cThere was a real understanding between all the musicians \u2013 a lot of respect \u2013 and a sense of experimentation and exploration of what you could do when you have a large group of rock musicians together.\u201d The megagroup performed seven more times over the next six years, including as the opening act for the first Porto edition of the Primavera Sound music festival in 2012, and had appeared to secure the building\u2019s future.

      "body": "<p>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho famously brought style to the Premier League. \u201cEvery man should have a white shirt in his wardrobe,\u201d he once proclaimed. \u201cSooner or later you will need it.\u201d</p> <p>It always seemed as if his perfectionism made him the sort of man who, despite his wealth, would take charge of his own wardrobe. There he would be, relaxing in front of Match of the Day, while methodically folding his charcoal cashmere jumpers and starching his blue shirts.</p> <p>But explaining why he chose to live in a hotel while manager of Manchester United, he revealed himself as lacking in the domestic department: \u201cI would have to iron, I don\u2019t know how to.\u201d None of us do, do we? Lynsey Crombie, AKA <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lynsey_queenofclean/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Queen of Clean</a>, answers some pressing questions.</p> <h2><strong>How do you iron shirts?</strong></h2> <p>Always start with the collar: start in the middle and work your way out because if you iron straight across it, you can get lumps and bumps in it. I don\u2019t use starch. These days you don\u2019t need to, as lots of shirts have collar stiffeners in them. Next, do the yoke \u2013 the part across the upper back and shoulder \u2013 then the sleeves, cuffs and main body. As soon as you\u2019ve ironed it, get it on a hanger and hang it up with space around it.</p> <h2><strong>What about iron fitted sheets?</strong></h2> <p>I iron fitted sheets so they fit neatly into the cupboard. If you don\u2019t iron them, you tend to screw them up and shove them in. The trick here is to fold the sheet in half, then into a quarter. I don\u2019t bother to iron the elasticated bits separately; I fold it up, so the sheet becomes square-shaped, then iron it.</p> <h2><strong>Should you use linen spray?</strong></h2> <p>I don\u2019t, but if I\u2019m away without an iron, I make a spray from white wine vinegar diluted with warm water. Spray the garment, then pull it to get the creases out.</p> <h2><strong>When do you change the setting on your iron?</strong></h2> <p>I separate my ironing pile. I do my delicates first on the lowest setting, then work my way up to the items that need the hottest setting.</p> <h2><strong>Which fabrics should you not iron?</strong></h2> <p>I iron everything. Silk is the only one you need to be careful with; I put a tea towel on top to prevent damage. Be careful with lace or a netted feature on garments; iron those inside out or put a slightly damp cloth over the top. You might not have to iron it anyway.</p> <h2><strong>Should you iron handkerchiefs and tea towels?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s personal preference. I think an ironed handkerchief looks nicer. I do iron tea towels sometimes, because then they fit in the drawer nicely.</p> <h2><strong>How about a pleated skirt?</strong></h2> <p>I do. Put it on your ironing board and rotate it, pressing each pleat once.</p> <h2><strong>And pants?</strong></h2> <p>No. I used to run an ironing business and people would give me their pants to iron, and it was disgusting. But it\u2019s a personal choice. If you want hot, steamy pants, iron them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho famously brought style to the Premier League. \u201cEvery man should have a white shirt in his wardrobe,\u201d he once proclaimed. \u201cSooner or later you will need it.\u201d It always seemed as if his perfectionism made him the sort of man who, despite his wealth, would take charge of his own wardrobe. There he would be, relaxing in front of Match of the Day, while methodically folding his charcoal cashmere jumpers and starching his blue shirts. But explaining why he chose to live in a hotel while manager of Manchester United, he revealed himself as lacking in the domestic department: \u201cI would have to iron, I don\u2019t know how to.\u201d None of us do, do we? Lynsey Crombie, AKA Queen of Clean, answers some pressing questions. How do you iron shirts? Always start with the collar: start in the middle and work your way out because if you iron straight across it, you can get lumps and bumps in it. I don\u2019t use starch. These days you don\u2019t need to, as lots of shirts have collar stiffeners in them. Next, do the yoke \u2013 the part across the upper back and shoulder \u2013 then the sleeves, cuffs and main body. As soon as you\u2019ve ironed it, get it on a hanger and hang it up with space around it. What about iron fitted sheets? I iron fitted sheets so they fit neatly into the cupboard. If you don\u2019t iron them, you tend to screw them up and shove them in. The trick here is to fold the sheet in half, then into a quarter. I don\u2019t bother to iron the elasticated bits separately; I fold it up, so the sheet becomes square-shaped, then iron it. Should you use linen spray? I don\u2019t, but if I\u2019m away without an iron, I make a spray from white wine vinegar diluted with warm water. Spray the garment, then pull it to get the creases out. When do you change the setting on your iron? I separate my ironing pile. I do my delicates first on the lowest setting, then work my way up to the items that need the hottest setting. Which fabrics should you not iron? I iron everything. Silk is the only one you need to be careful with; I put a tea towel on top to prevent damage. Be careful with lace or a netted feature on garments; iron those inside out or put a slightly damp cloth over the top. You might not have to iron it anyway. Should you iron handkerchiefs and tea towels? It\u2019s personal preference. I think an ironed handkerchief looks nicer. I do iron tea towels sometimes, because then they fit in the drawer nicely. How about a pleated skirt? I do. Put it on your ironing board and rotate it, pressing each pleat once. And pants? No. I used to run an ironing business and people would give me their pants to iron, and it was disgusting. But it\u2019s a personal choice. If you want hot, steamy pants, iron them.",

Beneath the fabric of his khaki shirt, pushed into the waistband of his trousers, a pistol bulges.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re fighting against a system where we can\u2019t eat and we don\u2019t get paid.

The idea was to free up funds for social schemes, but the money thus freed got pocketed by politicians.</p> \n<p>The upwelling of popular outrage that greeted the official report into the scandal, which has tied Mo\u00efse to at least knowledge of the misappropriation, has played out in Creole slogans painted on walls demanding \u201c<em>Kot kob Petrokaribe</em><em>?</em>\u201d (\u201cWhere\u2019s the Petrocaribe money?\u201d).</p> \n<p>The scandal is debated angrily around the clock on radio talk shows, and denounced in the music of rappers, like Izolan, whose song Lage Pye Ou \u2013 Step On it \u2013 has been taken up by demonstrators.</p> \n<p>Opposition spokesman Andre Michel believes the unrest is down to the culmination of several factors.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe first is the circumstances around the election of Jovenel Mo\u00efse as president, a victory that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/haiti-presidential-election-result-protest-jovenel-moise\">not accepted</a> by the other candidates.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe second is a structural issue. Ever since its foundation, Haiti has been ruled by an oligarchic minority who have held the country hostage. We have a political system that allows a small number of people to take all the country\u2019s wealth.\u201d</p> \n<p>That, adds Michel, is the point dramatised by the Petrocaribe scandal.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe money was supposed to pay for education, hospitals, roads and agricultural development,\u201d he says of the billions misappropriated by those in government.</p> \n<p>\u201cNot a single hospital has been built or a single training centre.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5693b0c86a92eeb12d0b228dece3c18bca936d65\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5693b0c86a92eeb12d0b228dece3c18bca936d65/0_0_5342_3585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rocks and burning tyres block a road running alongside the boundary wall of Port-au-Prince\u2019s main airport during anti-government protests in Haiti\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rocks and burning tyres block a road running alongside the boundary wall of Port-au-Prince\u2019s main airport during anti-government protests.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Beaumont/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And the crisis is biting beyond politics.

If nothing is done, that will rise to 4.1 million people \u2013 roughly 40% of the Haitian population \u2013 within the next three to five months.</p> \n<p>The dire state of affairs is summed up by security guard Junior Estinfort, 31, a father of two, who the Guardian meets outside the looted mayor\u2019s office in L\u00e9og\u00e2ne. Even before the attack on the building, he had not received his salary for six months.</p> \n<p>Unlike many, Estinfort believes Mo\u00efse should serve out his term until 2022, but he complains the system has been \u201cturned upside down\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m relying on handouts from friends just to survive,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Much is spoken about \u201cthe system\u201d in Haiti \u2013 <em>la machine</em>,<em> </em>as it is known colloquially.

In the same period, they reported that more than 200 people were injured, including at least eight journalists.</p> \n<p>In neighbourhoods like the capital\u2019s Martissant, long notorious for its insecurity and lethal gang violence, credible local human rights groups suggest that political figures are arming and paying gunmen to settle scores against opponents on the street.</p> \n<p>In a tiny, one-room house in Port-au-Prince\u2019s Solino slum, Jean Charles Jean Clauzel, aged 41, and other anti-Mo\u00efse activists gathered to meet the Guardian. Jean Clauzel explains he has moved his place of residence multiple times, fearful of being targeted by paid gunmen.</p> \n<p>His fears are apparently not without foundation.</p> \n<p>According to a November report by the human rights group Fondasyon Je Klere, there may be reasons to fear that political assassinations are returning to the country\u2019s politics.</p> \n<p>Je Klere lists a number of incidents to underline its concerns, including several involving passengers in cars without number plates firing on demonstrations. The group also cites the killing on 29 September of the political activist Josemano Victorieux, known as \u201cBadou\u201d, whose murder has been marked by memorial banners draped over his Delmas 33 neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>Jean Clauzel and the other activists have another reason to be concerned. Accompanying them is nine-year-old Dera Lourdjy, who was shot in the arm by an unseen gunman during a demonstration in the neighbourhood on 4 November.

      "bodyText": "At the barricaded junction next to the international airport in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, protesters burn tyres and block the road with stones and a large truck. Cars and commercial vehicles that approach turn back or risk being stoned, while pedestrians wade on through the smoke. Standing among a group of young men overseeing proceedings is Wandy Drelien, 28. Beneath the fabric of his khaki shirt, pushed into the waistband of his trousers, a pistol bulges. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting against a system where we can\u2019t eat and we don\u2019t get paid. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken to the streets,\u201d he explains as a jet flies in low overhead to land at the airport. \u201cThe president [Jovenel Mo\u00efse] isn\u2019t working for us,\u201d Drelien adds. \u201cHe\u2019s no friend of the people. Only of the bourgeoisie and businessmen, while we live in poverty. \u201cIt\u2019s why young people have given up at school and taken up the gun. Because we need to defeat to this for ourselves.\u201d The sentiments are familiar in the crisis in Haiti that has flared up over the past year. Intermittent protests have seen roads blockaded and offices and institutions associated with the government attacked, including the major\u2019s office in the city of L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, about 42km from Port-au-Prince, which was petrol bombed and looted. Schools opened again this week after two months of large-scale protests almost completely paralysed the country. But as a semblance of what passes for normality returns, the causes of the crisis remain amid evidence of a darker, more covert strand of violence now emerging: the supply of weapons and cash to armed gangs by figures on both sides. While the proximate reason for the turmoil in Haiti has been a long running multi-billion dollar corruption scandal that has engulfed the presidency of Mo\u00efse, it has exacerbated tensions in a place long racked by brutal poverty and extreme inequality where political dishonesty has long been commonplace. Central to the protests is the Petrocaribe scandal, a controversy that arose from a scheme to buy discounted oil from Venezuela on cheap credit. The idea was to free up funds for social schemes, but the money thus freed got pocketed by politicians. The upwelling of popular outrage that greeted the official report into the scandal, which has tied Mo\u00efse to at least knowledge of the misappropriation, has played out in Creole slogans painted on walls demanding \u201cKot kob Petrokaribe?\u201d (\u201cWhere\u2019s the Petrocaribe money?\u201d). The scandal is debated angrily around the clock on radio talk shows, and denounced in the music of rappers, like Izolan, whose song Lage Pye Ou \u2013 Step On it \u2013 has been taken up by demonstrators. Opposition spokesman Andre Michel believes the unrest is down to the culmination of several factors. \u201cThe first is the circumstances around the election of Jovenel Mo\u00efse as president, a victory that was not accepted by the other candidates. \u201cThe second is a structural issue. Ever since its foundation, Haiti has been ruled by an oligarchic minority who have held the country hostage. We have a political system that allows a small number of people to take all the country\u2019s wealth.\u201d That, adds Michel, is the point dramatised by the Petrocaribe scandal. \u201cThe money was supposed to pay for education, hospitals, roads and agricultural development,\u201d he says of the billions misappropriated by those in government. \u201cNot a single hospital has been built or a single training centre.\u201d And the crisis is biting beyond politics. Disruption on the roads, combined with rising commodity prices and the depreciation of the Haitian gourde against the US dollar, has reduced the ability of Haiti\u2019s poorest to buy food. According to a joint statement by humanitarian organisations, already 35% of the Haitian population \u2013 an estimated 3.67 million people \u2013 require emergency food assistance. If nothing is done, that will rise to 4.1 million people \u2013 roughly 40% of the Haitian population \u2013 within the next three to five months. The dire state of affairs is summed up by security guard Junior Estinfort, 31, a father of two, who the Guardian meets outside the looted mayor\u2019s office in L\u00e9og\u00e2ne. Even before the attack on the building, he had not received his salary for six months. Unlike many, Estinfort believes Mo\u00efse should serve out his term until 2022, but he complains the system has been \u201cturned upside down\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m relying on handouts from friends just to survive,\u201d he says. Much is spoken about \u201cthe system\u201d in Haiti \u2013 la machine, as it is known colloquially. Talk of it is rivalled only by conversational use of the word pagaille, denoting utter chaos. Even those associated with the government are critical. \u201cIt is a nightmare,\u201d says Newton Louis St Juste, a government lawyer. \u201cEveryone is fighting for power.\u201d If many of St Juste\u2019s criticisms of the situation echo that of opposition figures, where he differs is blaming the opposition for many of the same sins as the government. Both sides, he suggests, are implicated in violence and corruption \u2013 including in the Petrocaribe scandal \u2013 in a weak state where politics have been co-opted by business interests. \u201cOn the one side you have an opposition that won\u2019t wait for the next elections in 2022 and on the other a president who can\u2019t deliver because he does not have the resources to solve the country\u2019s problems.\u201d In a place where gangs are better armed than the police, he adds, a sense of impunity is running riot, from the white collar criminals and corrupt politicians at the apex down to the poorest slums. Mo\u00efse \u2013 who critics say has rarely been seen outside the wealthy neighbourhood of P\u00e9tion-Ville, and who appears bolstered by the support of the US, which has sent senior diplomats in a show of solidarity \u2013 is more forthright. He has referred to a plot by individuals with interests in Haiti\u2019s energy sector to unseat him and accused the opposition of holding the country hostage, adding: \u201cIs it the resignation of the president that will free the state? No, it is reform.\u201d For now, however, the trajectory is not negotiation or political process, but rising political violence that has already claimed dozens of lives. Amnesty and other human rights organisations say they have validated claims of indiscriminate live fire on demonstrators by police. And other, more shadowy gunmen also appear to be at work. According to the National Human Rights Defence Network, a Haitian NGO, in a single month between 16 September and 17 October at least 35 deaths occurred in the context of protests alone, including at least nine at the hands of the police. In the same period, they reported that more than 200 people were injured, including at least eight journalists. In neighbourhoods like the capital\u2019s Martissant, long notorious for its insecurity and lethal gang violence, credible local human rights groups suggest that political figures are arming and paying gunmen to settle scores against opponents on the street. In a tiny, one-room house in Port-au-Prince\u2019s Solino slum, Jean Charles Jean Clauzel, aged 41, and other anti-Mo\u00efse activists gathered to meet the Guardian. Jean Clauzel explains he has moved his place of residence multiple times, fearful of being targeted by paid gunmen. His fears are apparently not without foundation. According to a November report by the human rights group Fondasyon Je Klere, there may be reasons to fear that political assassinations are returning to the country\u2019s politics. Je Klere lists a number of incidents to underline its concerns, including several involving passengers in cars without number plates firing on demonstrations. The group also cites the killing on 29 September of the political activist Josemano Victorieux, known as \u201cBadou\u201d, whose murder has been marked by memorial banners draped over his Delmas 33 neighbourhood. Jean Clauzel and the other activists have another reason to be concerned. Accompanying them is nine-year-old Dera Lourdjy, who was shot in the arm by an unseen gunman during a demonstration in the neighbourhood on 4 November. She is one of several children who have been caught in the crossfire. \u201cThe situation is not good at all,\u201d says Jean Clauzel. \u201cIt\u2019s why many of the activists are trying to stay away from trouble. I\u2019ve moved multiple times and I\u2019ve only slept around seven nights in this house in total. If they find me, I\u2019m worried they will kill me.\u201d If opposition figures point the finger at the government, it is a two-way street. \u201cThe president has broken his promises. He needs to understand that people are tired and angry,\u201d says Arnel B\u00e9lizaire, a charismatic former deputy and opposition leader who the Guardian meets at his warehouse, where workers are loading up a truck with planks. \u201cHe does not respect democratic norms. He has become arrogant and refuses to resign.\u201d Barely two days after his interview with the Guardian, B\u00e9lizaire is arrested for allegedly attempting to deliver weapons and ammunition to the city of Jacmel with seven other individuals. He is accused of \u201cconspiring against the state\u201d, and images of the weapons are shared with the Haitian media. Haiti\u2019s crisis seems far from over.",

calls on government to expedite asylum claim of two gay Saudi journalists in 'arbitrary' detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a hearing on Thursday, counsel for the two men, Stephen Keim, argued that the high court\u2019s second Mabo decision contained an \u201cunderstanding of the history of European settlement and imposition of the sovereignty of the crown\u201d which should guide the common law in the way it deals with \u201ca multiplicity of legal issues\u201d beyond native title, such as citizenship.</p> <p>Chief justice Susan Kiefel suggested that Victoria\u2019s submissions had taken the court into the territory of \u201cMabo No 3\u201d \u2013 a \u201cmuch wider proposition\u201d that could have implications in many other areas of law.</p> <p>Keim submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that Aboriginal people are \u201cpermanent Australian nationals and not aliens in Australia\u201d unless they abandon that status.</p> <p>He asked the court to give \u201cweight to Aboriginal Australians as the first people of what is now the Australian community\u201d.</p> <p>Keim submitted if the court accepted the \u201charshness\u201d of the commonwealth\u2019s submission that all non-citizens are aliens, people who became Australian citizens by naturalisation \u2013 rather than by birth \u2013 would be vulnerable to denaturalisation and deportation.</p> <p>This could be up to one-third of Australians, including dual citizens and those born overseas, he said.</p> <p>The state of Victoria, represented by Peter Willis, argued that Indigenous Australians have a special relationship with the land and waters of Australia analogous to the concept of allegiance which is the basis of recognising citizenship.</p> <p>That connection was \u201csufficiently close and meaningful\u201d that it answers the question of \u201cwho belongs here, who is a member of us\u201d, Willis said, and was equivalent to the \u201cairy\u201d notion of allegiance, which most Australians are assumed to have from birth despite never giving it a moment\u2019s thought or consciously affirming it.</p> <p>Willis said this connection was \u201cqualitatively different\u201d to that of a non-Indigenous Australian such as \u201csomeone in [hit film] The Castle\u2019s quarter-acre block\u201d.</p> <p>Kiefel queried how Indigenous Australians\u2019 connection to particular land could be extrapolated to Australia as a whole then to the polity of the commonwealth, suggesting there \u201cseems to be a few missing premises\u201d in Victoria\u2019s argument.</p> <p>But Justice James Edelman gave the Victorian arguments more credence, suggesting that Indigenous Australians can have connection to particular land as well as a spiritual connection more generally, so while a native title claim to the former may be lost or extinguished \u201cthe latter always remains\u201d.</p> <p>The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, representing the commonwealth, submitted Victoria had invited the court to \u201cjettison\u201d the \u201ccore idea\u201d of allegiance, which had always been allegiance to the sovereign or body politic not a place.</p> <p>But justice Virginia Bell that the notion of the Australian polity may have expanded to recognise that Indigenous Australians\u2019 connection with land \u201cmight be inconsistent with seeing an Aboriginal person as alien\u201d.</p> <p>Edelman suggested both allegiance and connection to land are \u201cmetaphysical\u201d and it would be a strange result if a two-year-old born in Australia to two foreign parents was deemed to have allegiance but a two-year-old Aboriginal Australian born overseas did not despite 10,000s of years of Aboriginal people living in Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element

Australian can disclaim their Indigeneity and become an alien by \u201cpersonal choice\u201d in the same way anyone could renounce a birthright to citizenship.</p> <p>Justice Patrick Keane seized on this, asking if an Indigenous Australians could disclaim Australian citizenship but retain membership of an Aboriginal group, which Willis conceded was possible because they are \u201ctwo different

      "bodyText": "Indigenous Australians\u2019 connection to the land is \u201cimportant but not equivalent\u201d to allegiance to Australia, the commonwealth has argued in a landmark case fighting for the right to deport two Aboriginal non-citizens. Lawyers for the two Indigenous men, backed up by the state of Victoria, are arguing the Australian government cannot deport Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders even though they don\u2019t hold Australian citizenship because the constitutional definition of \u201calien\u201d can\u2019t be set by the government of the day through citizenship law. The plaintiffs, Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms, were born in Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, each with one Aboriginal parent, and face deportation due to laws which allow the cancellation of visas on character grounds. Their fight to stay now hinges on a special case arguing that although they are non-citizens, they are also not aliens. At a hearing on Thursday, counsel for the two men, Stephen Keim, argued that the high court\u2019s second Mabo decision contained an \u201cunderstanding of the history of European settlement and imposition of the sovereignty of the crown\u201d which should guide the common law in the way it deals with \u201ca multiplicity of legal issues\u201d beyond native title, such as citizenship. Chief justice Susan Kiefel suggested that Victoria\u2019s submissions had taken the court into the territory of \u201cMabo No 3\u201d \u2013 a \u201cmuch wider proposition\u201d that could have implications in many other areas of law. Keim submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that Aboriginal people are \u201cpermanent Australian nationals and not aliens in Australia\u201d unless they abandon that status. He asked the court to give \u201cweight to Aboriginal Australians as the first people of what is now the Australian community\u201d. Keim submitted if the court accepted the \u201charshness\u201d of the commonwealth\u2019s submission that all non-citizens are aliens, people who became Australian citizens by naturalisation \u2013 rather than by birth \u2013 would be vulnerable to denaturalisation and deportation. This could be up to one-third of Australians, including dual citizens and those born overseas, he said. The state of Victoria, represented by Peter Willis, argued that Indigenous Australians have a special relationship with the land and waters of Australia analogous to the concept of allegiance which is the basis of recognising citizenship. That connection was \u201csufficiently close and meaningful\u201d that it answers the question of \u201cwho belongs here, who is a member of us\u201d, Willis said, and was equivalent to the \u201cairy\u201d notion of allegiance, which most Australians are assumed to have from birth despite never giving it a moment\u2019s thought or consciously affirming it. Willis said this connection was \u201cqualitatively different\u201d to that of a non-Indigenous Australian such as \u201csomeone in [hit film] The Castle\u2019s quarter-acre block\u201d. Kiefel queried how Indigenous Australians\u2019 connection to particular land could be extrapolated to Australia as a whole then to the polity of the commonwealth, suggesting there \u201cseems to be a few missing premises\u201d in Victoria\u2019s argument. But Justice James Edelman gave the Victorian arguments more credence, suggesting that Indigenous Australians can have connection to particular land as well as a spiritual connection more generally, so while a native title claim to the former may be lost or extinguished \u201cthe latter always remains\u201d. The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, representing the commonwealth, submitted Victoria had invited the court to \u201cjettison\u201d the \u201ccore idea\u201d of allegiance, which had always been allegiance to the sovereign or body politic not a place. But justice Virginia Bell that the notion of the Australian polity may have expanded to recognise that Indigenous Australians\u2019 connection with land \u201cmight be inconsistent with seeing an Aboriginal person as alien\u201d. Edelman suggested both allegiance and connection to land are \u201cmetaphysical\u201d and it would be a strange result if a two-year-old born in Australia to two foreign parents was deemed to have allegiance but a two-year-old Aboriginal Australian born overseas did not despite 10,000s of years of Aboriginal people living in Australia. Several justices queried whether the connection gave rise to a permanent allegiance or could be renounced, and Willis replied that an Aboriginal Australian can disclaim their Indigeneity and become an alien by \u201cpersonal choice\u201d in the same way anyone could renounce a birthright to citizenship. Justice Patrick Keane seized on this, asking if an Indigenous Australians could disclaim Australian citizenship but retain membership of an Aboriginal group, which Willis conceded was possible because they are \u201ctwo different things\u201d. \u201cExactly right,\u201d Keane replied. Donaghue later seized on this concession, suggesting Aboriginality was \u201cnot relevant at all\u201d to Australian citizenship. Donaghue argued that the common law draws no distinction between whether Australian citizens or subjects are Indigenous or non-Indigenous. He argued that Indigenous Australians became British subjects because Britain exercised sovereignty over the entire territory of Australia, and later generations became subjects in the same way as non-Indigenous Australians. Donaghue submitted that the fact both plaintiffs were born overseas and were citizens of foreign powers was sufficient to win the case, because the constitutional meaning of alien must at least include the common law meaning, which they both plainly fit. Donaghue concluded by arguing the case had \u201cno general implications for [all] Indigenous people\u201d \u2013 only non-citizens \u2013 and noted non-Indigenous people would be deported in the same circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s not Mabo number three \u2013 it\u2019s whether two particular people can be treated as aliens.\u201d The court reserved its judgment.",

Yet it is equally as capable of detracting from one \u2013 and this is often most evident when dining out.</p> <p>Keeling\u2019s cautionary tales speak volumes about the perils of playing DJ to a varied, indifferent audience principally concerned with their other senses. Accordingly, in Noble Rot, no music plays at all (although there is a turntable for vinyl in the wine bar).</p> <p>\u201cWhen I listen to music, I try to pay attention to it,\u201d says Keeling. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with food and wine \u2013 it\u2019s about giving everything its due space and respect.\u201d</p> <p>But not playing music also gets around the crucial question of what to play. Keeling notes that diners at Noble Rot, a 55-cover restaurant, are diverse, ranging in age from their early 20s to 80-plus. \u201cWhat are we going to play that everybody will feel enhances their experience? Music is as strong a flavour as food \u2013 it\u2019s just another thing to get wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past 15 years or so, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/06/inside-the-booming-business-of-background-music\" title=\"\">an entire industry has emerged</a> to help companies reflect \u2013 or even construct \u2013 their brand identity. \u201cThe earlier we get in there, the better,\u201d says Mikey Vettraino of <a href=\"https://www.mavmusic.co.uk/\">MAV Music Supervision</a>.</p> <p>Vettraino founded the music consultancy in 2004 after overseeing the introduction of music to the members\u2019 club Soho House, where he was then operations manager. Since then, the company has assembled a global portfolio of more than 500 clients, including Wagamama, the O2 Arena and Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Lucky Cat in Mayfair.</p> <p>Vettraino says the music consultant serves as \u201cblind DJ\u201d: \u201cYou\u2019re playlisting a song that\u2019s going to come on, and you don\u2019t know what the atmosphere is.\u201d The company\u2019s approach is to come up with a few playlists to suit different times of the day, each sonically cohesive enough to be put on shuffle (and about four or five times the length that it will play for, to avoid too much repetition \u2013 for the staff\u2019s sake).</p> <p>Song choice is informed by a back-and-forth with the client of representative songs, soundtrack snippets and moodboards. (Genres are considered to be essentially meaningless.) For example, Wagamama\u2019s brief was to appeal to a twentysomething, urban woman, interpreted by MAV\u2019s head of music and operations Alex Hill as Annie Mac-esque \u2013 \u201cthe very accessible side of alternative pop\u201d.</p> <p>Hill says there are some artists \u2013 such as Khruangbin, Nightmares on Wax and Bonobo \u2013 that suit most settings: (and has <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7jeWr0zBn2A3gwUaemThgV\" title=\"\">made such a playlist of them for the Guardian here</a>). \u201cDeath metal, or minimal techno, isn\u2019t going to work 99 times out of 100.\u201d There are also technical considerations, such as whether a song has been overplayed or whether an explicit song has a clean version, as well as disruptive outros and intros, guitar solos and spoken-word breaks to navigate. Most crucial for the service industries are the peaks and troughs throughout the day, week or seasons (MAV typically updates clients\u2019 playlists quarterly).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"MAV Music's Guardian favourites\">  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7jeWr0zBn2A3gwUaemThgV\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 380px;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>After the lunch rush at Wagamama, for example, the soundtrack becomes softer and more atmospheric to take the edge off the experience of dining in a fairly empty restaurant. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your banging-est playlist on when the restaurant\u2019s empty and there\u2019s one guy sat there,\u201d says Hill.</p> <p>Conversely, Wagamama\u2019s new \u201cgrab and go\u201d lunch spot Mamago requested high-energy, fast-paced music to encourage turnover. (Hotels are known to do the same to encourage guests not to linger at the buffet.) Music\u2019s influence on staff productivity and customer spend was established by research <a href=\"https://thinkgrowth.org/stores-are-using-music-to-make-you-spend-more-d6c85974b20b\" title=\"\">dating back to the early </a><a href=\"https://thinkgrowth.org/stores-are-using-music-to-make-you-spend-more-d6c85974b20b\" title=\"\">80s</a>.</p> <p>When the soundtrack and dining experience are in harmony, it can become a key part of an establishment\u2019s reputation. Vettraino says that MAV\u2019s playlists have cropped up in several restaurant reviews.</p> <p>Diners\u2019 requests to know the name of the song playing can suggest a burgeoning credibility with music lovers. Part of the appeal of Shoreditch street food market Dinerama (where MAV playlists have replaced live DJs) is the chance of hearing an obscure song or remix you like enough to look up on Shazam, says Hill. That may be best left to the experts. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Spotify playlists called, like, \u2018Your Morning Cafe\u2019, and they do a job \u2013 but they\u2019re not tailored.\u201d</p> <p>The desire to appeal to all tastes has led to some genres, artists and even songs emerging as staples for hospitality playlists \u2013 Radio 1 Live Lounge-style acoustic covers of Top 40 pop being one example.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Hillary Dixler Canavan, the restaurant editor for the US website Eater, <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2019/2/5/18210964/this-is-every-cool-restaurant-indie-music-playlist-spotify\" title=\"\">shared her take on</a> \u201cevery generically cool restaurant\u2019s playlist\u201d with a <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4AEt6vXGJYmyOEE8zzgvjQ?si=Oj6hbounRMCey26xfO8JoA\" title=\"\">Spotify playlist</a>, featuring LCD Soundsystem, Phoenix, TV on the Radio, M83, Vampire Weekend and classic hip-hop such as Talib Kweli and Notorious BIG.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Hilary Dixler Canavan playlist\">  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4AEt6vXGJYmyOEE8zzgvjQ\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 380px;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But in later unpicking why these songs seemed ubiquitous in the kind of establishments that served natural wine and cauliflower steak, Canavan noted that a defined audience was being targeted: millennial and Gen X diners in urban centres, with disposable income and skewing white. \u201cThat the musical taste of this cohort has become at all universalised is telling \u2013 and, sadly, not that surprising,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2019/7/30/20746328/every-restaurant-playlist-spotify-switched-on-pop\" title=\"\">she concluded</a>. That said: \u201cYour parents would probably find it a bit too loud.\u201d</p> <p>It is a reminder that one way that music can influence people in a space is by shutting some out of it. For many dining establishments, the street cred to be gained from a distinctive playlist isn\u2019t worth the risk of putting off some customers. For others, that is the goal.</p> <p>Black Axe Mangal in north London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/14/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-black-axe-mangal-lee-tiernan-turkish-british-bone-marrow-st-john-legacy#comment-131025519\" title=\"\">is as often referenced</a> for its blaring soundtrack of metal and grunge \u2013 Metallica, Queens of the Stone Age, Black Sabbath, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce \u2013 as it is for its kebabs. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in making it innocuous? You may as well not play it,\u201d says its founder, Lee Tiernan, bluntly.</p> <p>The thinking behind the polarising playlist is the same as the genitalia graffitied on the floor, he says \u2013 \u201cI just know the people I want to attract. I think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/14/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-black-axe-mangal-lee-tiernan-turkish-british-bone-marrow-st-john-legacy#comment-131025519\" title=\"\">Jay Rayner said it</a> best in that it\u2019s not for everyone, but if you\u2019re into it, you\u2019re really into it.\u201d</p> <p>In that sense, the music at Black Axe Mangal is as much a part of it as the food, says Tiernan \u2013 although, these days, hard rock has given way to more UK grime and US rappers such as Action Bronson, Tyler, the Creator and Frank Ocean. \u201cYou can almost guarantee it\u2019s going to be loud.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This article was amended on 6 December 2019.

Hill says there are some artists \u2013 such as Khruangbin, Nightmares on Wax and Bonobo \u2013 that suit most settings: (and has made such a playlist of them for the Guardian here). \u201cDeath metal, or minimal techno, isn\u2019t going to work 99 times out of 100.\u201d There are also technical considerations, such as whether a song has been overplayed or whether an explicit song has a clean version, as well as disruptive outros and intros, guitar solos and spoken-word breaks to navigate. Most crucial for the service industries are the peaks and troughs throughout the day, week or seasons (MAV typically updates clients\u2019 playlists quarterly). After the lunch rush at Wagamama, for example, the soundtrack becomes softer and more atmospheric to take the edge off the experience of dining in a fairly empty restaurant. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your banging-est playlist on when the restaurant\u2019s empty and there\u2019s one guy sat there,\u201d says Hill. Conversely, Wagamama\u2019s new \u201cgrab and go\u201d lunch spot Mamago requested high-energy, fast-paced music to encourage turnover. (Hotels are known to do the same to encourage guests not to linger at the buffet.) Music\u2019s influence on staff productivity and customer spend was established by research dating back to the early 80s. When the soundtrack and dining experience are in harmony, it can become a key part of an establishment\u2019s reputation. Vettraino says that MAV\u2019s playlists have cropped up in several restaurant reviews. Diners\u2019 requests to know the name of the song playing can suggest a burgeoning credibility with music lovers. Part of the appeal of Shoreditch street food market Dinerama (where MAV playlists have replaced live DJs) is the chance of hearing an obscure song or remix you like enough to look up on Shazam, says Hill. That may be best left to the experts. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Spotify playlists called, like, \u2018Your Morning Cafe\u2019, and they do a job \u2013 but they\u2019re not tailored.\u201d The desire to appeal to all tastes has led to some genres, artists and even songs emerging as staples for hospitality playlists \u2013 Radio 1 Live Lounge-style acoustic covers of Top 40 pop being one example. Earlier this year, Hillary Dixler Canavan, the restaurant editor for the US website Eater, shared her take on \u201cevery generically cool restaurant\u2019s playlist\u201d with a Spotify playlist, featuring LCD Soundsystem, Phoenix, TV on the Radio, M83, Vampire Weekend and classic hip-hop such as Talib Kweli and Notorious BIG. But in later unpicking why these songs seemed ubiquitous in the kind of establishments that served natural wine and cauliflower steak, Canavan noted that a defined audience was being targeted: millennial and Gen X diners in urban centres, with disposable income and skewing white. \u201cThat the musical taste of this cohort has become at all universalised is telling \u2013 and, sadly, not that surprising,\u201d she concluded. That said: \u201cYour parents would probably find it a bit too loud.\u201d It is a reminder that one way that music can influence people in a space is by shutting some out of it. For many dining establishments, the street cred to be gained from a distinctive playlist isn\u2019t worth the risk of putting off some customers. For others, that is the goal. Black Axe Mangal in north London is as often referenced for its blaring soundtrack of metal and grunge \u2013 Metallica, Queens of the Stone Age, Black Sabbath, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce \u2013 as it is for its kebabs. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in making it innocuous? You may as well not play it,\u201d says its founder, Lee Tiernan, bluntly. The thinking behind the polarising playlist is the same as the genitalia graffitied on the floor, he says \u2013 \u201cI just know the people I want to attract. I think Jay Rayner said it best in that it\u2019s not for everyone, but if you\u2019re into it, you\u2019re really into it.\u201d In that sense, the music at Black Axe Mangal is as much a part of it as the food, says Tiernan \u2013 although, these days, hard rock has given way to more UK grime and US rappers such as Action Bronson, Tyler, the Creator and Frank Ocean. \u201cYou can almost guarantee it\u2019s going to be loud.\u201d This article was amended on 6 December 2019.

In the lawsuit, Zimmerman claims his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/george-zimmerman-trayvon-martin-lawsuit\">reputation was destroyed</a> by the \u201cmalicious\u201d and conspiratorial prosecution; that he was defamed in a book by Benjamin Crump, the attorney of Martin\u2019s parents; and that he receives death threats.

The gap between disadvantaged pupils and their better-off peers in England was shown to be much wider than official estimates.

      "bodyText": "We have a week to go before election day and after the blip that was the Nato summit, the leaders are focused on the final sprint to the 12 December finish line. Boris Johnson has outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office (if he wins) and Labour will be talking education today. You really should follow our rolling political coverage here. What\u2019s going on? The Nato circus has left town \u2013 some members earlier than planned \u2013 which means Johnson can resume campaigning today. The PM survived the summit relatively unscathed. There had been concerns among the Conservative camp that Johnson\u2019s proximity to the US president might be damaging, stoking voter fears that the NHS might be on the table in US-UK trade deals. But he managed to avoid almost any public meetings with Donald Trump, though he was caught on camera apparently joking about Trump with other world leaders \u2013 something Johnson astonishingly professed no memory of. After the video of the interaction did the rounds, Trump called Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d and then announced he was leaving early and would not be giving a press conference. Don\u2019t miss Marina Hyde\u2019s and John Crace\u2019s take on events. Now that all the Nato shenanigans are out of the way, normal programming can resume. Johnson has launched his hopes for his first 100 days in office. He says his main focus would be passing the withdrawal agreement to ensure Brexit happens on 31 January. Other priorities include bringing in legislation to end the automatic release of serious violent and sexual offenders at the halfway point of their sentence \u2013 the family of murdered student Jack Merritt have condemned this as kneejerk politicisation of the London Bridge terror attack \u2013 and increasing the amount that new immigrants pay to use the NHS. Labour will be talking about education today as Jeremy Corbyn visits schools and the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, pledges to recruit 20,000 more teachers, cap secondary class sizes at 30 and spend \u00a37bn on repairs and upgrades to England\u2019s crumbling school buildings. Labour will also promise free, healthy breakfasts for all primary-age children as part of a multibillion-pound plan to \u201cpoverty-proof\u201d England\u2019s schools. At a glance The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has faced Andrew Neil and apologised for her party backing the coalition\u2019s austerity policies including the bedroom tax and benefit cap. Democracy campaigners have accused politicians of ignoring the issue of electoral reform, arguing that \u201cthe signs of democratic decay are all around us\u201d. Aditya Chakrabortty writes that Boris Johnson may be a clown but the threat he poses is deadly serious. The latest instalment in our People and Power series heads to Camborne and Redruth where creating jobs is high on the agenda in one of Cornwall\u2019s most deprived constituencies. Caroline Lucas has written about the need to protect nature if we are to stand any chance of tackling climate chaos. The day ahead Boris Johnson will head to the Midlands where he will have a tour of a mill shop and inspect some knitwear. Jeremy Corbyn will also be in the Midlands where he will visit several schools before hosting a rally in the evening. Jo Swinson will visit a care home in Edinburgh before appearing at a rally alongside colleagues from the Scottish section of the party. It\u2019s Nigel Farage\u2019s turn to face off against Andrew Neil. The interview will be broadcast at 7.30pm.

Best of the rest &gt; George Zimmerman is launching a \u00a3100m lawsuit over his unsuccessful prosecution for shooting and killing Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was acquitted over the 2012 shooting, which happened after he followed the unarmed Martin, 17, around a gated community in Florida, then shot him when they got into an altercation. In the lawsuit, Zimmerman claims his reputation was destroyed by the \u201cmalicious\u201d and conspiratorial prosecution; that he was defamed in a book by Benjamin Crump, the attorney of Martin\u2019s parents; and that he receives death threats. Crump responded by calling Zimmerman\u2019s lawsuit shameless, callous, unfounded and reckless. &gt; An analysis has found 24,600 students disappeared from school rolls in 2018, fuelling concerns about \u201coff-rolling\u201d whereby difficult or low-achieving pupils are excluded so they are not included in GCSE results. The gap between disadvantaged pupils and their better-off peers in England was shown to be much wider than official estimates. Once school results were recalculated to take into account pupils who left before the end of year 11, when GCSEs are taken, researchers found the failure rate for disadvantaged pupils increased by more than double that of better-off pupils. &gt; The Star Wars actor John Boyega says he has met Americans who are not aware there are black people living in London, and believes the under-representation of the black British experience in popular culture fuels such ignorance. Boyega made the comments in a Radio Times interview where he discussed his future plans to create work about black life in Britain, partly as a result of having to explain to Americans that black Londoners exist while promoting his 2011 breakthrough film Attack the Block. He said: \u201cI\u2019m black British and I\u2019m from London. And that in itself is something that the world doesn\u2019t know about yet. I met American people \u2013 civilians of a first-world country \u2013 who were confused that there were black people in London.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Iran\u2019s deadly protests When Iran\u2019s government announced it was raising the price of fuel by up to three times, thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest. Michael Safi reports on what happened next. And: Jim Waterson on how social media has changed the way we consume news. Lunchtime read: \u2018They said I would be done for murder\u2019 At 17, Amy Dunne was pregnant with a baby who had a fatal abnormality. She was given a pseudonym and became the focus of a landmark Irish legal case over whether she could have an abortion. Now she is reclaiming her story, as she tells Rory Carroll. Sport Liverpool treated their Merseyside foes with contempt, winning 5-2 in the Premier League and leaving behind the impression that for the Reds, rivalry with Everton is a matter of history, not current concern. The fallout from Anfield will likely carry on and on, with Marco Silva on borrowed time as Everton manager \u2013 and David Moyes lined up for a return to Goodison Park. Still on the Premier League, and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s return to Old Trafford was not an enjoyable one as a Marcus Rashford-inspired Manchester United recorded a 2-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur. Bob Willis, the former England captain and fast bowler who died at the age of 70, inspired teammates with his excellence, writes Vic Marks. In rugby, Robert Kitson argues that the upcoming, truncated tour of South Africa removes the last vestige of romance from the British &amp; Irish Lions. Back to football, and our countdown of the world\u2019s top 100 female players continues \u2013 check out the talent in positions 100-41. Business Although global shares have lifted again in the last 24 hours on hopes of a US-China trade deal, the tensions underlying relations between the two superpowers were laid bare as Chinese tech giant Huawei said it would challenge the US decision to bar it from federal contracts because it posed a security threat. It comes as Boris Johnson suggested Huawei was a security threat. The FTSE100 is set for a modest rise this morning while the pound has held on to gains it made yesterday at $1.312 and \u20ac1.183. The papers The Times and the Telegraph both lead today with the PM\u2019s tax pledge: \u201cJohnson to offer tax cut after Brexit\u201d in the former, and \u201cTax cuts for millions within days of Brexit\u201d in the latter. The Sun presents Johnson\u2019s \u201c10 commandments\u201d for his first 100 days, with the door of No 10 standing in for stone tablets. \u201cTrump leaves Nato talks after ridicule from allies\u201d is the Guardian\u2019s straightforward headline above the pic of Johnson, Macron, Trudeau, Rutte and Princess Anne in a chortling huddle. The Metro is out to have more fun with it: \u201cTrump gets the hump\u201d. The i leads on a doctor\u2019s sad story of how \u201cNHS cuts killed my mother\u201d. \u201cAs nurses use foodbanks, Boris is Mr Greedy\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the Mirror castigating the PM for his \u00a3700,000 in outside earnings over the last year, more than any other MP. The Express is \u201cSpeechless!\u201d because Jeremy Corbyn said he watches the Queen\u2019s address on Christmas morning, when it doesn\u2019t air until 3pm. The Mail likes that one too: \u201cCorbyn caught out over Queen\u201d. We\u2019ll do our best to translate the FT headline which is \u201cM&amp;G halts trading in \u00a32.5bn fund as high outflows spark sell-off fears\u201d. So M&amp;G is a property fund that owns shopping centres across the country, and it has banned withdrawals by investors \u2013 who have pulled nearly \u00a31bn of their money out in the last year amid Brexit uncertainty and the retail downturn.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s easy to forget just how consistently, bracingly nasty The War of the Roses is, thanks in great part to the extravagant, and festive, studio packaging it arrived in, unwrapped in cinemas 30 years ago this month. It was fast-paced, glossy, <em>Christmassy</em> and, deceptively, it starred one of the most beloved onscreen couples of the 80s: Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. Audiences were accustomed to seeing them bicker in the hit adventures Romancing the Stone and The Jewel of the Nile but their sparring was only ever of the screwball variety, a string of lighthearted quips signposting a Billy Ocean-soundtracked happy ending on the horizon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/18/drugstore-cowboy-at-30-is-this-the-best-film-ever-made-about-addiction\">Drugstore Cowboy at 30: is this the best film ever made about addiction?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the end of the decade, they reunited to show us that happily ever afters are as fantastical as treasure maps and that early romance will more likely give way to seething resentment and sadistic violence. The film was a cruel R-rated footnote to their era of PG-13 flirting and it both shocked and compelled me as a child whose family was in the thick of a divorce at the same time. I didn\u2019t see it upon release \u2013 I was five at the time \u2013 but as it tore its way to the small screen, it became an early object of obsession. Each rewatch was met with a certain amount of parental displeasure, an understandable concern that I would blur the lines between what happened on screen and what was happening in real life \u2026</p> <p>The War of the Roses unfolds as a cautionary tale, shared by the lawyer Gavin D\u2019Amato (Danny DeVito, the reliable third wheel in Douglas and Turner\u2019s previous two capers and also playing director here) with a client seeking a divorce. Urging him to consider his options, he tells the story of the Roses, a couple whose marital bliss ended in disaster. \u201cThey met \u2026 great. They agreed on that,\u201d he says, while we\u2019re taken back to a charming meet-cute as Barbara (Turner) and Oliver (Douglas) compete at an auction in Nantucket. The film leaps forward from the auction to the bedroom to their first apartment to their first house, the couple gliding from one rite of passage to the next, ticking every box that society has taught them to tick. Barbara becomes the perfect housewife, Oliver goes from associate to senior partner at his law firm and they have two cute kids, one boy and one girl.</p> <p>\u201cEverything was working for the Roses,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cLet me restate that. The Roses were working for everything.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ebv3i_9Ltc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5ebv3i_9Ltc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Because in Michael J Leeson\u2019s exuberantly cynical script, based on the book by Warren Adler, hard work only gets you so far. The Roses were doing everything they thought they needed to do to be happy but it wasn\u2019t enough. Those cute kids grow up to be overweight and insolent. That grandiose house ends up feeling empty and alienating. Their relationship goes from fun and frisky to stale and stuffy. The cracks that start to show are initially relatable \u2013 the annoying way your partner laughs, the rambling way they tell a story, the endless fucking snoring \u2013 and the escalation is believably restrained. For a while. But the potholes they encounter culminate in more of a sinkhole, those niggling issues no longer fixable with just a brave face.</p> <p>Barbara asks for a divorce. Oliver says no. Barbara wants the house. So does Oliver. Both stand their ground, refusing to abandon their much-loved home, and the competitive edge that brought them together on that rainy Nantucket day soon becomes the same thing that starts tearing them apart. It\u2019s the cruel irony of so many breakups and the film revels in this. As their beautiful house becomes a war zone, the ornament they playfully fought over years ago is brought back to be used as a cruel reminder of what they once had. It\u2019s the last straw that forces them into their final physical duel, which leads to their deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"72ca11ef0cd4514a52c77833d325b7aba05c9919\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72ca11ef0cd4514a52c77833d325b7aba05c9919/0_0_2047_2389/857.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"857\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In this year\u2019s wonderful, Oscar-tipped drama Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach similarly shows how divorce can bring out the worst in a couple, especially in one virtuosic show-stopping argument, but he also shows how humanity can still be maintained and, in a gut-wrenching final scene, how tenderness remains. In The War of the Roses, there\u2019s no such relief.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s easy to forget just how consistently, bracingly nasty The War of the Roses is, thanks in great part to the extravagant, and festive, studio packaging it arrived in, unwrapped in cinemas 30 years ago this month. It was fast-paced, glossy, Christmassy and, deceptively, it starred one of the most beloved onscreen couples of the 80s: Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. Audiences were accustomed to seeing them bicker in the hit adventures Romancing the Stone and The Jewel of the Nile but their sparring was only ever of the screwball variety, a string of lighthearted quips signposting a Billy Ocean-soundtracked happy ending on the horizon. At the end of the decade, they reunited to show us that happily ever afters are as fantastical as treasure maps and that early romance will more likely give way to seething resentment and sadistic violence. The film was a cruel R-rated footnote to their era of PG-13 flirting and it both shocked and compelled me as a child whose family was in the thick of a divorce at the same time. I didn\u2019t see it upon release \u2013 I was five at the time \u2013 but as it tore its way to the small screen, it became an early object of obsession. Each rewatch was met with a certain amount of parental displeasure, an understandable concern that I would blur the lines between what happened on screen and what was happening in real life \u2026 The War of the Roses unfolds as a cautionary tale, shared by the lawyer Gavin D\u2019Amato (Danny DeVito, the reliable third wheel in Douglas and Turner\u2019s previous two capers and also playing director here) with a client seeking a divorce. Urging him to consider his options, he tells the story of the Roses, a couple whose marital bliss ended in disaster. \u201cThey met \u2026 great. They agreed on that,\u201d he says, while we\u2019re taken back to a charming meet-cute as Barbara (Turner) and Oliver (Douglas) compete at an auction in Nantucket. The film leaps forward from the auction to the bedroom to their first apartment to their first house, the couple gliding from one rite of passage to the next, ticking every box that society has taught them to tick. Barbara becomes the perfect housewife, Oliver goes from associate to senior partner at his law firm and they have two cute kids, one boy and one girl. \u201cEverything was working for the Roses,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cLet me restate that. The Roses were working for everything.\u201d Because in Michael J Leeson\u2019s exuberantly cynical script, based on the book by Warren Adler, hard work only gets you so far. The Roses were doing everything they thought they needed to do to be happy but it wasn\u2019t enough. Those cute kids grow up to be overweight and insolent. That grandiose house ends up feeling empty and alienating. Their relationship goes from fun and frisky to stale and stuffy. The cracks that start to show are initially relatable \u2013 the annoying way your partner laughs, the rambling way they tell a story, the endless fucking snoring \u2013 and the escalation is believably restrained. For a while. But the potholes they encounter culminate in more of a sinkhole, those niggling issues no longer fixable with just a brave face. Barbara asks for a divorce. Oliver says no. Barbara wants the house. So does Oliver. Both stand their ground, refusing to abandon their much-loved home, and the competitive edge that brought them together on that rainy Nantucket day soon becomes the same thing that starts tearing them apart. It\u2019s the cruel irony of so many breakups and the film revels in this. As their beautiful house becomes a war zone, the ornament they playfully fought over years ago is brought back to be used as a cruel reminder of what they once had. It\u2019s the last straw that forces them into their final physical duel, which leads to their deaths. In this year\u2019s wonderful, Oscar-tipped drama Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach similarly shows how divorce can bring out the worst in a couple, especially in one virtuosic show-stopping argument, but he also shows how humanity can still be maintained and, in a gut-wrenching final scene, how tenderness remains. In The War of the Roses, there\u2019s no such relief. As the crumpled-up couple lie dying on a broken chandelier, one that\u2019s crashed to the ground, Oliver reaches to touch Barbara, music swelling, but she pushes him off, a final, brutal rejection that remains one of the coldest endings I can remember in studio cinema. Critics at the time were unsure what to make of it, unsure exactly how to enjoy watching a sprightly holiday comedy involving two big stars inflicting verbal and physical abuse on each other. In a mostly positive review, Roger Ebert nonetheless remarked: \u201cThere are times when its ferocity threatens to break through the boundaries of comedy \u2013 to become so unremitting we find we cannot laugh,\u201d while Janet Maslin praised its \u201coutstanding nastiness\u201d but worried that the ending took things too far. It was rare in 1989 and arguably rarer now to see a film of this scale have the courage of its convictions, maintaining its dour worldview right up until the bitter and bloody end.

      "body": "<p><strong>Tom Stoppard:</strong> In the theatre, Michael is simply \u201cBillington\u201d, like a brand. Four stars from Billington is a relief and a blessing; a single star is as rare as five. Actually rarer. After so many reviews and so many years, I doubt Michael ever enters a theatre pessimistically. How could he keep going for so long if he didn\u2019t expect to be blown away every time? When he can\u2019t like something as much as he\u2019d like to like it, he often writes \u201cMuch as I admire\u2026\u201d before he dissents. A curate\u2019s egg never got a fairer deal. Not very long after Michael took over, Kenneth Tynan asked me, \u201cWho is <em>the</em> critic now?\u201d then answered his own question tentatively: \u201cMichael Billington?\u201d I didn\u2019t have a better answer.</p> <p><strong>Laura Wade:</strong> Playwrights aren\u2019t supposed to care about reviews. I do care \u2013 I can\u2019t help being interested \u2013 and the one I care about most is Michael\u2019s. He brings a sense of history, vast knowledge and unmatched experience. Is there anyone writing now who has seen more plays? It matters to Michael that our work is both theatrically and politically rigorous, and mentally and visually stimulating. He holds us to account. And when he really gets what you\u2019re trying to do \u2013 as he did with my most recent play, The Watsons \u2013 it\u2019s the best feeling. It galvanises you. His love for the theatre and his belief that plays can be a catalyst for change and a force for good make him a humane and timely reminder of the value of experts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0706eaf074dc76fbb87f77003291296de786755a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0706eaf074dc76fbb87f77003291296de786755a/0_0_5097_3398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Watsons by Laura Wade at Chichester Festival theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Watsons by Laura Wade at Chichester Festival theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Harriet Walter:</strong> My first mention in a Billington review was in 1970 when I was a pre-drama school usher at Ed Berman\u2019s Ambiance Lunch Hour theatre. We were roped in to chat to the audience and invite them for a spin on the dancefloor. We had our names on our lapels and I unwittingly selected Michael B as my partner. His review said something like: \u201cIt isn\u2019t every day one enters a theatre to be swept on to a dancefloor by an usherette called Harriet.\u201d Little did either of us know that he would be reviewing my acting for the next 50 years. Michael would venture where other critics feared to tread. In my early years on the political fringe, he would turn up at some shabby little venue miles out of London on a rainy Tuesday and honour us with a review. That dedication and breadth of perspective have stayed with him.</p> <p><strong>Peter Brook: </strong>A good critic has an eye like a scanner, an ear like a composer, the tongue that enjoys sweet and sour, a razor-like intelligence and a deeply tender heart. Michael has all of these, and I will miss reading all he writes.</p> <p><strong>Atiha Sen Gupta:</strong> I first crossed paths with Michael in 2009 when my debut play, What Fatima Did, about a young woman who adopts the hijab on the eve of her 18th birthday, was produced at Hampstead theatre. The much-feared and much-feted \u201cBillington review\u201d came out, and the cast and crew breathed a proverbial sigh of relief: Michael\u2019s thoughts on the piece were generally positive. I was glad he had seen something in the play as it was full of loud, angry, brown kids and quite a lot of swearing \u2013 a far cry from what usually graced the main stage at Hampstead. Although sharp, Michael has a generosity that seeks out the best in people\u2019s work. His review of my play ended with the words, \u201cThis is the work of a writer with a future\u201d \u2013 which I then proceeded to reproduce on everything (I\u2019ll admit, it was a bit much on birthday cards). After 48 years and 10,000 reviews, Michael can retire in the knowledge that he is a critic with a past \u2013 and an illustrious one at that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74f545df58489fbb8e5dfeafbf93d9e284a446e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74f545df58489fbb8e5dfeafbf93d9e284a446e3/0_0_2000_1432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Coombs and Farzana Dua Elahe in What Fatima Did by Atiha Sen Gupta at Hampstead theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Coombs and Farzana Dua Elahe in What Fatima Did by Atiha Sen Gupta at Hampstead theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Rumford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Sonia Friedman:</strong> Michael has been a powerful, trustworthy voice throughout my entire career. He can condense a show into 400 words, carrying its argument and catching its tone, in a way that few critics can. Some British reviews these days feel fluffy or a bit flip. His never do, even after all this time. They\u2019re robust, informative, even-handed. They spread credit around casts and creative teams. They always summon (and justify) an opinion \u2013 and that\u2019s easier said than done night after night, show after show. Most of all, Michael makes a case for theatre as something that matters, be it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/04/ken-dodd-at-90-comedy-standup-liverpool\">Ken Dodd </a>or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/01/king-lear-review-ian-mckellen-delivers-profound-portrait-of-a-soul-in-torment-chicester-festival-theatre\">King Lear</a>. There\u2019s a gruelling quality to criticism, turning up every night to whatever happens to be opening \u2013 panto to political theatre \u2013 and turning out copy day after day, to deadline. Doing so for half a century requires extraordinary discipline, honesty, faith in artists and in art and, really, a generosity of spirit. Michael marries intellectual self-assurance with emotional humility. I suspect he will be the last of his kind in the changing face of the media and our industry will be the poorer for his departure but I hope future critics will be inspired by his dedication and enthusiasm.</p> <p><strong>Patrick Stewart:</strong> When I was 15 and worked for the Dewsbury and District Reporter, the subeditor, Charlie Pickles, told me that if I wanted to understand what good, independent journalism was, I should read the Guardian. Charlie was right then and he still is. At 15, I was bitten by the acting bug and was given, after a year in the reporters\u2019 room, an ultimatum by the editor, Henry Wilson. One night, there was a mill fire in my home town, Mirfield. Charlie had told the editor: \u201cNo need to send anyone, Patrick is next door at a council meeting.\u201d I wasn\u2019t. I was at a rehearsal with the Mirfield drama club and had planned to phone in for the council meeting report, but had been outed. Next morning, I was summoned to the editor\u2019s office and told: give up this stupid acting and do your job or get off my paper. I closed up my ancient typewriter, while my closest friend, Barry Parkin, urged me: \u201cYou are a secondary modern schoolboy, Patrick, you\u2019ll never get a job again as good as this.\u201d It has turned out he might have been wrong.</p> <p>From that day, the Guardian became the only newspaper for me \u2013 and when Michael took the post of theatre critic in 1971, it became clear to me that, as long as he was writing, this would be my paper. His skills were so quickly evident: a great knowledge of drama, an understanding of the roles of director and, especially, actor and, most significant for me, a complete understanding of what the Royal Shakespeare Company stood for. I can\u2019t remember when he first gave me a mention but it might have been when I played Launce in Robin Phillips\u2019s production of The Two Gentlemen of Verona alongside the tremendous Ian Richardson and the then little-known Helen Mirren. Most importantly his love of the theatre was evident in every review. He will be missed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"356eb2a0a9be4ce9bdd5343d56106aabc70c41e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/356eb2a0a9be4ce9bdd5343d56106aabc70c41e6/0_146_4791_2873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Stewart as Launce in The Two Gentlemen of Verona in 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Stewart as Launce in The Two Gentlemen of Verona in 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Joe Penhall:</strong> I began reading Michael\u2019s reviews just before I became a playwright. He gave the impression playwriting was an honourable, thrilling, important occupation. It was a discourse that could banish the boredom of ordinary life. It seemed like a conversation I wanted involvement in. When he reviewed my debut play at the Royal Court Upstairs it was terse and to the point, not quite a rave. \u201cThe Court has discovered a good writer.\u201d I liked the abstemiousness of it. Other plays of mine that were slated by almost everyone else, he unexcitingly praised for their \u201cgenerosity\u201d or \u201ccompassion\u201d, assessments I probably benefited from but didn\u2019t savour. He understood my work better than most and only once did I tear my hair out \u2013 when he damned a play with faint praise while fretting: \u201cI just worry that it will give succour to rightwing opponents of nationalised healthcare.\u201d A typically utilitarian cavil which seemed a tad overripe at the time but with which I vaguely agree now. Like fine wine, his reviews took time to mature.</p> <p>He isn\u2019t afraid to like a play that nobody else likes and vice versa. If a play was going down badly, one would always wait for Billington\u2019s review before one slashed one\u2019s wrists. If a play opened with a brace of raves, he would occasionally bring one down to earth. Nevertheless, no matter what happened on opening night, one usually respected Michael in the morning. I made it my business to never meet him, although we were introduced once. I\u2019d got it into my head that a playwright should never meet critics and I slightly regret that now. Because I admired his respectfulness, his incisive intellect, his thoughtfulness, his extraordinary work ethic and, indeed, his considerable generosity and compassion. I loved the fact he would travel to the four corners of the earth to review theatre with the same relish and insight that he brought to homegrown work. He was influential in a way that few critics will be in the future \u2013 sometimes annoyingly so. He liked a certain kind of play (who doesn\u2019t?) but in later years he embraced eclecticism and breathed new life into his writing. Like the Rolling Stones he never stopped working. Now that time has come, he will be greatly missed \u2013 but at least I\u2019m allowed to meet him now. I\u2019m giving him four stars. The Guardian discovered a good writer\u2026</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/05/guardian-theatre-critic-michael-billington-to-step-down\">Guardian theatre critic Michael Billington to step down</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Alan Ayckbourn:</strong> I\u2019ve been writing professionally for 60 years and, for a considerable period of that time, Michael has been there encouraging, noting the development as my work gradually matured in style and shifted in focus.

Laura Wade: Playwrights aren\u2019t supposed to care about reviews. I do care \u2013 I can\u2019t help being interested \u2013 and the one I care about most is Michael\u2019s. He brings a sense of history, vast knowledge and unmatched experience. Is there anyone writing now who has seen more plays? It matters to Michael that our work is both theatrically and politically rigorous, and mentally and visually stimulating. He holds us to account. And when he really gets what you\u2019re trying to do \u2013 as he did with my most recent play, The Watsons \u2013 it\u2019s the best feeling. It galvanises you. His love for the theatre and his belief that plays can be a catalyst for change and a force for good make him a humane and timely reminder of the value of experts. Harriet Walter: My first mention in a Billington review was in 1970 when I was a pre-drama school usher at Ed Berman\u2019s Ambiance Lunch Hour theatre. We were roped in to chat to the audience and invite them for a spin on the dancefloor. We had our names on our lapels and I unwittingly selected Michael B as my partner. His review said something like: \u201cIt isn\u2019t every day one enters a theatre to be swept on to a dancefloor by an usherette called Harriet.\u201d Little did either of us know that he would be reviewing my acting for the next 50 years. Michael would venture where other critics feared to tread. In my early years on the political fringe, he would turn up at some shabby little venue miles out of London on a rainy Tuesday and honour us with a review. That dedication and breadth of perspective have stayed with him. Peter Brook: A good critic has an eye like a scanner, an ear like a composer, the tongue that enjoys sweet and sour, a razor-like intelligence and a deeply tender heart. Michael has all of these, and I will miss reading all he writes. Atiha Sen Gupta: I first crossed paths with Michael in 2009 when my debut play, What Fatima Did, about a young woman who adopts the hijab on the eve of her 18th birthday, was produced at Hampstead theatre. The much-feared and much-feted \u201cBillington review\u201d came out, and the cast and crew breathed a proverbial sigh of relief: Michael\u2019s thoughts on the piece were generally positive. I was glad he had seen something in the play as it was full of loud, angry, brown kids and quite a lot of swearing \u2013 a far cry from what usually graced the main stage at Hampstead. Although sharp, Michael has a generosity that seeks out the best in people\u2019s work. His review of my play ended with the words, \u201cThis is the work of a writer with a future\u201d \u2013 which I then proceeded to reproduce on everything (I\u2019ll admit, it was a bit much on birthday cards). After 48 years and 10,000 reviews, Michael can retire in the knowledge that he is a critic with a past \u2013 and an illustrious one at that. Sonia Friedman: Michael has been a powerful, trustworthy voice throughout my entire career. He can condense a show into 400 words, carrying its argument and catching its tone, in a way that few critics can. Some British reviews these days feel fluffy or a bit flip. His never do, even after all this time. They\u2019re robust, informative, even-handed. They spread credit around casts and creative teams. They always summon (and justify) an opinion \u2013 and that\u2019s easier said than done night after night, show after show. Most of all, Michael makes a case for theatre as something that matters, be it Ken Dodd or King Lear. There\u2019s a gruelling quality to criticism, turning up every night to whatever happens to be opening \u2013 panto to political theatre \u2013 and turning out copy day after day, to deadline. Doing so for half a century requires extraordinary discipline, honesty, faith in artists and in art and, really, a generosity of spirit. Michael marries intellectual self-assurance with emotional humility. I suspect he will be the last of his kind in the changing face of the media and our industry will be the poorer for his departure but I hope future critics will be inspired by his dedication and enthusiasm. Patrick Stewart: When I was 15 and worked for the Dewsbury and District Reporter, the subeditor, Charlie Pickles, told me that if I wanted to understand what good, independent journalism was, I should read the Guardian. Charlie was right then and he still is. At 15, I was bitten by the acting bug and was given, after a year in the reporters\u2019 room, an ultimatum by the editor, Henry Wilson. One night, there was a mill fire in my home town, Mirfield. Charlie had told the editor: \u201cNo need to send anyone, Patrick is next door at a council meeting.\u201d I wasn\u2019t. I was at a rehearsal with the Mirfield drama club and had planned to phone in for the council meeting report, but had been outed. Next morning, I was summoned to the editor\u2019s office and told: give up this stupid acting and do your job or get off my paper. I closed up my ancient typewriter, while my closest friend, Barry Parkin, urged me: \u201cYou are a secondary modern schoolboy, Patrick, you\u2019ll never get a job again as good as this.\u201d It has turned out he might have been wrong. From that day, the Guardian became the only newspaper for me \u2013 and when Michael took the post of theatre critic in 1971, it became clear to me that, as long as he was writing, this would be my paper. His skills were so quickly evident: a great knowledge of drama, an understanding of the roles of director and, especially, actor and, most significant for me, a complete understanding of what the Royal Shakespeare Company stood for. I can\u2019t remember when he first gave me a mention but it might have been when I played Launce in Robin Phillips\u2019s production of The Two Gentlemen of Verona alongside the tremendous Ian Richardson and the then little-known Helen Mirren. Most importantly his love of the theatre was evident in every review. He will be missed. Joe Penhall: I began reading Michael\u2019s reviews just before I became a playwright. He gave the impression playwriting was an honourable, thrilling, important occupation. It was a discourse that could banish the boredom of ordinary life. It seemed like a conversation I wanted involvement in. When he reviewed my debut play at the Royal Court Upstairs it was terse and to the point, not quite a rave. \u201cThe Court has discovered a good writer.\u201d I liked the abstemiousness of it. Other plays of mine that were slated by almost everyone else, he unexcitingly praised for their \u201cgenerosity\u201d or \u201ccompassion\u201d, assessments I probably benefited from but didn\u2019t savour. He understood my work better than most and only once did I tear my hair out \u2013 when he damned a play with faint praise while fretting: \u201cI just worry that it will give succour to rightwing opponents of nationalised healthcare.\u201d A typically utilitarian cavil which seemed a tad overripe at the time but with which I vaguely agree now. Like fine wine, his reviews took time to mature. He isn\u2019t afraid to like a play that nobody else likes and vice versa. If a play was going down badly, one would always wait for Billington\u2019s review before one slashed one\u2019s wrists. If a play opened with a brace of raves, he would occasionally bring one down to earth. Nevertheless, no matter what happened on opening night, one usually respected Michael in the morning. I made it my business to never meet him, although we were introduced once. I\u2019d got it into my head that a playwright should never meet critics and I slightly regret that now. Because I admired his respectfulness, his incisive intellect, his thoughtfulness, his extraordinary work ethic and, indeed, his considerable generosity and compassion. I loved the fact he would travel to the four corners of the earth to review theatre with the same relish and insight that he brought to homegrown work. He was influential in a way that few critics will be in the future \u2013 sometimes annoyingly so. He liked a certain kind of play (who doesn\u2019t?) but in later years he embraced eclecticism and breathed new life into his writing. Like the Rolling Stones he never stopped working. Now that time has come, he will be greatly missed \u2013 but at least I\u2019m allowed to meet him now. I\u2019m giving him four stars. The Guardian discovered a good writer\u2026 Alan Ayckbourn: I\u2019ve been writing professionally for 60 years and, for a considerable period of that time, Michael has been there encouraging, noting the development as my work gradually matured in style and shifted in focus. Throughout he wrote with an amazing sensitivity, empathy and understanding for which I shall always be grateful. His fair, balanced, intelligent reviews were driven by the love and enthusiasm he had for his job. In short, a critic with a genuine passion for theatre \u2013 which, speaking from a lifetime of experience, is far rarer than it sounds. Thank you, Michael, you are special. We shall miss you. Michael Billington will be talking to Arifa Akbar in a Guardian Live event at Kings Place, London, on 3 February.",

In the 1973 US lawsuit Roe v Wade, the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/19/norma-mccorvey-obituary\" title=\"\">Norma McCorvey,</a> better known by the legal pseudonym Jane Roe, played a key role in widening abortion rights in the US, only to later repent and join an anti-abortion movement that is now curbing abortion access in states across the US.</p> <p>Dunne\u2019s journey has ended with her staking a position in direct contrast to that of McCorvey. Dunne is ardently pro-choice. And she does not consider herself a Catholic. The swing in the US \u2013 where conservatives in states such as Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/18/2020-could-see-an-end-to-safe-legal-abortion-anywhere-in-america\" title=\"\">moved to restrict access</a> \u2013 appals her.</p> <p>\u201cIf a woman has chosen to have an abortion, she\u2019s not made that decision lightly,\u201d says Dunne. \u201cPutting the guilt on her that she\u2019s a murderer or that it\u2019s illegal or that she\u2019ll be punished for it \u2013 it\u2019s insane. If a woman chooses to have an abortion, it\u2019s either for her mental health or physical wellbeing and she should be allowed to do so. It\u2019s laughable that anyone else could think that they should control another person\u2019s body.\u201d</p> <p>Dunne welcomes the recent extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland, aligning the region with the rest of the UK and the Republic. \u201cI\u2019m delighted. It was crazy that they weren\u2019t allowed.\u201d</p> <p>Since sharing her story last month with the <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/lifestyle/living/2019/1016/1083698-finne-the-story-of-amy-dunne-aka-miss-d/\" title=\"\">documentary strand Finn\u00e9</a> on TG4, and then on other Irish media outlets, Dunne has become an unofficial agony aunt for people with pregnancy dilemmas. Men and women approach her in shops, on the street and via social media seeking guidance or just a friendly ear. \u201cPeople don\u2019t openly talk about abortion that much, but I\u2019m having a lot of people talk openly to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good or a bad thing. Now that I\u2019m over my part, I\u2019m in a position to give advice, very carefully.\u201d</p> <p>As a teenager, Dunne was not one for taking advice. Her mother, reeling from a breakup, moved Dunne and her siblings to Drogheda, where they knew no one. Dunne rebelled. \u201cI\u2019m very stubborn and righteous and started doing what I wanted at the age of 14. I started being a devil and not coming home and getting up to mischief.\u201d She entered temporary foster care at the age of 16. When she became pregnant, she was delighted. Her boyfriend of two years shared her enthusiasm at starting a family. \u201cI\u2019d nothing else at that time, I was so alone.\u201d</p> <p>The subsequent diagnosis of her baby\u2019s anencephaly, a disorder that affects the skull and brain, triggered dread, she says. \u201cI was petrified carrying her inside of me. I didn\u2019t want to go through that heartache. I wanted to get her out. She had no chance of survival.\u201d</p> <p>In 2007, Ireland had complex laws on the right to life of the unborn. An abortion ban accorded the mother and unborn baby an equal right to life. But successive referendums had loosened restrictions. Terminations were permitted if there was a substantial threat to the mother\u2019s life. Suicidal feelings could be grounds for abortion. But Dunne\u2019s social workers showed no inclination for nuance and inaccurately claimed there was a court order barring her departure to Britain, the traditional destination for Irish women wanting abortions.</p> <p>The teenager contacted a solicitor and within days was in the high court in Dublin, surrounded by people in gowns and wigs, trying to make sense of the maelstrom. Lawyers spoke legalese she found impenetrable. Protesters lining a bank of the River Liffey waved banners and chanted while TV journalists shared details of her life and her body to the nation. \u201cIt was very intimidating and scary,\u201d she says now. \u201cThere was no regard for my health or mental wellbeing. I didn\u2019t know who was for or against me. A guy with a Bible and a cross approached me one day while I was out on a break. He was praying over me and called me evil.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1703eaa413ad2311cc92e9c58a454b21286f9fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1703eaa413ad2311cc92e9c58a454b21286f9fb/0_146_6750_4050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Dunne at home in Drogheda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This opened my eyes to understand how strong I really am.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam Murphy/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dunne did not understand why she was in court. \u201cI just knew that I had a sick baby who needed to be taken out. She was deteriorating inside me as the case was going on.\u201d Invited to declare herself suicidal, Dunne refused. \u201cI was not suicidal. My child was sick. I knew what needed to happen.\u201d</p> <p>After three weeks the judge ruled that Miss D, by now 19 weeks pregnant, could leave the country. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/10/health.frontpagenews\" title=\"\">praised her maturity</a> and honesty, and said the Irish Health Service Executive had failed her.</p> <p>The judgment was another milestone on the path to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/may/26/irish-abortion-referendum-result-count-begins-live\" title=\"\">2018 referendum</a> that legalised abortion, leading to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/11/irish-gps-slow-to-offer-abortions-despite-muted-backlash\" title=\"\">rollout of services</a> this year. But, for Dunne, the immediate aftermath entailed a difficult visit to Liverpool.</p> <p>During the trial she had researched terminations and watched graphic videos on anti-abortion sites that turned her against abortion. So Dunne opted for an induced birth. She refused pain relief for almost all the 16 hours of labour to give her baby, named Jasmine, the best chance at life, however fleeting. \u201cI was naive and believed that she might take a breath,\u201d she recalls. But Jasmine died in the womb.</p> <p>Dunne\u2019s eyes glisten as she recalls how she was wheeled into a room to see the body. \u201cHer fingers and toes, they were perfect.\u201d A blanket covered the face. Warned that the abnormality might upset her, Dunne did not lift the blanket nor hold the baby, decisions that torment her to this day. \u201cIf I had been allowed to do this in Ireland, I could have gone back. But I was in a rush to catch a flight. I was screaming leaving the hospital, leaving her behind. I had to leave her in a hospital on her own, in a country on her own.\u201d It is the only time in the interview when Dunne\u2019s voice breaks. She buried Jasmine in a Drogheda cemetery.</p> <p>Self-conscious and ashamed, Dunne dropped out of school. \u201cI remember standing in queues and girls were whispering: \u2018That\u2019s Miss D.\u2019 It\u2019s a small town.\u201d She swiftly became pregnant again and gave birth to a healthy boy, Adam, who is now aged 11. \u201cA blessing. I had someone to focus on and I wanted to give him a better life than the one I was living,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In 2010, Dunne outed herself as Miss D in an interview with RTE. It was, she says now, probably too soon, her feelings still too raw. She subsequently retreated from public view, but tried again in the 2018 referendum and spoke to the BBC. \u201cI wanted to be a big part of it. But the \u2018pro-life\u2019 posters were everywhere and I couldn\u2019t deal with it. I was very angry. I had to step back.\u201d</p> <p>Her recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CstIU5B-nsI\" title=\"\">appearance on TG4</a>, followed by other media appearances, seemed to mark a turning point. Composed and eloquent, she has taken back ownership of her story. Audiences responded warmly. One media organisation has mooted hiring her as a presenter.</p> <p>At last, Dunne accepts that she is not an outcast. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of myself now,\u201d she says. \u201cThis opened my eyes to understand how strong I really am. I didn\u2019t realise that what I had done was so positive for other women. I didn\u2019t realise there was so much support.\u201d She glances at the angel portrait on her wall and smiles. \u201cMy anxiety has calmed itself. I have become so much more comfortable in myself as a person. I feel as if I had a bag of rubbish on my back and I\u2019ve dumped it. It\u2019s gone. It\u2019s like a secret that I was carrying, and it\u2019s not a secret any more. Now I feel like a very good person.\u201d</p>",

To have been thrust into an abortion rights crucible amid a traumatic pregnancy has given Dunne a unique perspective \u2013 and voice \u2013 on political battles over reproductive rights inside and outside Ireland. In the 1973 US lawsuit Roe v Wade, the late Norma McCorvey, better known by the legal pseudonym Jane Roe, played a key role in widening abortion rights in the US, only to later repent and join an anti-abortion movement that is now curbing abortion access in states across the US. Dunne\u2019s journey has ended with her staking a position in direct contrast to that of McCorvey. Dunne is ardently pro-choice. And she does not consider herself a Catholic. The swing in the US \u2013 where conservatives in states such as Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia have moved to restrict access \u2013 appals her. \u201cIf a woman has chosen to have an abortion, she\u2019s not made that decision lightly,\u201d says Dunne. \u201cPutting the guilt on her that she\u2019s a murderer or that it\u2019s illegal or that she\u2019ll be punished for it \u2013 it\u2019s insane. If a woman chooses to have an abortion, it\u2019s either for her mental health or physical wellbeing and she should be allowed to do so. It\u2019s laughable that anyone else could think that they should control another person\u2019s body.\u201d Dunne welcomes the recent extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland, aligning the region with the rest of the UK and the Republic. \u201cI\u2019m delighted. It was crazy that they weren\u2019t allowed.\u201d Since sharing her story last month with the documentary strand Finn\u00e9 on TG4, and then on other Irish media outlets, Dunne has become an unofficial agony aunt for people with pregnancy dilemmas. Men and women approach her in shops, on the street and via social media seeking guidance or just a friendly ear. \u201cPeople don\u2019t openly talk about abortion that much, but I\u2019m having a lot of people talk openly to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good or a bad thing. Now that I\u2019m over my part, I\u2019m in a position to give advice, very carefully.\u201d As a teenager, Dunne was not one for taking advice. Her mother, reeling from a breakup, moved Dunne and her siblings to Drogheda, where they knew no one. Dunne rebelled. \u201cI\u2019m very stubborn and righteous and started doing what I wanted at the age of 14. I started being a devil and not coming home and getting up to mischief.\u201d She entered temporary foster care at the age of 16. When she became pregnant, she was delighted. Her boyfriend of two years shared her enthusiasm at starting a family. \u201cI\u2019d nothing else at that time, I was so alone.\u201d The subsequent diagnosis of her baby\u2019s anencephaly, a disorder that affects the skull and brain, triggered dread, she says. \u201cI was petrified carrying her inside of me. I didn\u2019t want to go through that heartache. I wanted to get her out. She had no chance of survival.\u201d In 2007, Ireland had complex laws on the right to life of the unborn. An abortion ban accorded the mother and unborn baby an equal right to life. But successive referendums had loosened restrictions. Terminations were permitted if there was a substantial threat to the mother\u2019s life. Suicidal feelings could be grounds for abortion. But Dunne\u2019s social workers showed no inclination for nuance and inaccurately claimed there was a court order barring her departure to Britain, the traditional destination for Irish women wanting abortions. The teenager contacted a solicitor and within days was in the high court in Dublin, surrounded by people in gowns and wigs, trying to make sense of the maelstrom. Lawyers spoke legalese she found impenetrable. Protesters lining a bank of the River Liffey waved banners and chanted while TV journalists shared details of her life and her body to the nation. \u201cIt was very intimidating and scary,\u201d she says now. \u201cThere was no regard for my health or mental wellbeing. I didn\u2019t know who was for or against me. A guy with a Bible and a cross approached me one day while I was out on a break. He was praying over me and called me evil.\u201d Dunne did not understand why she was in court. \u201cI just knew that I had a sick baby who needed to be taken out. She was deteriorating inside me as the case was going on.\u201d Invited to declare herself suicidal, Dunne refused. \u201cI was not suicidal. My child was sick. I knew what needed to happen.\u201d After three weeks the judge ruled that Miss D, by now 19 weeks pregnant, could leave the country. He praised her maturity and honesty, and said the Irish Health Service Executive had failed her. The judgment was another milestone on the path to the 2018 referendum that legalised abortion, leading to the rollout of services this year. But, for Dunne, the immediate aftermath entailed a difficult visit to Liverpool. During the trial she had researched terminations and watched graphic videos on anti-abortion sites that turned her against abortion. So Dunne opted for an induced birth. She refused pain relief for almost all the 16 hours of labour to give her baby, named Jasmine, the best chance at life, however fleeting. \u201cI was naive and believed that she might take a breath,\u201d she recalls. But Jasmine died in the womb. Dunne\u2019s eyes glisten as she recalls how she was wheeled into a room to see the body. \u201cHer fingers and toes, they were perfect.\u201d A blanket covered the face. Warned that the abnormality might upset her, Dunne did not lift the blanket nor hold the baby, decisions that torment her to this day. \u201cIf I had been allowed to do this in Ireland, I could have gone back. But I was in a rush to catch a flight. I was screaming leaving the hospital, leaving her behind. I had to leave her in a hospital on her own, in a country on her own.\u201d It is the only time in the interview when Dunne\u2019s voice breaks. She buried Jasmine in a Drogheda cemetery. Self-conscious and ashamed, Dunne dropped out of school. \u201cI remember standing in queues and girls were whispering: \u2018That\u2019s Miss D.\u2019 It\u2019s a small town.\u201d She swiftly became pregnant again and gave birth to a healthy boy, Adam, who is now aged 11. \u201cA blessing. I had someone to focus on and I wanted to give him a better life than the one I was living,\u201d she says. In 2010, Dunne outed herself as Miss D in an interview with RTE. It was, she says now, probably too soon, her feelings still too raw. She subsequently retreated from public view, but tried again in the 2018 referendum and spoke to the BBC. \u201cI wanted to be a big part of it. But the \u2018pro-life\u2019 posters were everywhere and I couldn\u2019t deal with it. I was very angry. I had to step back.\u201d Her recent appearance on TG4, followed by other media appearances, seemed to mark a turning point. Composed and eloquent, she has taken back ownership of her story. Audiences responded warmly. One media organisation has mooted hiring her as a presenter. At last, Dunne accepts that she is not an outcast. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of myself now,\u201d she says. \u201cThis opened my eyes to understand how strong I really am. I didn\u2019t realise that what I had done was so positive for other women. I didn\u2019t realise there was so much support.\u201d She glances at the angel portrait on her wall and smiles. \u201cMy anxiety has calmed itself. I have become so much more comfortable in myself as a person. I feel as if I had a bag of rubbish on my back and I\u2019ve dumped it. It\u2019s gone. It\u2019s like a secret that I was carrying, and it\u2019s not a secret any more. Now I feel like a very good person.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Early in the morning on 21 March, in Mosul\u2019s flat and dusty al-Baker neighbourhood, a school principal named Ustad Ahmad went to see his mother. It was the start of the new year holiday of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/21/in-praise-of-nowruz\" title=\"\">Nowruz</a>, and she asked if they could go to the cemetery to visit his father\u2019s grave. Ahmad had other ideas. He was planning to take his wife and children to an amusement park, as a reward for the boys\u2019 full marks in their recent exams. Besides, he told his mother, he didn\u2019t want to be reminded of death on such a beautiful spring day.</p> <p>Back home, after breakfast with the boys, Ahmad sat on a wooden chair in the bathroom for his weekly shave. Then, preparing to go out, he put on his new summer blazer, a pair of jeans and the wraparound sunglasses his wife had recently bought for him. Tall and burly, Ahmad was a very proud man \u2013 proud of his status among his colleagues, the comfort and neatness of his house, his smart and witty boys, his beautiful baby daughter and above all, his clever, outgoing wife, who loved to travel. At around 1pm, the family caught a taxi to the amusement park, and Ahmad gave the boys enough money to go on every ride. He even joined them for a round on the bumper cars.</p> <p>Things hadn\u2019t always been as comfortable for Ahmad as they were now. When Islamic State took over Mosul in 2014, he had been deemed \u201cunreliable\u201d and expelled from his teaching job. For three years he was unemployed and unable to provide for his family. He sold his wife\u2019s gold and some of their furniture, borrowed money from his mother and brother, and became dependent on whatever his wife\u2019s family could spare them. Friends and neighbours nagged him to go out and find work as a day labourer, or get himself a pushcart and work in the vegetable market. But how could he? A school principal can\u2019t work in the market, he felt. He rarely left the house and sank into depression, arguing with his wife and children, who stopped going to school. Now, two years after the liberation of Mosul, he was proud to be a respectable principal once more, even if the city was still in ruins and his school barely functioning.</p> <p>Mosul is a city broken by war and corruption. Today, the early euphoria of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/after-the-liberation-of-mosul-an-orgy-of-killing\" title=\"\">liberation from Islamic State</a> is dissolving as the failure of reconstruction efforts becomes increasingly apparent. Pledges to rebuild the city remain unfulfilled, while the five bridges spanning the river Tigris have either collapsed or are strung together by military pontoons. Hundreds of thousands of people who were driven out of their homes during the fighting are still living in camps. The security situation is deteriorating and Islamic State cells are re-emerging. Across Iraq, anger against political elites is rising. In recent weeks, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have taken to the streets of Baghdad to demand a complete overhaul of the political system. After two months of demonstrations, in which 400 were killed and thousands injured, the prime minister resigned, but the crowds are still camping out in main squares across the country, waiting for the rest of their demands to be met.</p> <p>At the same time, what endures is the tenacity and resilience of the people of Mosul, their love of life and entrepreneurial spirit. During the later stages of the war, as the city was being retaken block-by-block by the Iraqi army, liberated neighbourhoods would spring back to life quickly. Families returned to their homes and teams of young volunteers cleared rubble from their streets. Even as the fighting raged just a few blocks away, someone would start selling cigarettes, a grocer would reopen with a box of half-rotten tomatoes and canned beans, and refurbished shops and restaurants would spring up, albeit without water or electricity. Those who could raise a bit of money began rebuilding their homes, while still waiting for the compensation their government had promised them. People allowed themselves the small reward of a meal out with their families.</p> <p>It was close to 2pm when Ahmad\u2019s family settled down to have their lunch, but there were no shaded areas in the park. The boys suggested that they go to Umm Rabaen, a pleasure island on the Tigris River. It was cooler by the water and there was a picnic area, and another amusement park. Ahmad called another taxi and they headed to the island.</p> <p>Umm Rabaen embodies the mixture of ruin and resurgence that defines Mosul. It was first turned into a pleasure island during the late 80s, when riverside cafes, restaurants, chalets and the pyramid-shaped Oberoi hotel were built as part of a grand development plan. The hotel is now a ruined shell, and most of the trees have been chopped down for firewood. But cafes and restaurants have been restored and reopened, and on weekends, the people of Mosul flock to the island to sit at white plastic tables, drinking tea or eating grilled kebabs. The familiar sight of the Tigris flowing beside them, fast and muddy, is a reminder of the endurance of their city, just as the view of the ruined buildings on the opposite bank brings back memories of the vicious war that they only just survived.</p> <p>Like many businesses in Mosul, since the liberation of the city from Isis, the island was part-owned by a member of the economic wing of a powerful militia. Earlier this year, a parliamentary commission reported that armed groups, working through their economic wings, have secured public contracts for businesses, in return for large kickbacks. They control the multimillion-dollar scrap metal trade and oil smuggling operations, as well as imposing illegal tolls on commercial traffic. The businesses they own are unaccountable, their funding is untraceable and, through a combination of fear and corruption, there is almost no oversight. The result, for the people enjoying their new year holiday in Mosul, was disaster.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>That same morning, in a different part of Mosul, a woman named Shahla woke up feeling cheerful and decided to take her mother to a new restaurant for brunch. Tomorrow would be her mother\u2019s 72nd birthday and Shahla and her two sisters had bought gifts, ordered cakes and sweets, and stuffed aubergines, zucchini and vine leaves with meat and rice, arranging them in a large <em>dolma </em>pot for the family feast. Today, though, Shahla had her mother to herself.</p> <p>The two women shared a particularly close bond after living as virtual prisoners under the rule of Islamic State. Their prison had been their two-storey house, which sat in a quiet neighbourhood, nestled among olive, tangerine and eucalyptus trees, not far from the eastern banks of the Tigris. Shortly after June 2014, when Isis officially declared its caliphate, the 13 Christian families that lived in the neighbourhood were expelled, their doors marked with the letter N (for Nazrites) and their houses redistributed to the organisation\u2019s senior foreign fighters. A Chechen commander lived across the street, while a Russian woman moved in next door and shouted at Shahla and her mother to cover their eyes even in their own garden. She would also send over her Egyptian husband to demand some of Shahla\u2019s mother\u2019s food.</p> <p>When the battle to liberate Mosul began in September 2016, the houses of the foreign fighters in the neighbourhood became a target. Three were levelled in airstrikes that shook Shahla\u2019s home and shattered their windows. Russian snipers set up a base in a house across the street. Other fighters fired their rocket-propelled grenades at the approaching Iraqi armoured vehicles from barricades at the end of the road.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"808fb701a99cccb2164d8f5426312b74c91274c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/808fb701a99cccb2164d8f5426312b74c91274c2/0_41_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street near Mosul University after fighting between the Iraqi counter-terrorism service and Islamic State, January 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street near Mosul University after fighting between the Iraqi counter-terrorism service and Islamic State, January 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Towards the end of the battle, as the fighting intensified and Iraqi troops got closer, Islamic State fighters came knocking at their door in the middle of the night. They ordered them to leave their house and go with them: they would be human shields for the retreating fighters. The women gathered their belongings in small bags, piled food into an old wheelchair and set out. Distant explosions shook the ground under their feet. At the end of the street they came across other neighbours who had slipped away from the Isis fighters, and together they hid in the basement of an abandoned house. Twenty-five women and children hid in that dark basement for three nights, while above, battle raged. When finally they heard on the radio that their neighbourhood was liberated, they remained trapped in their hiding place. They could hear fighters in the house, searching for civilian hostages to ensure their safe retreat. In the basement, the families crouched in darkness, holding their breath. Not until they heard the roars of army trucks and armoured vehicles had they dared to move.</p> <p>After their brunch, Shahla was in the kitchen preparing a pot of sweet Turkish coffee, while her mother sat reading in the garden, when Umm Yussuf, a friend of her mother, called to invite them for tea at the pleasure island that afternoon. Shahla didn\u2019t want to go out. She thought that on a sunny public holiday the island would be too crowded. But her mother wanted to go \u2013 the weather was beautiful, and she hadn\u2019t seen Umm Yussuf for weeks, so Shahla eventually agreed. She prepared a basket of food and a flask of coffee and they set off.</p> <p>It took Shahla and her mother 20 minutes to walk from their house to the river. Her mother was glad to be out, and her cheeks were flushed from the warm afternoon sun. When she saw the large crowd that had gathered at the river bank, Shahla thought the whole of Mosul must be here. She didn\u2019t like crowds, and she was trying to ask her mother if they could leave, when Umm Yussuf found them. The two old women hugged and the three of them slowly headed towards the ferry to the island.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Umm Rabaen island is connected to the east bank of the Tigris, less than 100 metres across the water, by two cable-pulled flatbed ferries, which were owned and maintained as part of the amusement park and island. The ferry allegedly had no safety provisions, security staff were reportedly unskilled and inept, and the service was rarely, if ever, subject to inspection.</p> <p>As the crowd waiting for the ferry swelled, a short man with alert, beady eyes watched with growing unease. Omar was sitting nearby in an old motorboat whose white fibreglass coating had turned yellowish-brown with age. He noticed that in the past couple of hours the water had risen quickly. The lower decks of the riverside cafes, where he had moored his boat, had been submerged, and plastic tables and chairs taken to higher decks.</p> <p>The day before, the river police had told the ferry management that it would need to suspend operations because of the unusual quantity of water being released from the Mosul dam higher up the river, after heavy rainfall. Everyone who lived or worked along the river had been informed \u2013 boatmen, cafe owners, even the farmers who raised water buffalos on the southern edge of the city. But the ferry was running as normal.</p> <p>At 3pm, it docked at the jetty on the eastern bank, and a single line of people descended, squeezing their way through the families waiting to board. The two crowds intermingled in a sea of coloured headscarves, pushing, and moving slowly. Everyone was in their holiday clothes, young men and boys wore suits and bow ties, girls wore dresses with frills.</p> <p>Shahla went down the steps on to the ferry carrying her bag, the food basket and her mother\u2019s handbag. She noticed that the water level was very high. Her mother and Umm Yussuf walked behind her slowly, holding hands. Ahmad and his family climbed down the steps backwards with the pram, one step at a time. The back of the ferry was full, but more people pushed to enter. By the time it started moving, nearly 300 people were crammed onboard.</p> <p>The ferry was a contraption made from two sections of an old pontoon bridge welded together and decorated with arches that rose high on either side. Steel wires stretched between the arches above a row of benches. Motors mounted on opposite sides of the river pulled cables connected to the front and back of the ferry. A third, guiding cable resisted the push of the currents and maintained the ferry on a straight course.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/mosul-map/giv-3902E5Ba9LrEhv6I/\" data-alt=\"Mosul ferry disaster map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/mosul-map/giv-3902E5Ba9LrEhv6I/\">Mosul ferry disaster map</a> </figure>  <p>The ferry shook and shuddered as it moved. The strength of the current pushed it downstream before the cable pulling it corrected its path and it shifted slightly upstream. The operator, standing in the back, noticed the ferry was tilting and started walking to the front, telling people to move away from the listing right side. The back of the ferry was being dragged by the current, pulling the ferry off its line. As the ferry jerked and swayed, a few kids climbed over the right-side railing, trying to see what was going on.</p> <p>A small wave gushed over the deck, covering Shahla\u2019s feet. Growing scared, her mother said that the three of them should go back and sit in a cafe on the shore, as if they could still walk away. Shahla tried to reassure her, but she could see that people were frightened. Elsewhere on the ferry, where Ahmad was standing, women were crying. He stuck by the railing, assuring his wife and children that the ferry would right itself, while clutching the pram handles tightly.</p> <p>A second, bigger wave surged in. The ferry began listing to the right. The boys hanging on the right side railings threw themselves into the frothing water. Just over a minute into the crossing, the ferry had tilted so far that one third of the deck was underwater, and most of the people were clambering on the other side, but the ferry couldn\u2019t right itself. Ahmad, standing in water up to his neck, held on to the pram, trying to keep the baby above water. Then he heard a loud grinding noise and saw that the ferry was turning over and people were sliding down towards him. He gripped the handles of the pram tightly but it sank, pulling him underwater, his baby daughter disappearing into the darkness of the river.</p> <p>At this point, the cable pulling the ferry snapped. The left side of the hull, standing almost vertical now, hit the cable pulling the second ferry back from the island, and started to turn over. People fell on top of each other. Shahla was pushed into the water. She was still holding her mother\u2019s hand. She managed to get her head above the water, but a body fell on her, she sank again, and lost her mother\u2019s hand. When she got back to the surface, a woman in a black robe grabbed her, desperate to stay afloat, and tried to climb on top of her, pushing Shahla down again. Shahla took a breath and sank underwater, allowing herself to be dragged downstream.</p> <p>The hull stood vertical; people were trapped between the jaws of the arches and the rods connecting them. As it turned over, the arches closed like giant fangs on the people below. The ferry flipped, a green floating whale drifting downstream, chasing after dozens of bobbing heads.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Deep under the water, Ahmad lost the pram. He saw a boat nearby and swam to it, trying to grab on to the engine at the back. He shouted for help but no one heard him, or they were too absorbed in pulling people from the water. The owner of the boat came down to the stern, where Ahmad was still clinging desperately to the engine, and, ignoring the man hanging on to the propellor, pulled a cord to start the engine. It roared into life and the blades cut into Ahmad\u2019s sides. He screamed as the propellor cut his flesh.</p> <p>He let go. He knew he had lost his family. Better to die, he thought, as he sank into the water. But his body would not let him die, and involuntarily he kicked his way to the surface. He wept and mumbled thanks be to God, thanks be to God, his tears sinking into the water that carried him downstream, past riverside cafes where people stood, watching and filming.</p> <p>He reached another boat, and clutching on to the reeds, stretched out his hand and asked for help. Two men grabbed him by his arms, and a third pulled him by his belt and swung him over the edge. The body of a woman lay in the bottom of the boat, next to two dead children. The men hauled in another woman and a child, and started the engine, setting off towards the island.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b59e987ebce5b99312559939d6969fc3a1156475\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b59e987ebce5b99312559939d6969fc3a1156475/0_18_5926_3557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A ferry taking people to the Umm Rabaen island amusement park in Mosul, June 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A ferry taking people to the Umm Rabaen island amusement park in Mosul, June 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Thomas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By now, a handful of fishing boats had driven into the middle of the river to try to pull survivors out of the water. Omar, the boatman who had been anxiously watching the crowds waiting for the ferry earlier, steered towards the drowning crowd. Among the people hauled on to his boat was Aya, a young woman a few days short of her 20th birthday, who had gone to the island with her mother and sister, along with some of her aunts and cousins. Sitting in the boat, with the shock of air flowing back into her lungs, Aya recovered enough to scream. A large man, with his son hanging on his back, grabbed the side of the boat and it started teetering dangerously. Aya begged him to let go, in case he flipped the boat and drowned them all, but the man held on with all his might. A young man bent over and pulled the child hanging on the man\u2019s back into the boat. They all tried to pull the man, but he was too heavy. Too tired to hang on, he was dragged away by the current.</p> <p>In the water, Shahla was bumped and rammed by objects and bodies. She looked for her mother among the people screaming and struggling around her, but the water was pushing her fast. She saw white gulls, so loved by the people of Mosul, circling overhead. Oh lord, she thought, is it possible that they are feeding on the bodies of the dead? She had been in the water for half an hour by now. The water was cold, her winter clothes were getting heavy, her headscarf was choking her, but she hung on tightly to her mother\u2019s green bag. She didn\u2019t want her mother to lose her ID card and go through the hassle and the humiliation of long queues.</p> <p>Her chest was contracting, and she couldn\u2019t breathe, she knew that if she didn\u2019t keep swimming, she would die. She managed to catch on to a boat. She hauled herself over the side and collapsed into the bottom of the boat.</p> <p>From the safety of the boat, Shahla was able to see the extent of the disaster. Bodies floated all around them, many of them children. There was a tiny boy, three or four, dressed in a onesie and floating on his back: it reminded her of the game she played as a child, with her sisters, floating their dolls in the bathtub. To her relief, she saw that the gulls were not feasting on the dead bodies, but the food people had brought for their picnics.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The boat dropped Ahmad on the island, where he wandered along with other survivors, and watched families still enjoying their picnics. Someone gave him water, another offered him a chair. A neighbour and his wife spotted him; they took him to the island\u2019s administration office, but it had been abandoned. When the ferry sank, most of the staff had run away, fearing they would be arrested and anticipating the anger of the victims\u2019 families. The neighbours took off Ahmad\u2019s jacket and shirt and cleaned the three long cuts in his side with a piece of cloth soaked in antiseptic. At that point, he started to cry.</p> <p>An officer from the Mosul Swat police unit arrived on the island in a large civilian motorboat they had commandeered and arrested everyone who was still working there \u2013 including vendors selling coffee and burgers \u2013 but the owners and directors of the island were nowhere to be seen. The officer took pity on Ahmad and gave him a lift back to the eastern riverbank.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Omar brought Aya to the jetty and went back with his motorboat to see if he could rescue more people. She stood there shivering, her hair soaked in mud and her dress dripping with water. She was surrounded by a crowd of spectators and policemen who had gathered to watch the disaster unfold, their phones pointed at her. When Aya spotted a young policeman standing nearby, she began screaming at him. \u201cMy family, where is my family?\u201d The bewildered policeman looked at her as if she were mad.</p> <p>In front of Aya, the ineptitude and failure of the Iraqi state seemed to be laid bare. In oil-rich Iraq, the Mosul River police department had just one boat, which had sat broken for many months; they had no ropes, and no lifejackets to throw to the people drifting and drowning in front of them. While the chief of the river police had jumped in one of the civilian boats and went to help with the rescue, some of his men just stood there staring. They didn\u2019t know what to do; most of them had never trained for such a crisis and some didn\u2019t even know how to swim. In the highly corrupt Iraqi security services, many of those policemen had paid a bribe to be appointed to a comfortable job by the river, rather than one of the more dangerous posts outside the city.</p> <p>Once Shahla had been deposited back on land, a policeman stopped a passing car and told the driver to take her to the hospital. When she arrived, she searched out her mother and Umm Yussuf \u2013 first among the survivors, and then, with trepidation, among the bodies in bags. She didn\u2019t find them. She was wet, shivering and exhausted, but she didn\u2019t want to be in the hospital, which was packed with crying women and children. She collapsed on the pavement outside. \u201cThere was chaos, and no one was in control,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe bodies were dumped in the back of ambulances and pick-up trucks like they were sacks of garbage, while the policemen and the crowds filmed with their mobile phones.\u201d</p> <p>Later in the day, Shahla spoke to her brother on the phone. He was weeping. Before he said anything, she knew that her mother was dead.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The most organised institution in Mosul is the morgue. Two years after the war, it continues to receive the black and festering remains of corpses buried under mounds of debris and destroyed houses. The staff, who are efficient and thorough, compare DNA samples with their records and try to identify the victims among the thousands still missing.</p> <p>The short, stocky young director, Hassan Watheq, who has a pencil moustache and wears rimless glasses, was having his lunch when he received a phone call from a friend to tell him about the ferry. He could hear the sounds of screaming families on the phone. He hurried to the morgue, knowing that the bodies would quickly begin to disintegrate, making identification very difficult. He knew all too well the chaos that would ensue, with families pushing and shoving, trying to reclaim their dead relatives. He called for a police guard to be stationed around the morgue.</p> <p>Soon the bodies started arriving. Within an hour, there were 65 bodies in the refrigerators and hundreds of families gathering outside, women wailing, men pleading with the policemen to be allowed in. The director went outside, flanked by policemen, and climbed on top of a police truck. In his calm voice, he pleaded with the people to give him time.</p> <p>The majority of the bodies that arrived from the ferry were women and children. Even the staff of the Mosul morgue, accustomed to the sight of death, were weeping. \u201cI saw a woman clutching a five month-old child,\u201d recalled the director. \u201cBoth were dead, and I thought of my own two girls and started crying, even though death had become normal for us.\u201d</p> <p>He began posting headshots of the victims on the morgue\u2019s gate. Where ID had been found with the body, he was able to post the names of the dead. His other priority was preventing bodies from being stolen. \u201cIraqi law doesn\u2019t recognise the missing as dead until five years have passed,\u201d he explained to me, \u201cand all this time they can\u2019t get pensions or any rights. So a lot of people tried to register their missing as dead in the ferry disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Of the 128 confirmed dead, 57 were women, and 44 children. Another 69 are still missing. The latest body to be found was brought in on 11 September, almost six months after the ferry sank.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Even in a nation accustomed to fanatical militias, occupying armies and mad dictators, the ferry disaster was shocking. \u201cI have seen death in this city,\u201d the morgue director said, \u201cbut nothing as sad as this. People dressed for holidays lined up in body bags.\u201d When the public discovered that the River Authority had issued a warning about the dangers of operating the ferry that day, grief turned to anger. People were enraged by the failure of the state and the apparent recklessness of the pleasure island\u2019s owners.</p> <p>The prime minister arrived in Mosul on the evening of the disaster and announced three days of mourning. He also formed an investigation committee and declared all the victims as martyrs, to be added to the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi martyrs killed in the war. The president came the following day, and was booed by a crowd protesting against political corruption. He was bundled into a police pick-up while crowds pressed around, banging on the car.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60510392bfd701600295034f98ee29ddb5227c3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60510392bfd701600295034f98ee29ddb5227c3d/0_194_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iraqi civil defence workers recover the ferry that sank in the Tigris, 23 March 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iraqi civil defence workers recover the ferry that sank in the Tigris, 23 March 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within days, the media was reporting that there was a connection between the owner of the island, Ubaid al-Hadidi, and a notorious militia commander. Before the ferry disaster, people in Mosul had felt too scared to speak openly about the activities of the militias\u2019 economic arms. Now there were protests and sit-ins. On 24 March, the governor of Mosul, Nufal Hammadi, already under investigation for embezzlement of public funds and international aid, was sacked. He was accused of involvement with the militias\u2019 business enterprises, of raiding public funds and annexing public land. The governor told a press conference: \u201cI deny that I received a single cent or dinar from any party.\u201d</p> <p>A member of Mosul city council, who was on the investigation committee, told me the ferry had been overcrowded and sailing in very fast waters. \u201cThe official regulations specified that the ferry was allowed to work in [river speeds] that do not exceed 700 metres per minute, preferably between 400-300 metres, with a maximum capacity of 80 people on board. On the day it sank, it was carrying 287 people, and the current speed was 1,400 metres per minute,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The councillor, who asked to remain nameless, said the owners and management of the island bore direct responsibility for the incident, having apparently ignored the safety warnings. \u201c[The owner] was informed by the river police the night before, and he signed the memo. But he saw a vast crowd, and he wanted to load as many people as possible. The state institution that was supposed to monitor the work of the ferry failed in their responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that the island\u2019s owners were backed by a leader of the economic wing of one of Iraq\u2019s fiercest militias, Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq, would have made it less likely that the rules would be enforced against them. Shirwan Dubadani, MP for the city of Mosul, Shirwan Dubadani, who also sat on the parliamentary fact-finding mission last year, told me that during a meeting he attended between the former governor of Mosul, the president of Iraq and the speaker of parliament, the governor confirmed that one of the militia\u2019s most powerful men, Hayder al-Sa\u2019edy, was a partner in the island, and his men provided security. Since the liberation of Mosul, al-Sa\u2019edy had been in charge of the lucrative scrap metal business, running companies as fronts for the militia and its political party that were awarded public contracts by the governor.</p> <p>The owner of the island, Ubaid al-Hadidi, was a mid-level contractor before the fall of Mosul. Under the Isis occupation, he made a fortune buying and selling residential and agricultural lands confiscated from Christian residents expelled from the city. In 2015, he bought the concession for the island and ran it for a year and a half before he was forced to close it because of the lack of electricity and the approaching war. After the liberation of Mosul, a warrant was issued for his arrest on terrorism charges. But after al-Sa\u2019edy allegedly intervened, the charges against al-Hadidi were dropped. In return, according to MPs and intelligence officers who spoke to me about the disaster, al-Hadidi paid a \u201ccontribution\u201d of 5bn Iraqi dinars and gave al-Sa\u2019edy a 30% share in the island.</p> <p>The day after the ferry sank, al-Hadidi claimed in a phone interview with an Iraqi TV station that he and his son had not been in Mosul when the disaster occurred. The reason, he said, was that an Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq security representative had threatened them and demanded a large payment. \u201cWe would always shut the island if the water level climbed, but we haven\u2019t been in Mosul because of the threats we received,\u201d he said. Three days later, al-Hadidi and his son were arrested in Erbil and taken to a prison in Mosul. In an interview with an Iraqi TV network, a representative of Asai\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq\u2019s political wing said: \u201cEven if we accept that someone connected to the movement is a partner in the island, that does not mean that Asa\u2019ib are responsible for what happened.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When they brought the body of Ustad Ahmad\u2019s wife to his house on the night of the accident, he refused to see her. He did not attend her funeral. The body of his eldest boy was found the day after the ferry sank, trapped under the capsized hull. His other son and baby girl will never be found.</p> <p>After the disaster, Ahmad could not stand to see his boys\u2019 toys and school bags. \u201cI asked my mother to remove all their belongings and give them away,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remember them. I want to forget their memories.\u201d As he spoke, his voice was breaking. \u201cI imagine all that happened as a dream; I talk about it as if it was a story that happened to someone else.\u201d He was sitting in his mother\u2019s house, the confident pride of the school principal was gone. He looked old and tired, his back bent and face sagging.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c1cccf65b362edb14db7b407d16cae459f6f92f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1cccf65b362edb14db7b407d16cae459f6f92f0/0_86_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ustad Ahmad family for Mosul ferry disaster\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ustad Ahmad\u2019s wife, sons and baby daughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou know, we had lost another baby girl two years ago, she was the same age, a mirror image of this one, same laughter, the same face,\u201d he said. Two years earlier, when their house was struck by an Isis mortar, Ahmad had run into the street carrying the other daughter, his wife and boys following him. His brother and neighbours rushed to help them. His brother pulled the baby from his arms, while Ahmad and his wife went back to the house to collect their valuables. When the couple were back in the house, another mortar exploded. Ahmad ran outside to find his brother and 10 of the neighbours dead. His baby daughter was dead. \u201cMaybe it was in our fate to die on that day, but we missed death, and it caught up with us on the ferry,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Ahmad does not blame incompetence or corruption for the ferry disaster. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was negligence, but what can I do about the owner, how can I get my justice from him? Is he much worse than the people who stood watching while people were floating in front of them? No one came to save us; no one volunteered to come down into the water; people just stood watching. No one helped. When they took me back to the island, I saw people sitting eating their picnics. This unfeeling attitude \u2013 is it because of all the death the city had seen?\u201d</p> <p>In the autumn, I visited Aya at her aunt\u2019s house. \u201cWhat caused the ferry to sink was corruption and negligence; treating the people as if they are nothing,\u201d she told me. She spoke forcefully, her grief mixed with the bitterness of being abandoned by the state. \u201cMy mother said after this war, the destruction, the savagery of the killings, nothing worse would happen to us. We were liberated in March 2017, and in March 2019 she died.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/after-the-liberation-of-mosul-an-orgy-of-killing\">After the liberation of Mosul, an orgy of killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNo one cares this happened here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ferry will be forgotten just like all these other deaths were forgotten.\u201d In October, Aya started receiving phone calls from prominent tribal elders, pressuring her to accept an offer of blood money from the owner of the island. Al-Hadidi was offering bereaved families 10m Iraqi dinars and a plot of land on the outskirts of the city, if they would drop any charges against him and his son. The elders told her that all the other families had accepted and she was one of the last holding out. \u201cI was refusing to sign, but all the families had signed, they tell me that they won\u2019t get anything from the state and they need the money. I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Aya.</p> <p>I called the MP Shirwan Dobadani to ask him about the compensation offer. He told me that it was true \u2013 two prominent tribal sheikhs had intervened as intermediaries. \u201cIf the families wait for the judicial system to give them justice, they won\u2019t get anything,\u201d Dobadani said. \u201cThere are thousands of cases of murder and assassination that haven\u2019t been solved.

      "bodyText": "Early in the morning on 21 March, in Mosul\u2019s flat and dusty al-Baker neighbourhood, a school principal named Ustad Ahmad went to see his mother. It was the start of the new year holiday of Nowruz, and she asked if they could go to the cemetery to visit his father\u2019s grave. Ahmad had other ideas. He was planning to take his wife and children to an amusement park, as a reward for the boys\u2019 full marks in their recent exams. Besides, he told his mother, he didn\u2019t want to be reminded of death on such a beautiful spring day. Back home, after breakfast with the boys, Ahmad sat on a wooden chair in the bathroom for his weekly shave. Then, preparing to go out, he put on his new summer blazer, a pair of jeans and the wraparound sunglasses his wife had recently bought for him. Tall and burly, Ahmad was a very proud man \u2013 proud of his status among his colleagues, the comfort and neatness of his house, his smart and witty boys, his beautiful baby daughter and above all, his clever, outgoing wife, who loved to travel. At around 1pm, the family caught a taxi to the amusement park, and Ahmad gave the boys enough money to go on every ride. He even joined them for a round on the bumper cars. Things hadn\u2019t always been as comfortable for Ahmad as they were now. When Islamic State took over Mosul in 2014, he had been deemed \u201cunreliable\u201d and expelled from his teaching job. For three years he was unemployed and unable to provide for his family. He sold his wife\u2019s gold and some of their furniture, borrowed money from his mother and brother, and became dependent on whatever his wife\u2019s family could spare them. Friends and neighbours nagged him to go out and find work as a day labourer, or get himself a pushcart and work in the vegetable market. But how could he? A school principal can\u2019t work in the market, he felt. He rarely left the house and sank into depression, arguing with his wife and children, who stopped going to school. Now, two years after the liberation of Mosul, he was proud to be a respectable principal once more, even if the city was still in ruins and his school barely functioning. Mosul is a city broken by war and corruption. Today, the early euphoria of liberation from Islamic State is dissolving as the failure of reconstruction efforts becomes increasingly apparent. Pledges to rebuild the city remain unfulfilled, while the five bridges spanning the river Tigris have either collapsed or are strung together by military pontoons. Hundreds of thousands of people who were driven out of their homes during the fighting are still living in camps. The security situation is deteriorating and Islamic State cells are re-emerging. Across Iraq, anger against political elites is rising. In recent weeks, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have taken to the streets of Baghdad to demand a complete overhaul of the political system. After two months of demonstrations, in which 400 were killed and thousands injured, the prime minister resigned, but the crowds are still camping out in main squares across the country, waiting for the rest of their demands to be met. At the same time, what endures is the tenacity and resilience of the people of Mosul, their love of life and entrepreneurial spirit. During the later stages of the war, as the city was being retaken block-by-block by the Iraqi army, liberated neighbourhoods would spring back to life quickly. Families returned to their homes and teams of young volunteers cleared rubble from their streets. Even as the fighting raged just a few blocks away, someone would start selling cigarettes, a grocer would reopen with a box of half-rotten tomatoes and canned beans, and refurbished shops and restaurants would spring up, albeit without water or electricity. Those who could raise a bit of money began rebuilding their homes, while still waiting for the compensation their government had promised them. People allowed themselves the small reward of a meal out with their families. It was close to 2pm when Ahmad\u2019s family settled down to have their lunch, but there were no shaded areas in the park. The boys suggested that they go to Umm Rabaen, a pleasure island on the Tigris River. It was cooler by the water and there was a picnic area, and another amusement park. Ahmad called another taxi and they headed to the island. Umm Rabaen embodies the mixture of ruin and resurgence that defines Mosul. It was first turned into a pleasure island during the late 80s, when riverside cafes, restaurants, chalets and the pyramid-shaped Oberoi hotel were built as part of a grand development plan. The hotel is now a ruined shell, and most of the trees have been chopped down for firewood. But cafes and restaurants have been restored and reopened, and on weekends, the people of Mosul flock to the island to sit at white plastic tables, drinking tea or eating grilled kebabs. The familiar sight of the Tigris flowing beside them, fast and muddy, is a reminder of the endurance of their city, just as the view of the ruined buildings on the opposite bank brings back memories of the vicious war that they only just survived. Like many businesses in Mosul, since the liberation of the city from Isis, the island was part-owned by a member of the economic wing of a powerful militia. Earlier this year, a parliamentary commission reported that armed groups, working through their economic wings, have secured public contracts for businesses, in return for large kickbacks. They control the multimillion-dollar scrap metal trade and oil smuggling operations, as well as imposing illegal tolls on commercial traffic. The businesses they own are unaccountable, their funding is untraceable and, through a combination of fear and corruption, there is almost no oversight. The result, for the people enjoying their new year holiday in Mosul, was disaster. * * * That same morning, in a different part of Mosul, a woman named Shahla woke up feeling cheerful and decided to take her mother to a new restaurant for brunch. Tomorrow would be her mother\u2019s 72nd birthday and Shahla and her two sisters had bought gifts, ordered cakes and sweets, and stuffed aubergines, zucchini and vine leaves with meat and rice, arranging them in a large dolma pot for the family feast. Today, though, Shahla had her mother to herself. The two women shared a particularly close bond after living as virtual prisoners under the rule of Islamic State. Their prison had been their two-storey house, which sat in a quiet neighbourhood, nestled among olive, tangerine and eucalyptus trees, not far from the eastern banks of the Tigris. Shortly after June 2014, when Isis officially declared its caliphate, the 13 Christian families that lived in the neighbourhood were expelled, their doors marked with the letter N (for Nazrites) and their houses redistributed to the organisation\u2019s senior foreign fighters. A Chechen commander lived across the street, while a Russian woman moved in next door and shouted at Shahla and her mother to cover their eyes even in their own garden. She would also send over her Egyptian husband to demand some of Shahla\u2019s mother\u2019s food. When the battle to liberate Mosul began in September 2016, the houses of the foreign fighters in the neighbourhood became a target. Three were levelled in airstrikes that shook Shahla\u2019s home and shattered their windows. Russian snipers set up a base in a house across the street. Other fighters fired their rocket-propelled grenades at the approaching Iraqi armoured vehicles from barricades at the end of the road. Towards the end of the battle, as the fighting intensified and Iraqi troops got closer, Islamic State fighters came knocking at their door in the middle of the night. They ordered them to leave their house and go with them: they would be human shields for the retreating fighters. The women gathered their belongings in small bags, piled food into an old wheelchair and set out. Distant explosions shook the ground under their feet. At the end of the street they came across other neighbours who had slipped away from the Isis fighters, and together they hid in the basement of an abandoned house. Twenty-five women and children hid in that dark basement for three nights, while above, battle raged. When finally they heard on the radio that their neighbourhood was liberated, they remained trapped in their hiding place. They could hear fighters in the house, searching for civilian hostages to ensure their safe retreat. In the basement, the families crouched in darkness, holding their breath. Not until they heard the roars of army trucks and armoured vehicles had they dared to move. After their brunch, Shahla was in the kitchen preparing a pot of sweet Turkish coffee, while her mother sat reading in the garden, when Umm Yussuf, a friend of her mother, called to invite them for tea at the pleasure island that afternoon. Shahla didn\u2019t want to go out. She thought that on a sunny public holiday the island would be too crowded. But her mother wanted to go \u2013 the weather was beautiful, and she hadn\u2019t seen Umm Yussuf for weeks, so Shahla eventually agreed. She prepared a basket of food and a flask of coffee and they set off. It took Shahla and her mother 20 minutes to walk from their house to the river. Her mother was glad to be out, and her cheeks were flushed from the warm afternoon sun. When she saw the large crowd that had gathered at the river bank, Shahla thought the whole of Mosul must be here. She didn\u2019t like crowds, and she was trying to ask her mother if they could leave, when Umm Yussuf found them. The two old women hugged and the three of them slowly headed towards the ferry to the island. * * * Umm Rabaen island is connected to the east bank of the Tigris, less than 100 metres across the water, by two cable-pulled flatbed ferries, which were owned and maintained as part of the amusement park and island. The ferry allegedly had no safety provisions, security staff were reportedly unskilled and inept, and the service was rarely, if ever, subject to inspection. As the crowd waiting for the ferry swelled, a short man with alert, beady eyes watched with growing unease. Omar was sitting nearby in an old motorboat whose white fibreglass coating had turned yellowish-brown with age. He noticed that in the past couple of hours the water had risen quickly. The lower decks of the riverside cafes, where he had moored his boat, had been submerged, and plastic tables and chairs taken to higher decks. The day before, the river police had told the ferry management that it would need to suspend operations because of the unusual quantity of water being released from the Mosul dam higher up the river, after heavy rainfall. Everyone who lived or worked along the river had been informed \u2013 boatmen, cafe owners, even the farmers who raised water buffalos on the southern edge of the city. But the ferry was running as normal. At 3pm, it docked at the jetty on the eastern bank, and a single line of people descended, squeezing their way through the families waiting to board. The two crowds intermingled in a sea of coloured headscarves, pushing, and moving slowly. Everyone was in their holiday clothes, young men and boys wore suits and bow ties, girls wore dresses with frills. Shahla went down the steps on to the ferry carrying her bag, the food basket and her mother\u2019s handbag. She noticed that the water level was very high. Her mother and Umm Yussuf walked behind her slowly, holding hands. Ahmad and his family climbed down the steps backwards with the pram, one step at a time. The back of the ferry was full, but more people pushed to enter. By the time it started moving, nearly 300 people were crammed onboard. The ferry was a contraption made from two sections of an old pontoon bridge welded together and decorated with arches that rose high on either side. Steel wires stretched between the arches above a row of benches. Motors mounted on opposite sides of the river pulled cables connected to the front and back of the ferry. A third, guiding cable resisted the push of the currents and maintained the ferry on a straight course. The ferry shook and shuddered as it moved. The strength of the current pushed it downstream before the cable pulling it corrected its path and it shifted slightly upstream. The operator, standing in the back, noticed the ferry was tilting and started walking to the front, telling people to move away from the listing right side. The back of the ferry was being dragged by the current, pulling the ferry off its line. As the ferry jerked and swayed, a few kids climbed over the right-side railing, trying to see what was going on. A small wave gushed over the deck, covering Shahla\u2019s feet. Growing scared, her mother said that the three of them should go back and sit in a cafe on the shore, as if they could still walk away. Shahla tried to reassure her, but she could see that people were frightened. Elsewhere on the ferry, where Ahmad was standing, women were crying. He stuck by the railing, assuring his wife and children that the ferry would right itself, while clutching the pram handles tightly. A second, bigger wave surged in. The ferry began listing to the right. The boys hanging on the right side railings threw themselves into the frothing water. Just over a minute into the crossing, the ferry had tilted so far that one third of the deck was underwater, and most of the people were clambering on the other side, but the ferry couldn\u2019t right itself. Ahmad, standing in water up to his neck, held on to the pram, trying to keep the baby above water. Then he heard a loud grinding noise and saw that the ferry was turning over and people were sliding down towards him. He gripped the handles of the pram tightly but it sank, pulling him underwater, his baby daughter disappearing into the darkness of the river. At this point, the cable pulling the ferry snapped. The left side of the hull, standing almost vertical now, hit the cable pulling the second ferry back from the island, and started to turn over. People fell on top of each other. Shahla was pushed into the water. She was still holding her mother\u2019s hand. She managed to get her head above the water, but a body fell on her, she sank again, and lost her mother\u2019s hand. When she got back to the surface, a woman in a black robe grabbed her, desperate to stay afloat, and tried to climb on top of her, pushing Shahla down again. Shahla took a breath and sank underwater, allowing herself to be dragged downstream. The hull stood vertical; people were trapped between the jaws of the arches and the rods connecting them. As it turned over, the arches closed like giant fangs on the people below. The ferry flipped, a green floating whale drifting downstream, chasing after dozens of bobbing heads. * * * Deep under the water, Ahmad lost the pram. He saw a boat nearby and swam to it, trying to grab on to the engine at the back. He shouted for help but no one heard him, or they were too absorbed in pulling people from the water. The owner of the boat came down to the stern, where Ahmad was still clinging desperately to the engine, and, ignoring the man hanging on to the propellor, pulled a cord to start the engine. It roared into life and the blades cut into Ahmad\u2019s sides. He screamed as the propellor cut his flesh. He let go. He knew he had lost his family. Better to die, he thought, as he sank into the water. But his body would not let him die, and involuntarily he kicked his way to the surface. He wept and mumbled thanks be to God, thanks be to God, his tears sinking into the water that carried him downstream, past riverside cafes where people stood, watching and filming. He reached another boat, and clutching on to the reeds, stretched out his hand and asked for help. Two men grabbed him by his arms, and a third pulled him by his belt and swung him over the edge. The body of a woman lay in the bottom of the boat, next to two dead children. The men hauled in another woman and a child, and started the engine, setting off towards the island. By now, a handful of fishing boats had driven into the middle of the river to try to pull survivors out of the water. Omar, the boatman who had been anxiously watching the crowds waiting for the ferry earlier, steered towards the drowning crowd. Among the people hauled on to his boat was Aya, a young woman a few days short of her 20th birthday, who had gone to the island with her mother and sister, along with some of her aunts and cousins. Sitting in the boat, with the shock of air flowing back into her lungs, Aya recovered enough to scream. A large man, with his son hanging on his back, grabbed the side of the boat and it started teetering dangerously. Aya begged him to let go, in case he flipped the boat and drowned them all, but the man held on with all his might. A young man bent over and pulled the child hanging on the man\u2019s back into the boat. They all tried to pull the man, but he was too heavy. Too tired to hang on, he was dragged away by the current. In the water, Shahla was bumped and rammed by objects and bodies. She looked for her mother among the people screaming and struggling around her, but the water was pushing her fast. She saw white gulls, so loved by the people of Mosul, circling overhead. Oh lord, she thought, is it possible that they are feeding on the bodies of the dead? She had been in the water for half an hour by now. The water was cold, her winter clothes were getting heavy, her headscarf was choking her, but she hung on tightly to her mother\u2019s green bag. She didn\u2019t want her mother to lose her ID card and go through the hassle and the humiliation of long queues. Her chest was contracting, and she couldn\u2019t breathe, she knew that if she didn\u2019t keep swimming, she would die. She managed to catch on to a boat. She hauled herself over the side and collapsed into the bottom of the boat. From the safety of the boat, Shahla was able to see the extent of the disaster. Bodies floated all around them, many of them children. There was a tiny boy, three or four, dressed in a onesie and floating on his back: it reminded her of the game she played as a child, with her sisters, floating their dolls in the bathtub. To her relief, she saw that the gulls were not feasting on the dead bodies, but the food people had brought for their picnics. * * * The boat dropped Ahmad on the island, where he wandered along with other survivors, and watched families still enjoying their picnics. Someone gave him water, another offered him a chair. A neighbour and his wife spotted him; they took him to the island\u2019s administration office, but it had been abandoned. When the ferry sank, most of the staff had run away, fearing they would be arrested and anticipating the anger of the victims\u2019 families. The neighbours took off Ahmad\u2019s jacket and shirt and cleaned the three long cuts in his side with a piece of cloth soaked in antiseptic. At that point, he started to cry. An officer from the Mosul Swat police unit arrived on the island in a large civilian motorboat they had commandeered and arrested everyone who was still working there \u2013 including vendors selling coffee and burgers \u2013 but the owners and directors of the island were nowhere to be seen. The officer took pity on Ahmad and gave him a lift back to the eastern riverbank. Meanwhile, Omar brought Aya to the jetty and went back with his motorboat to see if he could rescue more people. She stood there shivering, her hair soaked in mud and her dress dripping with water. She was surrounded by a crowd of spectators and policemen who had gathered to watch the disaster unfold, their phones pointed at her. When Aya spotted a young policeman standing nearby, she began screaming at him. \u201cMy family, where is my family?\u201d The bewildered policeman looked at her as if she were mad. In front of Aya, the ineptitude and failure of the Iraqi state seemed to be laid bare. In oil-rich Iraq, the Mosul River police department had just one boat, which had sat broken for many months; they had no ropes, and no lifejackets to throw to the people drifting and drowning in front of them. While the chief of the river police had jumped in one of the civilian boats and went to help with the rescue, some of his men just stood there staring. They didn\u2019t know what to do; most of them had never trained for such a crisis and some didn\u2019t even know how to swim. In the highly corrupt Iraqi security services, many of those policemen had paid a bribe to be appointed to a comfortable job by the river, rather than one of the more dangerous posts outside the city. Once Shahla had been deposited back on land, a policeman stopped a passing car and told the driver to take her to the hospital. When she arrived, she searched out her mother and Umm Yussuf \u2013 first among the survivors, and then, with trepidation, among the bodies in bags. She didn\u2019t find them. She was wet, shivering and exhausted, but she didn\u2019t want to be in the hospital, which was packed with crying women and children. She collapsed on the pavement outside. \u201cThere was chaos, and no one was in control,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe bodies were dumped in the back of ambulances and pick-up trucks like they were sacks of garbage, while the policemen and the crowds filmed with their mobile phones.\u201d Later in the day, Shahla spoke to her brother on the phone. He was weeping. Before he said anything, she knew that her mother was dead. * * * The most organised institution in Mosul is the morgue. Two years after the war, it continues to receive the black and festering remains of corpses buried under mounds of debris and destroyed houses. The staff, who are efficient and thorough, compare DNA samples with their records and try to identify the victims among the thousands still missing. The short, stocky young director, Hassan Watheq, who has a pencil moustache and wears rimless glasses, was having his lunch when he received a phone call from a friend to tell him about the ferry. He could hear the sounds of screaming families on the phone. He hurried to the morgue, knowing that the bodies would quickly begin to disintegrate, making identification very difficult. He knew all too well the chaos that would ensue, with families pushing and shoving, trying to reclaim their dead relatives. He called for a police guard to be stationed around the morgue. Soon the bodies started arriving. Within an hour, there were 65 bodies in the refrigerators and hundreds of families gathering outside, women wailing, men pleading with the policemen to be allowed in. The director went outside, flanked by policemen, and climbed on top of a police truck. In his calm voice, he pleaded with the people to give him time. The majority of the bodies that arrived from the ferry were women and children. Even the staff of the Mosul morgue, accustomed to the sight of death, were weeping. \u201cI saw a woman clutching a five month-old child,\u201d recalled the director. \u201cBoth were dead, and I thought of my own two girls and started crying, even though death had become normal for us.\u201d He began posting headshots of the victims on the morgue\u2019s gate. Where ID had been found with the body, he was able to post the names of the dead. His other priority was preventing bodies from being stolen. \u201cIraqi law doesn\u2019t recognise the missing as dead until five years have passed,\u201d he explained to me, \u201cand all this time they can\u2019t get pensions or any rights. So a lot of people tried to register their missing as dead in the ferry disaster.\u201d Of the 128 confirmed dead, 57 were women, and 44 children. Another 69 are still missing. The latest body to be found was brought in on 11 September, almost six months after the ferry sank. * * * Even in a nation accustomed to fanatical militias, occupying armies and mad dictators, the ferry disaster was shocking. \u201cI have seen death in this city,\u201d the morgue director said, \u201cbut nothing as sad as this. People dressed for holidays lined up in body bags.\u201d When the public discovered that the River Authority had issued a warning about the dangers of operating the ferry that day, grief turned to anger. People were enraged by the failure of the state and the apparent recklessness of the pleasure island\u2019s owners. The prime minister arrived in Mosul on the evening of the disaster and announced three days of mourning. He also formed an investigation committee and declared all the victims as martyrs, to be added to the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi martyrs killed in the war. The president came the following day, and was booed by a crowd protesting against political corruption. He was bundled into a police pick-up while crowds pressed around, banging on the car. Within days, the media was reporting that there was a connection between the owner of the island, Ubaid al-Hadidi, and a notorious militia commander. Before the ferry disaster, people in Mosul had felt too scared to speak openly about the activities of the militias\u2019 economic arms. Now there were protests and sit-ins. On 24 March, the governor of Mosul, Nufal Hammadi, already under investigation for embezzlement of public funds and international aid, was sacked. He was accused of involvement with the militias\u2019 business enterprises, of raiding public funds and annexing public land. The governor told a press conference: \u201cI deny that I received a single cent or dinar from any party.\u201d A member of Mosul city council, who was on the investigation committee, told me the ferry had been overcrowded and sailing in very fast waters. \u201cThe official regulations specified that the ferry was allowed to work in [river speeds] that do not exceed 700 metres per minute, preferably between 400-300 metres, with a maximum capacity of 80 people on board. On the day it sank, it was carrying 287 people, and the current speed was 1,400 metres per minute,\u201d he said. The councillor, who asked to remain nameless, said the owners and management of the island bore direct responsibility for the incident, having apparently ignored the safety warnings. \u201c[The owner] was informed by the river police the night before, and he signed the memo. But he saw a vast crowd, and he wanted to load as many people as possible. The state institution that was supposed to monitor the work of the ferry failed in their responsibility.\u201d The fact that the island\u2019s owners were backed by a leader of the economic wing of one of Iraq\u2019s fiercest militias, Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq, would have made it less likely that the rules would be enforced against them. Shirwan Dubadani, MP for the city of Mosul, Shirwan Dubadani, who also sat on the parliamentary fact-finding mission last year, told me that during a meeting he attended between the former governor of Mosul, the president of Iraq and the speaker of parliament, the governor confirmed that one of the militia\u2019s most powerful men, Hayder al-Sa\u2019edy, was a partner in the island, and his men provided security. Since the liberation of Mosul, al-Sa\u2019edy had been in charge of the lucrative scrap metal business, running companies as fronts for the militia and its political party that were awarded public contracts by the governor. The owner of the island, Ubaid al-Hadidi, was a mid-level contractor before the fall of Mosul. Under the Isis occupation, he made a fortune buying and selling residential and agricultural lands confiscated from Christian residents expelled from the city. In 2015, he bought the concession for the island and ran it for a year and a half before he was forced to close it because of the lack of electricity and the approaching war. After the liberation of Mosul, a warrant was issued for his arrest on terrorism charges. But after al-Sa\u2019edy allegedly intervened, the charges against al-Hadidi were dropped. In return, according to MPs and intelligence officers who spoke to me about the disaster, al-Hadidi paid a \u201ccontribution\u201d of 5bn Iraqi dinars and gave al-Sa\u2019edy a 30% share in the island. The day after the ferry sank, al-Hadidi claimed in a phone interview with an Iraqi TV station that he and his son had not been in Mosul when the disaster occurred. The reason, he said, was that an Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq security representative had threatened them and demanded a large payment. \u201cWe would always shut the island if the water level climbed, but we haven\u2019t been in Mosul because of the threats we received,\u201d he said. Three days later, al-Hadidi and his son were arrested in Erbil and taken to a prison in Mosul. In an interview with an Iraqi TV network, a representative of Asai\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq\u2019s political wing said: \u201cEven if we accept that someone connected to the movement is a partner in the island, that does not mean that Asa\u2019ib are responsible for what happened.\u201d * * * When they brought the body of Ustad Ahmad\u2019s wife to his house on the night of the accident, he refused to see her. He did not attend her funeral. The body of his eldest boy was found the day after the ferry sank, trapped under the capsized hull. His other son and baby girl will never be found. After the disaster, Ahmad could not stand to see his boys\u2019 toys and school bags. \u201cI asked my mother to remove all their belongings and give them away,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remember them. I want to forget their memories.\u201d As he spoke, his voice was breaking. \u201cI imagine all that happened as a dream; I talk about it as if it was a story that happened to someone else.\u201d He was sitting in his mother\u2019s house, the confident pride of the school principal was gone. He looked old and tired, his back bent and face sagging. \u201cYou know, we had lost another baby girl two years ago, she was the same age, a mirror image of this one, same laughter, the same face,\u201d he said. Two years earlier, when their house was struck by an Isis mortar, Ahmad had run into the street carrying the other daughter, his wife and boys following him. His brother and neighbours rushed to help them. His brother pulled the baby from his arms, while Ahmad and his wife went back to the house to collect their valuables. When the couple were back in the house, another mortar exploded. Ahmad ran outside to find his brother and 10 of the neighbours dead. His baby daughter was dead. \u201cMaybe it was in our fate to die on that day, but we missed death, and it caught up with us on the ferry,\u201d he told me. Ahmad does not blame incompetence or corruption for the ferry disaster. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was negligence, but what can I do about the owner, how can I get my justice from him? Is he much worse than the people who stood watching while people were floating in front of them? No one came to save us; no one volunteered to come down into the water; people just stood watching. No one helped. When they took me back to the island, I saw people sitting eating their picnics. This unfeeling attitude \u2013 is it because of all the death the city had seen?\u201d In the autumn, I visited Aya at her aunt\u2019s house. \u201cWhat caused the ferry to sink was corruption and negligence; treating the people as if they are nothing,\u201d she told me. She spoke forcefully, her grief mixed with the bitterness of being abandoned by the state. \u201cMy mother said after this war, the destruction, the savagery of the killings, nothing worse would happen to us. We were liberated in March 2017, and in March 2019 she died.\u201d \u201cNo one cares this happened here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ferry will be forgotten just like all these other deaths were forgotten.\u201d In October, Aya started receiving phone calls from prominent tribal elders, pressuring her to accept an offer of blood money from the owner of the island. Al-Hadidi was offering bereaved families 10m Iraqi dinars and a plot of land on the outskirts of the city, if they would drop any charges against him and his son. The elders told her that all the other families had accepted and she was one of the last holding out. \u201cI was refusing to sign, but all the families had signed, they tell me that they won\u2019t get anything from the state and they need the money. I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Aya. I called the MP Shirwan Dobadani to ask him about the compensation offer. He told me that it was true \u2013 two prominent tribal sheikhs had intervened as intermediaries. \u201cIf the families wait for the judicial system to give them justice, they won\u2019t get anything,\u201d Dobadani said. \u201cThere are thousands of cases of murder and assassination that haven\u2019t been solved. The worst disaster in Iraq is forgotten after 72 hours.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "body": "<p>Constantly inconstant, Boris Johnson is faithful in at least one area: generating outrage. That he does as naturally as a dog cocks its leg at a lamppost.</p> \n<p>This week, he has used the bodies of those murdered at London Bridge as props for his election campaign. Last week the 55-year-old dodged a Channel 4 debate on climate change, sending instead his dad and his wingman, Michael Gove. And then there are his many columns, spitting at gay men (\u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d), single mums (\u201cuppity and irresponsible\u201d) and black people (\u201csmiling piccaninnies\u201d).</p> \n<p>I would go on, but equally so might you \u2013 and we both know what typically comes next. The performative pearl-clutching, the saucer-eyed wailing: \u201cHow could he?\u201d The sound and rote fury on social media and rolling news, followed by a satisfied, full-bellied silence as grateful journalists wait for their next steaming dollop of Boris buffoonery.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson may be a rogue, but what should worry us is that he is a risk to our economy, society, and democracy</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It passes time and it pads out columns, but it is no way to scrutinise the man who may well be our next prime minister, in charge of taking Britain out of Europe into a new era of foreign and trade relations \u2013 and rewriting our political, economic and social settlement. With the president of America strutting around London this week, the comparison is inevitable. Over this election, Johnson is playing the media and the public just as Trump did before claiming the White House in 2016.</p> \n<p>Both men are adept at exploiting the media appetite for offence over ideas, for name-calling in place of nuance. Trump calls Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d; Johnson likens Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin. Ridiculous, of course, but enough kindling for at least two days\u2019 headlines. The US president calls his counterpart in No 10 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/jul/23/they-call-him-britains-trump-trump-on-boris-johnson-video\" title=\"\">Britain Trump</a>, and both men have made the same calculation. The cash-strapped media needs eyeballs, and these two enjoy having all eyes on them \u2013 so they grab coverage and set the terms of the debate.</p> \n<p>If Johnson makes a show of himself, at least he\u2019s the star. When he has a car crash, websites thank him for the traffic. With the biggest UK newspaper groups already behind him, the Conservative leader thus ensures he gets both total control of the message from his friends and the total attention of everyone else.</p> \n<p>Who cares if they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/29/stanley-johnson-says-british-public-couldnt-spell-pinocchio-video\" title=\"\">call him Pinocchio</a>? As a journalist he made his name with tales taller than Michael Jordan \u2013 yarns about how Brussels was designating snails as fish, or imposing a maximum size on condoms. Decades before Mark Zuckerberg came along, Johnson had already gleaned the attention economy\u2019s golden rule: professional reputation matters less than providing distraction. Did anyone say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/16/stuck-zip-wire-boris-johnson-london-2012-olympics\" title=\"\">zip wire?</a></p> \n<p>This is nothing to do with appearing prime ministerial: it\u2019s about grabbing power. Like Trump, Johnson has no interest in wooing all bases. I have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/04/britain-mired-democratic-crisis-deeper-brexit\" title=\"\">written here before</a> about how the Old Etonian has gone from being Heineken \u2013 the politician who reaches the parts of the electorate other Tories cannot reach \u2013 to utter Marmite.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82c48bd7-fafe-457f-b86d-b473febd6102\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VxtdCeg7VPE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Now he pursues a political strategy for a polarised country that deliberately seeks to divide it further by treating the other side as anti-national. You want Brexit, or you\u2019re part of the remoaner elite. You want spending cuts, or you can bugger off to Venezuela. The critics are so busy fact-checking his fibs that there\u2019s less time and energy to investigate the inconvenient truth. Crucial arguments about his eligibility for office are sacrificed instead for coverage of his latest gaffe. Policy loses out to political etiquette. Opponents in the media become mere accomplices. And so one of the most significant electoral choices of our lifetime is drained of consequence.</p> \n<p>With his plans for a disastrously hard Brexit, his stated enthusiasm for tax cuts for the rich and his team schooled in the dark-money thinktanks of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/29/rightwing-thinktank-conservative-boris-johnson-brexit-atlas-network\" title=\"\">transatlantic ultra rightwing</a>, Johnson poses a serious threat to the British way of life. The details of the Whitehall-Washington trade talks released by Labour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/03/jeremy-corbyn-on-the-offensive-over-donald-trumps-plans-for-nhs\" title=\"\">last week</a> make that clear. Whatever the nervous denials from Trump and Johnson this week, everything from the food we eat to our rights at work to the state\u2019s commitment to fight climate chaos spills across the boardroom table, ready to be bargained away.</p> \n<p>Yet voters see not a danger, but a clown. <a href=\"https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2019/11/he-put-the-milk-in-before-taking-the-teabag-out-hes-a-proper-nutcase-whos-going-to-pay-me-for-a-four-day-week-my-election-focus-groups-in-stoke-bolton-and-west-brom-2/\" title=\"\">Focus groups told the pollster Michael Ashcroft</a> last month that Johnson would most probably spend a spare Friday night \u201cshagging his secretary\u201d. \u201cThere would be apologies the next morning.\u201d Boys will be boys, especially those from the Bullingdon club.</p> \n<p>There will be less laughter if he gets in. Look at the Institute for Fiscal Studies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/28/ifs-manifesto-labour-economy-investment\" title=\"\">analysis</a> of the Tory manifesto. Barely covered on the BBC or in the press, it gives the lie to those studio-sofa cliches about both parties \u201cbidding to see who can spend the most\u201d.</p> \n<p>Instead, it calculates that a <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/election/2019/article/conservative-manifesto-an-initial-reaction-from-ifs-researchers\" title=\"\">Johnson government will spend less, day to day,</a> on everything outside the NHS \u2013 which is to say crucial things such as teachers or social security or care for the elderly, than 2010 levels \u2013 even as the fallout from his Brexit crash sucks jobs and money out of the private sector. A decade of cuts may have pushed your schools, your libraries, your councils to breaking point \u2013 but Johnson will ensure austerity carries on well into the next decade.</p> \n<p>In their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/24/how-democracies-die-review\" title=\"\">guide to this new age of autocracy</a>, How Democracies Die, the Harvard political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt compile a checklist titled \u201cKey indicators of authoritarian behavior\u201d. Intended to illustrate Trump\u2019s assault on democratic norms, it should serve as warning of how far Johnson may dismantle the UK\u2019s own checks and balances.</p> \n<p>\u201cDo they reject the Constitution or express a willingness to violate it?\u201d the checklist begins.

      "bodyText": "Constantly inconstant, Boris Johnson is faithful in at least one area: generating outrage. That he does as naturally as a dog cocks its leg at a lamppost. This week, he has used the bodies of those murdered at London Bridge as props for his election campaign. Last week the 55-year-old dodged a Channel 4 debate on climate change, sending instead his dad and his wingman, Michael Gove. And then there are his many columns, spitting at gay men (\u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d), single mums (\u201cuppity and irresponsible\u201d) and black people (\u201csmiling piccaninnies\u201d). I would go on, but equally so might you \u2013 and we both know what typically comes next. The performative pearl-clutching, the saucer-eyed wailing: \u201cHow could he?\u201d The sound and rote fury on social media and rolling news, followed by a satisfied, full-bellied silence as grateful journalists wait for their next steaming dollop of Boris buffoonery. It passes time and it pads out columns, but it is no way to scrutinise the man who may well be our next prime minister, in charge of taking Britain out of Europe into a new era of foreign and trade relations \u2013 and rewriting our political, economic and social settlement. With the president of America strutting around London this week, the comparison is inevitable. Over this election, Johnson is playing the media and the public just as Trump did before claiming the White House in 2016. Both men are adept at exploiting the media appetite for offence over ideas, for name-calling in place of nuance. Trump calls Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d; Johnson likens Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin. Ridiculous, of course, but enough kindling for at least two days\u2019 headlines. The US president calls his counterpart in No 10 Britain Trump, and both men have made the same calculation. The cash-strapped media needs eyeballs, and these two enjoy having all eyes on them \u2013 so they grab coverage and set the terms of the debate. If Johnson makes a show of himself, at least he\u2019s the star. When he has a car crash, websites thank him for the traffic. With the biggest UK newspaper groups already behind him, the Conservative leader thus ensures he gets both total control of the message from his friends and the total attention of everyone else. Who cares if they call him Pinocchio? As a journalist he made his name with tales taller than Michael Jordan \u2013 yarns about how Brussels was designating snails as fish, or imposing a maximum size on condoms. Decades before Mark Zuckerberg came along, Johnson had already gleaned the attention economy\u2019s golden rule: professional reputation matters less than providing distraction. Did anyone say zip wire? This is nothing to do with appearing prime ministerial: it\u2019s about grabbing power. Like Trump, Johnson has no interest in wooing all bases. I have written here before about how the Old Etonian has gone from being Heineken \u2013 the politician who reaches the parts of the electorate other Tories cannot reach \u2013 to utter Marmite. Now he pursues a political strategy for a polarised country that deliberately seeks to divide it further by treating the other side as anti-national. You want Brexit, or you\u2019re part of the remoaner elite. You want spending cuts, or you can bugger off to Venezuela. The critics are so busy fact-checking his fibs that there\u2019s less time and energy to investigate the inconvenient truth. Crucial arguments about his eligibility for office are sacrificed instead for coverage of his latest gaffe. Policy loses out to political etiquette. Opponents in the media become mere accomplices. And so one of the most significant electoral choices of our lifetime is drained of consequence. With his plans for a disastrously hard Brexit, his stated enthusiasm for tax cuts for the rich and his team schooled in the dark-money thinktanks of the transatlantic ultra rightwing, Johnson poses a serious threat to the British way of life. The details of the Whitehall-Washington trade talks released by Labour last week make that clear. Whatever the nervous denials from Trump and Johnson this week, everything from the food we eat to our rights at work to the state\u2019s commitment to fight climate chaos spills across the boardroom table, ready to be bargained away. Yet voters see not a danger, but a clown. Focus groups told the pollster Michael Ashcroft last month that Johnson would most probably spend a spare Friday night \u201cshagging his secretary\u201d. \u201cThere would be apologies the next morning.\u201d Boys will be boys, especially those from the Bullingdon club. There will be less laughter if he gets in. Look at the Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis of the Tory manifesto. Barely covered on the BBC or in the press, it gives the lie to those studio-sofa cliches about both parties \u201cbidding to see who can spend the most\u201d. Instead, it calculates that a Johnson government will spend less, day to day, on everything outside the NHS \u2013 which is to say crucial things such as teachers or social security or care for the elderly, than 2010 levels \u2013 even as the fallout from his Brexit crash sucks jobs and money out of the private sector. A decade of cuts may have pushed your schools, your libraries, your councils to breaking point \u2013 but Johnson will ensure austerity carries on well into the next decade. In their guide to this new age of autocracy, How Democracies Die, the Harvard political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt compile a checklist titled \u201cKey indicators of authoritarian behavior\u201d. Intended to illustrate Trump\u2019s assault on democratic norms, it should serve as warning of how far Johnson may dismantle the UK\u2019s own checks and balances. \u201cDo they reject the Constitution or express a willingness to violate it?\u201d the checklist begins. And one recalls Johnson\u2019s attempted prorogation of parliament that the supreme court ruled unlawful, and the ominous line in the Tory manifesto that pledges to \u201clook at the broader aspects of our constitution\u201d. Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement grants him so-called Henry VIII powers to change laws after Brexit without needing to pass a fresh act of parliament. As a House of Lords report last month shows, workers\u2019 rights and governance of Northern Ireland will be in his hands. \u201cDo they baselessly suggest that their rivals are foreign agents?\u201d Remember Johnson accusing Corbyn of \u201csiding with the Russian spin machine\u201d simply for wanting evidence over the Salisbury poisoning? \u201cHave they threatened to take legal or other punitive action against \u2026 the media?\u201d After Channel 4 editors swapped no-show Johnson with an ice sculpture at last Thursday\u2019s party leaders\u2019 debate, No 10 threatened to review the broadcaster\u2019s licence. Were such things happening in another state, especially outside the west, our journalists would be quick to talk about autocracy. Urgent protests would pour forth from NGOs and politicians, perhaps including our prime minister. Inside our borders it is harder to find such clarity of perspective, yet the danger is visible. Johnson may be a rogue, but what should worry us is that he is a risk to our economy, society and democracy. His bad manners should not distract from the fact he is a bad man.

      "bodyText": "The official report into the police shooting of a man whose death sparked the 2011 riots is facing a new challenge from human rights investigators who say a virtual model of the shooting shows its main conclusion is wrong. The shooting of Mark Duggan, 29, in Tottenham, north London, in August 2011, triggered the biggest riots in modern English history. An investigation by the police watchdog found he was most likely shot while holding a gun that he was probably \u201cin the process of throwing\u201d away. An illegal firearm was found over a fence and 14 feet (4.35 metres) from where Duggan fell. None of the police officers surrounding him saw it flying through the air. Now work by Forensic Architecture, a London-based research organisation that uses modern technology to search urban areas for evidence, claims it was unlikely that Duggan was holding a gun when he came face to face with police. They used the official accounts from officers and official records to recreate a virtual model of the scene. They say it allows people to experience what each officer could have seen throughout the incident, and their fields of vision. Prof Eyal Weizman of FA said their work undermines the finding by the police watchdog, which was then called the Independent Police Complaints Commission. He said: \u201cWe generated a precise 3D model of the site within which we played the different scenarios proposed by the police officers involved as well as the accounts of the official IPCC investigation and the inquest, checking their plausibility.\u201d Weizman said if the gun had been tossed away, it would have been in the field of vision of officers. \u201cThe model allowed us, for the first time, to give a depiction of what each of the police officers on site could have seen. We found that the conclusion arrived at by the IPCC, that Mark Duggan held the gun in his hand and threw it when he was shot, is incorrect,\u201d Weizman added. An inquest jury found the shooting to be lawful, and the police watchdog found no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the officer who shot Duggan, known only as V53. On the day he was shot, police correctly believed Duggan was trying to obtain a firearm, which he did get from a criminal contact. As he drove from east London, where he had collected the gun, towards Tottenham, Duggan was being followed by armed police, and became aware they were tailing him. The cab he was in was forced to stop by three Met police vehicles. The time from when his cab stopped to when he was shot lasts around five seconds, a short period of time whose events are still subject to claim and counter-claim. Once stopped, Duggan did not surrender but fled out of the cab on to a pavement. There, V53 shot him twice, once in the arm, and in the chest, believing Duggan was holding a gun. Duggan was surrounded by officers, some of whom were just a few feet away, when he was shot. FA is based at Goldsmiths, University of London and has investigated alleged human rights abuses around the world on behalf of clients such as the United Nations special rapporteur for counter-terrorism and human rights and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. For their work on the Duggan case they were commissioned by the dead man\u2019s family lawyers who were suing the Met. The intention was their virtual model reconstruction could be an aid to the court if civil proceedings had continued. The Met settled for an undisclosed sum running into the tens of thousands, without admitting liability, to the family of a man it was ruled was lawfully killed. In 2014, an inquest jury concluded that Duggan threw the firearm from the cab when it was forced to stop, and it landed over the fence. The jury decided Duggan was not holding a gun when shot. Weizman said: \u201cWe also found that inquest\u2019s jury conclusion that Mark Duggan has thrown the gun before he exited the minicab, has problems with it, namely, our model showed that the gun would have travelled through the field of vision of several key witnesses that could have seen it.\u201d Weizman added: \u201cWe think that the right thing is for this case to be reopened.\u201d Stafford Scott, a community activist who has supported the Duggan family, said: \u201cHad we had the FA model at our disposal during the inquest process the outcome would surely have been a different one.\u201d The officer who shot Duggan, V53, says he had an honestly held belief that he saw a gun in Duggan\u2019s right hand and his right arm beginning to move.

Did he deserve any?

Unsworth told the federal court in Los Angeles that Musk\u2019s 15 July 2018 tweet calling him \u201cpedo guy\u201d made him feel \u201chumiliated, ashamed, dirty\u201d.</p> <p>The court is considering if the tweet constituted defamation.</p> <p>As jurors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/04/elon-musk-pedo-guy-insult-was-not-classy-but-not-meant-literally\">heard on Tuesday</a>, Musk made his remarks after Unsworth mocked the miniature submarine that he had built and delivered to the rescue site.

Musk denied he had ever sought to take credit for helping the cave rescue: \u201cThe pump and generator team deserve immense credit,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody talks about them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/03/elon-musk-defamation-trial-begins-in-case-brought-by-british-diver\">Elon Musk on trial: CEO accused of defamation over 'pedo guy' remarks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under cross-examination by Unsworth\u2019s attorney, Lin Wood, one of the reasons for this came into focus, however.<strong> </strong>Musk was asked<strong> </strong>why he had used Twitter to apologize to Unsworth for the \u201cpedo guy\u201d remark, rather than contacting him directly or giving an interview on television. Musk said: \u201cMost things I say on Twitter will generally get some press awareness \u2026 If I write something on Twitter, it will get reported.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed.</p> <p>Wood introduced into evidence what appeared to be dozens of tweets sent by Musk documenting the process of building the submarine and delivering it to Thailand, including a video showing SpaceX engineers testing the tube in a swimming pool.</p> <p>Faced with the volume of tweets that Musk had just admitted were likely to generate press coverage, the billionaire responded defensively. \u201cI mean, I tweet a lot in general \u2026 I was looking for feedback from the public to see if there were any improvements they could suggest.</p> <p>\u201cI frequently solicit feedback on Tesla car design, even rockets,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve incorporated quite a lot of feedback from Twitter on Tesla car design.\u201d</p> <p>Unsaid, but obvious to the members of the media who chased Musk out of the courtroom the moment he was dismissed, was that nobody was talking about the pump and generator teams because everyone was talking about Musk and his mini-sub.</p> <p>Much of the rest of Musk\u2019s testimony involved a close parsing of the degree of flippancy that should be accorded to \u201cpedo\u201d versus \u201cpedo guy\u201d, and further questions about Musk\u2019s intent when he deployed the phrase against Unsworth.</p> <p>\u201cI did not accuse Mr Unsworth of being a pedophile,\u201d Musk said.</p> <h2>Unsworth speaks</h2> <p>After sitting silently with his attorneys for the first day and a half of the trial, Unsworth took the stand on Wednesday afternoon to describe the impact of Musk\u2019s words.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you combine \u2018sus\u2019 with \u2018pedo guy\u2019, I took it to mean I was being branded a pedophile,\u201d Unsworth said with obvious distress, his voice breaking multiple times. \u201cI feel humiliated, ashamed, dirty \u2026 I was effectively given a life sentence without parole. At times I feel very vulnerable. It hurts to talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>The 64-year-old Briton\u2019s noticeable discomfort provided a striking contrast with Musk\u2019s appearance that included references to the Simpsons, marijuana and his own net worth.</p> <p>Unsworth said he had worked as a consultant on three books about the cave rescue, and appeared in two documentaries, for which he was paid a total of about $3,000.</p> <p>His testimony will continue Thursday.</p> <h2>Ineptitude and heroism</h2> <p><strong> </strong>The head of Musk\u2019s family office, Jared Birchall, also testified on Wednesday about efforts to dig up dirt on Unsworth that might prove the cave explorer was actually a pedophile.</p> <p>Birchall testified to hiring James Howard, without performing any due diligence. Howard was a private investigator who falsely claimed to have worked for Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the financier George Soros. Birchall\u2019s own attempt to use a false identity while interacting with Howard was unsuccessful, but provided the jury with the opportunity to learn that he had previously used the pseudonym \u201cJames Brickhouse\u201d to arrange travel for Musk\u2019s family, help a Libyan refugee, and make inquiries about purchasing the domain name justballs.com.</p> <p>A former wealth manager for Merrill Lynch, Birchall offered Howard a $10,000 bonus if he provided proof of \u201cnefarious behaviour\u201d by Unsworth. It was Howard\u2019s fictional reports to Birchall that formed the basis of Musk\u2019s email to a BuzzFeed News journalist falsely alleging that Unsworth was a \u201cchild rapist\u201d. </p> <p>The fourth witness to testify Wednesday was Richard Stanton, one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/british-divers-at-heart-of-thai-cave-rescue-among-best-in-world\">undisputed heroes of the cave rescue</a> effort. An internationally recognized cave diver, Stanton and his dive partner were the first to locate the missing boys in the cave, and Stanton directed the subsequent extraction efforts.</p> <p>Musk and his lawyers invoked Stanton\u2019s name numerous times, noting that the British volunteer had invited Musk\u2019s contributions and provided guidance on what was needed.</p> <p>\u201cIt is absolutely worth continuing with the development of this system in as timely a manner as possible,\u201d Stanton wrote in an 8 July email to Musk that was introduced as evidence. In another email, the diver advised: \u201cIf you make a capsule that tightly encloses a 15-year-old boy it will fit through.\u201d</p> <p>On the witness stand however, Stanton paid tribute to Unsworth\u2019s role in the rescue. \u201cHe was the first person to greet us and guide us through the chaos. He had the best knowledge of that cave \u2026 He guided us through the geography and culture.\u201d Stanton also testified that Unsworth\u2019s description and drawings of the cave passage were more detailed and valuable than other surveys of the area.</p> <p>Under cross-examination, Stanton resisted efforts by Musk\u2019s attorneys to diminish the importance of Unsworth\u2019s contributions. The cave diver also spoke twice to reporters outside the courtroom on issues that he had not been able to testify on, due to objections by Musk\u2019s attorneys and rulings by the judge.</p> <p>Stanton was \u201cacutely disappointed\u201d when he saw photos of the submarine Musk built, he said, noting that the pod appeared to lack life-support, ballast or trim systems. \u201cI realized it could not work.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether he agreed that it was a PR stunt, the diver said: \u201cI think he had well-meaning intentions, but there must have been a point when surely his engineers discovered it was not possible, and what happened from that point, when he decided to bring it on site and showboat \u2026 you can decide for yourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Stanton also said that Musk\u2019s visit to the cave with a non-functioning mini-sub \u201cdetracted from the rescue effort\u201d by taking up the time of rescue personnel.</p> <p>Stanton addressed the media again after hearing Unsworth\u2019s testimony.</p> <p>\u201cWatching Vernon being questioned is the first time I\u2019ve really seen the impact on him personally,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful Elon Musk isn\u2019t here to be able to look him in the eye and see the damage that he\u2019s caused.\u201d</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",

Faced with the volume of tweets that Musk had just admitted were likely to generate press coverage, the billionaire responded defensively. \u201cI mean, I tweet a lot in general \u2026 I was looking for feedback from the public to see if there were any improvements they could suggest. \u201cI frequently solicit feedback on Tesla car design, even rockets,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve incorporated quite a lot of feedback from Twitter on Tesla car design.\u201d Unsaid, but obvious to the members of the media who chased Musk out of the courtroom the moment he was dismissed, was that nobody was talking about the pump and generator teams because everyone was talking about Musk and his mini-sub. Much of the rest of Musk\u2019s testimony involved a close parsing of the degree of flippancy that should be accorded to \u201cpedo\u201d versus \u201cpedo guy\u201d, and further questions about Musk\u2019s intent when he deployed the phrase against Unsworth. \u201cI did not accuse Mr Unsworth of being a pedophile,\u201d Musk said. Unsworth speaks After sitting silently with his attorneys for the first day and a half of the trial, Unsworth took the stand on Wednesday afternoon to describe the impact of Musk\u2019s words. \u201cWhen you combine \u2018sus\u2019 with \u2018pedo guy\u2019, I took it to mean I was being branded a pedophile,\u201d Unsworth said with obvious distress, his voice breaking multiple times. \u201cI feel humiliated, ashamed, dirty \u2026 I was effectively given a life sentence without parole. At times I feel very vulnerable. It hurts to talk about it.\u201d The 64-year-old Briton\u2019s noticeable discomfort provided a striking contrast with Musk\u2019s appearance that included references to the Simpsons, marijuana and his own net worth. Unsworth said he had worked as a consultant on three books about the cave rescue, and appeared in two documentaries, for which he was paid a total of about $3,000. His testimony will continue Thursday. Ineptitude and heroism The head of Musk\u2019s family office, Jared Birchall, also testified on Wednesday about efforts to dig up dirt on Unsworth that might prove the cave explorer was actually a pedophile. Birchall testified to hiring James Howard, without performing any due diligence. Howard was a private investigator who falsely claimed to have worked for Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the financier George Soros. Birchall\u2019s own attempt to use a false identity while interacting with Howard was unsuccessful, but provided the jury with the opportunity to learn that he had previously used the pseudonym \u201cJames Brickhouse\u201d to arrange travel for Musk\u2019s family, help a Libyan refugee, and make inquiries about purchasing the domain name justballs.com. A former wealth manager for Merrill Lynch, Birchall offered Howard a $10,000 bonus if he provided proof of \u201cnefarious behaviour\u201d by Unsworth. It was Howard\u2019s fictional reports to Birchall that formed the basis of Musk\u2019s email to a BuzzFeed News journalist falsely alleging that Unsworth was a \u201cchild rapist\u201d. The fourth witness to testify Wednesday was Richard Stanton, one of the undisputed heroes of the cave rescue effort. An internationally recognized cave diver, Stanton and his dive partner were the first to locate the missing boys in the cave, and Stanton directed the subsequent extraction efforts. Musk and his lawyers invoked Stanton\u2019s name numerous times, noting that the British volunteer had invited Musk\u2019s contributions and provided guidance on what was needed. \u201cIt is absolutely worth continuing with the development of this system in as timely a manner as possible,\u201d Stanton wrote in an 8 July email to Musk that was introduced as evidence. In another email, the diver advised: \u201cIf you make a capsule that tightly encloses a 15-year-old boy it will fit through.\u201d On the witness stand however, Stanton paid tribute to Unsworth\u2019s role in the rescue. \u201cHe was the first person to greet us and guide us through the chaos. He had the best knowledge of that cave \u2026 He guided us through the geography and culture.\u201d Stanton also testified that Unsworth\u2019s description and drawings of the cave passage were more detailed and valuable than other surveys of the area. Under cross-examination, Stanton resisted efforts by Musk\u2019s attorneys to diminish the importance of Unsworth\u2019s contributions. The cave diver also spoke twice to reporters outside the courtroom on issues that he had not been able to testify on, due to objections by Musk\u2019s attorneys and rulings by the judge. Stanton was \u201cacutely disappointed\u201d when he saw photos of the submarine Musk built, he said, noting that the pod appeared to lack life-support, ballast or trim systems. \u201cI realized it could not work.\u201d Asked whether he agreed that it was a PR stunt, the diver said: \u201cI think he had well-meaning intentions, but there must have been a point when surely his engineers discovered it was not possible, and what happened from that point, when he decided to bring it on site and showboat \u2026 you can decide for yourselves.\u201d Stanton also said that Musk\u2019s visit to the cave with a non-functioning mini-sub \u201cdetracted from the rescue effort\u201d by taking up the time of rescue personnel. Stanton addressed the media again after hearing Unsworth\u2019s testimony. \u201cWatching Vernon being questioned is the first time I\u2019ve really seen the impact on him personally,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful Elon Musk isn\u2019t here to be able to look him in the eye and see the damage that he\u2019s caused.\u201d The trial continues.",

She is feisty (hanging as a teeny pup by her jaws off Ronda\u2019s throat and ears and tail, and endlessly suckling her in vain) and clever (she soon repeatedly retrieved the same small, boomerang-shaped stone from wherever I\u2019d toss it down our sideway of thousands of small rocks). The garden suffered. We lost shoes. Now she\u2019s our shadow, curled in the armchair while I write nearby, or sitting on my feet while I cook. She gently nudges the backs of our knees, her touch gossamer soft and inquiring more than demanding. Ronda, meanwhile, has distanced herself. She\u2019s always in our orbit but not cloyingly so any more. Our dogs\u2019 lives are a rolling wrestling match, from the yard to my study, to the beach as the battle for alpha continues. I was certain Olive would quickly emerge top dog. But Ronda has asserted herself, claiming the mat by the back door, sometimes snatching the bone from Olive\u2019s jaws (infant Ronda attempted this once with Nari, who ripped open her snout with a vicious bite) and pinning the pup to the sand with jaws poised at her throat when she gets too much. I\u2019m smitten with Olive, who\u2019s now wading deep into bull shark territory after a stick, and who switches from pure octane to calm concentration as she stops to quietly, intently observe a bird or a butterfly, an image on the TV or one of her humans. She is fiercely territorial like Nari, barking should anyone enter our gate, or at strangers in our back lane. Ronda, who never barked, is now doing likewise. Ronda has also started wetting her paws in the harbour and sometimes chasing a ball. She\u2019ll never swim. But through death and renewal she\u2019s found herself. As we\u2019ve found her. My kids \u2013 who joke together about who is the favoured one \u2013 will not believe this: but I don\u2019t have a favourite dog or child. Any more. \u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist",

He emigrated from Boston 23 years ago, fleeing the cold winters. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a winter in 23 years and I\u2019m very happy about that,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI love summer.\u201d But on Thursday he took his family to the beach. \u201cI was driving towards Dee Why and I was thinking this is going to suck if it is this whole summer. It was worse at the beach than it was back home.\u201d Now the father of three says the air qualityis a worry. \u201cWe live surrounded by a national park and both myself and my daughter have to use an inhaler. So we had to go buy her a new one. I had to tell them, \u2018Why don\u2019t you go inside and watch TV for a while\u2019. It\u2019s the opposite to what I would normally say. \u201cI love Sydney, I moved here and decided to stay. It\u2019s an amazing place because of what you can do in the summertime, people wait for the summer to come out to really enjoy Sydney. It\u2019s a shame to think people are either going to be sick or uncomfortable.\u201d Brisbane resident Sheila Harmes agrees: \u201cI love summertime,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this year will probably make sure I stay inside.\u201d Harmes, who has chronic bronchitis, says she moved to Australia from Britain 29 years ago, largely for the weather. Now, for the first time in Australia, her condition is back. After a short walk, she says, she was unwell for two weeks. \u2018End-of-days\u2019 feeling The smoke has funnelled into Sydney from large bushfires in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury area north and west of the city. Those fires represent only a fraction of the hundreds that have turned the spring of 2019 into one of the most devastating bushfire seasons eastern Australia has known in terms of the area of land burnt. By the end of November, 1.9m hectares had been burnt in NSW alone, including 800,000 hectares in national parks \u2013 10% of the state\u2019s total national park area. Twenty per cent of the Blue Mountains world heritage area has been affected by fire. Queensland has also suffered badly, with 38 homes destroyed in this bushfire season. Almost 200,000 hectares have been burnt in the state since the start of September, and more than 2m hectares in NSW \u2013 a combined area larger than actual Wales. South Australia and Western Australia have also experienced dangerous fires, and many are still burning on the east coast. Between 1 July and 29 November, there have been 7,530 individual fires in NSW. Six people have died in NSW and more than 600 homes destroyed \u2013 4,700 homes have been saved by firefighters. There is no sign the conditions will let up over the summer months. The Bureau of Meterology has said the hot and dry conditions will continue, leading to more severe fire danger warnings over Christmas and into 2020. The fire season in Victoria typically comes later, and fire chiefs fear resources will be stretched beyond endurance if the southern state experiences a bad season while fires are still raging further north. Australia\u2019s worst recent bushfire catastrophe came in February 2009, when 180 people died as conflagrations raced through small towns north of Melbourne. The extent of the fires and the smoke that has drifted across Sydney and many other affected areas \u2013 combined with the seemingly endless drought in many areas of the country \u2013 have led to widespread fears that Australia is heading towards an ominous, apocalyptic time. The actor Sam Neill tweeted that there was a sense of \u201cthe end of days\u201d about the country seen from the air, as his plane approached on Tuesday. In a Climate Council report released the same day, the organisation warned the Australian summer would be a \u201cterrible trifecta of heatwaves, droughts and bushfires\u201d that would bring with it a range of health problems from heatstroke to breathing difficulties and mental health issues. \u201cThe catastrophic events that are unfolding in Australia are not normal. Now is the time to act decisively and swiftly by deeply and rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing our fire and emergency services and communities for worsening extreme weather events,\u201d the report said. More immediately, the smoke haze has prompted warnings of poor air quality due to ultrafine particles, or PM2.5, which travel for hundreds of kilometres and linger in the air. According to data from the NSW Department of Environment, Sydney is experiencing much higher rates of PM2.5 than normal. Australia\u2019s national standard is less than 8 micrograms/m\u00b3 of ultrafine particles, but in recent days Sydney has been blanketed by smoke, and has recorded up to 180 micrograms/m\u00b3. An analysis of the data shows no higher recordings over the past 10 years for Sydney. On the Air Quality Index, which also encompasses other pollutants, a reading below 100 is considered \u201cfair\u201d and safe by NSW Health. Over 150 is considered \u201cvery poor\u201d, and over 200 is \u201chazardous\u201d. Across Prospect in Sydney\u2019s west, Randwick in the east and in the city centre, the six days between 28 November and 3 December were all over 100, with a high of 523 in Randwick. In Prospect on 19 November, an astonishing peak of 2,593 was recorded. Two days later it was 1,699. In Randwick that same day it was 531, and in the city centre 707. Fay Johnston, associate professor of environmental health at the University of Tasmania, has been studying the impact of bushfires on health for nearly 20 years. She says Sydney and NSW have seen air quality this bad before but not over such an extended period. \u201cI don\u2019t recall an episode in NSW that has gone on for so long at these levels. That\u2019s new to me, to have such severe pollution that is going on for weeks now.\u201d The smoke has led to a spike in hospital admissions and ambulance callouts but the longer the pollution events, she says, the worse the health effects are. \u201cNot only does it exacerbate what conditions you might have and make you sicker from those, it makes you a bit like a smoker. It makes you develop heart disease and irritates your lungs,\u201d Johnston says. \u201cThe death rates from long-term exposure to air pollution are more than if you just add up the death rates you would expect from a bad day in a particular location.\u201d The smoke particles can cause reactions all over your body, she says. \u201cThe particles are so tiny they set off reactions throughout the body, like a stress reaction, makes your blood more likely to clot, makes your heart more stressed. \u201cWhich means if you\u2019re at very high risk of heart attack, it can be the precipitant.\u201d That may be a rare outcome, but in a city of five million there are quite a few people in those high risk states, she says. \u2018Summer is likely to get more dangerous\u2019 The long-term impacts of the smoke are unknown, Johnston says. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know with fires is how much is too much, and how long is too long, because there is just no long-term research.\u201d Johnston has researched the health impact on children arising from the Hazelwood coalmine fire in Victoria in 2014, which lasted longer than 45 days and caused worse air quality conditions than Sydney is currently experiencing. It has shown unborn children and those under the age of one in the Morwell area have had stiffer lungs and more coughs and colds during their childhood. \u201cIt\u2019s a tiny effect \u2026 it might not be of huge clinical importance, but the fact that we measured it means we need to take it seriously and if you\u2019re able to reduce the exposure of children and pregnant women, it is responsible.\u201d The executive director of the Climate and Health Alliance, Fiona Armstrong, says that as climate change exacerbates the conditions in summer, the effects on health will become more noticeable. \u201cIt\u2019s really the extreme weather events that are going to have the biggest impact on people\u2019s health,\u201d she says. \u201cOver the long term, I guess you could say summer is likely to get more dangerous for people\u2019s health.\u201d For now, Johnston says, the best people can do is to limit their exposure. Face masks have proliferated in city streets, although experts recommend that in most cases they are all but useless to protect against the tiny particles carried by bushfire smoke. Johnston advises people to stay in air-conditioning where possible, such as in the office or a library. The stereotypical beachside Australian summer seems a long way off.",

Following the 2010 election, former prime minister Julia Gillard bolstered the department by bringing energy into the new Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. This was abolished by the Abbott government in 2013, with its functions split between the Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. Malcolm Turnbull, after narrowly winning the 2016 election, established the Department of Environment and Energy, which was in place while the Coalition oversaw development of the national energy guarantee. Under the changes outlined by Morrison, a new department of Education, Skills and Employment will consolidate the current departments of education and employment, while the a new Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications will consolidate the current Department of Infrastructure and the Department of Communications and the Arts. The department known as Services Australia (formerly known as the Department of Human Services) will be established as a new executive agency within the Department of Social Services. Five departmental secretaries will be sacked as a result of the shake-up, with Kerri Hartland, Ren\u00e9e Leon, Mike Mrdak, Daryl Quinlivan and Heather Smith not continuing in their roles. David Fredericks, currently the Secretary of the Department of the Environment and Energy, will move to be secretary of the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources. Morrison has also appointed Andrew Metcalfe, who was head of the immigration department from 2005 to 2012, as secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment. \u201cHaving fewer departments will allow us to bust bureaucratic congestion, improve decision-making and ultimately deliver better services for the Australian people,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis is about better services on the ground, it\u2019s about getting more focus on Australians and delivering policy, it\u2019s about making sure that I keep my promises to the Australian people.\u201d The Labor deputy leader Richard Marles urged the prime minister to ensure \u201cstability within the public service\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important, particularly at this time, given all the challenges that we\u2019re facing, that the government is managing the public service in a way which maintains stability and ultimately maintains morale,\u201d Marles told Sky news.",

Megan Schutt is another to keep an eye on; with the lowest economy rate in the league at 5.67, her role will be to frustrate Lanning into making poor decisions by slowing down her run rate.</p> <p>The Heat have been installed as favourites for the title and they boast a strong team across the field, from wicketkeeper Beth Mooney who has been in sensational form with the bat with an average just shy of 75, to Jess Jonassen who has 19 wickets, including three four-wicket hauls. With strong back-up from the Harris sisters who will be battling each other to take out the coveted \u2018Harris of the Match\u2019 title, it\u2019s a formidable line up with finals experience.</p> <p>However, the Renegades will go into the semi-final with plenty of talent of their own and a belief they can take down the reigning premiers. While their stars, such as Jess Duffin and Molly Strano \u2013 who were named in the WBBL team of the season along with Wyatt \u2013 have been sensational, the true strength of the Renegades lies in their ability to fight right to the end of a match.</p> <p>Nowhere was that more evident than in their win over the Sixers at Drummoyne last month. With wickets falling regularly and the required run rate creeping up towards 12 an over, a partnership between No.6 Courtney Webb and No.9 Carly Leeson saved the day and showed they are a force with which to be reckoned.</p> <p>A silver lining of the absent English players is the opportunities this weekend could provide to young Australians like Webb and Leeson to make their mark on the finals and create a piece of history.</p>",

We would love to keep working on ways to make the WBBL available to the best players in the world because we can see they want to play.\u201d Despite the drain, there is still plenty of excellent cricketing talent on show this weekend. Lanning is the trump card for the Scorchers as they take on the Strikers, and a strong innings from her could negate the loss of the two English stars. After a slow start the season, she opened up in the second half and notched her first WBBL century in the Scorchers\u2019 final regular-season game. Jones\u2019 wicketkeeping will be missed, but fortunately the Scorchers have another strong keeper in Georgia Redmayne, who finished the 2018-19 season with the third-highest number of dismissals of any keeper in the league while playing for Hobart Hurricanes. The Strikers\u2019 key weapon will be New Zealander Sophie Devine, who has been on song with the bat and ball this season \u2013 scoring 699 runs for an average of 77, while taking 16 wickets to boot. Megan Schutt is another to keep an eye on; with the lowest economy rate in the league at 5.67, her role will be to frustrate Lanning into making poor decisions by slowing down her run rate. The Heat have been installed as favourites for the title and they boast a strong team across the field, from wicketkeeper Beth Mooney who has been in sensational form with the bat with an average just shy of 75, to Jess Jonassen who has 19 wickets, including three four-wicket hauls. With strong back-up from the Harris sisters who will be battling each other to take out the coveted \u2018Harris of the Match\u2019 title, it\u2019s a formidable line up with finals experience. However, the Renegades will go into the semi-final with plenty of talent of their own and a belief they can take down the reigning premiers. While their stars, such as Jess Duffin and Molly Strano \u2013 who were named in the WBBL team of the season along with Wyatt \u2013 have been sensational, the true strength of the Renegades lies in their ability to fight right to the end of a match. Nowhere was that more evident than in their win over the Sixers at Drummoyne last month. With wickets falling regularly and the required run rate creeping up towards 12 an over, a partnership between No.6 Courtney Webb and No.9 Carly Leeson saved the day and showed they are a force with which to be reckoned. A silver lining of the absent English players is the opportunities this weekend could provide to young Australians like Webb and Leeson to make their mark on the finals and create a piece of history.",

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Thursday\u2019s blog: Here\u2019s a recap of today: Four constitutional law experts testified on Donald Trump\u2019s conduct rises to the level of impeachable offenses. Three scholars called by Democratic members of the committee said that the president\u2019s handling of Ukraine military aid and the leveraging of his office for personal gain are impeachable offenses. A law professor that the Republicans called to testify said that the evidence is too thin, and the reasons for impeaching the president too narrow to justify a case against the president now. One of the experts, Pamela Karlan, apologized after the First Lady criticized her for punning off Barron Trump\u2019s name to make the point that the president is not a king. Donald Trump cut short his attendance at the Nato summit after a video captured world leaders apparently ridiculing him. The Trump administration approved a new rule that will cut nearly 70,000 people from the federal food stamp program. William Barr\u2019s hand-picked prosecutor wasn\u2019t able to provide evidence that to support right-wing suspicions that the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation was a setup, the Washington Post reports: Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s office contacted U.S. Attorney John Durham, the prosecutor Barr personally tapped to lead a separate review of the 2016 probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, the people said. The inspector general also contacted several U.S. intelligence agencies. Among Horowitz\u2019s questions: whether a Maltese professor who interacted with a Trump campaign adviser was actually a U.S. intelligence asset deployed to ensnare the campaign, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the inspector general\u2019s findings have not been made public. But the intelligence agencies said the professor was not among their assets, the people said. And Durham informed Horowitz\u2019s office that his investigation had not produced any evidence that might contradict the inspector general\u2019s findings on that point. NBC appears to have confirmed the Post\u2019s reporting. The Justice Department IG has an upcoming report investigating the origins of Russia investigation, separate from the one being conducted by Barr\u2019s prosecutor. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to soon announce future hearings, including testimony from the attornies for the Republicans and Democrats on the Hosue Intelligence committee, who will present the reports and findings from the investigation so far. After that, the Judiciary Committee will likely draw up articles of impeachment, vote on them. The exact timing of when all of this will happen is still unclear. It\u2019s also unclear which articles the committee will draft. The House Intelligence report released yesterday makes a case for obstruction of justice and abuse of power. Chairman Nadler gaveled the hearing closed, after delivering his closing remarks. Trump put his own interests above the national interest, Nadler said. Trump asked a\u201cforeign government to intervene in our elections, then got caught, then obstructed the investigators twice.\u201d \u201cThe constitution has a solution for a president who places his personal or political interests above those in the nation, the power of impeachment,\u201d Nadler concluded. When Republican member Louie Gohmert tried to get Nadler\u2019s attention (with a unanimous consent request), Nadler responded \u201cToo late\u201d and banged his gavel. \u201cTypical,\u201d Gohmert could be heard mumbling. A very animated Doug Collins said, \u201cThis is not a time to play hide the ball\u201d and repeatedly called for Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff testify before the Judiciary Committee. He said it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to hold these hearings and that lawmakers had not talked to enough \u201cfact witnesses\u201d. The Democrats, he said, are \u201cso obsessed with the election next year, they just gloss over things.\u201d Collins also repeated a Republican talking point that Ukraine only became aware that aid was being withheld \u201cone month after\u201d the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call. However, Pentagon official Laura Cooper testified that Ukraine was aware of the aid in early July, before the call. Representative Jerry Nadler, the leading Democrat on the committee, and Doug Collins, the leading Republican are now giving closing statements. Read the key takeaways from today\u2019s testimonies: Pamela Karlan made a distinction between Trump\u2019s political positions on foreign affairs and his right to solicit electoral interference from foreign powers. \u201cYes there is political influence in our foreign affairs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve exited climate accords, we\u2019ve taken different positions on Nato than we would have taken if his opponent won.\u201d That\u2019s different from partisan politics in the context of electoral manipulation, she said. \u201cIf we get over that or get used to that, we will cease to become the democracy that we are now\u201d Witness Pamela Karlan apologized for making a put out of Barron Trump\u2019s name. \u201cIt was wrong of me to do that...I do regret having said that,\u201d she said, adding that she\u2019s happy to apologize though the president hasn\u2019t apologized for offensive comments he\u2019s made in the past. Earlier, Michael Johnson, a Republican representative from Louisiana, read a tweet by First Lady Melania Trump criticizing Karlan\u2019s comment into the public record of the hearing. In other non-impeachment political news, the Trump administration approved a rule that will remove nearly 700,000 people from the federal food-stamp program by tightening work requirements for recipients. From the AP: The move by the administration is the latest in its attempt to scale back the social safety net for low-income Americans. It is the first of three proposed rules targeting the Supplemental Nutrition Program, known as SNAP, to be finalized. The program feeds more than 36 million people. The plan, announced Wednesday, will limit states from exempting work-eligible adults from having to maintain steady employment in order to receive benefits. The Agriculture Department estimates the change would save roughly $5.5 billion over five years and cut benefits for roughly 688,000 SNAP recipients... The final rule will be published in the federal register Thursday, and go into effect in April. Meanwhile, elsewhere on Capitol Hill... Those still holed up in the Judiciary Committee hearing can reportedly hear echoes of holiday cheer filtering in from the outside world. Several Republicans committee members have read from the memo that Donald Trump released summarizing his July 25 call with the Ukrainian president. \u201cThey never mentioned the 2020 election. They never mentioned military aid,\u201d Kelly Armstrong, a Republican representative from North Dakota, said just now. Though the rough transcript of the call that Trump released may not contain the phrase \u201c2020 election\u201d, the president does clearly ask Ukraine to conduct investigations, including into Biden, one of his leading rivals in the upcoming elections. The transcript also shows that Trump transitions directly from talk of military aid that the Ukrainian president says his country needs to talk of a \u201cfavor\u201d that Trump needs. Pushing back against arguments made by Jonathan Turley, who said that Democrats didn\u2019t have enough evidence to make a case for impeachment at this point, Michael Gerhardt said that lawmakers have tried to gather more evidence. \u201cI might just point out that one of the difficulties with asking for a more thorough investigation is that\u2019s exactly what the House has tried to conduct here,\u201d he said, \u201cThe president has refused to comply with subpoenas and other requests for documents.\u201d Val Demmings, the Democratic representative from Florida who questioned Gerhardt, agreed that Trump was \u201cdesperate\u201d to prevent investigations into his actions. \u201cThe president\u2019s obstruction of Congress is pervasive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are facing a categorically blockade by a president who is desperate to prevent any investigation into his wrongdoing.\u201d \u201cHas a president ever refused to cooperate in an impeachment investigation?\u201d Demmings asked. \u201cNot until now.\u201d Gerhardt responded. Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic representative from Washington, is now questioning Pamela Karlan. Jayapal asked Karlan what Trump\u2019s behavior reveals about the credibility of his claim that he was most concerned about corruption. What, for example, does it mean that Trump allegedly insisted that the Ukrainian president publicly announce an investigation? \u201cGenerally you don\u2019t announce the investigation in a criminal case before you conduct it, because it puts the person under notice that they\u2019re under investigation,\u201d Karlan said. As for credibility, Karlan said, \u201cI think you ought to make that credibility determination because you have the sole power of impeachment. if I were a member of the House of Representatives I would infer that he was doing it for political reasons.\u201d The House judiciary committee is still holding its first public impeachment hearing, but I\u2019m handing the blog over to my west coast colleague Maanvi Singh for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Three legal experts called by Democratic members of the House judiciary committee testified that Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine constituted impeachable offenses, a position that was contradicted by the only witness called by Republican members of the panel. The first lady, the White House and Trump\u2019s reelection campaign denounced one of today\u2019s legal experts, Pamela Karlan, after the Stanford law professor made a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name. \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d Karlan said. Democratic congressman Denny Heck, a member of the House intelligence committee, announced he would not seek reelection \u2013 citing his desire to spend more time with family and his chagrin over the Republican response to the impeachment inquiry. Rudy Giuliani reportedly traveled to Europe this week to meet with former Ukrainian prosecutors who helped spread baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden, even though the president\u2019s personal lawyer is under a microscope because of the impeachment inquiry. Trump canceled his final press conference at the Nato summit in London after a video surfaced of world leaders mocking the president\u2019s lengthy comments to reporters yesterday. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The first lady has now added her voice to the Republican chorus criticizing Pamela Karlan, accusing the Stanford law professor of invading the privacy of her son by making a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name. Karlan said earlier at today\u2019s hearing, \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d making a point about the constitution not allowing the president to distribute titles of nobility. Republicans are now arguing that the mere mention of Barron\u2019s name equates to a political attack meant to drag the first son into the impeachment inquiry. Republican congressman Tom McClintock began his five minutes of questions by asking the legal experts testifying today if they had voted for Trump in the 2016 election. This question sparked immediate pushback from Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan, who argued the witnesses should not have to disclose how they cast their ballots. Chairman Jerry Nadler interjected to say that McClintock was free to ask the question but witnesses were not obligated to answer. None of the witnesses raised their hands to say they voted for Trump, but Harvard law professor Noah Feldman emphasized the lack of response should not be taken as a sign that they oppose the president. The House judiciary committee has reconvened its first public impeachment hearing, and members of the panel have resumed their five-minute rounds of questioning of today\u2019s witnesses. Republican congressman Andy Biggs kicked off questioning after the brief recess, and Democratic congressman Ted Lieu is now speaking. After Lieu, there should be 18 members of the panel left, so the hearing could conclude around 6pm ET, but it may stretch even longer. The House judiciary committee has once again recessed its impeachment hearing for five minutes, with more than a dozen members of the panel still needing to question today\u2019s witnesses. Just before chairman Jerry Nadler briefly adjourned the hearing, Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell accused George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley of acting as the Republicans\u2019 defense attorney in support of the president. \u201cThat\u2019s not my intention, sir,\u201d Turley replied. The president\u2019s reelection campaign has now called on Democrats to repudiate Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan for making a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name to make a point about the Constitution not allowing presidents to distrubute titles of nobility. \u201cEvery Democrat in Congress should immediately repudiate Pamela Karlan and call on her to personally apologize to the President and the First Lady for mocking their son on national TV,\u201d said Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign\u2019s national press secretary. Karlan initially said at today\u2019s hearing, \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d prompting some laughter in the hearing room. Republican congressman Matt Gaetz used his five minutes of questioning to criticize the three legal experts called by Democrats on the House judiciary committee for previously donating to Democratic candidates. Gaetz especially went after Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan, asking why she donated $2,000 to Hillary Clinton. Karlan responded that she had been donating a lot of money at the time because of all the \u201cpoor\u201d people in the United States. Gaetz also accused Karlan of being \u201cmean\u201d for making a pun out of the name of the president\u2019s son, Barron Trump. As Karlan was trying to respond to Gaetz\u2019s questions, the congressman told the only woman on the panel, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to interrupt me on this time.\u201d After two weeks of high-stakes hearings that included \u201cstar witnesses,\u201d an attache with the cadence and authority of Walter Cronkite, a decorated do-gooder in uniform, a British-born Russia expert who inspired fan clubs around the world and a bombshell-lobbing hotelier-turned ambassador, the distinguished panel of academics was perhaps not the made-for-TV cast these impeachment hearings had thrived on. The witnesses painted in vivid detail the actions of a president hellbent on pressuring a foreign government to harm his political rival. By contrast the professors\u2019 testimony was conceptual and high-minded. They legitimized their assertions with quotations from the Founding Fathers, references to historical treaties and pleasantries that might require an advanced degree to follow. Words like \u201cperfidy\u201d and \u201cnecromancy\u201d obscured their more relatable references to a pet goldendoodle and Thanksgiving dinner. But aside from snarky tweets, the dulcet testimony is also providing Democrats a clear rationale for removing Trump from office that they can clip and reference in the weeks to come. \u201cIf we cannot impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy,\u201d said Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School. \u201cWe live in a monarchy or we live under a dictatorship.\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham lashed out against Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan for making a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name during today\u2019s impeachment hearing. Grisham accused Karlan of disrepecting the first son\u2019s privacy by making his name a punchline. \u201cWhat is being done to this country is no laughing matter,\u201d Grisham said. It\u2019s important to note Karlan was not at all mocking Barron Trump himself. She used his name to make a light-hearted joke about how presidents cannot distribute titles of nobility. \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d Karlan said, prompting some laughter in the hearing room. Meanwhile, as the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing continues, a Republican congressman is pressing Senate judiciary committee chairman Lindsey Graham to subpoena the phone records of Adam Schiff and Joe Biden, among others. The request comes after the release of the House intelligence committee\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry, which included call records from Rudy Giuliani and one of his former associates, Lev Parnas. The records showed Giuliani in contact with Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, and an official at the office of management and budget as the president\u2019s personal lawyer started peddling baseless corruption allegations againt Biden. Republican congressman Jim Jordan, who also participated in the House intelligence committee hearings, complained that Democrats were overseeing a \u201cpre-determined impeachment.\u201d Like the previous two Republican members, Jordan did not pose a single question to today\u2019s witnesses during his five-minute round of questioning, instead choosing to simply criticize the inquiry writ large. Republican congressman Louie Gohmert used his five minutes of questioning to criticize the process of the impeachment inquiry and demand that other witnesses linked to Joe Biden be made to testify, which has 0% chance of approval by the panel\u2019s Democratic majority. Republican congressman Steve Chabot just completed his five-minute round of questioning -- which he used to deliver a diatribe against chairman Jerry Nadler without posing a single question to today\u2019s witnesses. Chabot accused Nadler of reversing himself from his comments about impeachment during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency and argued the inquiry was preventing the panel from addressing other matters. Those talking points echo comments from Trump, who has accused the \u201cdo nothing Democrats\u201d of neglecting their constituents\u2019 needs. Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan has just delivered another line that is sure to be replayed many times after today\u2019s impeachment hearing. Responding to questions from Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Karlan was arguing that the Constitution makes a point to distinguish between the powers of the president and the powers of a monarch. Karlan specifically cited the president\u2019s inability to distribute titles of nobility. \u201cSo while the president can name his son Barron, he cannot make him a baron,\u201d Karlan joked. The first Republican questioner after the recess was Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who was an impeachment manager during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. Sensenbrenner used the first four minutes of his questioning to criticize the impeachment inquiry before posing a single question to Jonathan Turley, the only witness called by Republican members of the panel. Then his time was up. Chairman Jerry Nadler has once again gaveled in the first public impeachment hearing conducted by his panel, the House judiciary committee. The panel will continue with five-minute rounds of questions from the members of the committee, which could take another three hours or so. For reference, this hearing began almost five hours ago. Democrats on the House judiciary committee have been told to stay in Washington this weekend so the panel can complete work related to the impeachment inquiry. It\u2019s unclear what work chairman Jerry Nadler hopes for the members to complete, but it could include mock hearings regarding the Huse intelligence committee\u2019s newly released report on the impeachment inquiry. The Senate has released its calendar for 2020, but the chamber has left the month of January blank in case the House passes articles of impeachment and a trial needs to be held on whether to remove Trump from office. If the House passes articles of impeachment later this month, as it is widely expected to do, the Senate would likely take up the charges in January. Unless two-thirds of senators rule against the president, which is highly improbable, Trump will be acquitted and remain in office. Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Barack Obama, accused Republicans on the House judiciary committee of misrepresenting his words by only quoting a portion of his comments about Hunter Biden in his book \u201cImpeach: The Case Against Donald Trump.\u201d In the book, Katyal makes a point to emphasize that while Biden\u2019s conduct was not right, it also wasn\u2019t illegal -- as the business dealings of Trump\u2019s family while he is in office are not illegal. The House judiciary committee is not likely to reconvene for another 30 minutes, which could mean the impeachment hearing will not conclude for another four hours or so. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren opened her questioning of today\u2019s witnesses by noting that she has been present for all three modern impeachments -- as a staffer during Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment and as a lawmaker during Bill Clinton\u2019s. After Lofgren had concluded her questioning, chairman Jerry Nadler recessed the hearing for members to go vote on the House floor. Dozens of committee members still need to have the chance to question the witnesses, so we will be here for a while. The House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing has moved on to five-minute rounds of questioning from each member, which could run more than three hours long if everyone uses up their full time. Representative Denny Heck, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, has announced he will retire from Congress after serving four terms in the chamber. Heck cited his decades of public service, considering his years in the Washington state legislature, and his discouragement with the Russia investigation as reasons for his departure. \u201cIt is incredible work but it takes its toll. Being away so much from Paula, my best friend and wife of nearly 44 years, can be lonely even when I am in a crowded room,\u201d Heck said. \u201cAt our age, however many \u2018good years\u2019 we have left together is not a growing number. \u201cIn the spirit of complete openness, part of me is also discouraged. The countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary. I will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the President\u2019s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.\u201d The Republican counsel has concluded his questioning of the legal experts today, but he spent his time only posing questions to lone GOP witness Jonathan Turley -- pursuing a similar strategy as the Democratic counsel. Chairman Jerry Nadler noted this would have been the time when the White House had an opportunity to question the qitnesses, but the president declined the invitation. The panel has now moved on to five minutes of questioning from each member, beginning with Nadler. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness called by Republicans, criticized Democrats for not winning over more members of the opposite party about impeachment. \u201cIf you rush this impeachment, you\u2019re going to leave half the country behind,\u201d Turley warned. \u201cThis is not an impulse buy item.\u201d Paul Taylor, a longtime Republican staffer on the House judiciary committee, is now posing questions to the legal experts testifying today. (Well, so far he has only posed questions to the one witness Republicans called -- deploying the same strategy that Democrats pursued.) White House counsel Pat Cipollone is on Capitol Hill today, although he is not participating in the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing. The president was given the option to have a lawyer represent him at today\u2019s hearing, but the White House declined to do so. A Capitol Hill reporter said Cipollone was meeting with senators \u201cas part of an ongoing effort to keep Senate Republicans informed about White House thinking.\u201d A New York Times reporter noted that Jonathan Turley\u2019s argument about the impeachment inquiry moving at a record pace is actually up for debate. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who was called to testify by the Republicans on the House judiciary committee, argued members of Congress were abusing their power by moving quickly on the impeachment inquiry. \u201cFast is not good for impeachment. Fast and narrow impeachments have failed,\u201d Turley said, citing the example of former President Andrew Johnson, who was impeached in 1868 before being narrowly acquitted by the Senate. \u201cIf you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it\u2019s an abuse of power,\u201d Turley told the lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s your abuse of power.\u201d George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness at today\u2019s impeachment hearing who was called by Republicans on the House judiciary committee, argued Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine do not represent a \u201cclear case of bribery.\u201d Those comments clash with testimony from Stanford professor Pamela Karlan, who told the panel that Trump would be guilty of bribery if investigators concluded the president requested an investigation into Joe Biden to advance his political interests. Congressman Doug Collins also opened his questioning by joking that George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness called to testify by the Republican minority of the House judiciary committee, was \u201cwell rested\u201d after only being asked one question by the Democratic counsel. Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, opened his questioning by noting the freezing conditions of today\u2019s hearing room. Chairman Jerry Nadler has gaveled back in the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing, and the Republican ranking member and Republican counsel will now be allowed to pose questions to the four legal experts testifying today. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House judiciary committee is in the midst of holding its first public impeachment hearing, where three legal experts have testified that Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine constitute impeachable behavior. (A fourth expert has testified the president\u2019s behavior does not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment.) House Democrats held a closed-door meeting this morning, where members signaled their willingness to move forward with the impeachment inquiry despite the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate. Trump left the Nato summit in London without holding his scheduled final press conference after a video surfaced of world leaders seeming to mock the US president for his lengthy comments to reporters. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. House Democrats held a closed-door meeting this morning to discuss the intelligence committee\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry, which was released yesterday, and next steps in the investigation. The Washington Post reports: According to multiple Democratic lawmakers who attended a closed-door Capitol meeting, [speaker Nancy] Pelosi announced no firm decision or timeline in moving toward Trump\u2019s impeachment. But, a day after [Adam] Schiff delivered a 300-page report detailing charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress against Trump, she made clear what lay ahead in the House. \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 Pelosi (D-Calif.) asked her colleagues, after describing the grave constitutional circumstances posed by Trump\u2019s alleged wrongdoing surrounding his dealings with Ukraine and his subsequent decision to stonewall the House investigation into it. The caucus, according to multiple members, erupted with shouts of approval. \u2018We\u2019re moving forward,\u2019 said one member, summarizing the thrust of Pelosi\u2019s remarks and speaking on condition of anonymity to candidly describe a private meeting. \u2018We\u2019ve got a job to do whether people want to testify or not.\u2019 Pelosi then turned the room over to Schiff (D-Calif.), who received a standing ovation before saying a word, the members said. From the department of \u201cyou really can\u2019t make this up\u201d: the New York Times is reporting that Rudy Giuliani traveled to Europe this week to meet with former Ukrainian prosecutors who have pushed baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. The Times reports: Mr. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, met in Budapest on Tuesday with a former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. He then traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday seeking to meet with other former Ukrainian prosecutors whose claims have been embraced by Republicans, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk, according to people familiar with the effort. The former prosecutors, who have faced allegations of corruption, all played some role in promoting claims about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a former United States ambassador to Ukraine and Ukrainians who disseminated damaging information about Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, in 2016. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler has just called for a 10-minute recess in the panel\u2019s impeachment hearing, which will almost certainly become more like a 20-minute break. When the committee regroups, the Republican ranking member and Republican counsel will be given the chance to pose questions to the four legal experts testifying today. During the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing, the panel\u2019s Democrats displayed a sign appearing to indicate they are considering three articles of impeachment against Trump: abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of Congress and obstruction of justice. Democratic counsel Norm Eisen asked the legal experts testifying at today\u2019s impeachment hearing whether the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden was an impeachable act, even though the countryultimately did not launch the probe. \u201cThe attempt itself is the impeachable act,\u201d said Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, who noted that Richard Nixon\u2019s efforts to cover up the Watergate break-in were ultimately unsuccessful. But the attempts themselves clearly constituted impeachable behavior, Feldman said. Pamela Karlan and Michael Gerhardt echoed that opinion with hypothetical situations emphasizing the soliciation itself is the issue. University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt warned that lawmakers could set a dangerous precedent if they didn\u2019t impeach Trump for his actions toward Ukraine. \u201cIf what we\u2019re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,\u201d Gerhardt said. Stanford professor Pamela Karlan emphasized she had spent her Thanksgiving break reading the transcripts from the impeachment hearings, implicitly criticizing Republican congressman Doug Collins for implying today\u2019s witnesses had not had time to consider all the evidence. Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan said Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine meet the constitutional definition of bribery, adding credibility to Democrats\u2019 usage of the term to describe the allegations against the president. Karlan said that, if lawmakers conclude Trump requested an investigation into Joe Biden and his son for political gain, \u201cthen yes, you have bribery here,\u201d the law professor said. Harvard law professor Noah Feldman warned that the US would turn into a monarchy if its presidents cannot be impeached for using the office for personal or political gain. Democratic counsel Norm Eisen pressed Jonathan Turley, the only legal expert called to testify by Republican members of the House judiciary committee, about his Wall Street Journal op-ed on the impeachment inquiry. Eisen noted that Turley, who has argued that Trump\u2019s actions in the Ukraine controversy do not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment, wrote in the op-ed, \u201cThere is much that is worthy of investigation in the Ukraine scandal, and it is true that impeachment doesn\u2019t require a crime.\u201d Turley confirmed he had written that but he attempted to elaborate on the argument before being cut off by Eisen, who said he was only seeking a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer on whether Turley had in fact written that. Democratic counsel Norm Eisen has now been recognized for 45 minutes of questioning, and he has started by focusing on Trump\u2019s alleged abuses of power and whether those actions constitute impeachable offenses. All three of the witnesses called by Democrats -- Noah Feldman from Harvard, Pamela Karlan from Stanford and Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina -- agreed those actions met the constitutional standard for impeachable offenses. Chairman Jerry Nadler asked University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt what concerns should be raised by Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with congressional subpoenas in the impeachment inquiry. \u201cWhen the president does that, the separation of powers means nothing.\u201d Gerhardt said. The hearing has now moved on to questioning by the members of the House judiciary committee, beginning with chairman Jerry Nadler. The California Democrat began by asking Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan about the danger of a president inviting election interference from a foreign power. Karlan warned that such a request \u201ctakes the right away from the American people\u201d to determine the winners of elections. The four legal experts testifying at today\u2019s public imeachment hearing have concluded their opening statements, and the Republicans on the House judiciary committee have now forced another prcedural vote on subpoenaing the whistleblower whose complaint kicked off the inquiry. A Democratic member of the panel unsurprisingly responded with a proposal to table (or kill) the motion, which was adopted along party lines. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness called by the Republican members of the House judiciary committee, began his opening statement by noting he is not a supporter of the president and did not vote for Trump in 2016. However, the professor expressed fear about this inquiry setting a dangerous precedent for impeachment. \u201cI am concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger,\u201d Turley said. Turley also offered a joke about the current divsion in the country. \u201cI get it, you\u2019re mad. The president\u2019s mad ... My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog seems mad,\u201d Turley said. And he noted his dog, a goldendoodle named Luna, is never mad. But he added, \u201cWill a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration?\u201d University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt similarly argued in his opening statement that Trump has participated in several acts that constitute impeachable behavior. \u201cThe record compiled thus far shows that the president has committed several impeachable offenses, including bribery, abuse of power in soliciting a personal favor from a foreign leader to benefit his political campaign, obstructing Congress, and obstructing justice,\u201d Gerhardt said. The law professor closed by warning, \u201cIf Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our Constitution\u2019s carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil.\u201d Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan closed her opening statement by arguing the presidnet should not be inviting election interference but rather warning any country who threatens to do it. \u201cA president who cared about the Constitution would say \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening, butt out of our elections,\u2019\u201d Karlan said, referring to Trump\u2019s famous line requesting that the Kremlin try to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in 2016. In her opening statement, Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan echoed Noah Feldman\u2019s argument that Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine represented a clear abuse of power. \u201cWhen President Trump invited \u2014 indeed, demanded \u2014 foreign involvement in our upcoming election, he struck at the very heart of what makes this a republic,\u201d Karlan said. \u201cThat demand ... constituted an abuse of power.\u201d Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan took a shot at Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, in her opening statement after the congressman implied the legal experts testifying today may not have reviewed all the evidence gathered in the impeachement inquiry. Karlan said she was \u201cinsulted\u201d by Collins\u2019 suggestion that she has not carefully considered the facts of the investigation. As the members of the House judiciary committee took yet another procedural vote forced by the Republicans on the panel, Trump weighed in on the hearing from London. Speaking to reporters following the Nato summit, Trump questioned Democrats\u2019 loyalty to the US. \u201cYou almost question whether or not they love our country and that\u2019s a very serious thing: Do they love our country?\u201d the president said, according to the pool report. Trump added he considered impeachment to be a \u201cdirty word\u201d that \u201cshould only be used in special occasions.\u201d \u201cThis should never happen to a president again what\u2019s happened here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace to our country.\u201d Harvard law professor Noah Feldman used his opening statement to argue Trump\u2019s actions, as described during last month\u2019s hearings conducted by the House intelligence committee, clearly meet the constitutional standard for impeachment. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s conduct described in the testimony and evidence clearly constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under the Constitution,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cAccording to the testimony and to the publicly released memorandum of the July 25, 2019, telephone call between the two presidents, President Trump abused his office by soliciting the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals in order to gain personal political advantage, including in the 2020 presidential election. This act on its own qualifies as an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor.\u201d The witneeses for today\u2019s impeachment hearing have been sworn in, and the first legal expert, Noah Feldman from Harvard law school, has started to deliver his opening statement. But before Feldman could begin speaking, Republicans on the House judiciary committee once again tried to interrupt the hearing with a procedural motion. Chairman Jerry Nadler replied that the motion would be recognized in between the witnesses\u2019 opening statements, and Feldman continued with his prepared remarks. Thirty minutes into the House judiciary committee\u2019s first public impeachment hearing, the panel\u2019s Republican minority forced a vote on a motion to force Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, to testify. A Democratic member of the panel responded by proposing to table (or kill) the motion, which was approved by the committee along party lines. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, closed his opening statement by condemning the impeachment inquiry as a \u201csimple railroad job\u201d against the president. The Georgia Republican claimed the impeachment inquiry began with \u201ctears in Brooklyn,\u201d referring to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss to Trump. Collins closed out by mildly mocking the witnesses at today\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got law professors here,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWhat a start to a party.\u201d Doug Collins, the ranking member of the House judiciary committee, used his opening statement to reiterate some of the most consistent talking points from the president\u2019s allies. Collins claimed Democrats were only pursuing the impeachment inquiry because they were fearful of Trump\u2019s reelection prospects and had been hellbent on getting the president out of office since he was inaugurated. \u201cIf you want to know what is really driving this: it\u2019s called the clock and the calendar,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey want to do it before the end of the year.\u201d The Georgia Republican also joked that today\u2019s hearing, featuring testimony from legal experts on the constitutional standard for impeachment, would show Americans \u201cwhy most people don\u2019t go to law school.\u201d Chairman Jerry Nadler closed his opening statement by pushing back against some Republicans\u2019 argument that Democrats should postpone the impeachment investigation, given that the 2020 election is less than a year away. \u201cWe cannot wait for the election to address the present crisis,\u201d Nadler said at the start of his panel\u2019s first public impeachment hearing. \u201cThe integrity of that election is one of the very things at stake.\u201d Chairman Jerry Nadler pointed to the report from special counsel Robert Mueller, which outlines Trump\u2019s obstruction of his investigation, to argue there is \u201cprecedent for recommending impeachment here.\u201d \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the storm in which we find ourselves today was set in motion by President Trump,\u201d Nadler said in his opening statement. \u201cI do not wish this moment on the country. But we have each taken an oath to protect the Constitution, and the facts before us are clear.\u201d Chairman Jerry Nadler used his opening statement to outline the accusations against Trump and criticize the president for not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry. Nadler noted the two other modern presidents who have faced impeachment -- Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton -- turned over considerable evidence to congressional investigators. \u201cPresident Trump, by contrast, has refused to produce a single document and directed every witness not to testify,\u201d Nadler said. Chairman Jerry Nadler could not even begin his opening statement before he was interrupted twice by Republican members of the House judiciary committee raising procedural questions. Viewers of the hearing can expect a lot of those motions from the minority today. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee, has gaveled in his panel\u2019s first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry -- which will feature testimony from legal experts on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. The first public impeachment hearing conducted by the House judiciary committee is set to get underway in just a few minutes, but House Democrats are simultaneously meeting to discuss next steps in the inquiry. Speaker Nancy Pelosi enforced unusually strict rules for members entering the meeting, not even allowing staffers to attend. Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to cancel his press conference at the end of the Nato summit prompted surprise and frustration from the reporters gathered in London to pose questions to the president. Meanwhile, over on Capitol Hill, Republicans on the House judiciary committee are following the example of their intelligence committee counterparts by displaying signs disparaging the impeachment inquiry. Trump has just announced that he will depart the Nato summit in London today without holding his press conference, which was scheduled to take place at 10:30 a.m. ET. While taking questions from reporters this morning, Trump had suggested he may cancel the scheduled press conference, but more details were not immediately available from the White House. Now the president has confrmed he will not be holding the press conference after talking to reporters for more than two hours yesterday. But the abrupt decision may have less to do with his lengthy comments yesterday and more so to do with his fellow foreign leaders appearing to mock him yesterday for his rambling press conferences. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson denied that he, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were mocking Trump yesterday when they were caught on a hot mic joking about someone\u2019s late appearance at an event due to a long press conference. Follow the Guardian\u2019s UK politics live blog for more updates from Jonhson\u2019s press conference at the Nato summit. Today\u2019s impeachment hearing conducted by the House judiciary committee will feature testimony from four law professors -- Noah Feldman from Harvard University, Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina, Pamela S. Karlan from Stanford University and Jonathan Turley from George Washington University. The opening statements from the four witnesses were released this morning, and they feature some drastically varying interpretations of the president\u2019s actions, as described during last month\u2019s hearings conducted by the House intelligence committee. \u201cIf Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our Constitution\u2019s carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil,\u201d Gerhardt intends to say. \u201cNo one, not even the president, is beyond the reach of our Constitution and our laws.\u201d But Turley, the only witnesses called by Republicans on the House judiciary committee, argues in his opening statement that a Trump impeachment could set a dangerous precedent. \u201cI get it. You are mad. The President is mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My Republican friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog is mad . . . and Luna is a golden doodle and they are never mad,\u201d Turley intends to say. \u201cWe are all mad and where has it taken us? Will a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration?\u201d As the House judiciary committee prepares to hold its first public impeachment hearing, Trump continues to insult world leaders at the Nato summit in London. The US president called Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d after the Canadian prime minister was caught on video apparently mocking Trump for his long press conferences. (Trump spoke to reporters for more than two hours yesterday between three different appearances.) \u201cWell, he\u2019s two-faced,\u201d Trump said when asked about the comments by a reporter. But he quickly added, \u201cAnd with Trudeau, he\u2019s a nice guy. I find him to be a nice guy, but the truth is, I called him out on the fact that he\u2019s not paying 2%, and I guess he\u2019s not very happy about it.\u201d During his press conference with Trudeau yesterday, Trump urged Canada to contribute more toward Nato defense spending. In the original video, Trudeau is heard joking to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron, \u201cHe was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top.\u201d Trudeau doesn\u2019t explicitly say Trump\u2019s name, but it seemed to be a clear reference to the US president, given his multiple press conferences yesterday. Good morning, live blog readers! We are about an hour away from the next public hearing in the impeachment inquiry, the first to be held by the House judiciary committee. The hearing will feature testimony from a panel of legal experts on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. There is almost 0% chance of any major bombshells coming out of this hearing, unlike last month\u2019s hearings conducted by the House intelligence committee. These witnesses will not be providing new details about the Ukraine controversy, instead offering insight into whether the president\u2019s actions (as described at last month\u2019s hearings) would justify impeachment. But according to the opening statements released this morning, the witnesses do not intend to hold back. \u201cThe president\u2019s serious misconduct, including bribery, soliciting a personal favor from a foreign leader in exchange for his exercise of power, and obstructing justice and Congress are worse than the misconduct of any prior president, including what previous presidents who faced impeachment have done or been accused of doing,\u201d Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor, intends to say. However, Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University who was called to testify by House Republicans, will argue the allegations against Trump do not meet the Founders\u2019 standard for impeachment and could set a dangerous precedent for the future. These clashing viewpoints -- combined with the combative messaging strategy being pursued by the president\u2019s allies -- could add some fireworks to this morning\u2019s technical legal debate. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping an eye on: Trump is still at the Nato summit in London and is scheduled to hold a news conference at 10:30 a.m. ET. The Atlantic Council think tank will hold a discussion on \u201cUS Strategic Interests in Ukraine\u201d with lawmakers at the Capitol. Elizabeth Warren will appear on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Jimmy Fallon. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Naomi Wolf has reignited her row with Australia\u2019s energy minister, Angus Taylor, publishing a recording of a heated phone call with his office. On Thursday morning the US author said she called Taylor\u2019s parliamentary office requesting a \u201cformal correction\u201d to the Hansard record of his maiden speech, asking that Taylor \u201ctell Parliament please that I was not campaigning against Xmas in any way?\u201d She tweeted several excerpts before publishing the 29-minute recording in full. In 2013 Taylor referred to Wolf in his maiden speech to parliament while recounting an anecdote about \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and a dispute about a Christmas tree at Oxford University in 1991, when he was a Rhodes scholar. When Wolf was alerted to the speech on Monday she pointed out that she was not at Oxford in 1991 and accused the minister of \u201cantisemitic dogwhistling\u201d. In the call with Taylor\u2019s staffer, Wolf repeatedly requested that his office issue a public correction to say she was not at Oxford at the same time as him, and that she was not part of a group of people campaigning against Christmas. In his 2013 speech Taylor said: \u201cIt was 1991, and a young Naomi Wolf lived a couple of doors down the corridor. Several graduate students, mostly from the north-east of the US, decided we should abandon the Christmas tree in the common room because some people might be offended. I was astounded. \u201cIn our times, the world over, the foundation of democracy \u2013 free speech \u2013 and the foundation of capitalism \u2013 property rights \u2013 are being chipped away by shrill elitist voices who insist that they know what is best for people who are not remotely like them.\u201d The anecdote was repeated in a 2014 profile in the Australian Financial Review. Taylor\u2019s staffer told Wolf that was the AFR\u2019s reporting, and not a claim sourced from Taylor\u2019s office. Wolf said on Monday she was \u201clong back in the US\u201d and no longer at Oxford by 1991. \u201cI was a Rhodes Scholar in Oxford 1985-88,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAngus Taylor recalls me in a fever dream at Oxford in 1991 among those warring on Xmas. I was in NYC. Plus I love Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa. Flattered to be on this mythological hate list.\u201d \u201cCatch that anti-Semitic dogwhistle \u2013 elitist people \u2018who know what\u2019s best for people who are not remotely like them.\u2019 Referring to Jews like me whom Angus Taylor imagined to be among the warriors against xmas in Oxford in 1991.\u201d Taylor rejected the accusation he was antisemitic, with a spokesman noting that his grandmother was Jewish. His office insisted Taylor recalled seeing Wolf at Oxford, although they clarified the minister\u2019s speech was not referring to Wolf as one of the graduates who campaigned against the Christmas tree. Taylor is the subject of multiple controversies, including a NSW police investigation after his office provided a doctored document to the media as part of a political attack on the lord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore. A Senate committee this week found Taylor \u201cconsciously used his position as an MP and minister\u201d to try to influence an investigation into clearing of grasslands at a property he and his family part-own, and recommended the prime minister order an inquiry. Taylor\u2019s office has been contacted for a response to Wolf\u2019s claims. It is not the first time an Australian federal minister has sparred with a US celebrity. In 2017 the then deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, made international headlines after he threatened to have Johnny Depp\u2019s dogs put down when the actor bypassed customs to bring them into the country. Pistol and Boo were flown home before Joyce\u2019s deadline. In June, Wolf\u2019s latest book release was cancelled in the US and future versions corrected in the UK after she admitted live on air that it contained at least two errors. In an interview on BBC Radio 3, broadcaster Matthew Sweet pointed out that Wolf had misunderstood the historical term \u201cdeath recorded\u201d while writing her book Outrages. While Wolf believed it meant an execution, Sweet said it was a term that allowed judges to record a death without carrying out an execution. Wolf has said she was thankful for the correction, that it only affected two pages and did not affect the thesis of the book.",

      "bodyText": "Supermarket giant Coles has agreed to pay an extra $5.25m to one of its milk suppliers to settle a stoush with the consumer watchdog over whether it was passing all of a 10c a litre price increase on to dairy farmers. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission began investigating Coles following a promotional campaign in March in which the company promised it would \u201cpass the extra 10c per litre to processors who will distribute all of the money to the farmers who supply them with milk for Coles brand\u201d. However, the ACCC alleges that although most farmers received the extra money, this was not the case with those who supplied milk to one processor, Norco. Prior to its announcement, Coles had already agreed a separate price rise of 6.5c with Norco. The supermarket group bumped the price rise up to 10c but the ACCC believes the 10c promised to farmers should have gone on top. \u201cColes allowed farmers, consumers and the Australian public to believe that its 10c per litre price rise would go straight into the pockets of dairy farmers, when the ACCC alleges this was not the case for Norco farmers,\u201d the ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, said. Coles said that \u201cin order to avoid an unnecessary dispute\u201d with the ACCC it would pay Norco a $2.8m lump sum immediately plus an extra 7c a litre for two-litre and three-litre cartons of its home brand milk, beginning immediately and running through until 30 June next year. The payments will be on top of the 10c price rise announced in March, the company said in a statement. \u201cColes respects the regulatory process but disagreed with the ACCC\u2019s interpretation of these issues,\u201d it said. \u201cColes is pleased to be able to provide additional support to Australian dairy farmers while we continue to work with industry and government stakeholders to find long-term solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Australian dairy sector.\u201d Sims said the ACCC had been \u201cfully prepared\u201d to take Coles to court over the allegations. \u201cWe are pleased that Norco farmers will now receive additional money, commencing within seven days,\u201d he said. He said Coles had also agreed to an independent audit to make sure the extra money was passed on to farmers.\u201d \u201cWe take commitments made to us very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ACCC will be keeping a very close eye on Coles to ensure they follow through on this commitment, and we are not ruling out future litigation if necessary.\u201d",

The pioneering study found that 508,000 crabs died on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands archipelago in the Indian Ocean, along with 61,000 on Henderson Island in the South Pacific. Previous studies have found high levels of plastic pollution at both sites. Researchers from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (Imas) at the University of Tasmania, the Natural History Museum in London, and the community science organisation the Two Hands Project, found one to two crabs per metre squared of beach were being killed by litter. They surveyed sites across four Cocos Islands and Henderson for open plastic containers, with the opening sloped upwards in a way that would prevent the crab from leaving, and counted the number of entrapped crabs in each. They then extrapolated their results across another 15 islands in the Cocos archipelago. The problem is exacerbated as hermit crabs use the odour of recently deceased crabs to track down newly available shells, leading to multiple crabs becoming trapped in the same area \u2013 in one instance, 526 crabs were found in a single plastic container. Dr Alex Bond, a senior curator at the Natural History Museum and one of the report\u2019s researchers, said: \u201cThe problem is quite insidious really, because it only takes one crab. \u201cHermit crabs do not have a shell of their own, which means that when one of their compatriots die, they emit a chemical signal that basically says there\u2019s a shell available, attracting more crabs \u2026 essentially it is this gruesome chain reaction.\u201d Hermit crabs are an important part of tropical environments as they disperse seeds and aerate and fertilise soil, so their decline could have a significant impact on surrounding ecosystems. The Cocos Islands and Henderson Island are highly polluted, with 414m and 38m pieces of debris respectively, found on their beaches and in nearby vegetation. Bond said the potential for plastics to cause damage on land was under-acknowledged: \u201cIn the ocean, it entangles and is ingested by wildlife; on land it acts as a trap, as we\u2019ve seen, but can also be a physical barrier to species moving along the ground.\u201d The Imas researcher Dr Jennifer Lavers, who led the study, said: \u201cThese results are shocking but perhaps not surprising, because beaches and the vegetation that fringes them are frequented by a wide range of wildlife. \u201cIt is inevitable that these creatures will interact with and be affected by plastic pollution, although ours is one of the first studies to provide quantitative data on such impacts.\u201d The research team say their findings show the need for an urgent investigation into the death rate of hermit crabs worldwide.",
