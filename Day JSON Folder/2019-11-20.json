Turns out it wasn\u2019t quite accurate, we should\u2019ve come up with something like fierce tiger.\u201d</p> <p>He told the story of how, while she was working in India, Bergeron had been stopped by a vendor in a market who had boasted of how his textiles were handmade by nine-year-old children. Thinking he was talking to an interested shopper and not a lawyer specialising in human trafficking, he gave Bergeron information about the factory where the children were working, which her organisation then investigated.</p> <p>Bergeron was planning on moving to Wyoming in 2020 with Hammerling and Deesha for a new job.

Second, it is beyond my ability to comprehend, given the traditionally peaceful nature of culture of the Yapese people.\u201d</p> <p>Laura Tiningdad, from the Yap Womens\u2019 Association, with which Bergeron worked closely, said the death \u201cbroke my heart\u201d and that the association would name the women\u2019s centre after her in name of all the work she did with women in Yap.</p> <h2>\u2018Wanton indifference to the value of human life\u2019</h2> <p>The FBI sent a team to aid FSM police in their investigations.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has argued there is no direct link between Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and the severity of fires ravaging the continent, even suggesting Australia could increase its emissions without making the current fire season worse. Under pressure due to a record season of early bushfires and the accusation by a coalition of former fire chiefs that the government has avoided the issue of climate change, Morrison said on Thursday there was no \u201ccredible scientific evidence\u201d that cutting Australia\u2019s emissions could reduce the severity of bushfires. On Thursday Morrison defended the government\u2019s handling of the bushfire season, telling ABC\u2019s AM it had put additional resources into emergency services and praising the \u201coutstanding\u201d response and coordination of state governments. Morrison said he \u201ctook issue\u201d with the suggestion by Greg Mullins, the former chief of NSW Fire and Rescue, and 23 other fire chiefs that the government was not adequately prepared. Explaining why he didn\u2019t meet Mullins, Morrison said the government already had the same advice about the impact of climate change from \u201cexisting fire chiefs doing the existing job\u201d. At first, Morrison appeared to accept that climate change was affecting the severity and frequency of bushfires. \u201cThese are things that are very well known to the government \u2013 the contribution of these issues to global weather conditions and to conditions here in Australia are known and acknowledged,\u201d he said. \u201cIn February I acknowledged the contribution of those factors to what was happening in Australia \u2013 amongst many other issues.\u201d Morrison then said \u201cthe suggestion that any way shape or form that Australia, accountable for 1.3% of the world\u2019s emissions, that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events, whether it\u2019s here or anywhere else in the world, that doesn\u2019t bear up to credible scientific evidence either\u201d. \u201cClimate change is a global phenomenon and we\u2019re doing our bit as part of the response to climate change \u2013 we\u2019re taking action on climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think to suggest that at just 1.3% of emissions, that Australia doing something more or less would change the fire outcome this season \u2013 I don\u2019t think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all.\u201d The comments follow a controversy in September when the minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, David Littleproud, said he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow if climate change is manmade\u201d, before a total about-face. The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Australia\u2019s response to climate change has been ranked one of the worst in the G20, with rising greenhouse gas emissions since the Abbott government abolished the carbon price in 2014. Australia\u2019s target of 26%-28% emissions reduction by 2030 will require it to cut emissions by 695m tonnes cumulatively across the next decade. The Morrison government said more than half of that cut, 367m tonnes, would come from carryover credits from overperformance of earlier targets and not from practical emissions reduction. The centrepiece of federal climate policy is the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, now rebadged as the climate solutions fund, a reverse auction processes that pays landowners and businesses to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The government has been quietly pursuing an overhaul of the emissions reduction fund, appointing a panel of four business leaders and policy experts to suggest options to expand it, and will consider the issue with the states at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. On Thursday Morrison refused to give further details of his proposed crackdown on environmental protests and secondary boycotts, saying the government would make announcements when it had \u201cfinalised those arrangements\u201d. The attorney general, Christian Porter, has suggested measures could include extending the prohibition on secondary boycotts to environmental campaigns, and a crackdown on environmental litigation and use of litigation funders for class actions against mining companies. In a speech to the Business Council on Wednesday, Morrison flagged an overhaul of environmental approvals for major projects to reduce the length of time it takes for businesses to navigate environmental approvals.",

      "bodyText": "Ryan Giggs\u2019s critics should \u201ceat their words\u201d after the Wales manager led his country to Euro 2020 in his first qualifying campaign in charge, according to the midfielder Joe Allen. Wales mustered three points from their opening three qualifying matches but after victory over Hungary on Tuesday they are unbeaten in six matches and Wales are heading to a third major tournament finals. Many supporters were sceptical about Giggs\u2019s appointment last year, unconvinced the former Manchester United winger was the best candidate to replace Chris Coleman, who led Wales to a Euro 2016 semi-final, but Allen feels the decision has been vindicated. \u201cThe ambition and target was to get to the Euros,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe would have loved to have done it more easily but beggars can\u2019t be choosers. Any way you get there is huge success. A lot of people are going to have to eat their words with some of the criticism which has been thrown at us.\u201d Giggs credited Coleman for \u201cshowing the way\u201d and Allen said qualification should diminish any lingering doubts over the manager. \u201cYes [he has had flak], but he has delivered, simple as that. He came in off the back of a great manager who had huge success. It was always going to be tough but he has got us there. I think questions have been asked of everything really \u2013 selection, tactics \u2013 but nine times out of 10 he has got it right. That is one of the big reasons we have made it.\u201d Aaron Ramsey turned in a near-perfect performance against Hungary, scoring both goals, and it proved an equally special occasion for those who were not part of Euro 2016, such as the Bournemouth pair Harry Wilson, who attended the tournament as a fan, and Chris Mepham, who was then playing for Brentford B. \u201cI was on holiday in Greece,\u201d said Mepham, who made his Wales debut in March last year. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be in a position where I\u2019d be going to a major tournament. Even in the summer with the two games we had it made it very difficult. I think a lot of people lost hope.\u201d Ramsey believes Wales are capable of going deep into the knockout stages next summer. Ramsey missed Wales\u2019s semi-final defeat by Portugal three years ago because of suspension and the Juventus midfielder feels as if he has unfinished business with the competition. \u201cIt was obviously a disappointing ending to the Euros for me by missing out on the semi-final,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have the opportunity to go out there and express myself again and hopefully we can have another successful run. To do back-to-back Euros is something special. It was very disappointing not to make the [2018] World Cup but we learned from that experience to bring it back here, and to win in the manner that we did was a nice experience.\u201d Wales will discover their group-stage fate when the Euro 2020 draw is made in Bucharest on 30 November. Giggs\u2019s side will be drawn into either Group A, where matches will be played in Rome and Baku, or Group B, where matches will be played in Copenhagen and St Petersburg. Group B will comprise Belgium, Russia, Denmark and either Finland or Wales. Asked about possibly playing for his country in Italy next summer, Ramsey replied: \u201cI\u2019m enjoying my time over there at the moment, so that would be nice.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tears filled Primitivo Quisbert\u2019s bloodshot eyes as he contemplated his son\u2019s swollen, lifeless face \u2013 and why someone else\u2019s struggle for political supremacy had condemned his child to an early grave. \u201cIt\u2019s so painful, se\u00f1or. So very painful,\u201d the 61-year-old carpenter sobbed. \u201cJust look at what they have done to my boy.\u201d Before him, on a church\u2019s wooden pew, lay the body of Pedro Quisbert Mamani, 37, a factory worker and father of two \u2013 and one of at least eight young Bolivians killed on Tuesday when the country\u2019s political crisis exploded into deadly violence in the city of El Alto. Nearby lay another five bodies, their feet poking from blankets or flags, their names and ages printed on A4 sheets placed on top of the corpses. \u201cJoel Colque Patty, 22\u201d; \u201cDevi Posto Cusi, 34\u201d; \u201cAntonio Ronald Quispe Ticona, 23\u201d; \u201cClemente Eloy Mamani Santander, 23\u201d; \u201cJuan Jose Tenorio Mamani, 23\u201d. Three disposable cups had been placed on the tiled floor beneath Mamani\u2019s cadaver to catch the constant drips of blood coming from a gaping bullet wound to the back of his head. \u201cIt was one shot in the nape \u2013 just look at how he is bleeding,\u201d his father said as forensic pathologists donned white suits and face masks and prepared to perform autopsies on the bodies, right there in front of the altar. \u201cI raised my son with so much love \u2013 and now I must bury him. Do you know what that is like for me?\u201d Quisbert asked. \u201cTo raise, to educate - and then to bury?\u201d Evo Morales \u2013 the country\u2019s exiled former president \u2013 described the events in El Alto as a \u201cmassacre\u201d. \u201cIn Bolivia, they are killing my brothers and my sisters,\u201d he told reporters in Mexico City on Wednesday. \u201cThis is the kind of thing the old military dictatorships used to do.\u201d The rightwing interim government that took power after Morales\u2019 toppling on 10 November has rejected claims the army was behind Tuesday\u2019s killings, which came during confrontations between troops and Morales loyalists outside a fuel storage depot the latter had been blockading. Bolivia\u2019s defense minister, Fernando L\u00f3pez, told reporters \u201cnot a single bullet\u201d had been fired by his forces, and branded demonstrators \u201cterrorists\u201d acting on the orders of Morales. But in El Alto \u2013 a teeming high-altitude city near La Paz long considered a Morales stronghold \u2013 locals are adamant the government is to blame for what they call a massacre of innocent workers. \u201cWe cannot allow them to slaughter us like this,\u201d shouted Joana Quispe, 40, one of thousands of mostly indigenous demonstrators who had packed the streets around the city\u2019s Saint Francis of Assisi church on Wednesday to denounce the killings. Outside the simple redbrick church, the mood was one of fury and defiance as locals attacked Bolivia\u2019s interim president, Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, and her rightwing coalition. \u201cOur government is racist,\u201d fumed Ricardo Benito Mamani, 56. \u201cThey are trampling on our democracy. This lady president has to go.\u201d Roadblocks cobbled together from concrete slabs, sign posts, burning tires and car parts \u2013 and the presence of heavily armed Bolivian security forces \u2013 gave the stunning, mountain-ringed community the air of a war zone. Inside the church, there was rage too. \u201cThe world must know the truth,\u201d insisted Aurelio Miranda, 54. \u201cWhat happened was a massacre \u2026 They used weapons like you use in a war. They didn\u2019t think about the consequences. That\u2019s why so many are dead.\u201d \u201cI feel so much pain as a Bolivian, that Bolivians are slaughtering their own brothers,\u201d Miranda added. Primitivo Quisbert still seemed too dazed by his loss to point fingers. As cries of \u201cJustice! Justice! Justice!\u201d filled the church, he told of how his family had been preparing for a new arrival, not a funeral. His dead son\u2019s wife was eight months pregnant with a child who will now never meet its father. \u201cWe\u2019re not members of any party. We\u2019re not interested in any of this. We are humble people who know how to work,\u201d Quisbert said. \u201cHow can they just kill you as though you were a dog?\u201d On the wall above the grieving father, and the improvised altar-side morgue, elegant metal letters spelled out the Prayer of Saint Francis. \u201cLord, make me an instrument of your peace Where there is hatred, let me sow love Where there is injury, pardon Where there is doubt, faith Where there is despair, hope Where there is darkness, light And where there is sadness, joy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been here the whole night \u2013 here with my son,\u201d Quisbert said. \u201cI cannot let him go.\u201d Additional reporting Cindy Jimenez Becerra in El Alto and Jo Tuckman in Mexico City",

But the phone call, and the corruption it describes, still stands. The late John McCain used to say there was no higher calling than to serve a cause greater than self. He surely had in mind people like Lt Col Alexander Vindman, the decorated war hero who came to the country as a child immigrant, and served in this sleazy White House with a greater sense of American values than any of its political appointees. But for Gordon and Donald, McCain was so obviously wrong about national service. There is, in fact, an even higher calling in government: serving themselves as greatly as possible. For Donald, that has led directly to this moment of his own impeachment. For Gordon, it has led to this pathetic moment of his own public humbling.",

Only 6,287 council homes were built in 2018-19. The rapid increase would be paid for using half of the \u00a3150bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d recently announced by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, which will be funded through government borrowing. The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a new era of council housing. \u201cAnd the significance of it is that building on this scale allows us not just to build for the poorest; but to be able to build homes again for those young people trapped in private renting; young families that want to get a start in life that can\u2019t yet afford to buy; older people that may be in substandard homes that need somewhere more secure and reliably costed.\u201d He added: \u201cWe can do in a way that we did by kicking off that great council housebuilding programme after the second world war: we can build for the many.\u201d Healey conceded that to meet the target, Labour would have to rapidly increase the capacity of local authorities, whose planning departments have been hollowed out dramatically as building rates have declined. Corbyn hopes the focus on housing will help to broaden the general election debate beyond Brexit, where Boris Johnson has been hammering home his promise to leave the EU by the end of January in a bid to win over disgruntled leave voters. Labour is defending a string of leave-voting seats across the Midlands and the north, which the Tories are targeting aggressively. While Corbyn faced difficulties in Tuesday night\u2019s debate over his refusal to say how he would campaign in the referendum he has promised to hold next year, his advisers believe painting Labour as a remain party would wreck their chances in Brexit-voting areas.

The Conservatives will also focus on housing on Thursday, announcing a \u201cfairer deal for renters\u201d, including a government-guaranteed scheme to allow tenants to transfer their deposit from one property to another. They will also confirm plans first announced during May\u2019s premiership to abolish \u201cno-fault evictions\u201d. Labour\u2019s slim red \u201cFor the Many\u201d manifesto formed a central part of its campaign in the 2017 general election, when Corbyn unexpectedly deprived Theresa May of her majority. Corbyn has already announced a series of radical policies, including providing free broadband by part-nationalising BT, overhauling business regulation, and opening 1,000 Sure Start centres. The last time 100,000 council homes were built in a year was in 1977 and if achieved Labour\u2019s plan would represent the biggest acceleration in public housebuilding since 1946, when Clement Attlee oversaw the reconstruction of swathes of postwar Britain. Figures released by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government on Wednesday showed only 6,287 council homes were built in 2018-19, representing the second-lowest level since public house building began in earnest in 1921, except for during wartime. With more than 1.1m households on waiting lists for affordable homes, the output was branded \u201coutrageous\u201d by Polly Neate, chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, who said it would be \u201ca crushing blow\u201d for families waiting, including many who are currently homeless. \u201cThis includes mothers of severely ill children in need of a suitable home, people in their 70s and 80s desperate for some stability, and working families still struggling to pay their rent,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly social housing will do, not expensive new-builds and luxury flats.\u201d The council houses were among 37,825 new homes built nationwide last year to be let at discounted rents.

The sparring gives me all the information I need.\u201d His trainer, Rob McCracken, said that Joshua had enjoyed \u201creal good sparring\u201d with partners who had pushed him hard. He added: \u201cSince Josh has been a professional, sparring partners have always come here to try to rip his head off and make a name for themselves. This group of sparring partners has done really well and pushed him every step of the way and we still have three very important spars ahead, where our fight strategy is going to be carried out.\u201d Amnesty International is among those to have warned that the Saudi authorities are attempting to \u201csportswash\u201d their human rights record by bringing the fight, billed as the \u201cClash of the Dunes\u201d\u201a to Diriyah on 7 December. However, Joshua and his promoter Eddie Hearn claim they are trying to increase boxing\u2019s global profile.",

The Essential poll of 1,075 respondents found that a majority were also uncomfortable with the government providing other agencies with information for national security purposes (58%) or facial recognition to restrict access to content not suitable for children (56%). The poll found that just 19% of users claim to have fully read and understood the terms and conditions of websites they use and about the same number (18%) say they never read the terms, they just accept them. Most users are somewhere in between, reading the terms but not understanding the implications (21%) or reading the terms \u201csometimes \u2026 depending on the website\u201d (38%). The majority of respondents were uncomfortable with commercial platforms selling their data (76%) and the government providing their data to businesses (74%). About two-thirds of respondents were uncomfortable with the government (66%) or commercial online platforms (65%) \u201coffering products and services based on [their] personal information and behaviour\u201d. The most likely to object use of personal information for national security reasons were Greens voters (65%) or \u201cother\u201d voters for minor parties or independents (70%), with facial recognition for age verification also the most unpopular among those groups. Across age groups, people aged 18-34 were less likely to report being uncomfortable with all forms of data collection than those aged 35-54 or 55 and above. The results, released on Thursday, mark the launch of the Australia Institute\u2019s new Centre for Responsible Technology, to be headed by the Essential Media executive director, Peter Lewis. Lewis said the results reflect \u201cincreased public distrust at the data models at the very heart of the business strategies of big tech organisations like Facebook and Google\u201d. \u201cThey also show a breakdown of trust in the government to collect information in the public interest,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is most confounding about these results is that the public is uncomfortable with the use of data in the precise ways they routinely consent to it being used.\u201d The centre aims to develop a set of rules and standards to control how organisations handle personal information and to help people make choices about how their information is used. In July, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission digital platforms report recommended the Privacy Act should be updated to give users greater control over their personal information, the ability to move the data from one company to another, to have the data destroyed and to require greater levels of consent from users before personal information is collected. In responding to the report, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said: \u201cThere is no option other than to put in place the right regulatory and legislative regime to protect the public\u2019s privacy. \u201cWhat this report finds is that so much personal data is being collected without informed consent,\u201d he said. In October, the joint standing committee on intelligence and security told the government it needs to rethink its plans for a national facial verification database built with photos from passports and drivers\u2019 licences, citing privacy concerns. A parliamentary committee is currently considering whether to use facial recognition to verify users\u2019 age before they can access pornography.",

Orange, who led a consortium that took control of the Sharks in 2016 and has invested significant sums in the club, believes more must be done by the sport\u2019s authorities to ensure clubs are protected if wealthy backers decide they want to withdraw their investment. \u201cThe game needs to sort itself out,\u201d he said at a media day at the club\u2019s Carrington training ground on Wednesday. \u201cWe lost \u00a350m last year and that is currently being covered by a load of idiot owners, one of which is me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if those losses become \u00a3100m, and then \u00a3150m and \u00a3200m, there aren\u2019t going to be that many people who either can or want to be able to afford it. Let\u2019s say the average loss is \u00a33.5m per club \u2026 you only need 12 or 13 people to cover that. \u201cIf the losses went to \u00a310m \u2013 which, for instance, if we didn\u2019t have the salary cap it would \u2013 there would be three teams playing each other, wouldn\u2019t there? So we have got to protect it.\u201d Orange believes Premiership Rugby will make changes regarding contracts and the salary cap after Saracens\u2019 record punishment earlier this month. \u201cThey will change some processes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe job now is to make it so onerous to cheat that it\u2019s not worth it. I\u2019m not suggesting anyone has but \u2026 there\u2019s loads of discussions been had, and it\u2019s probably better for me not to be commenting, but we need transparency, players having to account for what they receive. And maybe agents. But Premiership Rugby will do it properly and professionally \u2013 and the new management team are on to it.\u201d When asked if he felt all teams were playing by the same rules, Orange said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I know I have got 24 players and I\u2019m struggling, and others have 48 quality players and aren\u2019t, so I suspect we\u2019re not all the way there yet. But I\u2019m pretty confident we will get there.\u201d Orange said of the prospect of the Premiership abandoning promotion and relegation: \u201cMost peoples\u2019 view is that they think the sport would be better off if we didn\u2019t have it. I see the merits for that, but I have no idea what harm it could do. It could just become duller and duller. My gut feeling is we should keep it \u2026 but I\u2019m not 100% sure.\u201d",

He points out that, while they have followed Labour and the Tories in promising a big increase in spending, the Lib Dems are now the only major party committed to reduce the national debt as a fraction of national income.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Liberal Democrats have followed Labour and the Conservatives in promising big increases in investment spending \u2013 a little bit more than the Conservative offer, still a lot less than the amount being proposed by Labour. Even so, their manifesto confirms that they are now the only major party committed to reduce the national debt as a fraction of national income, a goal now abandoned by both Labour and the Conservatives.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He says the most eye-catching spending plan is a near quintupling in spending on universal free childcare, which would cement \u201can entirely new leg of the welfare state and offering a big boost to families with young children\u201d. \u201cWe should though be cautious about expecting this to result in a big improvement in either child outcomes or a big increase in the number of parents in paid work,\u201d said Johnson.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Additional revenues would come from \u00a337bn worth of tax increases including increases in income tax and corporation tax rates, a reform to capital gains tax and a very big rise in air passenger duty. Nearly \u00a36bn is attributed to the dubious, if inevitable, \u2018anti-avoidance\u2019 measures.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also says that the party\u2019s claim that there would be a \u00a350bn \u201cwindfall\u201d from stopping Brexit is \u201cwithin the range of plausible estimates for the extent of that additional revenue\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The biggest individual source of income for additional spending though would be the \u00a314 billion \u2018remain bonus\u2019. This is an estimate of the additional tax revenue (net of payments to the EU) accruing in 2024-25 as a result of the economy being, on their estimates, about 2% bigger than otherwise in the event of remaining in the EU. (The \u00a350bn bonus they focus on comes from cumulating additional revenues over five years). </p> \n   <p>Of course, there is a lot of uncertainty over such an estimate. That said if it were to become clear not only that we were going to remain but that that was a settled state for the long term, we could expect some additional growth and with it additional tax revenue.

Mr. Johnson has not stated how much he would like to raise this threshold by, nor whether he would raise just the employee and self-employed thresholds or the employer one too. If just the employee and self-employed thresholds are changed, raising the threshold by \u00a31,000 takes 600,000 workers out of NICs altogether and costs the government about \u00a33bn per year. If the employer one is changed as well, the cost goes up to \u00a34.5bn per year. Raising the threshold to \u00a312,500 ... would cost \u00a311bn per year if just the employee and self-employed thresholds are raised, or \u00a317bn if employer ones are as well, and would take 2.4 million workers out of NICs. </p> \n   <p>Any of these policies would have a larger proportional impact on the after-tax earnings of low-earning workers than high-earning ones (though the very lowest earning workers \u2013 who currently do not pay NICs \u2013 would be unaffected). However, when we look at the impact of the policy on household incomes, the picture is rather different. Figure 4 shows the distributional impact of raising all NICs thresholds, including that for employer NICs, to \u00a312,500. 16 million households gain from the policy, but as the figure makes clear, the largest proportional gains go to those in the middle to upper part of the income distribution. This happens for two key reasons. First, those in households towards the bottom of the income distribution are much less likely to be in work, and of course only workers benefit from this policy. Second, households nearer the bottom get a larger share of their income from benefits, rather than earnings, which means that the policy has a smaller impact on their incomes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is a chart from the IFS report showing the distributional impact on households.</p> \n  <p>Obviously, we don\u2019t yet have the full details of what the Conservatives are proposing, but just what we\u2019ve heard from Johnson.

It is the line that party has always used, and there is no reason to believe that a private deal has been agreed. But what was striking was how, even without any pact, the SNP and Labour are starting to sound very similar in what they say about the Tories.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon said that a Tory government would strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the US that would lead to the cost of drugs rising. This is word for word what Labour says. And last night, in the ITV debate, Jeremy Corbyn used the argument that under the Tories the Brexit crisis would go on for years, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd44b508f087b800b61d3d8#block-5dd44b508f087b800b61d3d8\">negotiating a UK-US trade deal would take most of a decade. </a> Today Sturgeon said much the same thing.

Presumably because they both know that these attack lines are persuasive with voters.)</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from Sturgeon\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sturgeon claimed that Scottish independence would not be as disruptive as Brexit. </strong>She said she understood why people were claiming that Scottish independence would be as chaotic as Brexit. But that was not true, she claimed. In her Q&amp;A she said:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Much as I oppose Brexit, and I really oppose Brexit in principle, as well as for all the practical reasons I\u2019ve been talking about, there was nothing inevitable about the mess of the Brexit process. That was down to the fact that those who advocated to leave in the referendum didn\u2019t put any detail of what it would mean in practice, the trade-offs, the compromises that would be required to implement that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Sturgeon said that, unlike the Brexiters, the SNP had a detailed plan for independence when it was proposing this ahead of the 2014 referendum. She went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We had done the planning and we will do so again. And let us not allow the charlatans who were dishonest with people over Brexit to somehow suggest that constitutional change has to be that way. It was that way and is that way with Brexit because of their dishonest and their lack of planning. </p> \n   <p>These are mistakes the independence campaign did not make in 2014 and will not make in future.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said there were multiple threats to Scotland from remaining in the UK.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Make no mistake, it is now crystal clear that continued Westminster control means multiple threats to Scotland \u2013 to our economy and our living standards, and to our NHS and other public services.</p> \n   <p>First of all there is the direct economic threat of Brexit.<br></p> \n   <p>Leaving the European Union will mean lower economic growth and therefore lower tax revenue to fund public services.</p> \n   <p>The second threat is to the workforce. The end of freedom of movement will make it harder to attract NHS and social care staff. And it will mean fewer people working in Scotland and therefore contributing tax revenue to public services.</p> \n   <p>The third threat comes from the Tory power grab on the Scottish parliament in their pursuit of their Brexit vision.</p> \n   <p>They\u2019ve already used Brexit to grab powers from the Scottish parliament.<br></p> \n   <p>With the rightwing of the Tory party in full cry, can anyone have any confidence there won\u2019t be a further power-grab attempt on Scotland\u2019s parliament as, UK-wide, they compromise on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards?<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said a Tory government would strike a trade deal with the US that could lead to drug prices rising for the NHS. </strong>She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Tories are desperate to do a trade deal with Donald Trump.</p> \n   <p>That could mean large rises in the cost of NHS drugs.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a detailed summary of the day\u2019s events: And, for those wanting to read yet more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Jim Waterson have tonight\u2019s main politics story: \u201cYes, what was that?\u201d said Boris Johnson, affecting bafflement when asked about the Conservative party\u2019s Twitter feed masquerading as a fact-checking service during the debate on Tuesday between the party leaders. The prime minister appeared to be suggesting his own party\u2019s official communications channels had nothing to do with him; he argued it was not for him to \u201cinvigilate absolutely everything\u201d on the internet. Read my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s report from the Tory campaign trail: A complaint from the Labour Party over Sky News\u2019 decision to brand this contest the \u201cBrexit Election\u201d has been rejected by the media regulator, Ofcom. Labour are keen to fight the election on other policies such as the NHS, arguing that the presence of on-screen Brexit election branding showed bias. Ofcom rejected this claim in a letter sent on Tuesday afternoon, telling the party: We considered that Brexit is an important background contextual factor which has been instrumental in shaping the debate within Parliament in the weeks and months leading up to the general election. In addition, given that the current extension to the article 50 process runs out on 31 January 2020, the issue of what happens next in terms of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU will be determined by the election result and the make-up of the next parliament. Against this backdrop, we consider it a reasonable editorial judgment for Sky News to use the strapline \u2018The Brexit Election\u2019 to label its election programming. Some hasty revisions have been made to Boris Johnson\u2019s equally hasty announcement of a national insurance (NI) contributions cut (see 2.11pm). At first, the prime minister said the Tories were going to increase the threshold at which most workers begin paying NI to \u00a312,000. Later, speaking to ITV News, he said the initial increase would actually only be to \u00a39,500, while a subsequent rise to a new figure of \u00a312,500 was described as an \u201cambition\u201d. That first change to NI, he wrongly claimed, would represent a \u201c\u00a3500 cut for every working person\u201d. The latest version of the policy released by Tory HQ this evening is a lifting of the NI threshold from \u00a38,632 to \u00a39,500 in 2020/21, which the party now says will actually only be worth \u00a3100 per worker \u2013 or less than \u00a32 per week \u2013 and an \u201cultimate ambition\u201d to increase it to \u00a312,500 at some point in the future. Waheed Rafiq, the Lib Dem candidate in the Birmingham Hodge Hill constituency, has been suspended from the party for making \u201cclearly and unambiguously antisemitic\u201d comments on social media. The timing is potentially awkward for the Lib Dems, coming on the same day as the party\u2019s manifesto launch. A Liberal Democrat spokeswoman said: \u201cAt 3pm Waheed Rafiq Hodge Hill PPC (prospective parliamentary candidate) was suspended from the party. \u201cThe public posts on his Facebook and Twitter account from 2010 to 2014 are clearly and unambiguously antisemitic and bring the party into disrepute and are also of material disagreement with the fundamental values and objectives of the party.\u201d Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: \u201cThe only response to the disgusting antisemitism exhibited by the Liberal Democrat candidate for Birmingham Hodge Hill is to immediately drop him as a candidate for the constituency. \u201cWe call on the Liberal Democrats to act now and ensure he is expelled after he is dropped as a candidate.\u201d Earlier, the prime minister claimed a new pledge to increase the national insurance threshold to \u00a312,000 was part of a plan to primarily help \u201cworking people\u201d (see: 2.11pm). But does it stack up? Here\u2019s our factcheck, put together by my colleague Richard Partington: The Resolution Foundation said the threshold hike was \u201crelatively progressive as far as tax cuts go\u201d, but that to reduce poverty it would be better and more cost effective to reverse the \u00a312bn in benefits cuts imposed under austerity policies since 2015. Listen in to this week\u2019s Politics Weekly, as my colleague Heather Stewart is joined by Ayesha Hazarika, Paul Harrison and Will Jennings to pick apart the ITV debate. Plus, Rowena Mason calls in from the Tory battlebus and Peter Walker reports from the Green party\u2019s manifesto launch: Jo Swinson has launched her party\u2019s manifesto at an event in Camden. She said the Lib Dems were the only ones who could take a significant number of seats from the Conservatives and deprive them of a majority. In a speech to activists, she highlighted the party\u2019s policies on the environment, education and childcare. You can read our report on the manifesto here. She said: At this election the future of our country is at stake. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that is doesn\u2019t get better than Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn, that we are destined to stand alone in the world, that we must face the biggest challenges on our own, that Brexit is inevitable. None of that is a given. The future of our country is in our hands and we can make a better choice, so it you want to stop Boris Johnson and stop Brexit, vote Liberal Democrat. She wraps up: \u201cThe future of our country is in our hands ... so if you want to stop Boris Johnson and stop Brexit then vote Liberal Democrat. If you want a \u00a350bn bonus to improve your life, vote Liberal Democrat ... If you want to work with our friends to tackle the climate crisis, vote Liberal Democrat. If you want to build a brighter future, vote Liberal Democrat.\u201d The biggest investment in the manifesto is for parents, says Swinson, something she is very proud of. They will help parents going back to work by providing 35 free hours of childcare a week, for 48 weeks a year. \u201cWe are the only party that can win a significant number of seats from the Conservatives and deprive them a majority,\u201d says the Lib Dem leader. She says her party has committed \u00a311bn over the next five years for improvement of mental health services \u2013 investing more money in talking therapies and increasing the number of mental health nurses. Swinson says hers is the only party with a credible plan to tackle the climate emergency. \u201cWe will not leave our party with a boiling planet,\u201d she says. Stopping Brexit will give them the money to reverse schools cuts, she says. They will \u201cput our money where our heart is\u201d, she adds. Boris Johnson is deluded if he thinks he can negotiate a new trade deal with Europe by the end of 2020, she says. \u201cBoris Johnson only cares about Boris Johnson and he\u2019ll say whatever he needs to to stay in Number 10. This is a man who lied to the Queen,\u201d says Swinson. On to Jeremy Corbyn, she says the Labour leader won\u2019t be upfront about what he thinks on Brexit. \u201cI\u2019d like you to welcome my friend and our candidate to be the next prime minister,\u201d says Sanders. \u201cThe voice of a new liberal generation.\u201d Swinson says Corbyn and Johnson only know how to rehash ideas from the past \u2013 \u201cwhether it\u2019s the 1970s or the 1870s\u201d. She says the UK has wasted the last three-and-a-half years talking about Brexit. \u201cThere is no form of Brexit that would be good for our country,\u201d she says, whether it is done by Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn. We\u2019ve now got Matt Sanders, the party\u2019s candidate in Hampstead and Kilburn. \u201cPeople are responding to Jo\u2019s simple call \u2013 stop Brexit,\u201d he says. \u201cFriends, Brexit must be stopped.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn likes remain votes but he doesn\u2019t want us to stay in the EU, says Sanders. He says that millions of people looked at Corbyn and Johnson last night and they didn\u2019t want to choose either. Daisy Cooper, the party\u2019s candidate in St Albans \u2013 not Camden \u2013 is opening the event. She says that while St Albans voted to stay in the EU, the constituency has a \u201chard Brexit\u201d MP in Conservative Anne Main. \u201cYou guys are going to have to work really, really hard over the next few weeks so give yourselves a round of applause and have a great night,\u201d she says. We\u2019re just waiting for the Liberal Democrat manifesto launch to begin in Camden. You can watch a live feed at the top of this blog. Guardian political correspondent Peter Walker is there. Hundreds of students and under-18s have been registered to vote without their knowledge after a council IT blunder, according to the Sun. Around 635 students were wrongly registered by Plymouth city council, and polling cards were mistakenly sent to up to 247 under-18s. The council, which was criticised over similar errors in May, said \u201ctagging issues\u201d on its internal systems had caused students and young people to automatically be added to its voting roster. Since 2014 it has been illegal to register anyone but yourself to vote. Johnny Mercer, the candidate for Plymouth Moor View, wrote on Twitter: The chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, Torsten Bell, has been looking at the Liberal Democrat election manifesto plans. More from the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason. Labour\u2019s John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has commented on the Conservatives\u2019 national insurance plans. Even after 10 years of cruel cuts and despite creaking public services, the Tories still think the answer to the challenges of our time is a tax cut of \u00a31.64 a week, with those on universal credit getting about 60p. Meanwhile independent experts have said this will cost up to \u00a311bn so everyone who relies on public services and social security will be wondering whether they will be paying the price. The Tories are stuck in the 1980s while a Labour government will tackle head-on the climate and human emergencies of our time. Here\u2019s our full story on the Tory national insurance announcement. Boris Johnson has said he wants to raise the national insurance threshold to \u00a312,000, letting slip a major Tory tax cut from the manifesto as he was speaking to workers in Teesside. The prime minister said he wanted to cut tax for working people as he was pressed by an employee at a fabrication yard about whether he would help \u201cpeople like us\u201d, not just the rich. The policy would ultimately be a tax cut of more than \u00a3400 for everyone earning more than the current threshold of \u00a38,632. However, it quickly emerged that the Tories would only pledge to raise the threshold to \u00a39,500 next year then lift it gradually over many years until it reached the target \u00a312,000 threshold. Two million people have applied to register to vote since the general election was called, the Press Association reports. A total of 2,048,039 applications were submitted between 29 October \u2013 the day the government called for an election on 12 December \u2013 and 19 November, according to government figures. More than a third of applications (35%) came from people under the age of 25. A further 30% were from 25 to 34-year-olds. That was quick. The Liberal Democrats have now suspended Waheed Rafiq. See my previous post. Buzzfeed\u2019s Alex Wickham has this story about the Liberal Democrat candidate in Birmingham Hodge Hill, Waheed Rafiq, who tweeted antisemitic comments, expressed apparent support for the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, backed Trump for president and stood as a Ukip candidate in the same seat in 2010. You can read the whole (pretty astonishing) story here. More on that \u2013 possibly accidental \u2013 announcement of a huge proposed Conservative manifesto tax cut. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has issued some initial reaction to the Liberal Democrat manifesto. He points out that, while they have followed Labour and the Tories in promising a big increase in spending, the Lib Dems are now the only major party committed to reduce the national debt as a fraction of national income. The Liberal Democrats have followed Labour and the Conservatives in promising big increases in investment spending \u2013 a little bit more than the Conservative offer, still a lot less than the amount being proposed by Labour. Even so, their manifesto confirms that they are now the only major party committed to reduce the national debt as a fraction of national income, a goal now abandoned by both Labour and the Conservatives. He says the most eye-catching spending plan is a near quintupling in spending on universal free childcare, which would cement \u201can entirely new leg of the welfare state and offering a big boost to families with young children\u201d. \u201cWe should though be cautious about expecting this to result in a big improvement in either child outcomes or a big increase in the number of parents in paid work,\u201d said Johnson. Additional revenues would come from \u00a337bn worth of tax increases including increases in income tax and corporation tax rates, a reform to capital gains tax and a very big rise in air passenger duty. Nearly \u00a36bn is attributed to the dubious, if inevitable, \u2018anti-avoidance\u2019 measures. Johnson also says that the party\u2019s claim that there would be a \u00a350bn \u201cwindfall\u201d from stopping Brexit is \u201cwithin the range of plausible estimates for the extent of that additional revenue\u201d. The biggest individual source of income for additional spending though would be the \u00a314 billion \u2018remain bonus\u2019. This is an estimate of the additional tax revenue (net of payments to the EU) accruing in 2024-25 as a result of the economy being, on their estimates, about 2% bigger than otherwise in the event of remaining in the EU. (The \u00a350bn bonus they focus on comes from cumulating additional revenues over five years). Of course, there is a lot of uncertainty over such an estimate. That said if it were to become clear not only that we were going to remain but that that was a settled state for the long term, we could expect some additional growth and with it additional tax revenue. Their estimate is within the range of plausible estimates for the extent of that additional revenue. Labour\u2019s shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, has responded to Tory party proposals for victims to get the right to attend parole hearings. After almost a decade of cuts to the criminal justice system, the Conservatives have all but decriminalised rape. This announcement cannot cover over the fact we know that secret CPS targets incentivised difficult cases being dropped. Labour will carry out a fundamental review of rape survivors\u2019 treatment and provide the law, policy and resources required to reverse the lowest prosecution rates on record. Women in particular have learned they cannot trust Boris Johnson, not least with their most fundamental rights. Chakrabarti is referring to this story from a week ago which reveals that tens of thousands of rape cases could have been dropped because of secret targets implemented by the CPS. My colleague Rowena Mason says the Tory aides accompanying Boris Johnson are now in a bit of a panic. I\u2019ve got a meeting this afternoon, so my colleague Frances Perraudin is now taking over. And this is what the Institute for Fiscal Studies said about Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to raise the national insurance threshold in a briefing paper (pdf) when he floated the idea during the Tory leadership contest. Currently, only earnings above \u00a38,632 per year 3 are subject to NICs (employee, employer, and self-employed). Mr. Johnson has not stated how much he would like to raise this threshold by, nor whether he would raise just the employee and self-employed thresholds or the employer one too. If just the employee and self-employed thresholds are changed, raising the threshold by \u00a31,000 takes 600,000 workers out of NICs altogether and costs the government about \u00a33bn per year. If the employer one is changed as well, the cost goes up to \u00a34.5bn per year. Raising the threshold to \u00a312,500 ... would cost \u00a311bn per year if just the employee and self-employed thresholds are raised, or \u00a317bn if employer ones are as well, and would take 2.4 million workers out of NICs. Any of these policies would have a larger proportional impact on the after-tax earnings of low-earning workers than high-earning ones (though the very lowest earning workers \u2013 who currently do not pay NICs \u2013 would be unaffected). However, when we look at the impact of the policy on household incomes, the picture is rather different. Figure 4 shows the distributional impact of raising all NICs thresholds, including that for employer NICs, to \u00a312,500. 16 million households gain from the policy, but as the figure makes clear, the largest proportional gains go to those in the middle to upper part of the income distribution. This happens for two key reasons. First, those in households towards the bottom of the income distribution are much less likely to be in work, and of course only workers benefit from this policy. Second, households nearer the bottom get a larger share of their income from benefits, rather than earnings, which means that the policy has a smaller impact on their incomes. And here is a chart from the IFS report showing the distributional impact on households. Obviously, we don\u2019t yet have the full details of what the Conservatives are proposing, but just what we\u2019ve heard from Johnson. (See 2.11pm.) Some journalists think Boris Johnson may not have been planning to announce a huge proposed Conservative manifesto tax cut in a Q&amp;A with workers at an engineering company in Stockton-on-Tees. This is from the FT\u2019s George Parker. And this is from the Times\u2019 Francis Elliott. This is what Boris Johnson said in response to the question about whether his \u201clow tax\u201d policies would mean low taxes for people like Johnson himself, or for the workers and the engineering firm. (See 1.49pm.) He replied: I mean low tax for ... working people. If we look at what we\u2019re doing, and what I\u2019ve said in the last few days, we\u2019re going to be cutting national insurance up to \u00a312,000 [ie, lifting the threshold up to \u00a312,000], we\u2019re going to be making sure that we cut business rates for small businesses. We are cutting tax for working people. This is what the Institute for Fiscal Studies said about this proposal (one that Johnson floated when he was running for the Tory leadership) in its green budget published in the autumn. (Bold type in the original.) Raising the point at which employees and the self-employed start to pay national insurance contributions (NICs), from its planned level of \u00a38,788 per year in 2020\u201321, would cost about \u00a33bn for every \u00a31,000 by which it is raised. If the employer NICs threshold were raised alongside this, the total cost would be \u00a35bn. Raising NICs thresholds would benefit everyone who currently pays NICs \u2013 all workers above the bottom 12% of the weekly earnings distribution, or any employee aged 25+ working at least 20 hours per week at the national living wage. Raising the NICs threshold is the best way to help low and middle earners through the tax system, but if the aim is to help the lowest earners, increasing work allowances under universal credit is much more effective. Only 3% of the total gains from raising the NICs threshold (either by \u00a31,000 or to the personal allowance threshold) would accrue to the poorest fifth of households. Spending \u00a33bn on increasing work allowances could raise the incomes of the poorest fifth of households by 1.5%, compared with less than 0.1% under an equally costly NICs cut. Increasing aviation duties for frequent flyers, raising up to \u00a35bn a year, is among policies announced by the Liberal Democrats in an election manifesto based around investment in green technologies and higher spending on public services, my colleague Peter Walker reports. Johnson says he is committed to the nuclear deterrent. That investment will continue, he says. He says Jeremy Corbyn has been a unilateralist and in favour of getting rid of the nuclear deterrent. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Johnson seemed to get a respectful hearing from the workforce, but it was hard to detect much evidence of enthusiasm for him from what was said in the questions. Q: Why is the government withholding the dossier on Russian interference in elections when it has been cleared by the security services? Johnson says he has seen no evidence of Russian interference in British elections. He says he saw no reason to change the normal timetable for publication of these reports. Q: Don\u2019t the public have a right to know what it says? Johnson does not address this point directly, and just repeats what he said in his first answer. Q: Why do MPs think the 17.4m people who voted for Brexit did not know what they voted for? Johnson says most MPs voted remain. He says Brexit provides great opportunities. The UK can still be great friends with the EU. But it should be able to determine its future, he says. Q: Can you guarantee us that you will never sell off the NHS? Yes, says Johnson. He says what Jeremy Corbyn was saying about this last night was an invention. The NHS is a fantastic thing, he says. He says under no circumstances will it be for the sale. He says he will invest massively in it. And he can because he understands how to achieve a strong economy. He says Corbyn has produced this \u201cnonsense\u201d because they want to conceal the gap in their Brexit plan. They won\u2019t say what they want to do. He says he asked Corbyn nine times what side he would be on in the next Brexit referendum. Johnson says he did not get an answer. That is not \u201cdynamic leadership\u201d. Q: You say you believe in low taxes. Is that for people like you, or people like us? Johnson says he is talking about low taxes for the people here. He says Labour\u2019s policies would inevitably lead to higher taxes. \u201cThe problem with socialism is that you always run out of other people\u2019s money.\u201d He says he wants a high-wage, high-skills, low-tax economy. Q: Will foreign workers be hired for the new ships being built by Babcock? Johnson says Brexit will allow the UK to take control of its immigration policy. That does not mean the country will become hostile to immigrants, he says. He says he would like to have a shipbuilding renaissance in this country. He says the Type 26 frigate is an amazing ship. He wants to be able to export them to the US. In response to a question about social care, Johnson says he understands the problem. More money has been put into social care. And he will put \u201ca lot more\u201d in, he says. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: It took a long time to get trade deals with other countries. How confident are you you can get trade deals quickly. Johnson says he has a deal ready to go. (He is talking about the withdrawal agreement, but he was asked about post-Brexit trade deals \u2013 a completely different matter.) He says, after Brexit, we will be able to change our rules on animal welfare. That deal is ready to go, he says. He can put his deal in the oven \u2013 gas mark four, gas mark eight \u2013 and by January it will be pretty crispy, he says. Johnson asks his audience how enthusiastic they are about another Brexit referendum. Let\u2019s get this done, he says. Boris Johnson is opening with a version of his standard stump speech. He claims that he had to have an election because parliament was blocking Brexit. He has an oven-ready Brexit deal all ready to go. Boris Johnson is now doing a Q&amp;A with workers at an engineering company in Stockton-on-Tees. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. My colleague Rowena Mason is there. One thing to note about Nicola Sturgeon on this election campaign so far: she looks like she is really enjoying herself. She is smiley, joking with activists and media and generally more relaxed than she\u2019s appeared for a while. At her speech this morning (see 1.30pm) told reporters that she was picking up \u201centhusiasm and optimism\u201d about a second referendum from voters. Despite telling activists that everyone is \u201cheartily sick\u201d of Brexit, that attitude clearly doesn\u2019t extend to constitutional matters. She was also clear that Boris Johnson was wrong about a current deal between Labour and the SNP on a second independence referendum, although asked about her red lines for future post-election negotiations she joked that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u201cwere looking pretty pink\u201d. She added that she thought Corbyn has \u201ckind of accepted the principle\u201d of Scotland deciding its own future. In his Q&amp;A after her speech in Dundee Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, insisted that the SNP has not done a deal with Labour about supporting a minority government after the election. It is the line that party has always used, and there is no reason to believe that a private deal has been agreed. But what was striking was how, even without any pact, the SNP and Labour are starting to sound very similar in what they say about the Tories. Sturgeon said that a Tory government would strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the US that would lead to the cost of drugs rising. This is word for word what Labour says. And last night, in the ITV debate, Jeremy Corbyn used the argument that under the Tories the Brexit crisis would go on for years, because negotiating a UK-US trade deal would take most of a decade. Today Sturgeon said much the same thing. (See 12.14pm.) (Why are the SNP and Labour saying the same thing? Presumably because they both know that these attack lines are persuasive with voters.) Here are the main points from Sturgeon\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A. Sturgeon claimed that Scottish independence would not be as disruptive as Brexit. She said she understood why people were claiming that Scottish independence would be as chaotic as Brexit. But that was not true, she claimed. In her Q&amp;A she said: Much as I oppose Brexit, and I really oppose Brexit in principle, as well as for all the practical reasons I\u2019ve been talking about, there was nothing inevitable about the mess of the Brexit process. That was down to the fact that those who advocated to leave in the referendum didn\u2019t put any detail of what it would mean in practice, the trade-offs, the compromises that would be required to implement that. Sturgeon said that, unlike the Brexiters, the SNP had a detailed plan for independence when it was proposing this ahead of the 2014 referendum. She went on: We had done the planning and we will do so again. And let us not allow the charlatans who were dishonest with people over Brexit to somehow suggest that constitutional change has to be that way. It was that way and is that way with Brexit because of their dishonest and their lack of planning. These are mistakes the independence campaign did not make in 2014 and will not make in future. She said there were multiple threats to Scotland from remaining in the UK. Make no mistake, it is now crystal clear that continued Westminster control means multiple threats to Scotland \u2013 to our economy and our living standards, and to our NHS and other public services. First of all there is the direct economic threat of Brexit. Leaving the European Union will mean lower economic growth and therefore lower tax revenue to fund public services. The second threat is to the workforce. The end of freedom of movement will make it harder to attract NHS and social care staff. And it will mean fewer people working in Scotland and therefore contributing tax revenue to public services. The third threat comes from the Tory power grab on the Scottish parliament in their pursuit of their Brexit vision. They\u2019ve already used Brexit to grab powers from the Scottish parliament. With the rightwing of the Tory party in full cry, can anyone have any confidence there won\u2019t be a further power-grab attempt on Scotland\u2019s parliament as, UK-wide, they compromise on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards? She said a Tory government would strike a trade deal with the US that could lead to drug prices rising for the NHS. She said: The Tories are desperate to do a trade deal with Donald Trump. That could mean large rises in the cost of NHS drugs. And President Trump has said everything, including the NHS, is on the table. She insisted that, even if Brexit were stopped, that would not undermine the case for Scottish independence. (See 12.30pm.) She backed claims that in practice Labour would have to agree to holding a second Scottish independence referendum in 2020, regardless of what Corbyn says now. (See 12.34pm.) She said that the SNP was the only party that could take seats from the Conservatives in Scotland. (See 12.19pm.) Boris Johnson has said that flood-hit families and businesses will eligible for government grants worth up to \u00a35,000 for new resilience measures. He made the pledge in a Yorkshire Post article. Here\u2019s an excerpt. We must do everything possible to protect against future flooding and speed up the recovery time. So I can announce today that flood-hit homes and businesses will be eligible for government grants of up to \u00a35,000 for new resilience measures. This money will help people with the cost of installing precautions like flood doors or raised electrical systems. Steps of this kind will reduce any damage that could be caused by future floods and accelerate any clean-ups, enabling people to return to their homes more quickly. Sturgeon says it was no inevitable that Brexit had to be this chaotic. She says, if Scotland were to vote for independence, the process of separating from England would not have to be like Brexit. Q: Boris Johnson said last night Labour had already done a deal with the SNP on independence. Jeremy Corbyn said that was not true. But this morning Humza Yousef said in practice Labour would allow an early second referendum. (See 10.54am.) Sturgeon says she is surprised anyone believes anything Johnson says. She says there has been no deal with Labour. But she says she agrees with what Yousef said this morning. Jeremy Corbyn favours self-determination \u201cfor virtually every other country on the planet\u201d, she says. She says she would expect Scotland\u2019s desire for a second referendum to be granted. Nicola Sturgeon is now taking questions. Q: If you manage to stop Brexit, won\u2019t that take away your justification for a second independence referendum? No, says Sturgeon. She says Brexit illustrates why Scotland should be in charge of its own future. But it is only one example. If Brexit is stopped, there is no guarantee it won\u2019t return as a prospect. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is not just going to give up, she says. A Tory candidate who claimed British Jews who visited Israel returned \u201cbrainwashed\u201d has been suspended from the party, the Press Association reports. The PA story goes on: Amjad Bashir, who is standing for election in the Leeds North East constituency, apologised this week for the comments and said he intends to meet local Jewish groups and travel to Israel \u201cto gain direct experience from the situation on the ground there\u201d. A Conservative spokesman said: \u201cMr Bashir has been suspended from the party pending investigation and election support has been withdrawn.\u201d A pro-Brexit restaurateur, Bashir was elected as a Ukip MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber in 2014 before he defected to the Conservatives in 2015. Sturgeon says continued Westminster control poses multiple threats to Scotland. She says she will give three examples. First, Brexit could harm the Scottish economy. Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would cost the Scottish economy \u00a39bn by the end of the decade, she says. Second, Brexit would lead to the Scottish workforce shrinking, she says. There would be particular problems in the care sector. She says the Tories are \u201cdeliberately and shamefully\u201d giving the impression that EU workers are a burden, not a resource. That is shameful, she says. Third, the Tories would reduce Scotland\u2019s powers, she says She says they have already used Brexit to take powers from the Scottish parliament, legislating for the first time in this area without the approval of the Scottish parliament. She says the Tories are desperate to do a trade deal with the US. That could lead to large prices in NHS drugs. And the Tories would over-ride Scottish wishes if Scotland tried to get in the way of that trade deal. Sturgeon says Labour cannot win in Scotland. In all the 13 Scottish seats the Tories hold, the SNP are the challengers, she says. Strugeon turns to the Lib Dems. She says there now seem to be more Tories in the Lib Dems than there are Lib Dems. She says one of the Tory defectors to the Lib Dems (she is referring to Sam Gyimah) described free university tuition as a fantasy. But it is not a fantasy in Scotland, she says. Nicola Sturgeon is giving her speech in Dundee. The Scottish first minister says today feels like the morning after the night before. Yesterday Scotland was talked about in the leaders\u2019 debate,but not represented. Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn showed they are not fit to be prime minister, she says. She says this election really matters because \u201cthe future of Scotland is on the line\u201d. She says she thinks everyone in Scotland is \u201cheartily sick\u201d of Brexit. But this would just be the warm-up act, she says. The trade talks would have to start. And, with Nigel Farage pulling Boris Johnson\u2019s strings, there is a chance of a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition period. Sturgeon also said post-Brexit trade talks could take \u201cyears and years and years\u201d. The truth is Westminster is going to be engulfed in Brexit chaos for years to come, with long-term damage to Scotland guaranteed. The full tables from the YouGov poll last night on the ITV leaders\u2019 debate are now available on its website here (pdf). Laurence Janta-Lipinksi, a polling specialist, thinks the raw data reflect well on Jeremy Corbyn. I\u2019ve corrected the post at 9.54am because it contained a significant typo. Dawn Butler criticised Boris Johnson for saying in the debate last night that the monarchy was beyond reproach, not for saying that the monarch was beyond reproach. Johnson was commenting on the royal family generally, not the Queen as an individual. Sorry for the error. You can read all the Guardian\u2019s coverage of last night\u2019s election debate on our election page here. And here is a roundup of what journalists and commentators were saying about it on Twitter last night. From Patrick Maguire\u2019s Morning Call email briefing for the New Statesman Call it a score draw? Well, it depends. Given Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s less than stellar personal ratings, that the viewing public and this morning\u2019s serious papers concluded there was little in it will have heartened the Labour leadership. And given that Boris Johnson sold himself to Conservative MPs and members as the only candidate able to defeat Corbyn for good, his failure to do so on a debate stage he had no real incentive to be on will have set alarm bells ringing in some Tory quarters - albeit quietly. Strikingly, nearly half of 2017 Conservative voters surveyed by YouGov last night thought the Labour leader performed well. But look beyond what the numbers say about who won or lost last night and the real question is whether either succeeded in changing the electoral game altogether ... For all the audible contempt for Johnson among the studio audience \u2013 several of his answers, just like Corbyn\u2019s, were met with derisive laughter \u2013 the Conservatives will still be broadly happy with their lot. They know they are more or less the only game in town for leave voters and most Scots unionists and Corbyn was unwilling to respond in kind. From Michael Deacon in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) In all honesty, the most memorable answers were for the most inane question. Right at the end, a young man in the audience asked Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn what present they would give each other for Christmas. Mr Corbyn said he would give the prime minister a copy of A Christmas Carol by Dickens: \u201cSo you can see how nasty Scrooge was.\u201d Mr Johnson said that he would give Mr Corbyn \u201ca good read\u201d too: \u201ca copy of my brilliant Brexit deal\u201d. If that seems vapid and inane, it was at least in keeping with the rest of the broadcast \u2013 because, although it was meant to be the first big debate of this election campaign, it didn\u2019t really feel like a debate at all. It simply never got going. In fact, it wasn\u2019t allowed to. Throughout, the moderator, Julie Etchingham, kept butting in to cut the two leaders short (\u201cThank you, Mr Johnson! Thank you, Mr Corbyn!\u201d), and so they rarely if ever got beyond the soundbites they\u2019d come armed with. In the end, it felt like little more than a rushed, bullet-point digest of both sides\u2019 slogans. From Paul Goodman at ConservativeHome In football terms, Johnson played a high press and Corbyn relied on counter-attack. Neither scored. Which takes us back to our start. The Labour leader didn\u2019t win the debate. So he had no victory with which to cut through to voters. And so the prime minister doesn\u2019t have any ground to make up in the further TV debates \u2013 or elsewhere. That suits him fine. From Quentin Letts in the Times (paywall) One of the most striking things was the audience laughter. You normally expect the two teams\u2019 supporters to clap like maniacs but last night they deployed forced, supportive, mocking, occasionally genuinely disbelieving laughter as a weapon of attrition. \u201cDoes the truth matter? Of course,\u201d Mr Johnson said. A roar of ironic mirth from the Corbyn supporters in the crowd. The same thing happened in reverse when Mr Corbyn, after struggling to explain his Brexit position, said: \u201cI\u2019ve made the position clear.\u201d A great belch of merriment from the audience. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby Plaid Cymru is today calling for the creation of a new tax credit for people who pay more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities. This is from Ben Lake, who is seeking re-election as MP for Ceredigion. Everyone in Wales should have safe, stable and suitable housing but that\u2019s fast becoming the privilege of fewer people every year. Renters in Wales have a bad deal: 37% of private renters in Wales earn less than \u00a315,000, and almost half of private households in Wales spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. This leaves over 100,000 households with very little to spend on basic living expenses like food, heating or transport. Plaid Cymru will help those people by creating a new tax credit of up to \u00a325 a week to households paying over 30% of their income on private rent and utilities, providing people with much needed relief and flexibility to spend on other vital needs like food, heating and transport. Labour says Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that it would allow a second Scottish independence referendum in 2020, in addition to the second Brexit referendum that it is planning for next year, is not true. But on the Today programme this morning the SNP MSP Humza Yousaf said he thought in practice a Labour government would agree to hold one. He said: We\u2019ve been very clear it\u2019s not for Jeremy Corbyn, neither Boris Johnson, it is for the Scottish people and the Scottish parliament to decide when there should be another independence referendum, and we want to hold one in 2020, as the first minister has said. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position on this has shifted a number of times already in what is a relatively short campaign. I suspect what he says now will not necessarily be what he says when he needs the keys to No 10. In their manifesto, which will be launched this afternoon, the Liberal Democrats will call for the introduction of safe standing areas in all-seater football stadia. Layla Moran, the party\u2019s culture spokeswoman, said: Football matches in this country should not be subject to the bureaucracy of executives and ministers who are stuck in the past, and don\u2019t understand the game. People want to see safe standing in their stadiums, they want the knock-on effect of a reduction in ticket prices, and they want to be free to enjoy the sport they love without restrictive red tape. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said it is \u201csickening\u201d to hear Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, say last night that she would be willing to use a nuclear weapon. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand, who is on the Tory battlebus Some readers have been asking below the line why the page on the YouGov website with the results of its poll on the leaders\u2019 debate has a 6.50pm timestamp, which was more than an hour before the debate even started. A YouGov spokesman has called with (as I expected) an innocent explanation. He said that, knowing it would have to turn around the poll results quickly, YouGov launched the web page in advance of the debate. The article originally said something about how the poll results would be published on that page after the debate ended. Later the article was updated with the poll findings. But the timestamp still reflected the original publication time. Almost 7 million people watched the ITV leaders\u2019 debate last night, according to ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen. A subsequent ITV programme, featuring interviews with four leaders of the smaller parties, was watched by more than 2 million people. The Electoral Commission has released a statement saying that it cannot intervene in the Conservative party bogus Twitter handle row because it does not have a role in regulating what parties say during election campaigns. A spokesman for the commission said: Voters are entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners in the lead-up to an election, so they have the information they need to decide for themselves how to vote. The Electoral Commission seeks to deliver transparency to the public through the political finance rules. While we do not have a role in regulating election campaign content, we repeat our call to all campaigners to undertake their vital role responsibly and to support campaigning transparency. In her Today interview Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, also criticised Boris Johnson for saying the monarchy was \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d in last night\u2019s ITV debate. She said: I think most people would think that there is always room for improvement, and I think that Boris\u2019s response in regards to the royal family being beyond reproach was just flabbergasting with everything that is currently being exposed in regards to Prince Andrew and the scandal and the paedophile. To actually not talk about the victims, which Jeremy did right straight away and saying that we should be focusing on the victims, but then to say that the royal family is beyond reproach is unforgivable. It just stinks of this kind of, the law doesn\u2019t apply to a certain group of people in society. And I just think it\u2019s horrendous. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has given a series of interviews this morning, and the election questions mostly focused on the row about the Conservatives\u2019 abuse of their Twitter account. Here are the main points he has been making. Raab refused to apologise for the Conservative party\u2019s decision to rename one of their Twitter accounts \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d during the debate. He rejected claims that people had been misled by the bogus Twitter handle. (See 7.46am.) He refused to say whether or not the party would do the same thing again. But he implied it was unlikely. He told the Today programme: We will always abide by the rules with these things and, if there is advice that comes out, look at it very carefully. He said it was right for the Tories to respond to the \u201clies\u201d told about them. He said: We make no apologies for having an instant rebuttal for all the nonsense and lies put out. And Jeremy Corbyn repeated it last night, saying we want to sell off the NHS. He claimed that Boris Johnson was the clear winner of the debate, because the snap YouGov poll afterwards showed him well ahead of Jeremy Corbyn on who came out the most prime ministerial. Raab said: Overall, on the exam question in this election campaign, \u2018who do you want as your prime minister, or who do you think is more suited to be prime minster?\u2019 [Johnson] won by two to one. And that\u2019s what matters. But on other metrics Corbyn won. The detailed figures are here. Raab criticised Corbyn for failing nine times in the debate last night to say whether or not he would back remain or leave in the second Brexit referendum that Labour plans to hold. This is from Peter Kellner, the former president of YouGov, the polling organisation. Both sets of findings from the YouGov snap poll after the debate were covered on our live blog last night. More people thought Boris Johnson won than Jeremy Corbyn won, but more people thought Corbyn performed well than Johnson performed well. That sounds like a contradiction, but it isn\u2019t necessarily. In sport, the winning team isn\u2019t always the one that plays best. Here is Caroline Lucas, who is campaigning for re-election as a Green party MP, on the Tories\u2019 abuse of Twitter last night. Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Twitter had not done enough to punish the Conservative party for using one of its accounts to mislead people during last night\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate. The party rebranded its own press account as \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d, implying that it was providing an impartial, factchecking service. Twitter has effectively just issued the Tories with a warning, saying \u201ccorrective action\u201d will be taken if they do this again. Asked whether this was enough, Butler told Today: No, it\u2019s not enough. We\u2019ve been talking about the responsibilities of the social media platforms for quite a while. And they have to do better. And I think this is another example where social media has failed, and it\u2019s terrible. Asked what else Twitter should have done, she said it would have been better if the account had been taken down during the debate last night. She said: I think they had options. They could have either renamed the account, and put back the original branding, because in order to try and deceive the public the Conservative party changed everything ... They could have just suspended the account and taken it down. To me, that would have been the better punishment. And the other thing is, remove the blue tick [Twitter\u2019s account verification mechanism], because you cannot have a blue tick if you are trying to impersonate a legitimate account. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Damien Gayle. There are only two biggish events in the diary for the day. 12pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, gives a speech in Dundee on the \u2018Tory threat\u2019 to Scotland\u2019s services. 5pm: The Liberal Democrats launch their manifesto. There are also various, more low-level campaign events taking place, including Boris Johnson campaigning on the Tory battlebus. The Liberal Democrats promise an emergency \u00a34.6bn cash injection into schools, Layla Moran, the party\u2019s education spokeswoman, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning. The initial sum would increase to more than \u00a310bn by 2024-25, if the Lib Dems formed the next government, Moran said. It would be funded from the \u00a315bn that the party says it can conjure up as a \u201cremain bonus\u201d from halting Brexit. Moran\u2019s education pledges went beyond the purely financial. She continued: Also, we would value our teachers more. We would end the punitive, high-stakes testing regime that we have in schools. We would replace Ofsted with an inspectorate that has wellbeing at the core of what it does. Her comments will be welcomed by many in the profession. Ofsted, Moran said, has been responsible for \u201cnarrowing the curriculum [and] a focus on data\u201d. After their involvement in the coalition government and the tripling of fees for university students, the Liberal Democrats do not have a good reputation when it comes to education pledges. The party had promised during the 2010 election not to increase fees. Moran was not challenged on the record. She pledged that the party would \u201creview student finance and bring back maintenance grants\u201d. In case you missed it, the Guardian\u2019s media editor, Jim Waterson, reported on the factcheck controversy last night, including criticism from the established factchecking organisation Full Fact. As Waterson reported, Full Fact, which is run by a charity, said it had complained to Twitter and said the account should not be allowed to be used in this way while verified. \u201cIt is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their Twitter account \u2018factcheckUK\u2019 during this debate. Please do not mistake it for an independent factchecking service.\u201d Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has defended the Tory factcheck stunt on Twitter last night, even in the face of Twitter\u2019s stern criticism. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Raab said it was \u201cvery clear\u201d that the account was affiliated with Conservative campaign headquarters. \u201cWe have had all sorts of nonsense thrown at the Conservatives. We are going to be in the process of having a really good instant rebuttal,\u201d he said. Raab brushed aside criticism from established factcheckers. \u201cWho said Full Fact is the final arbiter of what the public need to see?\u201d he said. Asked about Twitter\u2019s statement accusing the Tories of misleading the public, Raab added: I don\u2019t agree. As I said to you before it was pegged to the Conservative campaign HQ account. Anyone who looked at it for more than a split second would not have been fooled. Twitter has released a statement saying the Conservative party has misled the public by styling its press office account as a factchecking operation during the televised leaders debate, the BBC has reported. In an almost unprecedented political intervention by the social network, Twitter said it would take \u201cdecisive corrective action\u201d if a similar stunt was attempted again. During Tuesday night\u2019s leadership debate on ITV, the @CCHQPress account was renamed \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d. Although the handle remained the same, as my colleague Jim Waterson reported, all other branding was changed to resemble an independent factchecking outlet. It may not have been immediately apparent to an individual who saw the account\u2019s tweets in their feed that it was a product of Conservative party HQ. Twitter\u2019s statement, carried by the BBC, said: Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election. We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information \u2013 in a manner seen during the UK election debate \u2013 will result in decisive corrective action. No one really landed any telling blows, with the whole show descending into second-rate light entertainment. Even Prince Andrew could probably have made a better fist of answering the questions. Despite talking over Corbyn and Etchingham at every opportunity \u2013 his ego can\u2019t allow the possibility of conversation \u2013 Johnson reverted to bluster and lies while trying to steer everything back to his Brexit deal that he had rejected 18 months previously. Corbyn couldn\u2019t even take advantage of the most open of goals. One questioner asked about personal trust. Here was the Labour leader\u2019s chance to ask Boris how many children he had, his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri and his broken promises to family and country. It would have been a slam-dunk moment that could have maybe changed the momentum of the election. But Corbyn blew it. The first half ended with an insincere handshake. The rest was something of a non-event. Corbyn scored well on the NHS with a redacted document but the audience was so dispirited that the debate ended in a Blind Date chat. Corbyn would give Boris A Christmas Carol for Christmas: Johnson would give Corbyn some damson jam. No voters\u2019 minds would be changed. The only winner was Etchingham who somehow held the shitshow together. Yet despite all this, the debate had revealed something. That voters hold both leaders in open contempt and are in despair that one of them will end up as prime minister. Given the chance to show off their best selves, Johnson and Corbyn had merely proved they didn\u2019t have one. The country was even more screwed than anyone had previously imagined. Top billing on most of the front pages is given to the election leaders\u2019 debate with some focusing on the snap YouGov poll that declared Boris Johnson won the night 51%-49%. Others highlighted the leaders\u2019 answers, or lack of them. As for what the parties will be wanting to talk about today: Labour will promise to eliminate what it calls the \u201c10 modern scourges of poverty\u201d, from soaring food bank use to childhood deprivation, in its latest attack on the Conservatives\u2019 record in government. Among its policies are increasing the minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour and extending it to under-25s; reforming universal credit; and scrapping restrictive rules including the two-child limit and the benefits cap. The Lib Dems will launch their manifesto in London and announce a plan to extend the scope of free school meals; increase schools spending by more than \u00a310bn a year within the next parliament; and recruit 20,000 more teachers. The Tories have announced a package of policies for victims of crime, which includes allowing victims and the media to apply to attend parole hearings and a 25% increase in the victims surcharge \u2013 a fine on offenders that goes towards refuges and community support for victims of domestic and sexual abuse. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s politics news. It is the day after the night before and if you missed the debate we have a lot of material to catch you up. Start here with our wrap of what happened. Rowena Mason offers her analysis including the leaders\u2019 best lines, worst moments and overall pitch. Our panel has given its verdict on how Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn fared. We\u2019ve fact-checked the leaders\u2019 claims, and there is news about the Conservative press office changing its Twitter name to make it look like a factchecking service for the duration of the debate. Leaders of minor parties have shared their views on what went down on ITV, as have readers, who have delivered their mostly unflattering verdicts. Dan Sabbagh writes that Corbyn outperformed expectations, Andrew Sparrow gives his take, and John Crace has written a devastating sketch, which closes with the observation that \u201cgiven the chance to show off their best selves, Johnson and Corbyn had merely proved they didn\u2019t have one\u201d. As usual, you can reach me on Twitter here. I\u2019ll be looking after the blog for the first hour or so.",

      "bodyText": "The plan, it appeared, was fairly straightforward: get Prince Andrew in front of a camera and put a stop to speculation about the nature of his connections to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. So, how did it go from that to the Queen feeling she had no choice but to take the barely conceivable step of allowing one of her sons to step back from public duties altogether \u2013 in less than five days? The Duke of York\u2019s strategy had taken a hit even before he had sat down opposite the BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis. Andrew had already lost the services of Jason Stein, the spin doctor hired in September to restore his reputation. Stein had reportedly advised Andrew against the whole thing, preferring a longer-term strategy that included a great deal of charity work and interviews with print outlets to mark his birthday. The unravelling of the strategy began almost immediately after the interview ended. Andrew appeared pleased with his performance, even giving the Newsnight team a tour of the palace afterwards. But when lines from the interview began reaching journalists\u2019 inboxes early on Friday evening, they were astonished by what they read. By Saturday morning, the story was dominating the news agenda. The headlines were devastating for Andrew. And the interview had not yet even been aired. The early press reports focused on his claim that his decision to maintain close relations with Epstein despite the financier\u2019s conviction for sexual offences was motivated primarily by the prince\u2019s \u201ctendency to be too honourable\u201d. Kept back by the BBC was the prince\u2019s claim that he could not have had sex with Virginia Giuffre, which she says she was coerced into doing while a teenager, because he was at home after a visit to Pizza Express in Woking. Nor was his contention that her description of his dancing with her beforehand could not be true because he was unable to sweat at the time. Those revelations, when they came out, were met with incredulity and were shared widely online, adding fresh impetus to the story. By Sunday evening, Andrew was facing calls to speak to the FBI from lawyers representing 10 of the Epstein\u2019s victims. While some of the attention was focused on Andrew\u2019s extraordinary defence, there was strong criticism of his attitude towards the victims and the fact that he had not expressed sympathy for them in the interview. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, said she could not understand \u201chow somebody could be talking about their relationship with [Epstein] without recognising, or understanding, or discussing, how he felt about those victims. And I felt they should have been much more at the centre of that discussion.\u201d The backlash continued into this week as numerous organisations began to cut ties with the prince. On Monday, it emerged that the accountancy giant KPMG would not be renewing its sponsorship of Andrew\u2019s entrepreneurial scheme, Pitch@Palace. That night a fresh Epstein accuser gave a press conference in Los Angeles where she detailed allegations that the financier assaulted her when she was 15 and urged Andrew to come forward to the authorities with whatever information he had about his former friend. On Tuesday, Standard Chartered also pulled out of Pitch@Palace as questions about Andrew\u2019s continued involvement in the scheme he founded in 2014 continued to circulate. They prompted a whole host of other firms to review their involvement or cut ties altogether. Wednesday morning brought no respite, as it emerged that three Australian universities had severed their links with the business-mentoring charity\u2019s Australian branch.

Were the president elected to a second term, it wouldn\u2019t surprise De Niro if Trump started a war to keep himself in office for a third term, he said in an interview with the Daily Beast this week.</p> \n<p>The harsh words for the president are nothing new from the actor: he\u2019s been one of the more outspoken anti-Trump critics since the 2016 campaign began. Here are some of his sharpest rebukes.</p> \n<h2>\u2018He\u2019s totally nuts\u2019</h2> \n<p>A few months before the election in 2016, De Niro joined a chorus of celebrities pointing to the absurdity of Trump\u2019s campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat he\u2019s been saying is really totally crazy, ridiculous \u2026 he is totally nuts,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/13/robert-de-niro-donald-trump-is-totally-nuts\">he told an audience</a> in Sarajevo marking the 40th anniversary of his film Taxi Driver.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s crazy that people like Donald Trump. He shouldn\u2019t even be where he is, so God help us.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018Blatantly stupid\u2019</h2> \n<p>As part of a campaign urging people to vote in the 2016 election, De Niro made what would prove to be some of his most withering comments about Trump in September of that year. \u201cHe\u2019s so blatantly stupid. He\u2019s a punk. He\u2019s a dog. He\u2019s a pig. A con. A bullshit artist. A mutt who doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d he said, among many other things, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/08/robert-de-niro-id-like-to-punch-donald-trump-in-the-face-video\">in a video</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face,\u201d he added.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Horrified\u2019</h2> \n<p>After Trump\u2019s victory, De Niro adopted a more sober tone.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s president now \u2026 half the country is horrified, many parts of the world are, and we\u2019re gonna see how he does. That\u2019s it. I give the benefit of the doubt that\u2019s he going to try his best to do the right thing,\u201d he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/nov/11/robert-de-niro-reacts-to-trump-presidential-victory-video\">in an interview</a>.</p> \n<p>His openness to the administration would not last long.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Enemy of the arts\u2019</h2> \n<p>In May of 2017, De Niro took aim at Trump\u2019s immigration policies, telling a crowd at a benefit in New York that they would prevent future artists and immigrants such as Charlie Chaplin, being honored that night, from entering the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe administration\u2019s mean-spiritedness towards our art and entertainment is an expression of their mean-spirited attitude about people who want that art and entertainment, people who also want and deserve decent wages, a fair tax system, a safe environment, education for their children and healthcare for all,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Tragic, dumbass comedy\u2019</h2> \n<p>In a speech at the Brown University commencement, also in May of that year, De Niro contrasted the America of the past with the Trump era.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you started school, the country was an inspiring, uplifting drama,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are graduating into a tragic, dumbass comedy. My advice is to lock the [university\u2019s] Van Wickle gates and stay here.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018Fuck Trump\u2019</h2> \n<p>In June of 2018, De Niro earned a standing ovation at the Tony awards for cursing out the president. \u201cI\u2019m gonna say one thing.

I mean, the way I understand it, they laughed at Hitler. They all look funny. Hitler looked funny, Mussolini looked funny and other dictators and despots look funny.\u201d</p> \n<p>He also compared him, unfavorably, to mob bosses, after Trump had recently called his own longtime lawyer Michael Cohen a \u201crat\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI mean, a mob boss calls people \u2018a rat\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Robert De Niro has a dire prediction about the presidency of Donald Trump. Were the president elected to a second term, it wouldn\u2019t surprise De Niro if Trump started a war to keep himself in office for a third term, he said in an interview with the Daily Beast this week. The harsh words for the president are nothing new from the actor: he\u2019s been one of the more outspoken anti-Trump critics since the 2016 campaign began. Here are some of his sharpest rebukes. \u2018He\u2019s totally nuts\u2019 A few months before the election in 2016, De Niro joined a chorus of celebrities pointing to the absurdity of Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cWhat he\u2019s been saying is really totally crazy, ridiculous \u2026 he is totally nuts,\u201d he told an audience in Sarajevo marking the 40th anniversary of his film Taxi Driver. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s crazy that people like Donald Trump. He shouldn\u2019t even be where he is, so God help us.\u201d \u2018Blatantly stupid\u2019 As part of a campaign urging people to vote in the 2016 election, De Niro made what would prove to be some of his most withering comments about Trump in September of that year. \u201cHe\u2019s so blatantly stupid. He\u2019s a punk. He\u2019s a dog. He\u2019s a pig. A con. A bullshit artist. A mutt who doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d he said, among many other things, in a video. \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face,\u201d he added. \u2018Horrified\u2019 After Trump\u2019s victory, De Niro adopted a more sober tone. \u201cHe\u2019s president now \u2026 half the country is horrified, many parts of the world are, and we\u2019re gonna see how he does. That\u2019s it. I give the benefit of the doubt that\u2019s he going to try his best to do the right thing,\u201d he said in an interview. His openness to the administration would not last long. \u2018Enemy of the arts\u2019 In May of 2017, De Niro took aim at Trump\u2019s immigration policies, telling a crowd at a benefit in New York that they would prevent future artists and immigrants such as Charlie Chaplin, being honored that night, from entering the country. \u201cThe administration\u2019s mean-spiritedness towards our art and entertainment is an expression of their mean-spirited attitude about people who want that art and entertainment, people who also want and deserve decent wages, a fair tax system, a safe environment, education for their children and healthcare for all,\u201d he said. \u2018Tragic, dumbass comedy\u2019 In a speech at the Brown University commencement, also in May of that year, De Niro contrasted the America of the past with the Trump era. \u201cWhen you started school, the country was an inspiring, uplifting drama,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are graduating into a tragic, dumbass comedy. My advice is to lock the [university\u2019s] Van Wickle gates and stay here.\u201d \u2018Fuck Trump\u2019 In June of 2018, De Niro earned a standing ovation at the Tony awards for cursing out the president. \u201cI\u2019m gonna say one thing. Fuck Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer down with Trump. It\u2019s fuck Trump,\u201d he said as the crowd rose to their feet. Trump interlude: DeNiro is \u2018brain-damaged\u2019 The president responded not long after on Twitter, suggesting De Niro was brain-damaged. \u201cRobert De Niro, a very Low IQ individual, has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI watched him last night and truly believe he may be \u2018punch-drunk\u2019.\u201d \u2018A real racist\u2019 Speaking to the Guardian in January of this year, De Niro said he was wrong to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, and that it was clear that he was a \u201creal racist\u201d and a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d. He also compared him to some of history\u2019s worst fascists. \u201cIf he had his way, we\u2019d wind up in a very bad state in this country. I mean, the way I understand it, they laughed at Hitler. They all look funny. Hitler looked funny, Mussolini looked funny and other dictators and despots look funny.\u201d He also compared him, unfavorably, to mob bosses, after Trump had recently called his own longtime lawyer Michael Cohen a \u201crat\u201d. \u201cI mean, a mob boss calls people \u2018a rat\u2019. That means you lied and somebody snitched on you, so you did commit the crime. So that\u2019s interesting, and he makes mobsters look bad because there are mobsters who will shake your hand and keep their word. He can\u2019t even do that.\u201d Wannabe A few months later De Niro touched on the mafia comparisons again, calling Trump a \u201cwannabe gangster\u201d and \u201ctotal loser\u201d on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. He reiterated that Trump had less honor than a common criminal. \u201cEven gangsters have morals and they have ethics. They have a code, and you know when you give somebody your word, it\u2019s your word, because it\u2019s all you have is your word. This guy, he doesn\u2019t even know what that means.\u201d \u2018He should not be president\u2019 In September of this year, De Niro was characteristically blunt in speaking about Trump, saying that he \u201cshould not be president, period\u201d. \u201cWe are in a moment in our lives, in this country, where this guy is like a gangster,\u201d he said. \u201cWe say over and over again: \u2018This is terrible, we\u2019re in a terrible situation, we\u2019re in a terrible situation,\u2019 and this guy just keeps going on and on and on without being stopped.\u201d \u2018Obvious gangsterism\u2019 This October, he once again returned to the gangster motif, telling the Guardian that Trump is a \u201cgangster president\u201d. \u201cOh, I can\u2019t wait to see him in jail. I don\u2019t want him to die, I want him to go to jail.\u201d \u2018President for life\u2019 \u201cHe\u2019s going to be history at one point, though he\u2019d love to be president for life,\u201d De Niro told the Daily Beast this week. \u201cHe jokes about it. I think that if he became president for a second term he\u2019d try to have a third term, and let smarter people manipulate it into getting us into some kind of altercation: a war.\u201d \u201cTrump joked about being \u2018president for life\u2019 with [Chinese president Xi Jinping] and so on.

      "bodyText": "Doctors who saw but did not report babies and mothers receiving poor care during the NHS\u2019s worst maternity scandal could be suspended or struck off, the General Medical Council has warned. The medical profession\u2019s regulator has asked NHS bosses for details of any doctor they believe may have ignored their professional duty to raise the alarm about threats to patient safety at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS hospital trust (SaTH). The GMC has raised the spectre of doctors being disciplined after it emerged on Monday that a government-ordered independent investigation found that at least 42 babies and three mothers died at the trust in cases linked to poor care between 1979 and 2017. An inquiry by maternity expert Donna Ockenden uncovered an array of failings that had damaging and in some cases tragic consequences for women giving birth at the trust and their babies, which included staff not realising a woman was in labour, not monitoring a baby\u2019s heartbeat properly and failing to give bereaved parents full information about what had happened. Anthony Omo, the GMC\u2019s general counsel and director of fitness to practice, said: \u201cThe reports in the media and press this week are shocking and our thoughts are with the families affected. \u201cWe are in contact with the trust and have asked NHS England and NHS Improvement for details of any concerns about individual doctors. Where we receive details of any such concerns we will take appropriate action to protect patients and public confidence in doctors.\u201d In a reminder to medics about disclosing concerns they have about about poor care or harm to patients, Omo added: \u201cAll doctors have a responsibility to take action if they are aware that patient safety may be at risk.\u201d Meanwhile, the body representing Britain\u2019s 8,000 doctors specialising in childbirth has hit out at the trust for delaying publication of its inquiry into maternity care. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has criticised SaTH for taking seven months to put into the public domain the report it had asked the college to draw up. It held off sharing the RCOG\u2019s findings despite longstanding public concern about babies having died or suffering terrible injuries, including brain damage. In a statement the college said: \u201cThe RCOG regrets that the trust did not accept its initial report and waited six months to publish it alongside the addendum.\u201d The RCOG passed its report into the trust\u2019s maternity and neonatal unit to SaTH in December 2017, five months after being asked to produce it. However, SaTH did not publish it until July 2018, after receiving a second report the trust had also requested from the college, which detailed the progress it had made towards implementing the 37 recommendations RCOG experts had included in their original findings. The college believes the trust should have published the report soon after receiving it and the seven-month delay shows it was not transparent about events at its hospitals in Shrewsbury and Telford. The statement follows Ockenden\u2019s investigation finding that the college\u2019s original report was inadequate. The RCOG has responded to that by pledging to share all future \u201cinvited reviews\u201d it undertakes at the request of an NHS trust with the Care Quality Commission, which regulates healthcare in England. Such reviews are usually only given to the trust which commissioned it. However, sources at the trust dismissed the RCOG\u2019s criticism as \u201ca shift in their position\u201d and maintained that the college went along with its decision at the time not to publish immediately. In a separate development, the Royal College of Midwives responded on Tuesday to the leaked findings of Ockenden\u2019s inquiry but did not comment on the countless failings by maternity staff, including midwives, that were identified. Its statement said: \u201cThe RCM is committed to improving safety within our maternity services and when the full review\u2019s findings are published there will be important lessons to be learned by the NHS and by maternity services across the UK.\u201d It will respond to the failings in clinical care when Ockenden\u2019s final report is published, which is expected to be next year. Clea Harmer, the chief executive of Sands, the stillbirth and neonatal death charity, said Ockenden\u2019s findings were \u201ctruly shocking\u201d. \u201cAs a charity founded by and for bereaved parents it is very sad to hear that bereaved families were treated with \u2018a distinct lack of kindness and respect\u2019 by healthcare professionals\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 21 November. Top stories Westpac could be facing a billion-dollar lawsuit after being accused of 23m breaches of financial law, including failure to monitor customers potentially involved in child sex trafficking. The bank failed to file reports relating to more than $11bn worth of transactions, as it is required to do under anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws, leaving CEO Brian Hartzer \u201cdisgusted and appalled\u201d. The Westpac boss has accepted the allegations made by the financial monitoring agency, Austrac, \u201calmost overwhelmingly\u201d, suggesting the bank may look to settle the lawsuit. The breaches carry a theoretical fine of between $391tn and $483tn, but punishment is likely to be in the billions, given a similar case involving Commonwealth Bank last year. A star witness in the Trump impeachment inquiry has delivered bombshell testimony, asserting the existence of a quid pro quo deal with Ukraine, claiming he was ordered by the president to work closely with lawyer Rudy Giuliani, against his will, to extract a deal. Gordon Sondland, a former Trump ally, and the US ambassador to the EU, made the allegations in a sensational opening statement that could devastate the lines of defence previously constructed by House Republicans, and increase scrutiny over former New York mayor Giuliani\u2019s role in the affair. Australia is set for a diplomatic stoush with nations including the UK over meeting its Paris climate agreement targets, with the Morrison government telling business groups it intends to find a diplomatic solution that will enable it to use carryover credits from the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocols against its 2030 commitments. Australia will need to cut emissions by 695m tonnes cumulatively across the next decade, but is seeking to account for 367m tonnes through \u201cbeating\u201d previous targets \u2013 something that will need to be agreed upon at forthcoming climate talks in Madrid. Australia Coalition MP Llew O\u2019Brien has warned he may cross the floor in an upcoming vote, unless the attorney general comes up with federal integrity commission legislation \u201cwith teeth\u201d. \u201cWe need confidence in our government. And we need the perception to be \u2013 as well as the reality \u2013 that we are doing the right thing,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. The archetypal Australian jihadist is not mentally ill, does not come from a refugee background, and more likely not from an Islamic school, new research from the Lowy Institute has suggested, with a desire for personal status perhaps the key motivator. Energy retailers have warned ministers that new regulations could see costs passed on to consumers if a rule change carrying potential $100,000 fines on retailers offering \u201cdodgy discounts\u201d is included in a new reliability standard. Two Australian billionaires are teaming up to build a massive solar farm in the Northern Territory, with the plan to supply one-fifth of Singapore\u2019s electricity. The $20bn-plus development would include a 10-gigawatt-capacity array and be completed by 2027. The world Prince Andrew has announced he will step back from public duties \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d, following an intensification of criticism over his relationship with convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Former Nobel Peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi will represent Myanmar at The Hague, with the nation facing allegations of genocide which the political leader says there is not enough evidence to support. Maltese police have arrested a prominent businessman in connection with the 2017 murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Her family have urged police to continue investigating links between the businessman and key politicians. A groundbreaking trial in the United States has seen doctors put a human into suspended animation, rapidly cooling the patient to enable surgeons vital minutes, potentially an hour, to conduct live-saving operations. Recommended reads Set in 1992, On Becoming a God in Central Florida grapples with the fallacy of the American dream via pyramid schemes. With lead actress Kirsten Dunst starting filming five months after the birth of her son, the exhaustion and anxiety of \u201ckeeping up\u201d was very real, writes Bridie Jabour. But after a career in which she\u2019s never quite cracked the big awards, will this be Dunst\u2019s ticket to long-overdue recognition? How do you drive innovation without exacerbating inequality? That\u2019s the question Labor shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh and economist Joshua Gans ask in a new book. But as Greg Jericho writes, the catch is: the future is very hard to predict. Who would have thought computers would get so affordable, or even motor vehicles? And how will technology affect employment rates and thus household incomes? It may be that in unforeseeable times, the role government plays becomes crucial. Listen By 2045 the Welsh village of Fairbourne will have to be dismantled due to rising sea waters. On this episode of Today in Focus, Rachel Humphreys chats to Anushka Asthana about the operation involved in moving an entire village, and environment correspondent Sandra Laville discusses the increasing risk of flooding. Listen now. Sport Test cricket is back. And while the wait appeared short given a run of white-ball matches and Sheffield Shield, for two players \u2013 David Warner and Steve Smith \u2013 it\u2019s been nearly two years since they last played on Australian soil, writes Geoff Lemon.

But having paid the price for a failure to renew their squad, is Jos\u00e9 Mourinho the right man for Spurs? Media roundup One year on from the demerger of Coles from Wesfarmers, shareholders are $16bn richer, writes the Australian Financial Review, following the biggest split in Australian corporate history. Crews battling \u201cpotentially catastrophic\u201d fires in north-west Tasmania have been left \u201cfrustrated\u201d by firebugs, reports the Mercury. And, a soil contamination crisis has thrown the $6.7bn West Gate tunnel into turmoil, claims the Herald Sun, amid fears the project won\u2019t be completed ahead of the 2022 state election. Coming up Severe bushfire warnings have been issued for swathes of eastern Australia on Thursday, including a code red issued for parts of northern Victoria. A judgment will be handed down in the class action case against the maker of transvaginal mesh. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 Norway \u2013 home of the sugar tax since 1922 \u2013 has big news. It\u2019s eating less sugar per capita than at any other time since 1975.

Starr has consistently been a critic of the impeachment hearings, but he could not muster a defense. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten closer to the president,\u201d Starr said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good for the president, substantively.\u201d Starr did add, that the president \u201cmay have covered himself by saying no quid pro quo\u201d \u2013 Sondland testified Trump told him that, but that was the one bright light in Starr\u2019s take. \u201cI think the articles of impeachment are being drawn up if they haven\u2019t already been drawn up,\u201d Starr continued.",

The Liberal Democrat manifesto promises more than \u00a360bn extra spending a year within the next parliament, focused on areas such as schools, mental health and childcare, financed by what the party calls the \u201cremain bonus\u201d brought by higher GDP from cancelling Brexit.

The party expects the economy to be about 1.9% larger in 2024-25 under remain, and that tax receipts will rise steadily as a consequence, increasing in each year to the point that they are worth \u00a314.3bn extra by 2025 than under the government\u2019s Brexit deal. The Lib Dems have added together every year of higher tax receipts to reach a sum of \u00a352.4bn, which they say is net of savings from not paying a Brexit divorce bill and not having to replace EU spending in the UK.

More than 40,000 university staff at 60 universities are preparing to go on strike for eight days from next Monday, followed by a period of work to rule, in protest over their pensions, pay and conditions. But with no progress in negotiations, the University and College Union (UCU) warned of further strike action next term in order to pursue their claims and bring their employers back to the table. More than a million students face disruption over the next two weeks, with lectures and tutorials cancelled and no plans to reschedule lost teaching time. The National Union of Students has called on its members to support lecturers and many are expected to join them in the protests. About 43,600 university lecturers, librarians, technicians and other academic staff are taking action in two separate disputes \u2013 one about changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme, which triggered strike action last year, and the other about pay and conditions. The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said she was disappointed there had been no substantive talks over pay and conditions. Negotiators held a final meeting about the pensions dispute on Wednesday with little hope of a breakthrough. \u201cThe employers seem to want to test the mettle of staff and see if they will turn up on picket lines,\u201d Grady said. \u201cIt is really unfortunate they have decided to do that because they are misjudging their staff. \u201cMore and more people are joining the union and there is a real feeling of anger.

      "body": "<p><strong>Brexit <br></strong>A majority Lib Dem government would revoke article 50 and ensure Britain stays in the EU. In other circumstances, they would champion a second referendum with the option of staying in Europe, which they would actively campaign for. They describe Brexit as a \u201cnational humiliation\u201d that ultimately costs the NHS, public services, scientific collaboration, peace in Northern Ireland and the ability to tackle climate change. But their \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/lib-dems-manifesto-pledges-5bn-duty-rise-for-frequent-flyers\">remain bonus</a>\u201d of \u00a350bn is the basis for a lot of the manifesto\u2019s spending commitments, and this pot of money comes from forecasts of higher growth for the UK economy in a remain scenario. Their votes at 16 policy would also come into play if there was another Brexit vote.</p> <p><strong>Education <br></strong>Jo Swinson has made much of her party\u2019s offer for children and families and education makes up the lengthiest portion of the manifesto. Headline-grabbing policies are plugging the gap in childcare for working parents by offering free hours between nine months and two years old. They would triple the early years pupil premium to help the most disadvantaged children, scrap Sats exams, hire 20,000 more teachers and pay new recruits a starting salary of \u00a330,000. Michael Gove\u2019s legacy education policy, the Ebacc, would also be scrapped. A form of the popular education maintenance allowance would make a return in the form of a new \u201cyoung people\u2019s premium\u201d, a portion of which would go to 16-18-year-olds directly.</p> <p><strong>Health <br></strong>A \u00a37bn cash injection for the NHS and social care would be raised by putting 1p on income tax. Meanwhile, they would begin developing a new health and care tax. This would bring together both funding streams into one collective budget and the tax would show up on people\u2019s payslips. New mums in England would be given Finnish-style baby boxes, which have been popular in Scotland. Mental health policies make up a significant portion of their health plans, including free prescriptions for those with chronic mental health conditions and new waiting time standards in children\u2019s services and for those with eating disorders and severe conditions.</p> <p><strong>Immigration<br></strong>They do not give a figure for a net migration target, focusing instead on a raft of what they call \u201canti-hostile environment\u201d policies. By stopping Brexit, they claim they would protect freedom of movement with EU countries. Power over work permits and student visas would be removed from the Home Office and given instead to the departments for education and business. Families registering a child as a British citizen would only have to pay the administration fee and not the current \u00a31,012 fee. Policies for asylum seekers and refugees include a 28-day limit on immigration detention, giving asylum seekers the right to work after three months, and resettling 10,000 unaccompanied refugee children.</p> <p><strong>Economy/tax<br></strong>Billing themselves as the party of \u201cfiscal rectitude\u201d, the Lib Dems plan a \u00a3130bn infrastructure investment for public transport improvement, 300,000 new homes a year by 2024, and hyper-fast broadband. Reforms of the tax system involve hikes on corporation tax from 17% to 20% and replacing business rates with a commercial landowner levy. This tax removes physical buildings from calculations and instead applies the levy to the overall land value of a commercial site. An idea borrowed from New Zealand \u2013 the wellbeing budget \u2013 would prioritise spending on mental health, care for children in schools, homelessness and exploitation. Their \u00a310,000-per-adult \u201cskills wallet\u201d comes from this budget and would be paid out at different stages of people\u2019s lives for education and training.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd9cbd73837486579f6076f5550d811f19cf5ca1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd9cbd73837486579f6076f5550d811f19cf5ca1/0_82_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"cannabis plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Legalising cannabis is one of the Liberal Democrats\u2019 key manifesto pledges.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Crime and justice<br></strong>A flagship policy is the legalisation of cannabis. They claim this could bring \u00a31.5bn in duty and savings through sales in licensed shops to over-18s. Community policing is also a significant focus, with a promise of \u00a31bn investment to put two new police officers in every ward. Officers would get an immediate 2% pay rise. The Tory initiative of police and crime commissioners would be scrapped, with scrutiny of policing transferred to police boards made up of local councillors.

      "bodyText": "Brexit A majority Lib Dem government would revoke article 50 and ensure Britain stays in the EU. In other circumstances, they would champion a second referendum with the option of staying in Europe, which they would actively campaign for. They describe Brexit as a \u201cnational humiliation\u201d that ultimately costs the NHS, public services, scientific collaboration, peace in Northern Ireland and the ability to tackle climate change. But their \u201cremain bonus\u201d of \u00a350bn is the basis for a lot of the manifesto\u2019s spending commitments, and this pot of money comes from forecasts of higher growth for the UK economy in a remain scenario. Their votes at 16 policy would also come into play if there was another Brexit vote. Education Jo Swinson has made much of her party\u2019s offer for children and families and education makes up the lengthiest portion of the manifesto. Headline-grabbing policies are plugging the gap in childcare for working parents by offering free hours between nine months and two years old. They would triple the early years pupil premium to help the most disadvantaged children, scrap Sats exams, hire 20,000 more teachers and pay new recruits a starting salary of \u00a330,000. Michael Gove\u2019s legacy education policy, the Ebacc, would also be scrapped. A form of the popular education maintenance allowance would make a return in the form of a new \u201cyoung people\u2019s premium\u201d, a portion of which would go to 16-18-year-olds directly. Health A \u00a37bn cash injection for the NHS and social care would be raised by putting 1p on income tax. Meanwhile, they would begin developing a new health and care tax. This would bring together both funding streams into one collective budget and the tax would show up on people\u2019s payslips. New mums in England would be given Finnish-style baby boxes, which have been popular in Scotland. Mental health policies make up a significant portion of their health plans, including free prescriptions for those with chronic mental health conditions and new waiting time standards in children\u2019s services and for those with eating disorders and severe conditions. Immigration They do not give a figure for a net migration target, focusing instead on a raft of what they call \u201canti-hostile environment\u201d policies. By stopping Brexit, they claim they would protect freedom of movement with EU countries. Power over work permits and student visas would be removed from the Home Office and given instead to the departments for education and business. Families registering a child as a British citizen would only have to pay the administration fee and not the current \u00a31,012 fee. Policies for asylum seekers and refugees include a 28-day limit on immigration detention, giving asylum seekers the right to work after three months, and resettling 10,000 unaccompanied refugee children. Economy/tax Billing themselves as the party of \u201cfiscal rectitude\u201d, the Lib Dems plan a \u00a3130bn infrastructure investment for public transport improvement, 300,000 new homes a year by 2024, and hyper-fast broadband. Reforms of the tax system involve hikes on corporation tax from 17% to 20% and replacing business rates with a commercial landowner levy. This tax removes physical buildings from calculations and instead applies the levy to the overall land value of a commercial site. An idea borrowed from New Zealand \u2013 the wellbeing budget \u2013 would prioritise spending on mental health, care for children in schools, homelessness and exploitation. Their \u00a310,000-per-adult \u201cskills wallet\u201d comes from this budget and would be paid out at different stages of people\u2019s lives for education and training. Crime and justice A flagship policy is the legalisation of cannabis. They claim this could bring \u00a31.5bn in duty and savings through sales in licensed shops to over-18s. Community policing is also a significant focus, with a promise of \u00a31bn investment to put two new police officers in every ward. Officers would get an immediate 2% pay rise. The Tory initiative of police and crime commissioners would be scrapped, with scrutiny of policing transferred to police boards made up of local councillors. The over-representation of people from BAME backgrounds in prison would be studied in more detail with a new uniform data system recording ethnicity and publishing details publicly. Environment Ambitious policies to try to tackle the climate emergency by 2030 include the insulation of all of Britain\u2019s homes, generating 80% of UK electricity from renewable sources, and making sure all new cars are electric. Their legally binding target to achieve net-zero emissions is 2045, which is five years below the Tories but far higher than the pledges made by Labour and the Greens.

      "body": "<p>Labour\u2019s fate \u2013 and with it that of the country \u2013 now rests with the young: not just the fresh-faced undergraduates of Lancaster and Cardiff but the sleep-deprived 35-year-old mums and dads of Hastings and Pembrokeshire. Just as at this stage in the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39869459\" title=\"\">2017 election</a> \u2013 and no, the past is no automatic predictor \u2013 Labour\u2019s polling ranges from <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/uk-election-polls-tracker-tories-out-in-front-with-13point-lead-on-labour-according-to-average-of-a4289536.html\" title=\"\">not good to very bad</a>. But every scrap of evidence underlines that Labour\u2019s prospects depend on whether Britain\u2019s young apprentices, undergraduates and doting new parents turn up to the polling stations in the first place.</p> <p>Ever since Labour surged from its pre-2017 election nadir, when it languished in the mid-20s in the polls, whether or not there was a \u201cyouthquake\u201d has been debated and contested. But the latest research does indeed suggest <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/youthquake-did-back-corbyn-and-labour-in-2017-general-election-study-11573148\" title=\"\">that an increase in younger turnout played a key role</a>. According to YouGov post-election analysis, an astonishing two-thirds of 18- and 19-year-olds opted for Labour, but the swing towards Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party among those in their 30s \u2013 55% of whom plumped for Labour \u2013 played a decisive role.</p> <p>It is fitting political karma that the Tory failure to address the housing and cost-of-living crises in London in particular have detonated in the party\u2019s face. Unable to afford to raise children in the capital, young families are driven to Tory marginal seats, and have been turning them red. They\u2019re known as DFLs in many of these places, \u201cdown from London\u201d. In Hastings and Rye, they are playfully called \u201cFilth\u201d \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/27/double-trouble-how-big-cities-are-gentrifying-their-neighbours\" title=\"\">Failed in London, tried Hastings</a>\u201d. In this constituency, they helped bring the Tory majority down from approaching 5,000 in 2015 to just 346 two years later. They care about job security, affording a decent home, childcare and being paid properly; they were raised to expect that life would always get better, are affronted by their stagnating living standards, and worry about their children\u2019s future in a turmoil-ridden world. They tend to have progressive social views, and they are disturbed by the US-style conservative culture war being waged by the Tory right. The climate emergency unnerves many of them.</p> <p>But will the young vote? The worst poll for Labour, conducted by Kantar, suggests a horrifying <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-election-poll-kantar/johnsons-lead-over-labour-balloons-to-18-points-kantar-poll-idUKKBN1XT21T\" title=\"\">18-point Tory lead</a> \u2013 though, eerily, its poll at this stage of the 2017 election suggested the same gap. Its findings are weighted by turnout: it claims that over three-quarters of Tory voters are certain to vote, but that falls to 57% among Labour voters. The discrepancy can be explained by a generational divide: while 75% of those over 65 \u2013 the demographic most likely to support the Tories \u2013 are judged certain to vote, that falls to 15% among 25- to 34-year-olds, and just 10% among 18- to 24-year-olds. These figures seem profoundly questionable \u2013 they would herald a truly catastrophic collapse in turnout \u2013 but they underline that Labour\u2019s fortunes depend on who is motivated to vote. In the latest <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/u9n27k5219/Sky_TheTimes_VI_191119_w.pdf\" title=\"\">poll conducted by YouGov</a> \u2013 a pollster which offers some of Labour\u2019s worst results \u2013 the Tory gap fell from 17 to 12 points in four days. The shift was partly explained by Labour supporters \u2013 particularly at the younger end \u2013 being more likely to vote.</p> <p>Some Labour MPs fret about the young vote. \u201cThe student vote is not as energised as it was in 2017,\u201d says one; another says that among their local students there is \u201cstill pretty good support, but the enthusiasm for us has dissipated\u201d. But it was only after the 2017 manifesto launch that the campaign truly caught fire last time. It is notable too that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/performance/register-to-vote/registrations-by-age-group\" title=\"\">1.35 million under-35-year-olds have registered to vote </a>during the first two weeks of this campaign, almost twice the rate of 2017.</p> <p>As it was last time, Labour\u2019s manifesto is its one major opportunity to overcome the formidable odds stacked against it. For the party to have a chance of evicting Boris Johnson from No 10, that manifesto must put rocket boosters under its efforts to convince the under-40s to trudge out of their homes in mid-December to polling stations. It must address student debt, the housing crisis, low pay, the lack of secure skilled work, childcare, rip-off mediocre public transport, cuts to education budgets and the climate emergency. It must also tell a story of how those younger people who can\u2019t rely on the bank of mum and dad have been locked out of their country\u2019s future; and of how the resources and talent exist to satisfy their ambitions and provide a prosperous future for their children, but that the wealth they help create ends up in the pockets and offshore accounts of the rich.</p> <p>Back in 2017, younger people saw Corbyn as an unlikely champion of a generation whose living standards and values had been systematically assaulted. In the remaining three weeks, the Labour leader has to show more fight to again convince them he is their tribune.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s fate \u2013 and with it that of the country \u2013 now rests with the young: not just the fresh-faced undergraduates of Lancaster and Cardiff but the sleep-deprived 35-year-old mums and dads of Hastings and Pembrokeshire. Just as at this stage in the 2017 election \u2013 and no, the past is no automatic predictor \u2013 Labour\u2019s polling ranges from not good to very bad. But every scrap of evidence underlines that Labour\u2019s prospects depend on whether Britain\u2019s young apprentices, undergraduates and doting new parents turn up to the polling stations in the first place. Ever since Labour surged from its pre-2017 election nadir, when it languished in the mid-20s in the polls, whether or not there was a \u201cyouthquake\u201d has been debated and contested. But the latest research does indeed suggest that an increase in younger turnout played a key role. According to YouGov post-election analysis, an astonishing two-thirds of 18- and 19-year-olds opted for Labour, but the swing towards Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party among those in their 30s \u2013 55% of whom plumped for Labour \u2013 played a decisive role. It is fitting political karma that the Tory failure to address the housing and cost-of-living crises in London in particular have detonated in the party\u2019s face. Unable to afford to raise children in the capital, young families are driven to Tory marginal seats, and have been turning them red. They\u2019re known as DFLs in many of these places, \u201cdown from London\u201d. In Hastings and Rye, they are playfully called \u201cFilth\u201d \u2013 \u201cFailed in London, tried Hastings\u201d. In this constituency, they helped bring the Tory majority down from approaching 5,000 in 2015 to just 346 two years later. They care about job security, affording a decent home, childcare and being paid properly; they were raised to expect that life would always get better, are affronted by their stagnating living standards, and worry about their children\u2019s future in a turmoil-ridden world. They tend to have progressive social views, and they are disturbed by the US-style conservative culture war being waged by the Tory right. The climate emergency unnerves many of them. But will the young vote? The worst poll for Labour, conducted by Kantar, suggests a horrifying 18-point Tory lead \u2013 though, eerily, its poll at this stage of the 2017 election suggested the same gap. Its findings are weighted by turnout: it claims that over three-quarters of Tory voters are certain to vote, but that falls to 57% among Labour voters. The discrepancy can be explained by a generational divide: while 75% of those over 65 \u2013 the demographic most likely to support the Tories \u2013 are judged certain to vote, that falls to 15% among 25- to 34-year-olds, and just 10% among 18- to 24-year-olds. These figures seem profoundly questionable \u2013 they would herald a truly catastrophic collapse in turnout \u2013 but they underline that Labour\u2019s fortunes depend on who is motivated to vote. In the latest poll conducted by YouGov \u2013 a pollster which offers some of Labour\u2019s worst results \u2013 the Tory gap fell from 17 to 12 points in four days. The shift was partly explained by Labour supporters \u2013 particularly at the younger end \u2013 being more likely to vote. Some Labour MPs fret about the young vote. \u201cThe student vote is not as energised as it was in 2017,\u201d says one; another says that among their local students there is \u201cstill pretty good support, but the enthusiasm for us has dissipated\u201d. But it was only after the 2017 manifesto launch that the campaign truly caught fire last time. It is notable too that 1.35 million under-35-year-olds have registered to vote during the first two weeks of this campaign, almost twice the rate of 2017. As it was last time, Labour\u2019s manifesto is its one major opportunity to overcome the formidable odds stacked against it. For the party to have a chance of evicting Boris Johnson from No 10, that manifesto must put rocket boosters under its efforts to convince the under-40s to trudge out of their homes in mid-December to polling stations. It must address student debt, the housing crisis, low pay, the lack of secure skilled work, childcare, rip-off mediocre public transport, cuts to education budgets and the climate emergency. It must also tell a story of how those younger people who can\u2019t rely on the bank of mum and dad have been locked out of their country\u2019s future; and of how the resources and talent exist to satisfy their ambitions and provide a prosperous future for their children, but that the wealth they help create ends up in the pockets and offshore accounts of the rich. Back in 2017, younger people saw Corbyn as an unlikely champion of a generation whose living standards and values had been systematically assaulted. In the remaining three weeks, the Labour leader has to show more fight to again convince them he is their tribune. That doesn\u2019t mean Labour should abandon older generations: even convincing a small sliver of pensioners will help tip the balance. But there is an unquestionable political truth: that if insufficient young people turn up to vote, Johnson will triumph and our country will be in the throes of hard Brexit by the end of January. The party has little time, and so much to do. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, has proposed to establish a group of experts headed by Stoltenberg to engage in political discussion on the alliance\u2019s strategic thinking in response to Macron\u2019s stance. Stoltenberg said the proposal had received support from many allies, adding: \u201c I think it has value and we will now look into it as we prepare for the upcoming leaders meeting.\u201d Concerns have also been raised that Macron had suggested that there was an opportunity for a rapprochement with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. Stoltenberg said it was important that the alliance showed unity and that different views were best dealt with through talks in London, where he said he was confident agreement would be found. \u201cSpace is part of our daily life here on Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be used for peaceful purposes. But it can also be used aggressively. Satellites can be jammed, hacked or weaponised. Anti-satellite weapons could cripple communications and other services our societies rely on, such as air travel, weather forecasts or banking. \u201cSpace is also essential to the alliance\u2019s deterrence and defence, including the ability to navigate, to gather intelligence, and to detect missile launches. Around 2,000 satellites orbit the Earth. And around half of them are owned by Nato countries. Nato has no intention to put weapons in space. We are a defensive alliance.\u201d However, Trump expressed different views when he announced the creation of a US space command as part of the military set-up in August. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Trump had said, describing space as \u201cthe next war-fighting domain\u201d. He said: \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s pretty obvious to everybody.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Kelsey Juliana, a youth climate activist from Oregon, is joining forces with Gabriela Hearst, a fashion designer whose clothes are worn by Lady Gaga and the Duchess of Sussex, to ignite a trend they hope will become a global sensation. Juliana, 23, is the lead plaintiff in a group lawsuit suing the US government for breaching the human rights of her generation by failing to take action to protect the environment.

She alleged that after dining and dancing, Giuffre and the prince had a sexual encounter at Maxwell\u2019s Belgravia home. Andrew denies the claim. Maxwell has also emphatically denied wrongdoing.</p> \n<p>The royal statement was drafted after consultation with Prince Charles, who is visiting New Zealand, and released on the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s 72nd wedding anniversary. It emerged just in time for the evening television bulletins and immediately nudged aside general election coverage.</p> \n<p>The release of the statement also followed criticism of the prince and those around him for their disastrous public relations strategy.</p> \n<p>With the prince standing aside from duties, there were expectations that heads of staff involved in advising Andrew to do the interview would roll. A renewed spotlight is expected to fall on Amanda Thirsk, his private secretary and the figure who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/17/who-were-the-main-players-behind-the-prince-andrew-interview\">believed to have pushed for the prince to do the BBC interview</a> in the face of initial scepticism.</p> \n<p>The interview, in which Emily Maitlis forensically dissected the prince\u2019s responses, was carried out after Andrew ignored the guidance of Jason Stein, former special adviser to Amber Rudd and spokesman for Liz Truss, who had been hired in September to mastermind the royal\u2019s PR fightback. He left by mutual consent two weeks ago after his advice to reject the Newsnight interview request was ignored.</p> \n<p>Following the palace announcement, the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, said she expected Andrew\u2019s effective suspension to include his honorific positions as patron of organisations such as the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the English National Ballet. \u201cWhen he says he\u2019s going to withdraw from public duties I would expect that would be heading up, or being a patron of, organisations, institutions like that,\u201d Morgan told ITV\u2019s Peston programme.</p> \n<p>Asked if she would encourage him to stand down from such institutions, she said: \u201cI think what he has obviously clearly realised is that his presence or his involvement in these organisations, these very worthy organisations, obviously detracts from the work that they are doing, and he doesn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prince\u2019s suspension was described as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d by the Women\u2019s Equality Party. The party\u2019s president, Catherine Mayer, who is also a royal biographer, forecast that the prince would spend the rest of his days \u201csomewhere warm and agreeable\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cLess predictable is whether he will yield to pressure to assist the FBI investigation into Epstein. I hope so,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/catherine_mayer/status/1197223385606115333?s=20\">she added</a>.</p> \n<p>Graham Smith, chief executive of the campaign group Republic, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GrahamSmith_/status/1197219062700560384\">tweeted</a> in response to news of the statement: \u201cIn a normal world it would be: head of state facing questions over son\u2019s conduct and son removed from all official duties.\u201d</p> \n<p>The palace announcement came after businesses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/20/the-firms-cutting-ties-with-prince-andrew-in-wake-of-scandal\">either severed ties or said that they would be reviewing their involvement</a> with Pitch@Palace, the business mentoring scheme founded by Prince Andrew.</p> \n<p>In an apparent attempt to limit separate damage to the Duke of York Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award (iDEA), an independent digital skills scheme, a page on its website listing Salesforce, Google, BT and Microsoft as \u201ccorporate partners\u201d was deleted.</p> \n<p>The unravelling of Andrew\u2019s interests had also spread to the charities that counted him as a patron. Among them, trustees at the English National Ballet were due to discuss his patronage. The controversy had also gone global, with Australian universities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/20/two-australian-universities-sever-ties-with-charity-founded-by-prince-andrew\">announcing that they would be severing ties</a> with Pitch@palace, which claims to operate in more than 60 countries.</p> \n<p>Sources at one of the major corporate backers in the UK said they expected the initiative to survive, but with Andrew making way for another royal such as Prince William or Harry.</p>",

The Duke of York also said he was \u201cwilling to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations if required\u201d over the US probe into Epstein. The development came on a day when BT said it would not work with a digital skills scheme that counts the duke as patron, amid a growing exodus of companies and other institutions after Andrew\u2019s interview at the weekend and pressure from a woman who says the convicted child sex offender trafficked her to London to meet the royal and have sex with him. His effective suspension from duties by his mother was announced in a statement issued in the prince\u2019s name, which said: \u201cIt has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family\u2019s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support. \u201cTherefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.\u201d He added: \u201cI continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.

Virginia Giuffre has claimed that Epstein flew her to London on his private jet around 2001, when she was 17 years old. She alleged that after dining and dancing, Giuffre and the prince had a sexual encounter at Maxwell\u2019s Belgravia home. Andrew denies the claim. Maxwell has also emphatically denied wrongdoing. The royal statement was drafted after consultation with Prince Charles, who is visiting New Zealand, and released on the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s 72nd wedding anniversary. It emerged just in time for the evening television bulletins and immediately nudged aside general election coverage. The release of the statement also followed criticism of the prince and those around him for their disastrous public relations strategy. With the prince standing aside from duties, there were expectations that heads of staff involved in advising Andrew to do the interview would roll. A renewed spotlight is expected to fall on Amanda Thirsk, his private secretary and the figure who is believed to have pushed for the prince to do the BBC interview in the face of initial scepticism. The interview, in which Emily Maitlis forensically dissected the prince\u2019s responses, was carried out after Andrew ignored the guidance of Jason Stein, former special adviser to Amber Rudd and spokesman for Liz Truss, who had been hired in September to mastermind the royal\u2019s PR fightback. He left by mutual consent two weeks ago after his advice to reject the Newsnight interview request was ignored. Following the palace announcement, the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, said she expected Andrew\u2019s effective suspension to include his honorific positions as patron of organisations such as the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the English National Ballet. \u201cWhen he says he\u2019s going to withdraw from public duties I would expect that would be heading up, or being a patron of, organisations, institutions like that,\u201d Morgan told ITV\u2019s Peston programme. Asked if she would encourage him to stand down from such institutions, she said: \u201cI think what he has obviously clearly realised is that his presence or his involvement in these organisations, these very worthy organisations, obviously detracts from the work that they are doing, and he doesn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d The prince\u2019s suspension was described as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d by the Women\u2019s Equality Party. The party\u2019s president, Catherine Mayer, who is also a royal biographer, forecast that the prince would spend the rest of his days \u201csomewhere warm and agreeable\u201d. \u201cLess predictable is whether he will yield to pressure to assist the FBI investigation into Epstein. I hope so,\u201d she added. Graham Smith, chief executive of the campaign group Republic, tweeted in response to news of the statement: \u201cIn a normal world it would be: head of state facing questions over son\u2019s conduct and son removed from all official duties.\u201d The palace announcement came after businesses either severed ties or said that they would be reviewing their involvement with Pitch@Palace, the business mentoring scheme founded by Prince Andrew. In an apparent attempt to limit separate damage to the Duke of York Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award (iDEA), an independent digital skills scheme, a page on its website listing Salesforce, Google, BT and Microsoft as \u201ccorporate partners\u201d was deleted. The unravelling of Andrew\u2019s interests had also spread to the charities that counted him as a patron. Among them, trustees at the English National Ballet were due to discuss his patronage. The controversy had also gone global, with Australian universities announcing that they would be severing ties with Pitch@palace, which claims to operate in more than 60 countries. Sources at one of the major corporate backers in the UK said they expected the initiative to survive, but with Andrew making way for another royal such as Prince William or Harry.",

      "bodyText": "Researchers in Venice have discovered a document that strengthens the theory that a group of friars played a hand in the revision of Marco Polo\u2019s book about his travels. The legendary merchant and explorer set off from Venice in 1271 at the age of 17 and spent more than two decades travelling through Asia. He returned to Venice in 1295 and was imprisoned in Genoa three years later after becoming embroiled in a naval conflict between the two cities. It was in prison that he dictated his stories to his cellmate, Rustichello da Pisa, a romance writer, who jotted them down, paving the way for what eventually became one of the world\u2019s first bestsellers. Researchers from Ca\u2019 Foscari University in Venice recently discovered a parchment in the city\u2019s archives that testified to Polo\u2019s close connection to the Dominican friars of the Santi Giovanni e Paolo convent, close to where he resided, in the years following his release from prison. In the document, dated 1323, a year before he died, Marco Polo is listed as the only layperson among the witnesses of the order\u2019s acceptance of money left to it by a Venetian nobleman, Giovanni dalle Boccole, in his will. Among the witnesses named on the document, which was discovered by Marcello Bolognari, were Friars Benvenuto and Centorio, who were included in Polo\u2019s will. The discovery sheds new light on Polo\u2019s life after his return to Venice, painting a picture of a man who not only managed his family\u2019s business but also participated in religious life. \u201cThis document means that the friars considered Polo to be a really important person for the convent, which was quite exceptional for a convent at that time,\u201d said Antonio Montefusco, the professor at Ca\u2019 Foscari who supervised the research project.

They\u2019ve never had any medical training about transitioning and stuff. They would not help me and they would not advise anyone at the surgery to help me. The only other GP I could get to was thankfully more accepting.\u201d Lloyd thinks the government needs to invest more money in this area. \u201cNHS England need to properly review their services and work with the people who are using private therapy or mental health therapy services rather than trying to put up barriers. \u201cMy voice therapist also worked at the gender identity clinic and she said that even before this influx, they were already understaffed. That\u2019s why they have a three-year, four-year waiting list in some places, which obviously is an obscenely long amount of time to get seen by any NHS professional.\u201d In England, Lloyd said, to get a new passport you need a medical letter. \u201cIf I were to wait for that letter from the gender identity clinic, I\u2019d still be waiting two and a half years and I wouldn\u2019t be able to change my gender or sex on any legal records. \u201cAfter the official gender and sex amendment by HMRC you\u2019ve got to change your bank personal details, which is really important for credit and financial history, employment HR records, everything else that has your name and gender info.\u201d Lloyd is now in a much better place because she is getting the right support. \u201cI just want to highlight how depressing and frustrating the whole waiting-list situation is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like government-wise, no one really cares.\u201d",

Now astronomers have discovered that these cataclysmic events, known as gamma ray bursts, release roughly twice as much energy as previously thought. The rethink comes after an international team registered a record-breaking observation of the highest-energy radiation ever measured from gamma ray bursts. \u201cThese are the craziest energies emitted \u2013 the most intense electromagnetic events known in the universe,\u201d said Razmik Mirzoyan, an astrophysicist at the Max-Planck-Institute for Physics in Munich and spokesman for the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (Magic) telescopes on La Palma. \u201cNow it turns out that these gamma ray bursts are even more powerful than that.\u201d The discovery was made possible by a exquisitely choreographed alert system that allowed more than 20 ground-based telescopes to simultaneously record the same event. Gamma ray bursts happen in the sky roughly once a day and a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the sun will in its entire 10bn-year lifetime. They are thought to be the result of gigantic stars, 30-50 times the mass of the sun, collapsing under their own gravity when they run out of fuel.

It was as inspiring to see the good work being done there as it was hearing the stories of those who had come to talk, drink tea and take away their parcels. The sheer scale and efficiency of the operation were impressive, but also depressing because of the very necessity for it to be quite so good. I almost forgot that we shouldn\u2019t need these things in the first place. It also felt very wrong, because I had mentioned food banks so many times in the course of my work without, until now, visiting one, let alone volunteering or even donating. This is going to change. My excuse for not having donated is on the flimsy side: I\u2019ve never really known what to give. It turns out the answer to that quandary is simply to ask the question.

Since then, several campuses have been barricaded by students, some of who are using footbridges or or near the campuses to block roads.

Johnson\u2019s claim now, as in the referendum campaign, is that leaving Europe is an act of empowerment. It contains the illusion that we, the liberated nation, tell them, the spurned continentals, how things will be. Three years of negotiation tell a different story. The UK tried to retain privileges of EU membership without abiding by the rules, failed, and watched its deal deteriorate as a result.

The old movie will be remade with the same gallop towards a cliff edge, cheered on by hardliners lying about \u201cclean breaks\u201d.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s plan is to complete a comprehensive free-trade agreement before transitional arrangements expire next December. More time is available, but he insists it will not be necessary. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, extension would have to be sought by July.

Second, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-49649586\" title=\"\">Phil Hogan</a>, the EU trade commissioner, has said a year is sufficient.

Citing the status quo as evidence that change will be easy is an old Brexiteer con. As Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Centre for European Reform, says: \u201cWhere we start isn\u2019t what matters, it\u2019s all about where we want to end up.\u201d Johnson\u2019s plan explicitly mandates divergence from EU norms. Its purpose is to carve out competitive advantage through deregulation. Brussels sees that as a threat to undercut continental businesses and dump substandard goods on EU consumers. The price of market access is set at a high level of compliance with European rules, which Tories despise. The narrowness of the Channel and the Eurosceptic fixation on de-alignment combine to make future trade talks harder than EU dealings with more remote countries.</p> <p>When EU officials nod along with the tight timetable, they are being polite and trying not to spook British voters. The commission wants the deal ratified as much as Johnson does. An imbalance of power favours Brussels as much in the next phase as it did in withdrawal talks. A new hand is dealt but the rules don\u2019t change: the lone state gets weaker cards than the bloc of 27. The commission brings cold-blooded negotiators, hardened over decades of top-level technical negotiation. The UK brings a demoralised civil service with little experience of trade talks, instructed by delusional Tories who think free trade is something to do with Britannia and ruling waves.</p> <p>As for Johnson\u2019s powers of persuasion, they are fictional.

In a statement to Holyrood on Wednesday, Jeane Freeman apologised directly to the parents of the children involved, saying they deserved to have their questions answered, and she described the board\u2019s communication with families as \u201csimply not good enough\u201d. But she insisted: \u201cI will not be rushed into wrong decisions simply to satisfy members of this chamber.\u201d The case of 10-year-old Milly Main, who died in August 2017 after contracting an infection as she recovered from leukaemia treatment, was raised at first minister\u2019s questions last week by Anas Sarwar, a Scottish Labour MSP. Milly was treated in a ward at Glasgow\u2019s Royal Hospital for Children that was subsequently closed because of infection concerns. Her mother has said she feels \u201clet down and lied to\u201d by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Citing information provided to him by a whistleblower, Sarwar disclosed that a doctor-led review had identified 26 infections at the hospital, part of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus, that were potentially connected to problems with the water supply during 2017. Sarwar also revealed that the girl\u2019s parents had not been told about the possible link. Milly\u2019s mother, Kimberly Darroch, told BBC Scotland she was \u201c100%\u201d convinced her daughter\u2019s death was linked to water contamination and that the health board was covering up the truth. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has offered to meet the family to discuss their concerns but said it was not possible to determine the source of their daughter\u2019s infection because there was no requirement for water testing at the time. Pressure on the board intensified on Sunday when it emerged that Police Scotland were investigating the death of three-year-old Mason Djemat, who died a few weeks before Milly on the same ward while he was receiving treatment for a rare genetic condition.

Harry Miller, who served with Humberside police, was contacted by the force this year after a complaint from a member of the public about allegedly transphobic comments he made on his Twitter account @HarryTheOwl. Another officer told Miller that he had not committed a crime but his tweeting was being recorded as a hate incident under the College of Policing\u2019s guidelines on hate crime, the high court in London heard. The guidance defines a hate incident as \u201cany non-crime incident which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice against a person who is transgender or perceived to be transgender\u201d.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Claim</strong></h2> <p>Boris Johnson said the Conservatives would cut taxes for \u201cworking people\u201d by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/boris-johnson-lets-slip-manifesto-pledge-to-cut-national-insurance\">raising the threshold for national insurance</a> contributions to \u00a312,000.</p> <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2> <p>Earnings above \u00a38,632 a year are subject to national insurance contributions under the current system. These are paid by employers, employees and the self-employed. National insurance is separate from income tax. Paying it entitles individuals to some state benefits.</p> <p>The new policy, which slipped out when the prime minister visited workers in Teesside, would include raising the threshold to \u00a39,500 next year, before it would then be gradually lifted over several years until it reached a target of \u00a312,000.</p> <p>Asked whether the tax cuts would be for all, or just people like himself, he said: \u201cI mean low tax for working people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-fact-checking-2\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-fact-checking-2&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-fact-checking-2&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Reality</strong></h2> <p>The details of the policy remain vague, as the Conservatives have yet to publish a manifesto.</p> <p>According to the Resolution Foundation, raising the threshold to \u00a312,500 \u2013 in line with the tax-free allowance on income tax \u2013would give most workers a tax cut of \u00a3480, at a cost of about \u00a311bn to the Treasury. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that every \u00a31,000 increase in the threshold would cost at least \u00a33bn each year.</p> <p>It is not yet clear how the policy would be funded, given the Tories\u2019 plans to increase other areas of government spending without announcing significant increases in tax.</p> <p>The plan could favour richer households over poorer ones.

      "bodyText": "Claim Boris Johnson said the Conservatives would cut taxes for \u201cworking people\u201d by raising the threshold for national insurance contributions to \u00a312,000. Background Earnings above \u00a38,632 a year are subject to national insurance contributions under the current system. These are paid by employers, employees and the self-employed. National insurance is separate from income tax. Paying it entitles individuals to some state benefits. The new policy, which slipped out when the prime minister visited workers in Teesside, would include raising the threshold to \u00a39,500 next year, before it would then be gradually lifted over several years until it reached a target of \u00a312,000. Asked whether the tax cuts would be for all, or just people like himself, he said: \u201cI mean low tax for working people.\u201d Reality The details of the policy remain vague, as the Conservatives have yet to publish a manifesto. According to the Resolution Foundation, raising the threshold to \u00a312,500 \u2013 in line with the tax-free allowance on income tax \u2013would give most workers a tax cut of \u00a3480, at a cost of about \u00a311bn to the Treasury. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that every \u00a31,000 increase in the threshold would cost at least \u00a33bn each year. It is not yet clear how the policy would be funded, given the Tories\u2019 plans to increase other areas of government spending without announcing significant increases in tax. The plan could favour richer households over poorer ones. The IFS reckons that about 16m households will benefit, but that the largest proportional gains will go to middle-income and upper-income earners. It said households nearer the bottom typically would get a larger share of their income from benefits, which meant they would not feel as much of an impact. People in work but on universal credit would not benefit as much, losing about 63% of the cut due to the means-testing of the benefit. They would receive a \u00a3480 cut, but their universal credit would immediately be reduced by \u00a3300, eroding the impact of the reduction. The Resolution Foundation said the threshold hike was \u201crelatively progressive as far as tax cuts go\u201d, but that to reduce poverty it would be better and more cost effective to reverse the \u00a312bn in benefits cuts imposed under austerity policies since 2015. Robert Palmer, executive director of the Tax Justice UK campaign group, said: \u201cThis will be pitched as a sop to those on lower incomes, but most of the benefits will go to the well-off.\u201d Verdict Johnson\u2019s tax cut would benefit taxpayers in the country, and \u201cworking people\u201d would stand to take home more of their pay. However, it is estimated that the move would most help the richest.

There he discovered well-equipped pottery studios but no teacher, so he began a course of self-tuition in clay, using <a href=\"https://www.leachpottery.com/history\" title=\"\">Bernard Leach\u2019s</a> A Potter\u2019s Book.</p> <p>On leaving Goldsmiths in 1956 he spent time teaching, and set up a communal studio of artists in Forest Hill, south London.

      "bodyText": "Australian officials have told major business groups there will have to be a diplomatic solution to a standoff between the Morrison government and other nations about whether the government can use carryover credits from the Kyoto period to meet its Paris target. Guardian Australia understands diplomats from the British high commission signalled their objection to Australia using carryover credits during a recent meeting of the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network, which includes major emitters such as BHP and Woodside, and industry associations. Australian officials responded by saying the government intended to use carryover credits despite the opposition, and there would need to be a diplomatic solution at the looming United Nations climate talks in Madrid. British officials, according to sources with knowledge of the meeting, said everything was negotiable in the context of the UN talks, but using carryover credits should not become a substitute for climate action. The British high commission in Canberra declined to comment on a presentation delivered during a private meeting. Carryover credits are an accounting system that allows countries to count credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030. Australia will need to cut emissions by 695m tonnes cumulatively across the next decade to meet its 2030 target. The Morrison government said more than half of that cut, 367m tonnes, would come from accounting and not from practical emissions reduction. Australia\u2019s stance is controversial, and a number of countries have objected, including the European Union, Pacific nations and Canada. Environment department officials recently told Senate estimates they were unaware of any countries other than Australia planning to use the controversial credits to meet their international climate commitments. The Australian Industry Greenhouse Network meets regularly. The most recent conversation, including diplomats and Australian officials, is scheduled as a precursor to the UN climate talks in Madrid starting on 2 December. Officials from the foreign affairs department have been briefing stakeholders ahead of the meeting. Foreign affairs officials told stakeholders that Australia would not discuss an increase in its headline commitment \u2013 a 26-28% emissions cut by 2030 compared with 2005 \u2013 in Madrid and did not expect carryover credits to be a major focus at the meeting. They said the environment department was working on a long-term climate strategy that would be released for feedback early next year. This is consistent with a commitment Morrison made at the Pacific Islands forum in Tuvalu in August, when \u2013 after rejecting heavy criticism by island nations of Australia\u2019s support for coal \u2013 he signed Australia up to pursuing efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C and produce a 2050 strategy by 2020. His statement said the strategy \u201cmay include commitments and strategies to achieve net zero carbon by 2050\u201d. The context for the conversation at the network meeting was rising concern in the business community about the continuing lack of resolution to article 6 of the Paris rulebook, which is the section of the agreement promoting international cooperation, including allowing countries to trade their emissions allowances, or credits. Despite Scott Morrison\u2019s frequent, strident criticisms during the May election of a plan by Labor to allow high emitting businesses to use international permits to reduce their pollution at least cost, Australia\u2019s official position in the UN negotiations is it supports the use of permits. But it remains unclear whether a consensus on the rules will be reached in Madrid. The issue of whether Australia can use carryover credits from the Kyoto period is a separate but related issue to the disputes about article 6. Carryover credits are not mentioned in the Paris agreement, under which countries nominate their own targets (known as nationally determined commitments) and explain how they plan to reach them. It means there is nothing in the text that prevents Australia from using them, despite the objections. They could be banned only through consensus, which would require Australia to agree. The government said Australia was entitled to use the carryover credits as they reflected its efforts in \u201cbeating\u201d the targets set under the Kyoto protocol. Critics say Australia has access to the credits only because it has made unexacting commitments, including allowing its emissions to continue to increase under the protocol\u2019s first stage, and the point of the Paris deal is to significantly ramp up action over time, not just loopholes.",

      "body": "<p>Jack Colwell\u2019s music manages to straddle a line between haunting and groovy. The singer and composer\u2019s fantasy influences are certainly detectable in his art. More surprising is his new attachment to a \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d beauty splurge.</p> <h2>What\u2019s thrilling</h2> <p><strong>I feel like this is a really exorbitant thing to say</strong> because I realise it\u2019s so expensive and it\u2019s actually even a bit crazy that I own this beauty product, but I have La Mer eye cream. I\u2019m turning 30 and I feel like over the last year I\u2019ve kind of really slipped out of my health and my fitness. I just wanted to make a really big effort to change my lifestyle, and become healthier and fitter. [It\u2019s] my guilty pleasure that I\u2019m absolutely excited about but embarrassed to admit. On every beauty blog that I\u2019ve read they recommend La Mer eye cream is the best one and that the skin around the eyes is the first place to see the telltale signs of ageing. So I decided to invest.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve become really obsessed with reading biographies.</strong> I\u2019m currently reading the unofficial Alexander McQueen biography by Andrew Wilson. I saw the documentary on McQueen about a year ago, just before I went into the studio to record my album. I was just so overcome with emotion when I saw the film and how beautiful his work was. I actually didn\u2019t really know too much about Alexander McQueen personally, and I felt so inspired by his creation that wanted to find out as much as I could about him. I\u2019ve also just finished a book of short stories by Jeffrey Eugenides, Fresh Complaint, that I\u2019ve been really enjoying. I find that I can often read them on the go, which is good for me.</p> <h2>What\u2019s nostalgia-inducing</h2> <p><strong>I don\u2019t even know if they still make this any more: </strong> Crave by Calvin Klein, and it was the first perfume that I saved up to buy with my own money. It sounds like a sweet story. I remember that the ads for this fragrance were so sexually charged. It had this Australian model called Travis Fimmel. He was the face of the campaign for the brand and it was a real sexual awakening for me to see these ads. They went everywhere. </p> <p>This ad, the model and the pose and even the fact that this fragrance is called Crave \u2026 everything about it was so sexually charged. It was Calvin Klein and it seemed like this really sophisticated fragrance, and I remember saving up all my money to go and buy it, which sounds like such a strange thing to do for a 14-year-old but I remember buying it and just really thinking that I was kind of coming into my own as a teenager, like having a sexual awakening. </p> <p><strong> I felt like I was a really precocious teenager.</strong> I went to a classical music high school and we studied classical music basically full-time. I was really obsessed with arthouse films and I was really obsessed with reading classic novels, and I thought that over time this stuff together was one day going to turn me into some kind of great artist.</p> <p>Now I just love to read trash and biographies and just relax. But the one book that I do still really feel passionate about, that I just remember loving as a teenager, was Jeffrey Eugenides\u2019 first novel, The Virgin Suicides. I think I read the book at least 10 or 20 times when I was 16 or 17. I don\u2019t really know what that says about my personality.</p> <p>I remember I felt really alone when I was a teenager, and that loneliness manifested in some kind of compassion for [one of the the lead characters] Lux Lisbon, who was really alone in 70s in suburban America, and for some reason I thought that there was some kind of parallel between our lives. I remember it so vividly and the sorts of scenes that it painted of this small, suburban American town where everything seemed so shiny and glossy on the surface, but there was this real dark underbelly just below. It just really resonated with me at that time of my life.</p> <p>Even before that, when I was in primary school, I was always really interested in fantasy books. I would say that this is something that is still with me as an adult today, and has even seeped into a lot of my music writing. In particular I loved this UK author called Diana Wynne Jones who actually wrote the story for Howl\u2019s Moving Castle. I read every fantasy book in her series and also Deltora Quest by Emily Rodda and I was really strongly influenced by the Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales. The pathos and the morals in their stories are things that I still think about in my day-to-day life, in my personal interactions with other people. I still really draw on those old methods and fables for advice, or to see the world in a certain way.</p> <h2>What I keep going back to</h2> <p><strong>I have three beauty products that I actually have in my bag with me at all times</strong>. I\u2019ve learned that any time is a good time to brush your teeth so I always keep a little toothbrush with a small Aesop toothpaste in my bag, and I also use an Aesop sunscreen every day. I have a wonderful combination Irish skin that is pale in some places and bright red in other places and it\u2019s covered in freckles. So I really need that sunscreen.</p> <p>It\u2019s either patchy or it\u2019s red, so it\u2019s gonna be one of the two. I also use Sebamed. It\u2019s just a really, really cheap facial cleanser. It\u2019s like a face and body wash. It\u2019s pretty widely available, but it does the trick every time.</p> <p>I think that cleansing my skin and brushing my teeth and wearing sunscreen are such simple beauty things but they really make a difference.</p> <p><strong>The only thing </strong><strong>I know that I\u2019ve reread multiple times as an adult </strong>is the fifth book in the Harry Potter series, The Order of the Phoenix.</p> <p>When the Philosopher\u2019s Stone came out I was about about nine or 10. And then when the final book came out, I was finishing high school.

      "bodyText": "Jack Colwell\u2019s music manages to straddle a line between haunting and groovy. The singer and composer\u2019s fantasy influences are certainly detectable in his art. More surprising is his new attachment to a \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d beauty splurge. What\u2019s thrilling I feel like this is a really exorbitant thing to say because I realise it\u2019s so expensive and it\u2019s actually even a bit crazy that I own this beauty product, but I have La Mer eye cream. I\u2019m turning 30 and I feel like over the last year I\u2019ve kind of really slipped out of my health and my fitness. I just wanted to make a really big effort to change my lifestyle, and become healthier and fitter. [It\u2019s] my guilty pleasure that I\u2019m absolutely excited about but embarrassed to admit. On every beauty blog that I\u2019ve read they recommend La Mer eye cream is the best one and that the skin around the eyes is the first place to see the telltale signs of ageing. So I decided to invest. I\u2019ve become really obsessed with reading biographies. I\u2019m currently reading the unofficial Alexander McQueen biography by Andrew Wilson. I saw the documentary on McQueen about a year ago, just before I went into the studio to record my album. I was just so overcome with emotion when I saw the film and how beautiful his work was. I actually didn\u2019t really know too much about Alexander McQueen personally, and I felt so inspired by his creation that wanted to find out as much as I could about him. I\u2019ve also just finished a book of short stories by Jeffrey Eugenides, Fresh Complaint, that I\u2019ve been really enjoying. I find that I can often read them on the go, which is good for me. What\u2019s nostalgia-inducing I don\u2019t even know if they still make this any more: Crave by Calvin Klein, and it was the first perfume that I saved up to buy with my own money. It sounds like a sweet story. I remember that the ads for this fragrance were so sexually charged. It had this Australian model called Travis Fimmel. He was the face of the campaign for the brand and it was a real sexual awakening for me to see these ads. They went everywhere. This ad, the model and the pose and even the fact that this fragrance is called Crave \u2026 everything about it was so sexually charged. It was Calvin Klein and it seemed like this really sophisticated fragrance, and I remember saving up all my money to go and buy it, which sounds like such a strange thing to do for a 14-year-old but I remember buying it and just really thinking that I was kind of coming into my own as a teenager, like having a sexual awakening. I felt like I was a really precocious teenager. I went to a classical music high school and we studied classical music basically full-time. I was really obsessed with arthouse films and I was really obsessed with reading classic novels, and I thought that over time this stuff together was one day going to turn me into some kind of great artist. Now I just love to read trash and biographies and just relax. But the one book that I do still really feel passionate about, that I just remember loving as a teenager, was Jeffrey Eugenides\u2019 first novel, The Virgin Suicides. I think I read the book at least 10 or 20 times when I was 16 or 17. I don\u2019t really know what that says about my personality. I remember I felt really alone when I was a teenager, and that loneliness manifested in some kind of compassion for [one of the the lead characters] Lux Lisbon, who was really alone in 70s in suburban America, and for some reason I thought that there was some kind of parallel between our lives. I remember it so vividly and the sorts of scenes that it painted of this small, suburban American town where everything seemed so shiny and glossy on the surface, but there was this real dark underbelly just below. It just really resonated with me at that time of my life. Even before that, when I was in primary school, I was always really interested in fantasy books. I would say that this is something that is still with me as an adult today, and has even seeped into a lot of my music writing. In particular I loved this UK author called Diana Wynne Jones who actually wrote the story for Howl\u2019s Moving Castle. I read every fantasy book in her series and also Deltora Quest by Emily Rodda and I was really strongly influenced by the Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales. The pathos and the morals in their stories are things that I still think about in my day-to-day life, in my personal interactions with other people. I still really draw on those old methods and fables for advice, or to see the world in a certain way. What I keep going back to I have three beauty products that I actually have in my bag with me at all times. I\u2019ve learned that any time is a good time to brush your teeth so I always keep a little toothbrush with a small Aesop toothpaste in my bag, and I also use an Aesop sunscreen every day. I have a wonderful combination Irish skin that is pale in some places and bright red in other places and it\u2019s covered in freckles. So I really need that sunscreen. It\u2019s either patchy or it\u2019s red, so it\u2019s gonna be one of the two. I also use Sebamed. It\u2019s just a really, really cheap facial cleanser. It\u2019s like a face and body wash. It\u2019s pretty widely available, but it does the trick every time. I think that cleansing my skin and brushing my teeth and wearing sunscreen are such simple beauty things but they really make a difference. The only thing I know that I\u2019ve reread multiple times as an adult is the fifth book in the Harry Potter series, The Order of the Phoenix. When the Philosopher\u2019s Stone came out I was about about nine or 10. And then when the final book came out, I was finishing high school. So I kind of grew up with Harry in a way. A lot of the milestones that Harry seemed to have in the book were also mirrored by things that were happening in my life at the time. Except you know, I wasn\u2019t really fighting a bunch of Death Eaters. So a little bit different. I\u2019ve never reread the first two books because I always felt like they weren\u2019t as hard-hitting as some of the later ones, although Harry Potter could be considered kind of hard-hitting in a way. There are definitely unexpected things that happen in the novels, like the favourite characters don\u2019t live forever. I think The Order of the Phoenix was the most interesting book in the series because it was when everything changed for Harry and he wasn\u2019t really so much a part of the school system any more. He was becoming a bit more of a rebel and a punk and pushing back against, you know, the administration like the Ministry of Magic and finding his way forward, and it\u2019s when the book started to get really dark. There\u2019s something about that rebellious attitude of Harry\u2019s that I find comforting, I suppose. Jack Colwell\u2019s new single Weak is out now. His debut album, produced by Sarah Blasko, is out in 2020.",

A philanthropic alliance, which Foley describes as \u201cunprecedented\u201d, gave another $1m and $750,000 came from insurance.</p> <p>The community gave money, too: $215,345 came from ordinary members of the public. Others threw themselves into campaigning.</p> <p>Comedian Judith Lucy started working for the theatre in 1989, an \u201cunbearable drama student\u201d new to Melbourne from Perth.

Foley said in a statement: \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough year for the La Mama team but today we look to the future, to seeing the theatre rise from the ashes and to the exciting next stage.\u201d The state government provided an additional $1m after its initial relief package towards the rebuild. A philanthropic alliance, which Foley describes as \u201cunprecedented\u201d, gave another $1m and $750,000 came from insurance. The community gave money, too: $215,345 came from ordinary members of the public. Others threw themselves into campaigning. Comedian Judith Lucy started working for the theatre in 1989, an \u201cunbearable drama student\u201d new to Melbourne from Perth. She worked front of house and then performed her first two shows there \u2013 the first, of course, with a performance poet. She also became one of the public faces of the fundraising campaign. Lucy says she wasn\u2019t surprised by people\u2019s generosity in response to the appeal. \u201cLa Mama isn\u2019t a building. It\u2019s the community that makes La Mama,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very rare thing and it\u2019s helped so many people.\u201d Jones describes La Mama as \u201can artist-led organisation\u201d \u2013 a space where thousands of creative types have had the chance to experiment, fail or thrive on their own terms. Playwright Zoey Dawson is one such artist. When she heard of the fire, she was left with a feeling of disbelief. \u201cIt felt like a place that would be fireproof somehow just from the sheer force of its history,\u201d she says. Dawson moved to Melbourne in 2005, and La Mama was deeply embedded in the theatre culture of the city. Seeing new and experimental work, she says, showed her \u201cthere is more theatre could be doing. There is more that I could do.\u201d This story repeats itself through the generations. When performance maker Maude Davey first went to La Mama in 1983, the space made her \u201cthink about performance in a completely different way.\u201d In 1967, Williamson says, the theatre \u201cwas a revelation\u201d. Even the architect leading the rebuild has a history with the theatre. Meg White worked at La Mama as a stage manager, a performer, a venue manager, and a theatre designer, before finding a new path in architecture. The existing building will be internally rebuilt in \u201cvery particular ways\u201d, Jones says \u2013 the fireplace and the staircase will return. But they will also construct a second building, with new office and rehearsal space. They will also, now, be able to make the building completely accessible. For anything \u2013 let alone a theatre \u2013 to survive 50 years with its spirit unchanging is remarkable. This spirit of La Mama, Jones says, \u201cis the energy that comes from people exploring new ideas and trying something for the very first time, because that\u2019s what basically happens at La Mama. \u201cAnd mostly doing it on the smell of an oily rag. And that\u2019s as it was then, and then pretty much as it is now.\u201d",

Of the high schools they attended, 73% were state high schools (slightly higher than the national average of 66%), 17% private Islamic schools and 6% non-Islamic private schools.\u201d</p> <p>Most jihadists held down jobs before leaving Australia or committing their crime, but their unemployment rate was greater than the national rate (17% to 6%) and they were more than twice as likely to work in blue-collar jobs compared with the general population. The paper argues that the attraction of Islamic State or other terrorist organisation \u201cmay\u2026 have been influenced by a desire to increase personal status\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOccupying for the most part lower status roles in secular Australian society, Australian jihadis may have been attracted to the empowerment and high religious status Islamic State offers martyrs\u2026\u201d </p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The working paper concedes establishing the impact of mental health on jihad is difficult, and contentious, but the working paper found there was little link between established mental health issues and the commission of terror offences.</p> <p>Only two people in Australia \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/02/sydney-pharmacy-student-who-stabbed-man-with-machete-found-guilty-of-terrorism\">Ihsas Khan</a>, who attacked another man with a knife in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs, and Moudasser Taleb, who attempted to travel to Syria to join Islamic State \u2013 have pleaded mental impairment in defence of a terrorism charge.

Studies in Germany, France, the UK and the Netherlands showed a strong link between serious criminal histories and jihad.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost 90% of the Australian terrorists in the data set have either no or minor police records. The \u2018jihadi in pursuit of salvation\u2019 argument therefore holds little weight.\u201d</p> <p>Shanahan said the working paper provided a snapshot of the Australian jihadi cohort, beyond the cliched image of the disaffected, impressionable young man. Australia needed to continue not only to deal with those convicted of terrorist crimes, but also to detect those at risk of being radicalised and offending.</p> <p>\u201cYou can deal with it in terms of legislation, which the Australian government has done: if you don\u2019t display contrition, if it\u2019s deemed you don\u2019t have a good chance of rehabilitation, the Australian government has interim control orders, extended detention orders: legislatively, the steps are there to deal with people who come out of jail.</p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s after someone has committed an offence: we keep coming back to this question of \u2018who are the influencers?\u2019. Most of these people don\u2019t wake up one day and say \u2018I\u2019m going to become a terrorist\u2019, there\u2019s a normalising of language and ideas, and this is something that community leaders need to address \u2013 and in public not in private. We know that it\u2019s not criminality [driving attraction to jihad], it\u2019s not mental health, it\u2019s the attraction of a part of the religion that is spread by Australian and foreign speakers and writers.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The archetypal Australian jihadist has no apparent mental health issues, does not have a refugee background, and is more likely to have gone to a state school than a private Islamic one, according to one of the world\u2019s largest databases of alleged and convicted terrorists. Islamist extremists from Australia tend to be better educated, more likely to be employed and have fewer and less serious criminal convictions than a typical European jihadist, according to the Lowy Institute study of 173 Australians alleged to have become foreign fighters or who have been convicted of terrorism offences. But they are still more likely to be on welfare or do blue-collar work than the average Australian, suggesting that a desire for personal status may be a greater motivator for joining or supporting a terrorist group than religious devotion, poverty or mental health issues \u2013 causes that are popularly cited as driving factors. The Typology of Terror working paper, by the Lowy Institute fellow Rodger Shanahan, studied the backgrounds and characteristics of 173 Australian citizens and residents who are known to have joined radical Islamist terrorist organisations or who have been charged with terrorism offences. It challenges a number of the stereotypes ascribed to those attracted to jihad. The Australia jihadi cohort skews strongly male \u2013 85% to 15% \u2013 and is young, on average, aged 25. Those from Sydney or Melbourne, and from a handful of suburbs within those two cities, account for 90% of the cohort. In Sydney, they lived in the western suburbs, and in Melbourne, there were two distinct northern and southern groups, close to religious institutions. Jihadists are most likely to have attended a state school, and have completed Year 12. \u201cTwenty seven per cent had not completed high school, almost exactly the rate for the rest of Australia. Of the high schools they attended, 73% were state high schools (slightly higher than the national average of 66%), 17% private Islamic schools and 6% non-Islamic private schools.\u201d Most jihadists held down jobs before leaving Australia or committing their crime, but their unemployment rate was greater than the national rate (17% to 6%) and they were more than twice as likely to work in blue-collar jobs compared with the general population. The paper argues that the attraction of Islamic State or other terrorist organisation \u201cmay\u2026 have been influenced by a desire to increase personal status\u201d. \u201cOccupying for the most part lower status roles in secular Australian society, Australian jihadis may have been attracted to the empowerment and high religious status Islamic State offers martyrs\u2026\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The working paper concedes establishing the impact of mental health on jihad is difficult, and contentious, but the working paper found there was little link between established mental health issues and the commission of terror offences. Only two people in Australia \u2013 Ihsas Khan, who attacked another man with a knife in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs, and Moudasser Taleb, who attempted to travel to Syria to join Islamic State \u2013 have pleaded mental impairment in defence of a terrorism charge. A judge accepted Khan suffered mental health issues, but found those did not have a causal effect on the offence, while Taleb\u2019s claim was accepted, a judge ruling his mental illness \u201csignificant impact on his moral culpability\u201d. Australians convicted of terror offences tend to show little contrition for their acts, and have, on the whole, poor chances for rehabilitation, the paper argues. Nearly three-quarters (73.8%) of those convicted displayed no contrition, while fewer than one in 10 (9.5%) displayed \u2018genuine contrition\u2019. Forty per cent were found by judges to have poor or non-existent prospects for rehabilitation. There is no correlation between a refugee background and jihadism: just 6% of the Australian jihadi cohort have a first- or second-generation refugee background. Typology of Terror found many of the characteristics of Australian jihadis matched those from comparable democracies overseas such as the US, and in Europe. But in other ways, Australia differed significantly. Australia has far fewer converts to Islam joining terrorist causes. In Europe and the US, converts to the religion make up about 20% of extremist fighters, in Australia, the figure is 8%. Also, the correlation between criminality and jihadism is weak among the Australian cohort. Studies in Germany, France, the UK and the Netherlands showed a strong link between serious criminal histories and jihad. \u201cAlmost 90% of the Australian terrorists in the data set have either no or minor police records. The \u2018jihadi in pursuit of salvation\u2019 argument therefore holds little weight.\u201d Shanahan said the working paper provided a snapshot of the Australian jihadi cohort, beyond the cliched image of the disaffected, impressionable young man. Australia needed to continue not only to deal with those convicted of terrorist crimes, but also to detect those at risk of being radicalised and offending. \u201cYou can deal with it in terms of legislation, which the Australian government has done: if you don\u2019t display contrition, if it\u2019s deemed you don\u2019t have a good chance of rehabilitation, the Australian government has interim control orders, extended detention orders: legislatively, the steps are there to deal with people who come out of jail. \u201cBut that\u2019s after someone has committed an offence: we keep coming back to this question of \u2018who are the influencers?\u2019. Most of these people don\u2019t wake up one day and say \u2018I\u2019m going to become a terrorist\u2019, there\u2019s a normalising of language and ideas, and this is something that community leaders need to address \u2013 and in public not in private. We know that it\u2019s not criminality [driving attraction to jihad], it\u2019s not mental health, it\u2019s the attraction of a part of the religion that is spread by Australian and foreign speakers and writers.\u201d",

Gans and Leigh note in the US many large companies have monopsony power (essentially a monopoly over the ability to buy labour), and are ruthless at maintaining it \u2013 such as Amazon putting in place hiring conditions that prevent employees from working at similar firms for 18 months after leaving. In such cases the onus is on governments to ensure industrial relation laws prevent such stifling of competition and wages. Similarly Gans and Leigh note that many workers do like the flexibility of the gig or share economy but \u201ceven multiple sharing economy jobs may not allow workers to earn enough to buy a house or raise a family\u201d and \u201cgig economy workers often lack health insurance and retirement savings\u201d and are also \u201cvulnerable to discrimination\u201d. It is not the job of governments to hold back this change but it is, they argue, their job to adapt \u2013 and not treat such workers as old-style independent contractors, when clearly they are closer to employees. Last month the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, took such a line when he argued \u201cit is time to have a conversation about new forms of worker protections, which can be made as flexible as the gig economy jobs they could cover, as well as benefit more traditional industries\u201d. Gans and Leigh argue that rather than worry about what taxes need to be cut to encourage innovation, government should be more worried about fostering a rise in people who are willing and able to innovate. As such education is a key \u2013 and importantly good teachers. They note that \u201cthe difference between good and bad teachers translates into $250,000-higher lifetime earnings for every child\u201d \u2013 which if applied across a class of 20 or more students makes a terrific teacher \u201cliterally worth their weight in gold\u201d. So much government policy is developed through a myopic view that people only do things for profit and that the more profit they can make the more likely they will be to pursue innovation. Gans and Leigh provide a strong counter to this, arguing that while innovation is a key to driving productivity, the improvements in living standards that should flow as a result can only come if governments pursue policies that aim \u201cto boost both innovation and equality\u201d. They argue this is akin to house or car insurance \u2013 in an uncertain world \u201csociety\u201d, they write, \u201cneeds to think about social insurance policies that suit an uncertain future.\u201d \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "body": "<p>Robert Ponsonby, who has died aged 92, was a highly influential figure in music administration, directing the Edinburgh festival from 1955 to 1960 and the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts (now the BBC Proms) from 1974 to 1986, during which period he also served as the controller of Radio 3.</p> <p>Between those posts he acted as the general administrator of the Scottish National Orchestra (1964-72), while in later years he devoted his energies to a considerable number of musical institutions, notably the Musicians Benevolent Fund, the Young Concert Artists Trust, the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation and the Purcell school.</p> <p>Highlights of his Edinburgh tenure included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/17/maria-callas-dead-opera-1977\" title=\"\">Maria Callas</a> and the La Scala company in Bellini\u2019s La Sonnambula; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/12/guardianobituaries.arts\" title=\"\">Birgit Nilsson</a> (with Set Svanholm, Kerstin Meyer and Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m) in Wagner\u2019s Die Walk\u00fcre; Britten conducting Britten and accompanying Peter Pears; Isaac Stern with Myra Hess; the young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/18/dietrich-fischer-dieskau\" title=\"\">Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau</a> and Irmgard Seefried in lieder by Hugo Wolf; and Victoria de los Angeles in Falla\u2019s La Vida Breve and in recitals with Gerald Moore. He also secured some fine theatrical performances, such as Christopher Plummer\u2019s Henry V with the company of Stratford, Ontario.</p> <p>On the lighter side, he brought to the festival the singer-comedian Anna Russell, Flanders and Swann and Beyond the Fringe.

      "bodyText": "Robert Ponsonby, who has died aged 92, was a highly influential figure in music administration, directing the Edinburgh festival from 1955 to 1960 and the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts (now the BBC Proms) from 1974 to 1986, during which period he also served as the controller of Radio 3. Between those posts he acted as the general administrator of the Scottish National Orchestra (1964-72), while in later years he devoted his energies to a considerable number of musical institutions, notably the Musicians Benevolent Fund, the Young Concert Artists Trust, the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation and the Purcell school. Highlights of his Edinburgh tenure included Maria Callas and the La Scala company in Bellini\u2019s La Sonnambula; Birgit Nilsson (with Set Svanholm, Kerstin Meyer and Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m) in Wagner\u2019s Die Walk\u00fcre; Britten conducting Britten and accompanying Peter Pears; Isaac Stern with Myra Hess; the young Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Irmgard Seefried in lieder by Hugo Wolf; and Victoria de los Angeles in Falla\u2019s La Vida Breve and in recitals with Gerald Moore. He also secured some fine theatrical performances, such as Christopher Plummer\u2019s Henry V with the company of Stratford, Ontario. On the lighter side, he brought to the festival the singer-comedian Anna Russell, Flanders and Swann and Beyond the Fringe. He later described the Edinburgh years as his \u201capprenticeship\u201d, his learning curve encompassing handling great artists, dealing with foreign agencies and \u201cuncomprehending bureaucrats\u201d, not to mention the press. There were also the civic authorities to contend with and it was their \u201cindifference, sometimes approaching hostility\u201d, coupled with severe economic constraints, that precipitated his ultimate resignation. Those pragmatic skills were to be tested further in his years at the BBC, an organisation he described as \u201cmy bread and butter (and sometimes jam) for 13 years\u201d. One incident on his watch left a bitter taste, however: a strike by BBC musicians that resulted in the cancellation of 20 concerts in the 1980 season. The corporation had proposed, on artistic as well as financial grounds, to disband five of its 11 full-time in-house ensembles, including the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. There was strong resistance from the music community, with a petition to parliament gathering half a million signatures. The BBCSSO was reprieved, though only five of the original ensembles remain today. Unhappy with the corporation\u2019s handling of the affair, Ponsonby contemplated resigning, but was persuaded otherwise by Colin Davis. There was also the ever-controversial issue of programming the Proms. As successor to William Glock, whose devotion to the avant garde was not to all tastes, Ponsonby endeavoured to steer a course between Glock\u2019s rigorous modernism and English late Romantic composers, for which there was enthusiastic lobbying. His policy was to draw on the vastly expanding classical repertoire, not least with regard to contemporary British composers. These included Harrison Birtwistle, Simon Bainbridge, David Blake, Peter Maxwell Davies, Jonathan Harvey, Robin Holloway, Oliver Knussen, Nicholas Maw, Giles Swayne, Hugh Wood and many others. Inevitably there were still carpers, although no one could accuse Ponsonby of box-ticking: his programming, frequently inspired, was underpinned by wide experience and total integrity. Born in Oxford, he was the older son of Noel Ponsonby, organist of Christ Church, and his wife, Mary (nee White-Thomson). He studied at Eton and then served in the Scots Guards (1945-47).

At the start of 1951 he joined the staff of Glyndebourne opera, learning the craft from Moran Caplat and Ian Hunter, former assistants of Rudolf Bing. He remained Hunter\u2019s assistant until 1955, describing him as \u201cthe most successful impresario of his generation\u201d, before taking Hunter\u2019s place as director of the Edinburgh festival. His diplomatic skills were tested there on many occasions. He liked to tell the story of the conductor Otto Klemperer insisting on exchanging his hotel suite for a room in the spartan hostel where the orchestra were lodged in order to gain closer proximity to an attractive female player to whom he had taken a fancy. Ponsonby\u2019s discreet solution, to which the maestro reluctantly agreed, was for Klemperer to sleep at his hotel but to be allowed to spend daylight hours at the hostel. On leaving Edinburgh, Ponsonby spent two less than rewarding years with the Independent Television Authority (1962-64), moving gratefully from there to the Scottish National Orchestra at the invitation of the musical director, Alexander Gibson. Ponsonby said he learned most of what he knew about the psychology of orchestral musicians and their relationship with conductors from the SNO, and recalled his eight years in Glasgow as the most satisfying of his career. On leaving the BBC, he became artistic director of the Canterbury festival (1987-88) and played an active role behind the scenes of British musical life as an adviser, programme consultant or trustee of numerous organisations. In his book Musical Heroes (2009) he wrote informatively and entertainingly about individuals in the musical world (mostly conductors, composers and performers) he admired. An extended interview with Pierre Boulez, derived from one of the six programmes Ponsonby made for the BBC\u2019s World Service, is particularly valuable for his penetrating observations and technical insights of the French conductor. Ponsonby\u2019s exceptional height of 6ft 6in, and a certain reserve, made him seem more remote than he was. The obituaries of leading musicians he wrote for this and other newspapers were well-informed and highly readable, while a keen sense of humour is evident in both Musical Heroes and a later collection that complements it, In and Out of Tune (2016). He was married twice: to Una Kenny in 1957 and to Lesley Black in 1977. Both marriages ended in divorce. \u2022 Robert Noel Ponsonby, arts administrator, born 19 December 1926; died 3 November 2019",

India took advantage of this to win a Test series in Australia for the first time last summer, now Pakistan have a similar chance. But India didn\u2019t have to bowl to Smith, and as he proved in England recently, he can literally be the difference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/01/steve-smith-ashes-fourth-test-old-trafford-ben-stokes-joe-root\">by himself</a>.

Indeed, of the state\u2019s six congressional districts, Edwards won a majority in just one: the blue-leaning 2nd district, which includes swaths of Baton Rouge and New Orleans. While Edwards took the governor\u2019s race, Republicans seized a super-majority in the Louisiana senate, giving them the power to override gubernatorial vetoes, and gained five seats in the Louisiana house, just two short of a super-majority. As Stephen Waguespack of the conservative Louisiana Association of Business and Industry <a href=\"https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/elections/article_0db3d712-0997-11ea-bda7-2355c74f8b57.html\">enthused</a>: \u201cThe [Louisiana] legislature is more conservative, more pro-business than ever before.\u201d</p> <p>The disconnect between Democrats\u2019 victory in the governor\u2019s race and their eroding ground in the state legislature speaks to the power of Republican gerrymandering, which has greatly diluted the electoral clout of Democrats in Louisiana and other southern states. For Democrats, this is one reason that Edwards\u2019 victory was so critical: when Louisiana begins redistricting in 2021, Governor Edwards will have veto power over legislative and congressional maps created by the state legislature, forcing compromises that could, for example, lead to the creation of a second Democratic-leaning congressional district.</p> <p>Aside from Trump\u2019s diminishing power to inspire voters, what else might Louisiana tell us about the country\u2019s political landscape heading into 2020? One lesson is that, if Democrats hope to succeed in 2020 \u2013 not only in the presidential contest, but all down-ticket races \u2013 they must energize and mobilize their base. In much of the south, this means African American voters. Edwards only got a majority in one congressional district, but the 85% of votes he won in the heavily African American, disproportionately urban 2nd district made all the difference. Between the 12 October primary and last weekend\u2019s runoff in the governor\u2019s race, turnout in the second district jumped by 42,000 voters \u2013 a critical boost in a race Edwards won by just over 40,000 votes statewide.</p> <p>That mobilization didn\u2019t happen by itself. The Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, a group of progressive community organizations in Louisiana, contacted 900,000 voters in the fall elections \u2013 mostly in communities of color \u2013 through door visits, phone calls and text messages. National groups like Black Voters Matter raised visibility about the elections in African American communities. And teachers, a key force in Edwards\u2019 first victory in 2015 as well as Democratic governor-elect Andy Beshear\u2019s recent win in Kentucky, also mobilized tens of thousands of voters.</p> <p>This points to another important ingredient in the Democrats\u2019 win in Louisiana: a progressive populist agenda. While Edwards drew headlines for his conservative stances on abortion and guns, he energized the Democratic base \u2013 and won over white moderates in the suburbs \u2013 through a campaign that focused on his implementation of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which covers more than 400,000 people in Louisiana. According to Edwards\u2019 lead pollster, Zac McCrary, Medicaid expansion was the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/18/what-john-bel-edwards-big-louisiana-win-says-about-democrats-trump/\">top factor</a> in the governor\u2019s victory; it was also a key issue in elections this year in Kentucky\u2019s gubernatorial race and in Virginia, where Democrats won control of the both chambers of the general assembly.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"https://www.theadvocate.com/video/player/?video_id=688555\">victory speech</a>, Edwards pledged his commitment to a host of progressive-populist issues which helped move his multiracial, urban and suburban coalition: investing in schools and infrastructure, support for early childhood education, an increase to the state minimum wage, and equal pay for men and women.</p> <p>As for Trump?

The case has reopened the row over secularism in France just weeks after a Muslim woman was asked to remove her headscarf while accompanying a school outing. The nun, who is in her 70s and has spent her entire adult life in a convent, wanted to retire to Vesoul in eastern France, where she was born, and applied for a self-contained apartment with a communal eating room at a local authority-run care home. She received a letter from the town hall telling her that she was on a waiting list for a place but because of France\u2019s strict rules on secularism, she would have to remove her habit and headscarf. \u201cWithin our homes, our residents may have preferences and beliefs and these should be respected \u2026 with regard to secularism, all ostentatious religious symbols cannot be allowed in order to guarantee everyone\u2019s tranquility,\u201d it read.

He told one broadcaster it would be over the course of a parliament but it was later clarified to be a long-term ambition with no deadline. He also appeared to suggest wrongly that the initial \u00a39,500 level would lead to tax bills lower by \u00a3500 a year, instead of \u00a385 per year.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe \u00a39,500 \u2026 it\u2019ll be soon in the next parliament if we\u2019re lucky enough to be re-elected.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has said he wants to raise the national insurance threshold to \u00a312,500, letting slip a major Tory tax cut from the manifesto as he was speaking to workers in Teesside. The prime minister blurted out the key announcement as he was pressed by an employee at a fabrication yard about whether he would help \u201cpeople like us\u201d, not just the rich. However, it quickly emerged that the Tories would only pledge to raise the threshold to \u00a39,500 next year, then lift it gradually over many years until it reached the target \u00a312,500. The policy would initially be a tax cut of about \u00a385 a year and aim towards a reduction of around \u00a3460 for everyone earning more than the current threshold of \u00a38,632. Johnson originally claimed the target would be \u00a312,000, not \u00a312,500, then stumbled over the timescale for the promise. He told one broadcaster it would be over the course of a parliament but it was later clarified to be a long-term ambition with no deadline. He also appeared to suggest wrongly that the initial \u00a39,500 level would lead to tax bills lower by \u00a3500 a year, instead of \u00a385 per year. \u201cThe \u00a39,500 \u2026 it\u2019ll be soon in the next parliament if we\u2019re lucky enough to be re-elected. This will put around \u00a3500 in people\u2019s pockets,\u201d he said, incorrectly. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that the initial increase alone would cost \u00a32bn. Xiaowei Xu, a research economist at the IFS, said reducing the NI threshold was the \u201cbest targeted way of helping low earners if restricting oneself to the direct tax system\u201d, but added: \u201cIf the intention is to help the lowest-paid, raising the NICs threshold is an extremely blunt instrument. Less than 10% of the total gains from raising NICs thresholds accrue to the poorest fifth of working households.\u201d Johnson was caught off-guard by the question from Claire Cartlidge, a fuel quality manager at the yard, who asked whether he was promising low taxes for all or just for people like himself. \u201cI mean low tax for working people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at what we are doing and what I said in the last few days, we are going to be cutting national insurance up to \u00a312,000. And we are going to make sure we cut business rates for small businesses, we are cutting tax for working people, by the way.\u201d Tory advisers were taken by surprise by Johnson letting slip the announcement, which was due to be a flagship element of the manifesto briefed to Sunday newspapers. The manifesto is due to be published on Sunday, which Tory sources said was aimed for maximum impact on the weekend evening news bulletin and to \u201cattract the Countryfile audience\u201d \u2013 referring to those who might switch to the news after watching a popular Sunday night programme. However, the mistaken announcement will not be unhelpful to the prime minister on a day when his campaign has been overshadowed by a row about the Conservative party Twitter account masquerading as a factchecking service. Twitter has criticised the party\u2019s move as misleading and warned it not to do it again. Earlier on the campaign trail, Johnson said his manifesto would tackle the social care crisis and repeated a pledge to make sure no older person would lose their home in order to fund their care. There were reports on Wednesday night that he plans to put an extra \u00a35bn of funding into the system.

The prime minister was later grilled by journalists on his manifesto but he declined to give any more details. Asked whether he would release his own tax return, he said he \u201calways\u201d released his tax return, even though he has not done so since he was London mayor in 2016.

The Burmese leader, once an icon of democracy but now tainted by her association with what UN investigators have described as crimes against humanity, will lead a delegation to the international court of justice (ICJ) next month. This month the Gambia lodged a 46-page application to the UN\u2019s highest court alleging Myanmar had carried out mass murder, rape and destruction of communities in Rakhine state, including against Rohingya people.

      "bodyText": "Tottenham Hotspur have acted swiftly to appoint Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as their new manager on a contract that will run until the end of the 2022-23 season following Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s sacking on Tuesday. Less than 12 hours after Pochettino was relieved of his duties by chairman Daniel Levy, Spurs confirmed that Mourinho will take charge of his third Premier League club after two spells at Chelsea and one at Manchester United. That ended with him being sacked by United in December last year, with the 56-year-old having since worked as a television pundit. Yet even with Mourinho having made no secret of his desire to return to England despite being linked with a second spell at Real Madrid, his appointment still comes as something of a surprise. But Levy admitted that the Portuguese\u2019s vast experience as a manager which includes winning three Premier League titles for Chelsea and two Champions Leagues, with Porto and Internazionale, had been a major factor in the decision. \u201cIn Jos\u00e9 we have one of the most successful managers in football,\u201d said Levy. \u201cHe has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.\u201d Mourinho was spending Wednesday afternoon meeting his new squad at their north London training base and putting them through their paces for the first time in preparation for his first game at West Ham on Saturday. \u201cI am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.\u201d He has moved quickly to appoint his backroom staff, with Jo\u00e3o Sacramento and Nuno Santos joining from Lille.

      "body": "<p>For the first time in my life I now feel able to consider a more fulfilled and \u201cnormal\u201d life. Picking up a cold and ending up in hospital may no longer be my reality and the thought of reaching middle-age seems more realistic. This follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/24/nhs-england-vertex-agrees-price-for-orkambi-unaffordable-cystic-fibrosis-drug\" title=\"\">the huge victory of cystic fibrosis patients</a> and the parents of children with the condition to get access to life-changing drugs on the NHS across the UK.</p> <p>I was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when I was six. I\u2019m now 21, and since then have been under a strict medical regime which sees me spend three hours a day undergoing treatment; a combination of 30 tablets a day, inhaled medications and constant physiotherapy. Despite my daily routine, I also get admitted into hospital when I pick up a lung infection, leaving me in a hospital isolation room for two weeks at a time. This takes me away from my family and friends, and has had a huge impact on my education and work opportunities.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/what-is-cystic-fibrosis/faqs\" title=\"\">Cystic fibrosis is an invisible, life-shortening genetic condition</a>. It causes passageways in the lungs and digestive system to become blocked with thick, sticky secretions, causing irreversible fatal lung damage as well as other health problems. The average life expectancy is about 47 years for half of those born with cystic fibrosis. Much less for others. But now a price deal between the US drug manufacturer, Vertex, and the NHS means that about 5,000 adults and children such as me can look forward to a longer life. One of the drugs, Orkambi, has been shown to increase a patient\u2019s lung function by up to 20%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The years of struggle by people with CF to gain access to these drugs has taken its toll</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few months before the deal, my consultant told me I had the correct CF mutations to take Symkevi, a sister drug to Orkambi and one that has, along with Kalydeco, also been made available on the NHS. At the time, access to these medications, which carried the unaffordable price tag of \u00a3100,000 per patient per year, still didn\u2019t seem very hopeful, and the four-year battle to get Vertex to lower its price saw many lose hope. My doctor warned me that it could still be a long wait, so the news that a deal had finally been done was unbelievable at first.</p> <p>These drugs will significantly improve the quality of life for so many with CF, reducing the daily treatment times, amount of tablets needed, hospital admissions and hopefully avoiding the need for lung transplants. However, the years of struggle by people with CF to gain access to these drugs has taken its toll. Parents watched as their children became more unwell, their lungs filling with mucus, causing lasting damage and knowing their children may die without better treatments. After the tireless efforts of everyone in the CF community, it is a huge victory to be able to get hold of these drugs.</p> <p>But how secure is this arrangement? Will Britain\u2019s proposed exit from the EU hinder access to these medications? Vertex has assured me that: \u201cWhen the UK leaves the European Union, all eligible patients across the UK will continue to have access to Vertex licensed CF medicines, as contractually agreed.\u201d </p> <p>Yet recent reports suggest that a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal could see US drug companies <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-11-12/could-a-post-brexit-trade-deal-with-the-us-cost-the-nhs-500-million-a-week/\" title=\"\">drive up the costs of the drugs</a> they currently sell to the NHS. Considering how hard we had to fight to get these medications, it is terrifying to know that if political circumstances change, our lives may once again hang in the balance. These decisions are in the hands of people unaffected by this debilitating illness, who will not value Orkambi in the same way those with CF do. We have to hope that the fight for our lives wasn\u2019t in vain.</p> <p>\u2022 Isabelle Jani-Friend is a journalist</p>",

      "bodyText": "For the first time in my life I now feel able to consider a more fulfilled and \u201cnormal\u201d life. Picking up a cold and ending up in hospital may no longer be my reality and the thought of reaching middle-age seems more realistic. This follows the huge victory of cystic fibrosis patients and the parents of children with the condition to get access to life-changing drugs on the NHS across the UK. I was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when I was six. I\u2019m now 21, and since then have been under a strict medical regime which sees me spend three hours a day undergoing treatment; a combination of 30 tablets a day, inhaled medications and constant physiotherapy. Despite my daily routine, I also get admitted into hospital when I pick up a lung infection, leaving me in a hospital isolation room for two weeks at a time. This takes me away from my family and friends, and has had a huge impact on my education and work opportunities. Cystic fibrosis is an invisible, life-shortening genetic condition. It causes passageways in the lungs and digestive system to become blocked with thick, sticky secretions, causing irreversible fatal lung damage as well as other health problems. The average life expectancy is about 47 years for half of those born with cystic fibrosis. Much less for others. But now a price deal between the US drug manufacturer, Vertex, and the NHS means that about 5,000 adults and children such as me can look forward to a longer life. One of the drugs, Orkambi, has been shown to increase a patient\u2019s lung function by up to 20%. A few months before the deal, my consultant told me I had the correct CF mutations to take Symkevi, a sister drug to Orkambi and one that has, along with Kalydeco, also been made available on the NHS. At the time, access to these medications, which carried the unaffordable price tag of \u00a3100,000 per patient per year, still didn\u2019t seem very hopeful, and the four-year battle to get Vertex to lower its price saw many lose hope. My doctor warned me that it could still be a long wait, so the news that a deal had finally been done was unbelievable at first. These drugs will significantly improve the quality of life for so many with CF, reducing the daily treatment times, amount of tablets needed, hospital admissions and hopefully avoiding the need for lung transplants. However, the years of struggle by people with CF to gain access to these drugs has taken its toll. Parents watched as their children became more unwell, their lungs filling with mucus, causing lasting damage and knowing their children may die without better treatments. After the tireless efforts of everyone in the CF community, it is a huge victory to be able to get hold of these drugs. But how secure is this arrangement? Will Britain\u2019s proposed exit from the EU hinder access to these medications? Vertex has assured me that: \u201cWhen the UK leaves the European Union, all eligible patients across the UK will continue to have access to Vertex licensed CF medicines, as contractually agreed.\u201d Yet recent reports suggest that a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal could see US drug companies drive up the costs of the drugs they currently sell to the NHS. Considering how hard we had to fight to get these medications, it is terrifying to know that if political circumstances change, our lives may once again hang in the balance. These decisions are in the hands of people unaffected by this debilitating illness, who will not value Orkambi in the same way those with CF do. We have to hope that the fight for our lives wasn\u2019t in vain. \u2022 Isabelle Jani-Friend is a journalist",

      "bodyText": "Doctors have put humans into a state of suspended animation for the first time in a groundbreaking trial that aims to buy more time for surgeons to save seriously injured patients. The process involves rapidly cooling the brain to less than 10C by replacing the patient\u2019s blood with ice-cold saline solution. Typically the solution is pumped directly into the aorta, the main artery that carries blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. Known formally as emergency preservation and resuscitation, or EPR, the procedure is being trialled on people who sustain such catastrophic injuries that they are in danger of bleeding to death and who suffer a heart attack shortly before they can be treated. The patients, who are often victims of stabbings or shootings, would normally have less than a 5% chance of survival. Samuel Tisherman, at the University of Maryland, in Baltimore, described the trial at a recent symposium held by the New York Academy of Sciences. He said at least one patient had had the procedure but did not elaborate on whether that patient or any others had survived. The first time the team performed the process was \u201ca little surreal\u201d, he told New Scientist magazine. Rapid cooling of trauma victims is designed to reduce brain activity to a near standstill and to slow the patient\u2019s physiology enough to give surgeons precious extra minutes, perhaps more than an hour, to operate. Once the patient\u2019s injuries have been attended to, they are warmed up and resuscitated. One aim of the US trial is to reduce the brain damage that patients are often left with if they survive such serious injuries. When the heart stops and blood stops circulating, the brain quickly becomes starved of oxygen, suffering irreparable damage within about five minutes. The trial will compare the outcomes of 20 men and women who receive standard emergency care or EPR. The trial is due to run until the end of the year, and full results are not expected until late 2020. Previous studies have shown that EPR can help save injured pigs, though it is by no means successful all the time. \u201cWe felt it was time to take it to our patients,\u201d Tisherman told New Scientist, which was the first to report on the work. \u201cNow we are doing it and we are learning a lot as we move forward with the trial. Once we can prove it works here, we can expand the utility of this technique to help patients survive that otherwise would not.\u201d One complication of the procedure is that patients\u2019 cells can become damaged as they are warmed up after surgery.

      "bodyText": "Democratic presidential candidates have been urged to address modern-day voter suppression at Wednesday\u2019s debate in Atlanta by the chair of Georgia\u2019s Democratic party. Nikema Williams, a Georgia state senator and the first African American woman to hold leadership of the party in the state, told the Guardian she would like to see \u201cmultiple questions\u201d related to voting rights asked of the 10 candidates set to appear on Wednesday evening. \u201cI would like to see multiple questions because there are multiple suppressive tactics at play here [in Georgia],\u201d Williams said on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that on the debate stage tomorrow night we hear not only the issue of voter suppression because it was so front and center here, but also, how do we address it moving forward?\u201d The issue of voter suppression in Georgia was thrust into the national spotlight last year during Stacey Abrams\u2019s historic bid for the governorship, which she lost by about 55,000 votes amid allegations of voter suppression at the hands of her Republican opponent, Georgia\u2019s former secretary of state Brian Kemp. Since a 2013 supreme court decision removed central protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Georgia and dozens of other states have implemented new laws, including voter rolls purges, stricter registration criteria and Voter ID laws, which opponents say make it harder to vote and target minority communities who tend to vote Democrat. Despite this surge in new practices, the issue has not been raised in any of the Democratic primary debates so far. \u201cEvery candidate on that stage should want exactly what we want as Georgia Democrats, and that is when we look someone in the eye and tell them to show up and vote and that their vote will be counted, we need to mean it. And I\u2019m looking forward to hearing how the presidential candidates address that,\u201d Williams said. Williams was among a group of protesters arrested at the Georgia state house last year during a voting rights rally held while the outcome of the gubernatorial election was still being decided. The case against Williams and 14 others was later dropped. Although all the Democratic presidential candidates support automatic voter registration for voting age Americans, a central part of voting rights legislation passed by the Democrat controlled House of Representatives but not by the Republican Senate, there is significant disagreement on other voting rights issues. While many Democrats, including senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, support abolishing the US electoral college in favour of a popular vote to elect the president, other more centrist candidates are opposed to such a move. Candidates including mayor Pete Buttigeg and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro support lowering the voting age to 16, while others including billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer oppose it. With the particularities of voting rights up to debate, advocates are hoping to make the topic a national conversation before Americans head to the polls.",

It\u2019s an entertaining pirate romp around the Ottoman empire with some dazzling virtuoso dancing, but as the African American dancer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/07/misty-copeland-interview-ballet-broken-disney-nutcracker-prince-obama\">Misty Copeland </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/07/misty-copeland-interview-ballet-broken-disney-nutcracker-prince-obama\">told me in an interview</a>: \u201cYou think of Corsaire as this light thing, but it\u2019s not really \u2013 it\u2019s about slaves, these women chained up.\u201d And it\u2019s all presented as glossy entertainment.</p> <p>Probably the most blatant example comes in the character of the Moor in Mikhail Fokine\u2019s Petrushka, from 1911. He\u2019s lazy, stupid and prone to violence, praying to a coconut and played by a blacked-up dancer. Last year saw two new versions of Petrushka, by Johan Inger and Edward Clug, that redrew the ballet for modern audiences. But there remains the question of what to do with the original \u2013 one of dancer Vaslav Nijinsky\u2019s most famous roles, with a brilliant Stravinsky score.</p> <p>Do you drop problematic ballets from the repertoire, tweak them around the edges, or keep them on show for archive value? Ballets are not objects like paintings or books, so they can\u2019t be reflected on at arm\u2019s length. To keep them alive, they have to be re-embodied with those stereotypes acted out all over again. And the dressing up is more crudely literal than, say, the gamelan-inspired music of Debussy, which nobody is boycotting due to cultural appropriation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"11603371a5fe6cbee2a5cafddd8dd7363f91e298\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11603371a5fe6cbee2a5cafddd8dd7363f91e298/0_0_3086_2999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Abetting ethnic stereotyping\u2019 \u2026 La Bayad\u00e8re by the Royal Ballet in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"972\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Abetting ethnic stereotyping\u2019 \u2026 La Bayad\u00e8re by the Royal Ballet in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/apr/15/kevin-ohare-weve-got-choreographers-that-people-around-the-world-want\">Kevin O\u2019Hare</a> began his dancing career in the 1980s with the Sadler\u2019s Wells Royal Ballet when the application of \u201cwet brown\u201d pancake to play swarthy Gypsy roles was par for the course. When you\u2019re immersed in the ballet world from a young age, he says, \u201cthat\u2019s just how things are\u201d. Now that he\u2019s artistic director of the Royal Ballet, however, he takes a more nuanced view. \u201cSuddenly, you look through a different lens, and sometimes I don\u2019t feel things are right for the sensibilities of today\u2019s world.\u201d<br><br>The Nutcracker is a prime example. In 2016, O\u2019Hare oversaw a revision of the Chinese dance into a cheery athletic variation. National dances are a fixture of the big 19th-century ballets: Spanish, Ukrainian, Arabian, Hungarian, Polish. But the European dances tend to be based on genuine folk steps, whereas the Arabian and Chinese variations were imaginative guesses and the Middle Eastern dances were invariably slinky, midriff-exposed harem delights.</p> <p>That jewel-encrusted orientalism, very present in the India-set La Bayad\u00e8re, is less straightforward to deal with than the sight of a dancer blacking up. O\u2019Hare thought in earnest about the decision to stage La Bayad\u00e8re last year. It was never intended as a piece of realism \u2013 its most famous scene is an opium dream of mesmerising ballerinas in white tutus. But still, he says, \u201cit sits awkwardly now, the idea of what India was\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have the feeling that we are going softer and softer, so as not to hurt anybody</p> <footer> <cite>Jean-Christophe Maillot</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adjustments were made to the makeup, including the soot-stained skin of some characters that could be mistaken for \u201cblackface\u201d. O\u2019Hare wants to put the work in context, with programme notes and talks surrounding the main show (including one from Indian choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/26/shobana-jeyasingh-bayadere-the-ninth-life-review-linbury-studio\">own work made in response to La Bayad\u00e8re</a> was performed at the Royal Opera House in 2015). \u201cYou\u2019re encouraging the audience not to take it at face value,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a history lesson.\u201d Which all sounds very reasonable, even if it doesn\u2019t change the content of the ballet.</p> <p>The Royal Ballet\u2019s production thankfully does without <em>la danse de n\u00e9grillons</em>, eight young dancers made up like minstrels, but some versions retain it. During Benjamin Millepied\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/12/benjamin-millepied-interview-paris-opera-natalie-portman-la-dance-project\">recent short-lived directorship</a> of the fiercely traditional Paris Opera Ballet, he attempted an update, turning the n\u00e9grillons into a \u201cchildren\u2019s dance\u201d, no face-paint required, and riling the conservative establishment.</p> <p>Purging offensive elements from modern productions may seem an obvious move in 21st-century Britain, but that view meets surprising resistance. Cultural differences in various countries play a major part, and there\u2019s the fear that once you start \u201ccorrecting\u201d the rep, you\u2019ll end up with nothing left: the Gypsies in Don Quixote or Two Pigeons, perhaps, and let\u2019s not get started on sexual politics. But more than that, because ballet is not a concrete product and you can\u2019t rely on the foundations of it always to be there, the responsibility to preserve the past must be taken seriously.</p> <p>Jean-Christophe Maillot is artistic director of Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo, known for stylish modern remakes of famous titles including Swan Lake, Romeo and Juliet and Copp\u00e9lia. But the company\u2019s repertoire includes original works of the legendary Ballets Russes, including Petrushka. And these, for Maillot, are sacrosanct.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47772c929eb5c9c0786c782bc9b209262e749278\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47772c929eb5c9c0786c782bc9b209262e749278/0_176_3780_2269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Response to a classic \u2026 Shobana Jeyasingh\u2019s Bayad\u00e8re \u2013 The Ninth Life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New approach \u2026 Shobana Jeyasingh\u2019s Bayad\u00e8re \u2013 The Ninth Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I perform the original Petrushka, it\u2019s exactly like when I go to the Louvre and see a beautiful Renoir painting,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s [an image of] a certain time. If I do Taming of the Shrew, the position of the woman in Shakespeare\u2019s work is truly unacceptable today. So should we destroy Shakespeare? The idea is to respect the memory of the original work. It is out of the question to change anything in it.\u201d And that means absolutely anything, including a white dancer wearing black makeup. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting mark of what the world was at that time \u2013 and that\u2019s what art is.\u201d</p> <p>What about those offended by the portrayal of the Moor? \u201cCan we fight against stupidity?\u201d says Maillot. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this piece is from 1911 and it has to be put in context.\u201d He is obviously energised by the issue. \u201cI have the feeling that, to not hurt anybody, we are going softer and softer to reach a point where everybody everywhere is speaking the same language with the same accent. Everybody is getting contentious about everything, and we should resist that a little bit.\u201d For him, it\u2019s akin to censorship. \u201cWe know how to be politically correct, but we\u2019re dying from that. I take the risk of [people] not understanding, being shocked by what I put on stage. If we destroy that freedom, I think it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Maillot celebrates the distinctively different cultures that have contributed to dance history, but the fact is that cultural borders are dissolving and ballet is now a global industry: a performance in Moscow can be beamed to a cinema in Massachusetts. Romanian choreographer Edward Clug recently fell foul of US distributors with his Petrushka for the Bolshoi. In Clug\u2019s version, the setting and characters are starkly abstracted, the Moor no longer a caricature. The Moor\u2019s makeup, however, was a mask-like oval painted in black.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07b1bfb98855ffd6a3ffdb2f55826e1c1bfe5582\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07b1bfb98855ffd6a3ffdb2f55826e1c1bfe5582/0_321_2586_3232/800.jpg\" alt=\"A dancer in minstrel makeup \u2026 the 1991 Petrushka by Birmingham Royal Ballet.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dancer in minstrel makeup \u2026 the 1991 Petrushka by Birmingham Royal Ballet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Jack/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI thought that was a discreet solution,\u201d says Clug, \u201cbut already that was too obvious for the American distributors.\u201d They came up with two black dots on the cheeks instead. Clug seems bemused by the whole episode, but open-minded. \u201cI like the idea of being able to share with more people,\u201d he says.<br><br>Racism in ballet is often a subtle and subjective question. Some black ballet dancers, for example, wear tights the colour of their own skin, as opposed to standard pink; others don\u2019t see the need. Sometimes it\u2019s less subtle, like the school of thought that there shouldn\u2019t be any black dancers in the corps de ballet of classic \u201cballet blanc\u201d, because the identical nature of the performers is its whole raison d\u2019etre.</p> <p>Maillot says: \u201cIf you ask me if a traditional Swan Lake at the Mariinsky can have a black girl in the corps de ballet, I can tell you honestly that I don\u2019t have the answer. But I feel like telling you no.\u201d His purism is not so much about race as about not having any deviation from a very particular image. For Maillot, only dancers with the same bodies, schooling and style should dance a traditional Swan Lake. That\u2019s why he made a new version for his own company.</p> <p>At the Royal Ballet, some variation in swans is allowed, and the approach to casting is colourblind. \u201cIt\u2019s not, \u2018Oh we\u2019ve got five Asian men in the company, let\u2019s do the Chinese dance,\u2019\u201d says O\u2019Hare. During a show\u2019s run, across different casts there may be white, black and Asian dancers playing the same role \u201cand nobody bats an eyelid\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3f86e22d4da8ce1aa7e78dd95419873492bc535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3f86e22d4da8ce1aa7e78dd95419873492bc535/0_145_3000_2194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s about slaves, women chained up\u2019 \u2026 English National Ballet\u2019s 2013 production of Le Corsaire, with Alina Cojocaru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"731\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s about slaves, women chained up\u2019 \u2026 English National Ballet\u2019s 2013 production of Le Corsaire, with Alina Cojocaru.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arnaud Stephenson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Petrushka, O\u2019Hare thinks it would have to be a remake. But the issue of cultural appropriation is not consigned to historical ballets. He hints at a new commission coming up \u201cfrom a different culture to ours\u201d and says: \u201cWe\u2019re really serious about talking to the right people, making sure we\u2019re going to do it in the right way.\u201d</p> <p>How about hiring an Indian choreographer if you want to make a ballet about India? \u201cI suppose you could,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if an Indian choreographer comes with a great idea, then yes. But there is nothing wrong with somebody who isn\u2019t from that heritage doing it, as long as they respect what they\u2019re doing and have the right collaborators around them to make sure they\u2019re treating that subject in the right way.\u201d</p> <p>Not that anyone in ballet \u2013 or the world at large \u2013 can agree about what \u201cthe right way\u201d is.

Kevin O\u2019Hare began his dancing career in the 1980s with the Sadler\u2019s Wells Royal Ballet when the application of \u201cwet brown\u201d pancake to play swarthy Gypsy roles was par for the course. When you\u2019re immersed in the ballet world from a young age, he says, \u201cthat\u2019s just how things are\u201d. Now that he\u2019s artistic director of the Royal Ballet, however, he takes a more nuanced view. \u201cSuddenly, you look through a different lens, and sometimes I don\u2019t feel things are right for the sensibilities of today\u2019s world.\u201d The Nutcracker is a prime example. In 2016, O\u2019Hare oversaw a revision of the Chinese dance into a cheery athletic variation. National dances are a fixture of the big 19th-century ballets: Spanish, Ukrainian, Arabian, Hungarian, Polish. But the European dances tend to be based on genuine folk steps, whereas the Arabian and Chinese variations were imaginative guesses and the Middle Eastern dances were invariably slinky, midriff-exposed harem delights. That jewel-encrusted orientalism, very present in the India-set La Bayad\u00e8re, is less straightforward to deal with than the sight of a dancer blacking up. O\u2019Hare thought in earnest about the decision to stage La Bayad\u00e8re last year. It was never intended as a piece of realism \u2013 its most famous scene is an opium dream of mesmerising ballerinas in white tutus. But still, he says, \u201cit sits awkwardly now, the idea of what India was\u201d. Adjustments were made to the makeup, including the soot-stained skin of some characters that could be mistaken for \u201cblackface\u201d. O\u2019Hare wants to put the work in context, with programme notes and talks surrounding the main show (including one from Indian choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh, whose own work made in response to La Bayad\u00e8re was performed at the Royal Opera House in 2015). \u201cYou\u2019re encouraging the audience not to take it at face value,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a history lesson.\u201d Which all sounds very reasonable, even if it doesn\u2019t change the content of the ballet. The Royal Ballet\u2019s production thankfully does without la danse de n\u00e9grillons, eight young dancers made up like minstrels, but some versions retain it. During Benjamin Millepied\u2019s recent short-lived directorship of the fiercely traditional Paris Opera Ballet, he attempted an update, turning the n\u00e9grillons into a \u201cchildren\u2019s dance\u201d, no face-paint required, and riling the conservative establishment. Purging offensive elements from modern productions may seem an obvious move in 21st-century Britain, but that view meets surprising resistance. Cultural differences in various countries play a major part, and there\u2019s the fear that once you start \u201ccorrecting\u201d the rep, you\u2019ll end up with nothing left: the Gypsies in Don Quixote or Two Pigeons, perhaps, and let\u2019s not get started on sexual politics. But more than that, because ballet is not a concrete product and you can\u2019t rely on the foundations of it always to be there, the responsibility to preserve the past must be taken seriously. Jean-Christophe Maillot is artistic director of Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo, known for stylish modern remakes of famous titles including Swan Lake, Romeo and Juliet and Copp\u00e9lia. But the company\u2019s repertoire includes original works of the legendary Ballets Russes, including Petrushka. And these, for Maillot, are sacrosanct. \u201cWhen I perform the original Petrushka, it\u2019s exactly like when I go to the Louvre and see a beautiful Renoir painting,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s [an image of] a certain time. If I do Taming of the Shrew, the position of the woman in Shakespeare\u2019s work is truly unacceptable today. So should we destroy Shakespeare? The idea is to respect the memory of the original work. It is out of the question to change anything in it.\u201d And that means absolutely anything, including a white dancer wearing black makeup. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting mark of what the world was at that time \u2013 and that\u2019s what art is.\u201d What about those offended by the portrayal of the Moor? \u201cCan we fight against stupidity?\u201d says Maillot. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this piece is from 1911 and it has to be put in context.\u201d He is obviously energised by the issue. \u201cI have the feeling that, to not hurt anybody, we are going softer and softer to reach a point where everybody everywhere is speaking the same language with the same accent. Everybody is getting contentious about everything, and we should resist that a little bit.\u201d For him, it\u2019s akin to censorship. \u201cWe know how to be politically correct, but we\u2019re dying from that. I take the risk of [people] not understanding, being shocked by what I put on stage. If we destroy that freedom, I think it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d Maillot celebrates the distinctively different cultures that have contributed to dance history, but the fact is that cultural borders are dissolving and ballet is now a global industry: a performance in Moscow can be beamed to a cinema in Massachusetts. Romanian choreographer Edward Clug recently fell foul of US distributors with his Petrushka for the Bolshoi. In Clug\u2019s version, the setting and characters are starkly abstracted, the Moor no longer a caricature. The Moor\u2019s makeup, however, was a mask-like oval painted in black. \u201cI thought that was a discreet solution,\u201d says Clug, \u201cbut already that was too obvious for the American distributors.\u201d They came up with two black dots on the cheeks instead. Clug seems bemused by the whole episode, but open-minded. \u201cI like the idea of being able to share with more people,\u201d he says. Racism in ballet is often a subtle and subjective question. Some black ballet dancers, for example, wear tights the colour of their own skin, as opposed to standard pink; others don\u2019t see the need. Sometimes it\u2019s less subtle, like the school of thought that there shouldn\u2019t be any black dancers in the corps de ballet of classic \u201cballet blanc\u201d, because the identical nature of the performers is its whole raison d\u2019etre. Maillot says: \u201cIf you ask me if a traditional Swan Lake at the Mariinsky can have a black girl in the corps de ballet, I can tell you honestly that I don\u2019t have the answer. But I feel like telling you no.\u201d His purism is not so much about race as about not having any deviation from a very particular image. For Maillot, only dancers with the same bodies, schooling and style should dance a traditional Swan Lake. That\u2019s why he made a new version for his own company. At the Royal Ballet, some variation in swans is allowed, and the approach to casting is colourblind. \u201cIt\u2019s not, \u2018Oh we\u2019ve got five Asian men in the company, let\u2019s do the Chinese dance,\u2019\u201d says O\u2019Hare. During a show\u2019s run, across different casts there may be white, black and Asian dancers playing the same role \u201cand nobody bats an eyelid\u201d. For Petrushka, O\u2019Hare thinks it would have to be a remake. But the issue of cultural appropriation is not consigned to historical ballets. He hints at a new commission coming up \u201cfrom a different culture to ours\u201d and says: \u201cWe\u2019re really serious about talking to the right people, making sure we\u2019re going to do it in the right way.\u201d How about hiring an Indian choreographer if you want to make a ballet about India? \u201cI suppose you could,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if an Indian choreographer comes with a great idea, then yes. But there is nothing wrong with somebody who isn\u2019t from that heritage doing it, as long as they respect what they\u2019re doing and have the right collaborators around them to make sure they\u2019re treating that subject in the right way.\u201d Not that anyone in ballet \u2013 or the world at large \u2013 can agree about what \u201cthe right way\u201d is. But at least the pointy fingers of my panto days are slowly making an exit. \u2022 English National Ballet\u2019s Le Corsaire is at Milton Keynes theatre, 20-23 November and at London Coliseum, 8-14 January.",

      "bodyText": "Wall Street has followed the lead set by major Asian and European counterparts, with early declines as investors digest another twist in the US-China trade battle. The worsening outlook on US-China relations has been set off by, well, take your pick: the US Senate angered China with a new bill aimed at protecting the rights of protestors in Hong Kong; a former employee of the British consulate there alleged he was tortured during detention by China; and Donald Trump last night said tariffs could rise if no deal is agreed. And yet it has not apparently affected Alibaba, which managed to raise as much as \u00a310bn on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange. The ease with which Alibaba raised the money may be an indicator of the loose financing conditions about which the European Central Bank. The ECB said that financial risks are building, and that non-bank lenders could exacerbate market turmoil if they all rush to sell illiquid assets at the same time. Thanks for following our rolling coverage of business, economics and markets. Please do come back for more tomorrow. JJ Major indices on Wall Street have fallen across the board. The Nasdaq fell by 0.3%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell by 0.2% at the opening bell. *An earlier post has been updated to include Janus Henderson\u2019s statement. Refresh your browser to see it. A quick look at futures shortly before the US markets open: The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average are expected to fall by 0.25%, while the Nasdaq could fall by about 0.3%. And a quick chaser from the politics live blog: Boris Johnson\u2019s big policy announcement appears to have been mistakenly revealed too early. \u201cSome journalists think Boris Johnson may not have been planning to announce a huge proposed Conservative manifesto tax cut in a Q&amp;A with workers at an engineering company in Stockton-on-Tees.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor on Twitter: After three years of constant political turmoil, one of the stranger aspects of the general election campaign has been the relative lack of market-moving announcements: even Labour\u2019s pledge to nationalise broadband infrastructure provider Openreach caused barely a flutter on the share price of current owner BT. However, there are some business and economics stories popping up. Today Boris Johnson pledged to raise the threshold at which workers pay national insurance on earnings to \u00a312,000 a year, up from \u00a38,632 currently. The Guardian\u2019s politics live blog has the details \u2013 including the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 verdict on the tax cuts (TL;DR: they help low-paid workers, but they are not the most effective way of doing so). And the Liberal Democrat party has pledged to raise duties on frequent international flyers by \u00a35bn a year. Read more here: Investment manager Janus Henderson has been fined \u00a31.9m by the City regulator for not telling customers that their money was tracking investment indices, rather than being actively allocated by human managers. The Financial Conduct Authority said Janus Henderson had failed to treat fairly more than 4,500 retail investors in two of its funds, the Henderson Japan Enhanced Equity Fund and the Henderson North American Enhanced Equity Fund, by reducing the level of active management without telling customers. Retail customers were charged the same fees, despite the changes to the management. Major institutional customers, on the other hand, were informed, and Henderson offered to manage the funds for them for free. Fund managers charge significantly higher fees to actively manage money than those charged to users whose money tracks the performance of stock markets indices. However, more and more investors are using passive indices \u2013 as many studies have found that they rival active investment for value for money once fees are taken into account. Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: The FCA requires firms to treat all its customers fairly, not just some customers. In this case, retail investors paid fees for active investment management they did not receive. For retail clients, the Japan and North American Funds were in effect operating as \u201ccloset trackers\u201d as the fees charged to them were inappropriate given the diminished level of active management. The matter is aggravated by the length of time HIFL took to identify the harm being caused to the retail investors and to fix it. A spokesperson for Janus Henderson said: The FCA\u2019s notice relates to events in the period 2011 to 2016 prior to the merger between Henderson Global Investors and Janus Capital Group in 2017. Janus Henderson Investors accepts the FCA\u2019s findings and the financial penalty and has co-operated fully throughout the process. Affected clients had already been separately contacted and fully compensated. Since the incident Janus Henderson Group has improved its systems and controls. More detail on the \u201cfemale advisory board\u201d that Aston Martin set up in 2015. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about making cars only for women, but rather to make our cars more practical for women and families, as well as men,\u201d an Aston Martin spokesman said. In an interview with Yahoo Finance this year, Carlee Hardaker, Aston Martin\u2019s senior manager of global customer and market intelligence, said: \u201cIt might be that their husband, boyfriend, or son, comes home and says, \u2018I\u2019m going to buy myself a supercar\u2019 or\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going to buy a Ferrari or a Lamborghini.\u2019 And the woman says, \u2018No, you\u2019re not, it looks like you\u2019re having a mid-life crisis, but you can have an Aston\u2019.\u201d You can read the full report here: German car components maker Continental plans to cut about 5,500 jobs worldwide, in the latest sign of the struggles affecting the global automotive industry as it prepares to transition away from fossil fuels. The job cuts from 2024 onwards will fall at five plants in Germany, Italy and the USA, with the brunt of the cuts focused on factories producing parts used in petrol and diesel engines. Electric vehicle sales are expected to grow exponentially in the next decade, amid tighter emissions regulations. Continental said it planned to discontinue the business in hydraulic components for gasoline and diesel engines completely. In its statement, Continental said: This is against the backdrop of the automotive industry\u2019s disruptive transition to electric mobility, which has been accelerated by stricter emissions laws, resulting in a drastic decline in demand for hydraulic components. The union representing Royal Mail workers has appealed against a high court judgment that their ballot in favour of strike action was not invalid. The Communication Workers Union tweeted that it has lodged its appeal with the high court, sending shares in Royal Mail to their lowest point of the day, down by 2.1%. Royal Mail successfully argued that the ballot was not carried out in accordance with legal rules as some workers had opened their ballots in sorting offices before they arrived at their home addresses. Royal Mail is keen to avoid strike action over the Christmas period, when parcel deliveries are commercially crucial. The privatised company also cited concerns over running postal votes during the general election on 12 December. Today is an important day for Aston Martin, with the launch of its make-or-break DBX, the company\u2019s first sports utility vehicle. Chief executive Andy Palmer launched the car in Beijing, a clear indication of the company\u2019s priority to sell to wealthy Chinese buyers. The company is particularly keen to increase its sales to women, diversifying a masculine-dominated image most associated with James Bond. It even hired a \u201cFemale Advisory Board\u201d to help with design. Palmer has staked the future of the business on the SUV bet paying off. Carmakers have responded to surge in demand for the bulkier vehicles \u2013 despite the terrible toll for the planet of manufacturing less efficient modes of transport. Growing demand for SUVs was the second largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions from 2010 to 2018, according to the International Energy Agency. Aston Martin Lagonda is following the well worn path trodden already by Lamborghini\u2019s Urus and Bentley\u2019s Bentayga, and the car is priced similarly at \u00a3158,000, before extras. Those extras include a bumper protector and in-built hose to prevent dogs marking the car or boot warmers for cold weather. Aston Martin did not give details of how much the extra features will cost. Just after midday, shares on the FTSE 100 have lost 1.2%. Kingfisher remains the biggest faller, down 6.4%, while educational materials provider Pearson las lost 3.7% and insurer Aviva has lost 3.6%. Only four stocks were in positive territory at the time of writing on the blue-chip index. Mid-cap stocks on the FTSE 250 \u2013 less exposed to global trade tensions \u2013 were down by 0.5%. The Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba has raised about $11bn in a share offering in Hong Kong, the city\u2019s biggest offering since 2010 despite ongoing protests against the Chinese-controlled regime. Alibaba said Wednesday that it has set the price for the offering at 176 Hong Kong dollars per share, raising 88bn Hong Kong dollars (\u00a38.7bn) \u2013 the largest fundraising of 2019. That amount could rise to \u00a310bn if bankers exercise options to sell an additional lump of shares over the next 30 days. In a statement, Alibaba said: The company plans to use the proceeds from the global offering for the implementation of its strategies to drive user growth and engagement, empower businesses to facilitate digital transformation, and continue to innovate and invest for the long term. The company\u2019s share code, 9988, shares the same pronunciation as the Chinese expression for \u201ceternal prosperity\u201d. Shares are due to begin trading on 26 November. Back on the ECB, here\u2019s a bit more detail on those building financial stability risks. Low interest rates \u2013 designed by central bankers to stimulate spending \u2013 have had the knock-on effect of making it more difficult for investors to make returns on their money. That has pushed investors outside the heavily regulated banking sector to look for returns, or yield, elsewhere. The ECB said: The ongoing search for yield across non-banks may exacerbate the build-up of vulnerabilities, not least by lowering financing costs for riskier borrowers. If markets do fall significantly investment funds, including hedge funds, could exacerbate any instability if they rush to sell assets that are difficult to sell, the ECB said. Funds invested in illiquid assets can face severe difficulties in dealing with large-scale outflows. Higher leverage, for example in hedge funds, can add to procyclical investor behaviour and accelerate outflows. The following chart shows the build-up in riskier bets. In the left-hand chart the two rings represent the credit ratings of companies in 2007 and 2018. The growth in high-yield debt (the yellow portion) is particularly striking; \u201chigh yield\u201d is another way of saying riskier, in comparison to debt given safer A or B ratings. The right-hand side of the chart shows the growth in house prices across the euro area \u2013 another tell-tale sign of a growing bubble. South African investor Prosus has criticised Takeaway.com\u2019s offer for food ordering service Just Eat as \u201cunrealistic\u201d as it pushes for shareholders to reject the Dutch company\u2019s approach in favour of its own. Takeaway.com and Just Eat published the offer document for its \u00a34.7bn bid \u2013 which is backed by Just Eat\u2019s management \u2013 this morning, but Prosus is still holding out hope that shareholders will back its \u00a34.9bn unsolicited offer. Prosus argues that Takeaway.com is underestimating the scale of investment needed in Just Eat\u2019s own delivery capabilities, which face stiff competition from rivals such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats. Bob van Dijk, chief executive of Prosus, said the company was \u201cexcited about the prospect of adding Just Eat to our portfolio\u201d. He said: Our cash offer provides compelling and certain value to shareholders at a premium to the Takeaway.com Offer and removes the downside risk for Just Eat\u2019s shareholders. Our offer also reflects the substantial investment required in product, technology, marketing and own-delivery capabilities to make the most of Just Eat\u2019s long-term potential. We believe that the Takeaway.com offer underestimates the substantial investment required in Just Eat to recapture market share and improve performance in an increasingly competitive sector undergoing global transformation. There\u2019s a lot to digest in the European Central Bank\u2019s financial stability review \u2013 the first under the leadership of newly appointed president Christine Lagarde. Some of the headline points from the ECB: The financial stability environment remains challenging, with \u201cprominent downside risks to growth\u201d. Signs of excessive leverage and risk-taking in some sectors \u2013 such as non-bank lenders, debt-burdened companies and property \u2013 \u201crequire targeted action\u201d. Excessive risk and leverage in non-banks amplifies cycles in capital markets and contagion of stress to the wider financial system. Consolidation between European banks could help aid financial stability. Risks to the stability of the global financial system have increased as shadow banks have lent more money to businesses in place of traditional lenders, the European Central Bank (ECB) warned on Wednesday. Regulators around the world have increased their scrutiny on the banking sector since the financial crisis a decade ago. While central banks believe that has made the banking sector safer, there are growing concerns that a financial shock could leave shadow banks \u2013 such as investors, insurance companies and pension funds \u2013 exposed. The ECB said: In the event of a sudden repricing of financial assets, growing credit and liquidity risk in some parts of the euro area non-bank financial sector \u2013 coupled with higher leverage in investment funds \u2013 may lead non-banks to respond in ways that cause stress to spread to the wider financial system. Low interest rates have been an important part of the shadow banking phenomenon, as investors seek better returns. Luis de Guindos, vice-president of the ECB, said: While the low interest rate environment supports the overall economy, we also note an increase in risk-taking which warrants continuous and close monitoring. Authorities should use available tools to address the build-up of vulnerabilities where possible. An interesting story from the Financial Times (\u00a3) this morning for watchers of the UK\u2019s most systemically important bank: HSBC is reportedly set to replace its investment banking head. Interim head Noel Quinn took over in August with a remit to cut thousands of staff, after his predecessor John Flint was ejected after barely 18 months in the job \u2013 reportedly for moving too slowly on improving returns. Now the shake-up could extend to the top of the bank. The FT said that Samir Assaf, head of global banking and markets, is expected to be moved to a non-executive role to allow a successor in who could shrink the unit serving the fundraising needs of large companies, citing people briefed on the matter. The top riser anywhere on the FTSE 350 is Mitchells and Butlers, the restaurant owners bucking the struggles of many other consumer-facing companies (cf. Kingfisher today). The owner of brands such as Harvester, Toby Carvery and Nicholson\u2019s pubs reported like-for-like sales growth of 3.5% for the year ending 28 September. It increased adjusted operating profits by \u00a314m, or 4%, and revenues and profits before tax also rose. It even managed to cut net debt (although it is still 3.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation). Phil Urban, the company\u2019s chief executive, said: These strong results reflect the work we have done over the last few years, first to build sustained sales growth and then to convert that into profit growth. It has been extremely encouraging to see an improvement in like-for-like sales growth across the portfolio during the year, fuelled by our Ignite programme of work. This puts us in a stronger position as we move forward into the next financial year, in what we expect to remain challenging market conditions. An hour into trading, and blue-chip shares in London are down by 0.9%, accelerating losses from initial exchanges. The mid-cap FTSE 250 has lost 0.6%. Kingfisher is the biggest faller, down by 6.9%, while accounting tech company Sage Group and insurer Aviva have lost 3.6% and 3.3% respectively. On the latter two, from Reuters: Sage reported a 13% drop in full-year organic operating profit to \u00a3432m on Wednesday as its margin was squeezed by increased investment in its cloud and subscription products. Shares in Aviva slid on Wednesday after the British insurer announced it would reorganise into five divisions and sell its stake in its Hong Kong business, falling short of investor expectations for a broader change in strategy. But in a show of support for the beleaguered American manufacturer, Emirates revealed an $8.8bn (\u00a36.8bn) order for 30 of Boeing\u2019s 787-9 Dreamliners. However, Reuters reported the deal could allow Emirates \u2013 negotiating on its home turf in the Dubai air show \u2013 to reduce orders for Boeing\u2019s other twin-aisle jet, the 777X, which has been delayed after engine issues. Air shows in recent months have been dominated by one thing: the crisis at Boeing over the grounding of the 737 Max. At the Dubai air show the top US regulator has indicated that it will have knock-on effects on the rest of Boeing\u2019s business. The head of the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the regulator will be tougher on the certification of the Boeing 777x, its twin-aisle jet. FAA administrator Steve Dickson also repeated the message that the FAA was not following any timeline for the return to service of the grounded 737 MAX model, its lead single-aisle offering, and said time pressure cannot influence the FAA\u2019s regulatory process. Here\u2019s the full story on Twitter\u2019s rebuke of the Conservative party over its misleading \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d account. While Twitter has come out strongly against the tactic of renaming the account, the matter could reignite concerns over political misinformation on its platform. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Will Moy, the chief executive of indepedent checkers Full Fact, said Twitter should have acted sooner and could have forcibly renamed the account. Read more here: B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning \u2013 with shares off by 7%. A quick glance at Kingfisher\u2019s statement will give some clues why: there is a palpable sense of a new boss clearing the decks. The first five words of Thierry Garnier\u2019s statement to the stock market might \u2013 to an uncharitable reader \u2013 be seen as diverting the blame for the DIY retailer\u2019s problems towards former management: \u201cIn my first eight weeks\u201d ... A 3.7% like-for-like sales fall in its third quarter and talk of too much complexity signal that there could be some more tough times ahead. Garnier said: As a team, our priority is to fix our operational issues \u2013 particularly in IT and supply chain in France \u2013 and refocus our efforts. This includes stopping or pausing a number of initiatives to concentrate on stabilising performance and trading. The effect of these changes will not be immediate. Analysts at MUFG Bank note that the response to the Hong Kong protests is a key diplomatic factor that could be affecting the trade talks. Lee Hardman and Fritz Louw, currency analysts at MUFG, highlighted a US Senate bill yesterday aimed at supportingprotesters in Hong Kong that warned China against a violent suppression of the demonstrators. China responded with a threat to retaliate if it becomes law. They wrote: The developments have put at least a temporary dampeneron building optimism over a US-China trade deal including the possibility of larger roll back of tariff hikes. Bloomberg reported yesterday that the two sides are locked in tough negotiations on a phase-one pact linking the size of tariff roll backs to the preliminary terms set in the failed deal from May. The White House is still reportedly debating the precise percentage of tariffs to roll back in response to China\u2019s demand to remove all tariffs imposed after May immediately and then tariffs imposed before that to be lifted gradually. [...] A larger tariff roll back would be an encouraging development for financial markets and help further ease downside risks for the global growth outlook. Let\u2019s have some more reaction to the big story driving markets around the world in the early morning (as so often in the last two years): the trade rhetoric rollercoaster. The back and forth can be contradictory and confusing but overall the US and China are making progress towards an interim deal, bets Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. He said: In our base case we now see the US and China agreeing a Phase 1 deal that, at a minimum, averts additional tariffs. The initial agreement would likely include a resolution of less critical issues such as China\u2019s purchases of US agricultural products and opening up of its financial services sector, as well as improving the transparency of its currency regime. We expect the more difficult structural issues, such as cybertheft and industrial subsidies, to be left for later phases. Our expected range for global equities in this scenario is for 0\u20135% upside from current levels. Just Eat has published the offer documents from Takeaway.com, meaning that the British tech firm will be acquired by the Dutch firm by 31 January if 75% of shareholders back the bid. The Takeaway.com offer, worth \u00a34.7bn, is up against an unsolicited bid by Prosus, an arm of South African firm Naspers. Jitse Groen, chief executive of Takeaway.com, said: Today we are taking an important step towards the creation of what we believe will be the world\u2019s leading online food delivery company. However, Just Eat\u2019s shares are trading at a premium to the offer, indicating that investors are hoping for a better bid. European stock markets have caught a cold from Asia: the FTSE 100 is down by 0.5% at the opening bell. France\u2019s Cac 40 has lost 0.5% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is down 0.4%. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 (which includes many of the above stocks) fell by 0.4%. Twitter has rebuked the Conservative party for misleading the public by changing its account name to \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d during Tuesday evening\u2019s general election debate. With the exceptions of Facebook and perhaps Google, Twitter is arguably the most powerful private company when it comes to the general election. The US social network has banned political advertising, but it usually steers clear of policing content or making decisions about \u201cfake news\u201d from politicians. However, it drew a line at changing a verified account \u2013 with the distinctive blue tick \u2013 to seemingly resemble an independent organisation. In a statement unprecedented in British politics, a spokeswoman said: Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election. We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information - in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate - will result in decisive corrective action. You can follow the political fallout here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A look at Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed is enough to tell you that the US president has other things (impeachment) on his mind, but behind the scenes the wheels are still turning on trade negotiations between the US and China. And Trump\u2019s feelings on the matter are still market critical: east Asian indices fell across the board on Wednesday morning following a threat of raising tariffs higher. The CSI 300 index, which measures the performance of stocks in Shenzhen and Shanghai, lost 0.99%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong lost 0.71% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell by 0.62%. Speaking at a cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump said he had a good relationship with China, noting that China was \u201cmoving along.\u201d However, he said China would have to make a deal \u201cI like.\u201d He said: If we don\u2019t make a deal with China, I\u2019ll just raise the tariffs even higher. Investor money flowed to safe-haven bonds in response. Yields on US 10-year Treasuries hit a two-week trough of 1.75%, as demand rose: yields move inversely to prices. That has set the tone for Europe, where futures indicate that stocks on the main indices are likely to fall in value. In UK corporate news, B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher reported like-for-like sales down by 3.7%, and new chief executive Thierry Garnier made it clear that the company has some upheaval ahead. My early assessment is that we have not found the right balance between getting the benefits of Group scale and staying close to local markets. We are suffering from organisational complexity, and we are trying to do too much at once with multiple large-scale initiatives running in parallel.

      "bodyText": "The 17-year-old pop sensation Billie Eilish has become the youngest artist to be nominated in all four of the most prestigious Grammy award categories: record, album and song of the year, and best new artist. Her gothic, innovative single Bad Guy, which topped the US charts, is nominated in the song and record categories, while her similarly chart-topping album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? is nominated for the album prize. She completed a sweep of the top categories with a best new artist nomination, and has six nominations in all. Her album engineers got a nod in the best engineered album category, including her brother and collaborator Finneas, who received three nominations. The most nominations were for Lizzo, who received eight, including in the top four categories. The powerhouse Minneapolis singer, known for her vociferous support of body positivity as well as her showboating flute solos, has been a slow-burn success, first releasing music in 2013 but scoring breakthrough hits this year with Juice, Tempo and US No 1 hit Truth Hurts. Lil Nas X received six nominations, including three in the top categories, predominantly for his song Old Town Road. It is indisputably one of the most successful songs of the year, breaking a US chart record with its 19 consecutive weeks at No 1 \u2013 Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men\u2019s duet One Sweet Day had held the honour since 1996. All three of Eilish, Lizzo and Lil Nas X have never received a Grammy nomination before. R&amp;B singer HER scored five nominations, including record, album and song of the year, with Ariana Grande also earning five, including record and album of the year \u2013 her first appearances in the major categories. Wisconsin singer-songwriter Bon Iver was nominated four times, including record and album of the year, while Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 in a relatively minor year with no solo album release \u2013 still managed to secure four nominations, for her Lion King soundtrack work as well as her Coachella concert film, Homecoming. While recent years have seen Grammy success for the likes of Ed Sheeran and Adele, British artists were mostly shut out of the top four categories. Lewis Capaldi received a nomination for song of the year for his ballad Someone You Loved, which has topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Bristol country-soul singer Yola was nominated for best new artist, and received three further nominations in American roots categories. Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke earned three nominations in specialist categories, with Chemical Brothers scoring three, and two for R&amp;B singer Ella Mai. Other nominated Brits include the 1975, Bring Me the Horizon, James Blake and Elvis Costello. A surprise inclusion was Bones UK, a Camden rock band who, despite their low profile, secured a nomination for best rock performance with their song Pretty Waste. Lil Nas X also crops up in the rap categories, this time with his single Panini in the running for rap/sung performance. The genre\u2019s biggest prize, best rap performance, features a posthumous nomination for Nipsey Hussle, the LA star who was shot dead in April. Snubs include to Taylor Swift, who might have expected more than just one nomination in major categories \u2013 song of the year for Lover, the only song in the category to feature a single songwriter \u2013 and Ed Sheeran, whose collaborative album No 6 Collaborations Project only generated one nomination, for pop vocal album. Sam Smith received no nominations for their major US hit Dancing With a Stranger, nor did Halsey, whose single Without Me spent 29 weeks in the US Top 10 and went five times platinum. The total lack of nominations for Solange\u2019s acclaimed album When I Get Home, or Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Western Stars, is also surprising \u2013 the Guardian has asked their record labels if their albums were put forward for nomination.

      "bodyText": "Mohamed Ali, the whistleblower who sparked rare street protests in Egypt two months ago with his revelations about corruption in his country, has launched a plan to coordinate a new opposition movement dedicated to saving the Egyptian economy and democracy. Ali announced in London on Wednesday that he was acting to bring together liberals, the Muslim Brotherhood and the April 6 movement in a move that he hopes will end with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi forced to stand down. Ali became a near-accidental leader of the Egyptian opposition when on 2 September he launched a series of Facebook video tirades revealing the scale of personal corruption inside Egypt based on his personal knowledge as a businessman working for many years on Egyptian military construction projects. His inside knowledge and ability to speak in a way that appealed to ordinary Egyptians led to street protests across Egypt, but the protest movement died down following widespread arrests and state repression. Ali admits he is not a political sophisticate, but told the Guardian he had been spending the last two months trying to reunite a disparate Egyptian opposition behind a common programme to save the country\u2019s economy and institutions. \u201cSixty per cent of Egyptians are poor or will be poor within two years,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no health education, as Emmanuel Macron was told by Sisi, and there are no jobs.

      "bodyText": "The EU has admitted in a leaked report that it cannot monitor the Libyan coastguard and that the detention of migrants is a \u201cprofitable business model\u201d for Libya\u2019s government, with whom it has recently renewed a controversial deal to stem migration to Europe. The report details the fate of refugees fleeing for Europe who have been picked up by the Brussels-backed coastguard and put in official and unofficial detention camps in dire and dangerous conditions. Widespread human rights violations, deaths, unexplained disappearances, bribery and corruption are cited in the 13-page paper, which still praises the \u201cprogress achieved\u201d in reducing the numbers leaving the Libyan coast for Europe. Under a recently renewed multimillion-euro deal, the EU and Italy provide the Libyan coastguard with cash, training and boats to intercept migrants in the Mediterranean, as part of an attempt to block people from European shores. The decision was made last month to continue with the deal, and provide an extra \u20ac5m in funding, despite an admission in the EU paper that \u201cconditions for migrants in Libya have deteriorated severely recently due to security concerns related to the conflict and developments in the smuggling and trafficking dynamics and economy, in addition to the worsening situation in the overcrowded detention facilities\u201d. The leaked EU document, marked Limite (restricted), of which only an almost entirely redacted version has been published, lays out the \u201csevere\u201d consequences in an internal call for \u201cimmediate action\u201d to save the lives of those caught up in the system. The document, written by the presidency of the EU council for a \u201chigh-level working group on asylum and migration\u201d, reports: There is no record of the numbers of detention camps but estimates of the number of official and unofficial facilities range from 17 to 35, some of which are said to be run by militia. More than 5,000 people are being held and about 3,700 of those are located in \u201cconflict areas\u201d. A number of the detention centres \u201care alleged of having links to human trafficking\u201d and \u201cthere is no proper registration system for migrants\u201d. \u201cSerious cases of corruption and bribery in the centres have been detected,\u201d the EU paper says. EU officials are not allowed onshore to monitor the makeup or activities of the Libyan coastguard to the \u201csecurity challenges\u201d. The government in Libya has failed to improve the situation in the camps or deal with the regular reports of \u201cdisappearances\u201d of people picked up by the Libyan coastguard. \u201cThe government\u2019s reluctance to address the problems raises the question of its own involvement\u201d, the paper says. The \u201creluctance of officials to cooperate is closely linked to the widely reported human rights violations that take place in the detention centres and to the fact that the facilities form a profitable business model for the current Libyan government\u201d. According to humanitarian organisations, detainees are coerced by camp officials into asking relatives to pay for their release. At least 53 men, women and children were killed and 130 injured in July when a detention facility near Tripoli, in which 644 migrants and refugees had been detained, was bombed. The bombed-out centre was then swiftly refilled with people provided by the Libyan coastguard. The detention camps \u201csuffer from overcrowding and the conditions are poor. In particular, there are difficulties in relation to sanitary facilities and food and water supply. Severe human rights violations have been widely reported\u201d. The EU has been pressing the Libyan government to stop the arbitrary detention of migrants. The leaked paper, distributed to key officials in September, notes that the Libyan authorities had agreed to close three detention centres near Tripoli but \u201cso far, any concrete panning has not followed this promise\u201d. The reduction in migration has instead been celebrated in Brussels, with the number of people arriving in Italy from Libya dropping from more than 107,000 in 2017 to about 13,000 in 2018, and to just 1,100 by August this year. The Libyan coastguard is said to have intercepted 5,280 people as of August 2019. The European parliament\u2019s civil liberties committee is due to interrogate EU officials on Thursday, with the Labour MEP Claude Moraes seeking full disclosure of the human cost. Sophie in \u2019t Veld, a Dutch MEP on the committee, said: \u201cOver the years, billions of euros have flown into Libya with the sole purpose of keeping migrants away from Europe. It is basically part of Fortress Europe, the European equivalent of Trump\u2019s wall. Just a lot more lethal than the wall. \u201cSo maybe fewer people have drowned, fewer have reached the shores of Europe.

      "body": "<p>One of the recurring scenes of the Trump era has been the president holding forth in some splenetic rant from the cabinet table flanked by his top officials gazing into the middle distance with frozen smiles or else looking resolutely downwards as if they had made a startling new discovery about their thumbs.</p> <p>It is a tableau that always invites speculation on what can be going through the minds of these pained accomplices and now we have at least a partial answer. One among them has brought out a book giving voice to those thoughts, but we do not know who.</p> <p>The book is by Anonymous, described on the cover as \u201ca senior Trump administration official\u201d, the same one who wrote an unsigned essay in the New York Times in September last year, declaring they were \u201cpart of the resistance Inside the Trump administration\u201d seeking to thwart the craziest impulses. Anonymous is now a year older, wiser and more depressed.</p> <p>\u201cMy original thesis in the New York Times was dead wrong. Americans should not expect that his advisers can fix the situation. We cannot. The question is what to do next,\u201d Anonymous writes in <em>A Warning</em>, a book- length exposition of life in the bizarre court of King Donald. The bottom line is that things look as appalling and chaotic from inside the administration as they do from the outside.</p> <p>Anonymous describes a \u201cbizarre sense of fraternity\u201d among senior officials \u201clike bank robbery hostages, lying on the floor at gunpoint, unable to sound the alarm, but aware that everyone else was stricken with the same fear of the unknown\u201d.</p> <p>The author sees himself or herself as part of the \u201csteady state\u201d (as opposed the \u201cdeep state\u201d of the darker imaginings of Trump loyalists), who joined the administration early on, out of a mix of duty and optimism that the unlikely president would grow into the role. Then \u2013 when that began to look absurdly unlikely \u2013 the steady staters stayed on to try to contain and mitigate Trump\u2019s whims until they realised they had become \u201cglorified government babysitters\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Presenting a fully\u00a0fledged policy document \u2018would be like speaking Aramaic to Trump through a\u00a0pillow\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These officials quietly compare notes and pool their shared shock and despair. According to Anonymous, there was half a plan to stage a mass resignation at one point as a way of raising the alarm about the seriousness of the situation, but the scheme was abandoned as being too destabilising to the country.</p> <p>Instead, these officials have continued to seep out of the administration in a steady stream of resignations and dismissals. It is not entirely clear whether Anonymous is still on the inside, constantly in fear of discovery. But if I had an anonymous source burrowed deep inside the administration, I would want a lot more colour and anecdote than we are given in <em>A Warning</em>. We do learn that Trump has the insane idea of designating migrants as \u201cenemy combatants\u201d and sending them to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/guantanamo-bay\" title=\"\">Guant\u00e1namo Bay</a>. We also get a little more detail on the relentless dumbing down of presidential briefings. Policy papers were condensed to PowerPoint presentations with a handful of slides, which became three main points, and then finally the advice to newcomers was \u201ccome in with one main point and repeat it over and over again\u201d, couching it in terms of \u201cwinners and losers\u201d, preferably with a really strong graphic.</p> <p>Anonymous recalls the reaction to a hapless aide who ignored the advice and presented pages of briefing notes. \u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d Trump shouts. \u201cThese are just words, a bunch of words. It doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Presenting a fully fledged policy document, the author observes memorably \u201cwould be like speaking Aramaic to Trump through a pillow\u201d. \u201cEven if he tried very hard to pay attention, which he didn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t be able to understand what the hell he was hearing,\u201d Anonymous writes.

      "bodyText": "One of the recurring scenes of the Trump era has been the president holding forth in some splenetic rant from the cabinet table flanked by his top officials gazing into the middle distance with frozen smiles or else looking resolutely downwards as if they had made a startling new discovery about their thumbs. It is a tableau that always invites speculation on what can be going through the minds of these pained accomplices and now we have at least a partial answer. One among them has brought out a book giving voice to those thoughts, but we do not know who. The book is by Anonymous, described on the cover as \u201ca senior Trump administration official\u201d, the same one who wrote an unsigned essay in the New York Times in September last year, declaring they were \u201cpart of the resistance Inside the Trump administration\u201d seeking to thwart the craziest impulses. Anonymous is now a year older, wiser and more depressed. \u201cMy original thesis in the New York Times was dead wrong. Americans should not expect that his advisers can fix the situation. We cannot. The question is what to do next,\u201d Anonymous writes in A Warning, a book- length exposition of life in the bizarre court of King Donald. The bottom line is that things look as appalling and chaotic from inside the administration as they do from the outside. Anonymous describes a \u201cbizarre sense of fraternity\u201d among senior officials \u201clike bank robbery hostages, lying on the floor at gunpoint, unable to sound the alarm, but aware that everyone else was stricken with the same fear of the unknown\u201d. The author sees himself or herself as part of the \u201csteady state\u201d (as opposed the \u201cdeep state\u201d of the darker imaginings of Trump loyalists), who joined the administration early on, out of a mix of duty and optimism that the unlikely president would grow into the role. Then \u2013 when that began to look absurdly unlikely \u2013 the steady staters stayed on to try to contain and mitigate Trump\u2019s whims until they realised they had become \u201cglorified government babysitters\u201d. These officials quietly compare notes and pool their shared shock and despair. According to Anonymous, there was half a plan to stage a mass resignation at one point as a way of raising the alarm about the seriousness of the situation, but the scheme was abandoned as being too destabilising to the country. Instead, these officials have continued to seep out of the administration in a steady stream of resignations and dismissals. It is not entirely clear whether Anonymous is still on the inside, constantly in fear of discovery. But if I had an anonymous source burrowed deep inside the administration, I would want a lot more colour and anecdote than we are given in A Warning. We do learn that Trump has the insane idea of designating migrants as \u201cenemy combatants\u201d and sending them to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. We also get a little more detail on the relentless dumbing down of presidential briefings. Policy papers were condensed to PowerPoint presentations with a handful of slides, which became three main points, and then finally the advice to newcomers was \u201ccome in with one main point and repeat it over and over again\u201d, couching it in terms of \u201cwinners and losers\u201d, preferably with a really strong graphic. Anonymous recalls the reaction to a hapless aide who ignored the advice and presented pages of briefing notes. \u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d Trump shouts. \u201cThese are just words, a bunch of words. It doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Presenting a fully fledged policy document, the author observes memorably \u201cwould be like speaking Aramaic to Trump through a pillow\u201d. \u201cEven if he tried very hard to pay attention, which he didn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t be able to understand what the hell he was hearing,\u201d Anonymous writes. Various unnamed officials are frequently cited saying such things as: \u201cThis place is so fucked up ... There is literally no one in charge here\u201d \u2013 which frankly has become the archetypal unattributed quote from the Trump era, familiar from a thousand newspaper stories. Anonymous acknowledges that there is something strange about Trump\u2019s obsequious relationship with Vladimir Putin but has no definitive ideas about what lies beneath it, other than a general admiration for dictators who run their countries as he would like to run the US.

      "body": "<p>Fifty years ago this season Liverpool went to Watford, then struggling near the bottom of the Second Division, in the sixth round of the FA Cup. On a dreadful pitch, its central third rutted and bare, they lost 1-0 to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSxN6-csiNA\" title=\"\">diving header from Barry Endean</a>. Bill Shankly called Watford \u201cthe worst team that ever beat us\u201d. He was aware the upset could be as epochal as the defeat to Worcester City that had led to him replacing Phil Taylor as manager in 1959 and was provoked into action. \u201cI knew I had to do my job and change my team,\u201d he said. \u201cIt had to be done and if I didn\u2019t do it I was shirking my obligations.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although Liverpool had finished second the previous season, they were enduring a major stutter, having won only five of their previous 18 in the league. He raged in the Vicarage Road dressing room, telling a number of players they were finished. Over the following weeks Tommy Lawrence, Ian St John, Ron Yeats and Geoff Strong were all discarded. Peter Thompson, struggling with cartilage problems, departed a few months later. The players changed, but the method did not. \u201cThe policy of the new team was the same as that of the old,\u201d Shankly explained. \u201cWe played to our strengths. We pressurised everybody and made them run.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/20/tottenham-glory-daniel-levy-spurs-champions-league-mauricio-pochettino\">Tottenham love to talk of glory, but for Daniel Levy business is business</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There was a time when managers were not sacked as soon as they faced a bump in the road. Three years later Liverpool won the league and the Uefa Cup. A year after that they produced arguably the greatest performance of Shankly\u2019s reign in demolishing Newcastle in the FA Cup final. He promptly retired.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/20/tottenham-hotspur-jose-mourinho-named-new-manager-of-spurs\" title=\"\">As Mauricio Pochettino has found</a>, that is not how modern football works. Modern football likes nothing more than to identify a crisis and to respond to it with sacrifice. Perhaps that is simple economics \u2013 it is cheaper to replace a manager than half the squad \u2013 but there is also something ritualistic about it, the elders leading the designated scapegoat sadly to the altar. Sir Alex Ferguson identified football\u2019s lust for blood with reality TV and the idea that somebody must be voted off each week, but the urge perhaps lies deeper than that: Isaac, Jephthah\u2019s daughter, Iphigenia, Jesus, Sydney Carton, Edward Woodward\u2019s police officer in The Wicker Man \u2013 they all pre-date the X Factor.</p> \n<p>Football operates in cycles. Coaches as different as B\u00e9la Guttmann and Gordon Strachan have identified the third year as fatal, the moment when a critical mass of players tire of the techniques and idiosyncrasies of their manager, when one or other has to change. Managers such as Ferguson and Valeriy Lobanovskyi were able to sustain their success for so long because they were ruthless in refreshing their squads. Shankly acknowledged he had waited too long but was given time to enact a second revolution. Pochettino was not afforded that luxury.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ae52c92b-7e33-41d6-bbf3-dde7c8975465\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eHehouKMhgU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Argentinian, having been at Tottenham since 2014, had identified the problem. He knew it was not just about building a good squad and letting it run. For two years he has been urging rejuvenation but when it came last summer with three signings, two of whom have struggled with injury, it was too little too late. What has happened to Tottenham this season \u2013 14th in the table after three wins in 12 games \u2013 is the price of last season, when they did not make a single senior signing.</p> \n<p>Two factors have exacerbated the problem. First, that Pochettino\u2019s way of playing is particularly exhausting. A hard pressing style is hugely demanding. When belief goes, the downturn can be dramatic. It happened, for instance, to Borussia Dortmund in J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s final season and, more pertinently, it happened to Pochettino as a player at his first club. Newell\u2019s Old Boys claimed the Apertura in 1990-91 and the Clausura in 1991-92, also reaching the final of the 1992 Copa Libertadores, but the manager Marcelo Bielsa then left and form collapsed; they finished bottom of the 1992-93 Apertura.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1a62dee8-fa7d-4c32-8816-c0a0d893500b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8ZaMh13QPik?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Pochettino is not an inflexible disciple of Bielsa, is not as close to his methods as, say, Jorge Sampaoli, but the influence is clear and that can create problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a method that provokes a certain level of tiredness,\u201d said the former Newell\u2019s full-back Juan Manuel Llop. \u201cNot just physical tiredness, but also mental, emotional. Because the competitive level is so high, it\u2019s difficult to keep up with it \u2026 there comes a time that the human being relaxes. It\u2019s not that you abandon it, but you let something go because you feel worn out.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/01/tottenham-hotspur-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">7-2 home defeat to Bayern Munich</a> is accepted as something of a freak, Tottenham\u2019s worst performance of the season came in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/brighton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">3-0 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/brighton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">loss at Brighton</a>. Nine of the 11 who started that game have been at the club four years or more. It is hardly surprising if they have begun to feel fatigued, and that perhaps explains why Tottenham\u2019s pressing has been so obviously less intense this season.</p> \n<p>As a rough measure of that, in every previous season under Pochettino, Spurs have been one of the top six sides in the league for winning the ball back within 40 metres of their opponents\u2019 goal; this season they are 15th. Any disillusionment will hardly be assuaged by the knowledge they could have been earning significantly higher wages elsewhere.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/20/jose-mourinho-tottenham-manager-good-bad-ugly-manchester-united\">Mourinho brings good, bad and ugly, but in what ratio at Tottenham?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tottenham being in the Champions League may have come to seem familiar, but by most financial metrics they remain the sixth-biggest club in the Premier League. And that is why something feels so self-defeating about Pochettino\u2019s departure. For all their struggles this season, they remain one win off fifth. There was no threat of relegation such as that which prompted Middlesbrough to dismiss Gareth Southgate or West Brom Roberto Di Matteo. Nor was there the sense of insoluble toxicity that characterised Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s final weeks at Chelsea. Even with four key players running down their contracts, this was salvageable.</p> \n<p>But instead Tottenham have chosen the familiar route of replacing the manager. Perhaps the situation was irresolvable. Perhaps Pochettino, as his increasingly regular hints about leaving suggested, had lost patience with the project. But Spurs have paid \u00a312.5m to release from his contract a well-respected and in-demand manager with a proven record of working on a budget and developing young players, and replaced him with Mourinho, who habitually complains about a lack of funding and, for all his protestations, has a limited record of youth development.</p> \n<p>Where Pochettino\u2019s sides at their best pressed hard, Mourinho essentially eschewed pressing as part of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/22/devil-and-jose-mourinho\" title=\"\">rejection of Barcelona in 2008</a>; his Manchester United side had the lowest running stats in the league when he was sacked a year ago. Perhaps weary players will relish the change, but this represents a major shift in approach and, as such, is a major gamble.</p> \n<p>Sometimes the logic of football does not feel like logic at all.</p>",

He was aware the upset could be as epochal as the defeat to Worcester City that had led to him replacing Phil Taylor as manager in 1959 and was provoked into action. \u201cI knew I had to do my job and change my team,\u201d he said. \u201cIt had to be done and if I didn\u2019t do it I was shirking my obligations.\u201d Although Liverpool had finished second the previous season, they were enduring a major stutter, having won only five of their previous 18 in the league. He raged in the Vicarage Road dressing room, telling a number of players they were finished. Over the following weeks Tommy Lawrence, Ian St John, Ron Yeats and Geoff Strong were all discarded. Peter Thompson, struggling with cartilage problems, departed a few months later. The players changed, but the method did not. \u201cThe policy of the new team was the same as that of the old,\u201d Shankly explained. \u201cWe played to our strengths. We pressurised everybody and made them run.\u201d There was a time when managers were not sacked as soon as they faced a bump in the road. Three years later Liverpool won the league and the Uefa Cup. A year after that they produced arguably the greatest performance of Shankly\u2019s reign in demolishing Newcastle in the FA Cup final. He promptly retired. As Mauricio Pochettino has found, that is not how modern football works. Modern football likes nothing more than to identify a crisis and to respond to it with sacrifice. Perhaps that is simple economics \u2013 it is cheaper to replace a manager than half the squad \u2013 but there is also something ritualistic about it, the elders leading the designated scapegoat sadly to the altar. Sir Alex Ferguson identified football\u2019s lust for blood with reality TV and the idea that somebody must be voted off each week, but the urge perhaps lies deeper than that: Isaac, Jephthah\u2019s daughter, Iphigenia, Jesus, Sydney Carton, Edward Woodward\u2019s police officer in The Wicker Man \u2013 they all pre-date the X Factor. Football operates in cycles. Coaches as different as B\u00e9la Guttmann and Gordon Strachan have identified the third year as fatal, the moment when a critical mass of players tire of the techniques and idiosyncrasies of their manager, when one or other has to change. Managers such as Ferguson and Valeriy Lobanovskyi were able to sustain their success for so long because they were ruthless in refreshing their squads. Shankly acknowledged he had waited too long but was given time to enact a second revolution. Pochettino was not afforded that luxury. The Argentinian, having been at Tottenham since 2014, had identified the problem. He knew it was not just about building a good squad and letting it run. For two years he has been urging rejuvenation but when it came last summer with three signings, two of whom have struggled with injury, it was too little too late. What has happened to Tottenham this season \u2013 14th in the table after three wins in 12 games \u2013 is the price of last season, when they did not make a single senior signing. Two factors have exacerbated the problem. First, that Pochettino\u2019s way of playing is particularly exhausting. A hard pressing style is hugely demanding. When belief goes, the downturn can be dramatic. It happened, for instance, to Borussia Dortmund in J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s final season and, more pertinently, it happened to Pochettino as a player at his first club. Newell\u2019s Old Boys claimed the Apertura in 1990-91 and the Clausura in 1991-92, also reaching the final of the 1992 Copa Libertadores, but the manager Marcelo Bielsa then left and form collapsed; they finished bottom of the 1992-93 Apertura. Pochettino is not an inflexible disciple of Bielsa, is not as close to his methods as, say, Jorge Sampaoli, but the influence is clear and that can create problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a method that provokes a certain level of tiredness,\u201d said the former Newell\u2019s full-back Juan Manuel Llop. \u201cNot just physical tiredness, but also mental, emotional. Because the competitive level is so high, it\u2019s difficult to keep up with it \u2026 there comes a time that the human being relaxes. It\u2019s not that you abandon it, but you let something go because you feel worn out.\u201d If the 7-2 home defeat to Bayern Munich is accepted as something of a freak, Tottenham\u2019s worst performance of the season came in the 3-0 loss at Brighton. Nine of the 11 who started that game have been at the club four years or more. It is hardly surprising if they have begun to feel fatigued, and that perhaps explains why Tottenham\u2019s pressing has been so obviously less intense this season. As a rough measure of that, in every previous season under Pochettino, Spurs have been one of the top six sides in the league for winning the ball back within 40 metres of their opponents\u2019 goal; this season they are 15th. Any disillusionment will hardly be assuaged by the knowledge they could have been earning significantly higher wages elsewhere. Tottenham being in the Champions League may have come to seem familiar, but by most financial metrics they remain the sixth-biggest club in the Premier League. And that is why something feels so self-defeating about Pochettino\u2019s departure. For all their struggles this season, they remain one win off fifth. There was no threat of relegation such as that which prompted Middlesbrough to dismiss Gareth Southgate or West Brom Roberto Di Matteo. Nor was there the sense of insoluble toxicity that characterised Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s final weeks at Chelsea. Even with four key players running down their contracts, this was salvageable. But instead Tottenham have chosen the familiar route of replacing the manager. Perhaps the situation was irresolvable. Perhaps Pochettino, as his increasingly regular hints about leaving suggested, had lost patience with the project. But Spurs have paid \u00a312.5m to release from his contract a well-respected and in-demand manager with a proven record of working on a budget and developing young players, and replaced him with Mourinho, who habitually complains about a lack of funding and, for all his protestations, has a limited record of youth development. Where Pochettino\u2019s sides at their best pressed hard, Mourinho essentially eschewed pressing as part of his rejection of Barcelona in 2008; his Manchester United side had the lowest running stats in the league when he was sacked a year ago. Perhaps weary players will relish the change, but this represents a major shift in approach and, as such, is a major gamble. Sometimes the logic of football does not feel like logic at all.",

Just as Sebald worried over many things alongside the English landscape he walks through, Car Park Life is just as much about Rees\u2019s failed marriage, his worries over his writing career and the ravages of capitalism as it is a study of the \u201ccarscape\u201d . Rees is happy to call it a psychogeography \u2013 focused on \u201cthe psychology of a place: its effect on our behaviour, emotions and imagination\u201d. At one point in the book, he even leads a tour around a Huddersfield car park as part of <a href=\"http://4wcop.org/past/#2018\">the Fourth World Congress of Psychogeography</a>, while sporting a slogan T-shirt: \u201cMy Psychogeography Is Better Than Your Psychogeography.\u201d</p> <p>Rees leads this group within 30ft of the aforementioned body, which is <a href=\"https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/police-probe-continues-body-found-13697078\">discovered a few weeks later</a>. From this, Rees extrapolates a small, tragic history of unnoticed car park deaths: the man reported missing for a month who had, in fact, been dead in an Asda car park; the dead priest who sat unnoticed outside a Morrisons for days over Christmas. \u201cEven when looking closely, I didn\u2019t see that deeper, darker layer of car park life and death,\u201d Rees writes. \u201cI missed the real story that was there, all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Rees acknowledges how ridiculous his project is. But as he writes: \u201cIt isn\u2019t the objects that must change, but our view of them, and our view of ourselves in relation to them \u2026 When enough human beings realise this truth, we may have the potential for change.\u201d He believes that the shift in perspective required to better acknowledge what we usually ignore could be a step towards more radical, societal change. It is both ludicrous and profoundly moral.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that readers will see a familiar landscape in a new light, and understand that there is magic and mystery all around, no matter where you live,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps they\u2019ll begin to challenge the methods used by capitalism to control the way we think and act. The doctrine of never-ending economic growth on a finite planet is dooming us. Cars and retail are part of that threat. We need to think radically about the future and stop clinging to the ideas of the past.\u201d</p> <p>The past plays a crucial role in the book. Car parks have long been developed over wild spaces and beautiful landscapes; fossils and even Richard III have been known to lurk beneath. Returning to the <a href=\"https://www.makro.co.uk/manchester-store.html\">Makro car park in Manchester</a>, a significant spot from Rees\u2019s childhood, he is forced to confront the \u201clandscape nostalgia, the lie of the halcyon past\u201d. What he remembers is not the tarmac and bay markings, but what he and his brother made of it with their imaginations; forced to wait in the car whilst their parents shopped, they played as pilots of a Mazda spaceship.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The heart of darkness is not at the end of an exotic river.

A month before the EU referendum, and his marriage over, Rees is in Kent for a literary festival and takes a trip to nearby Reculver, where a 12th-century church is built over a 7th-century monastery, which was built over a Roman fort next to a fossil-strewn beach. \u201cStories of invasion and assimilation, adaptation and innovation, change and renewal, all laid out across this coastal stage,\u201d he writes.

He is now exploring multi-storey car parks, flyovers, roundabouts and even motorways for another book, due out next year. But even if he has moved on, what is built into the retail car park remains: consumerism, climate change, pollution, poverty and austerity.</p> <p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t just things that are happening somewhere else, they\u2019re right here,\u201d he says. \u201cRacist attacks, road rage, homelessness, child grooming, gun crime, heat-absorbing tarmac, rain run-off.

Stepping out of the supermarket - a space I had regularly visited for years - I was suddenly aware of my surroundings: the positioning of trees, the bays, the mazy twists required to escape it.

BT said on Wednesday it would no longer work with iDEA \u2013 the Duke of York Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award \u2013 while the duke was a patron of the scheme. The prince is reported to either be a patron of, or have an official role at, more than 200 charities, including two dozen that work mainly with children or young people. Andrew\u2019s entrepreneurial scheme Pitch@Palace faces an exodus of support from organisations seemingly fearing damage to their reputation if associated with the Queen\u2019s second son. Pitch@Palace, which hosts pitching events for small companies, has removed its web page listing corporate supporters but companies have made public statements dissociating themselves from the organisation or announcing it would review their relationship. Cutting ties The accountancy firm KPMG, a founding Pitch@Palace partner, said on Monday that its sponsorship contract had expired at the end of October and would not be renewed. On Tuesday, the banking services company Standard Chartered said it would not be renewing its sponsorship of Pitch@Palace \u2013 which claims to have generated more than 6,000 jobs \u2013 in December, citing \u201ccommercial reasons\u201d. The insurance company Aon asked for its logo to be removed from the Pitch@Palace website, saying it had never been involved in the scheme in any capacity. Advertising Week Europe, another supporter of Pitch@Palace, was reported to not be inviting the latter to be part of its annual conference in March. Murdoch University, in Perth, Australia, announced on Wednesday it had advised Buckingham Palace it would no longer participate in Pitch@Palace from next year. \u201cWe remain committed to supporting innovators and entrepreneurs,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cHowever, in the current circumstances we have decided that our efforts in this area are best served through other means.\u201d Bond University, another Australian university, on the Gold Coast of Queensland, has said that although it was preparing to consider working again with Pitch@Palace in 2020, \u201cin light of recent events, the university does not intend to seek any further involvement\u201d. The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, in Australia, ended its involvement with Pitch@Palace in October and said it was committed to ensuring its campus remained \u201ca safe and inclusive place to work and study\u201d. The telecommunications company Inmarsat is reported to be not renewing its sponsorship of Pitch@Palace. The tech company Gravity Road, a supporter of Pitch@Palace, is another reported to be no longer working with the initiative. The IT multinational Cisco ended its involvement with Pitch@Palace in June 2019. Considering their position The English National Ballet was asked to confirm whether Andrew would remain as patron after reports that senior figures within the institution were lobbying for him to be removed. A spokesperson said trustees were discussing the matter. Andrew\u2019s role as patron of the London Metropolitan University will be reviewed at a board of governors\u2019 meeting next week. \u201cThe university opposes all forms of discrimination, abuse, human trafficking and any activity that is contrary to the university\u2019s values,\u201d it added. A student panel at Huddersfield University has passed a motion to lobby the duke to resign as its chancellor. It read: \u201cWe as students at the University of Huddersfield and members of Huddersfield students\u2019 union should not be represented by a man with ties to organised child sexual exploitation and assault.\u201d However, a spokesman for the university defended Andrew, saying his \u201centhusiasm for innovation entrepreneurship is a natural fit with the work of the university\u201d and cited his \u201cemphatic\u201d denial of the allegations. The University of Wollongong, in Australia, has also said it is \u201ccurrently undertaking an annual review of its future involvement in Pitch@Palace\u201d. The pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca\u2019s three-year partnership with Pitch@Palace is due to expire at the end of this year and is being reviewed. The educational charity Outward Bound Trust, which has a long association with the royal family, is holding a board meeting this week to discuss whether Andrew should remain in the role. The duke succeeded his father as patron this year. Prince Philip had had a 65-year relationship with the charity. Hult International Business School, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, will complete its involvement in the current Pitch@Palace event early December, but it is reviewing its future involvement. The Jubilee Sailing Trust, a charity encouraging people with disabilities to sail, will be discussing Andrew\u2019s role as patron at a meeting of trustees next month. Continuing sponsorship Barclays Bank has recently renewed its sponsorship of the initiative, but is concerned about the situation and is keeping its involvement with Pitch@Palace under review. The Stelios Philanthropic Foundation, founded by easyJet\u2019s Stelios Haji-Ioannou, is understood to be continuing its support for Pitch@Palace for the time being. Asked how many companies had ended or were reviewing their ties with Andrew, Buckingham Palace said this would be a matter for those organisations. \u201cHRH\u2019s future engagements are announced weekly on social media by his team on his Facebook page,\u201d a spokesperson added.",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s growing appetite for new coal-fired power stations has outstripped plant closures in the rest of the world since the start of last year, data shows. Elsewhere countries reduced their capacity by 8GW in the 18 months to June because old plants were retired faster than new ones were built. But over the same period China increased its capacity by 42.9GW despite a global move towards cleaner energy sources and a pledge to limit the use of coal. Christine Shearer, an analyst at the NGO Global Energy Monitor, said: \u201cChina\u2019s proposed coal expansion is so far out of alignment with the Paris agreement that it would put the necessary reductions in coal power out of reach, even if every other country were to completely eliminate its coal fleet.\u201d More than 30 countries plan to phase out coal-fired power to help reduce carbon emissions and keep global temperatures from rising to catastrophic levels. The UK has just five coal-fired power stations, with one in south Wales scheduled to close next year and two more to be converted to gas within the next two years. Global Energy Monitor said the gulf between China and other countries was on track to widen as Beijing pursued plans to build more new plants than the rest of the world combined. China is also helping to finance a quarter of all the new coal projects in the rest of the world, including in South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh. China\u2019s coal investments, including domestic projects, mean it is backing more than half of all global coal power capacity under development. The country has a pipeline of 147GW of coal plants that are either under construction or suspension but are likely to be revived, the report says. This is more than all existing coal plants in the EU combined and almost 50% higher than the 105GW of capacity planned in the rest of the world. \u201cInstead of expanding further, China needs to make significant reductions to its coal fleet over the coming decade,\u201d Shearer said. The report says China\u2019s continued expansion of coal power is not inevitable, and urges Beijing to strengthen its policies to discourage the plant construction and incentivise low-carbon energy. \u201cThe path that China\u2019s central government chooses could make or break Paris climate goals,\u201d the report says.

The health minister and the health service executive agreed to compensate and pay the full legal costs of Aoife Bennett, 27, who received the Pandemrix vaccine in school in 2009 as part of a state campaign against swine flu. The settlement, reached via mediation on Tuesday, ended what promised to be a protracted case at the high court in Dublin. Details of the compensation were not disclosed and the state admitted no liability, which will come as a blow to dozens of other people with narcolepsy considering similar cases and hoping for a legal precedent. In 2017, the UK high court rejected a British government appeal to withhold payments to dozens of British children who developed the sleeping disorder after swine flu vaccines. Six million people in Britain, and more across Europe, were given the Pandemrix vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline during the 2009-10 swine flu pandemic, but the jab was withdrawn after doctors noticed a sharp rise in narcolepsy among those receiving it.

      "bodyText": "A claim by Prince Andrew during his controversial BBC interview to have first met the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 1999 has been thrown into doubt after it emerged that the duke\u2019s previous chief of staff said the two men met in \u201cthe early 1990s\u201d. The claim was made by Alastair Watson, the prince\u2019s private secretary for nine years until 2012, who wrote a letter to the Times in 2011 in order to reject reports that the Duke was a friend of Saif Gaddafi, son of the former Libyan dictator. Addressing reports at the time about the prince\u2019s relationship with Epstein, Watson said the two men were introduced in the early 1990s and that \u201cinsinuations and innuendos\u201d about Andrew were without foundation. Buckingham Palace pushed back at suggestions of an apparent discrepancy in the account given by the prince in his BBC interview last weekend, when he said he had met Epstein through the US financier\u2019s girlfriend in 1999. \u201cThe duke\u2019s words in the interview speak for themselves,\u201d said a spokesperson. The development came as BT has said it will not work with a digital training scheme that counts Prince Andrew as patron, amid a growing exodus after the duke\u2019s unrepentant interview about his friendship with Epstein and pressure from a woman who says the convicted child sex offender trafficked her to London to meet the royal and have sex with him. The telecoms firm said it was reviewing its ties with the Duke of York Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award (iDEA), an independent digital skills scheme with whom it is partnered, in light of its relationship with Andrew. \u201cWe have been working with the company since its launch in 2017 and our dealings have been with its executive directors, not its patron, the Duke of York,\u201d a BT spokesperson said. \u201cAs a leading provider of online digital skills training, iDEA was a natural partner for our new Skills for Tomorrow programme. \u201cHowever, in light of recent developments we are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage.\u201d In an apparent attempt to limit damage, a page on the iDea website listing Salesforce, Google, BT and Microsoft as \u201ccorporate partners\u201d has been deleted. Microsoft said it had supported the prince\u2019s entrepreneurial scheme, Pitch@Palace, some years ago but had no ongoing involvement. Pitch@Palace has also removed its webpage listing corporate supporters, and the educational charity Outward Bound Trust, which has a long association with the royal family, will consider his role as patron at a board meeting this week. Amid an unravelling of corporate support for the enterprise, at least one major company that has been involved with it is hoping that Andrew could step aside for another royal such as Prince Harry or Prince William. On Tuesday, Andrew was due to visit emergency workers and evacuated residents in Stainforth and Fishlake, near Doncaster, during a tour with the army. But the trip to flood-hit South Yorkshire was cancelled. The duke had been due to offer his \u201csupport and thanks\u201d to the emergency services but with an election campaign and a politician also visiting, it was not felt appropriate for the visit to continue due to purdah rules, Buckingham Palace confirmed. Meanwhile, two Australian universities publicly severed ties with Pitch@Palace on Tuesday after the banking services company Standard Chartered withdrew its support for the scheme \u2013 which claims to have generated more than 6,000 jobs \u2013 citing \u201ccommercial reasons\u201d. On Monday, it emerged that KPMG, a founding partner of the initiative, would not be renewing its sponsorship, which ended on 31 October. Andrew, who has failed to express regret over his friendship with Epstein, is facing mounting scrutiny amid allegations he had sex with Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, who had allegedly been coerced by the financier when she was 17 and with whom the prince has been pictured. He has strenuously denied her claims. Barclays recently renewed its sponsorship of Pitch@Palace, but is understood to be monitoring the situation, while AstraZeneca\u2019s three-year partnership with the initiative is due to expire at the end of this year and is being reviewed. The English National Ballet said its patronage was being discussed by trustees, following reports that senior figures within the institution were lobbying for Andrew to be ousted as a patron. Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia said it had concluded its involvement with Pitch@Palace in October and was committed to ensuring its campus remains \u201ca safe and inclusive place to work and study\u201d. Bond University was preparing to consider working again with Pitch@Palace in 2020, but \u201cin light of recent events, the university does not intend to seek any further involvement\u201d. Murdoch University in Perth was \u201creviewing its support of the PitchPalace event in 2020\u201d. London Metropolitan University will review the prince\u2019s role as patron at a board of governors\u2019 meeting next week, and a student panel at Huddersfield University has passed a motion to lobby the duke to resign as their chancellor.",

      "body": "<p>It was Pedja Mijatovic who started it. One night on the radio, the former Real Madrid player and sporting director said he hadn\u2019t spoken to Gareth Bale but the impression he got was that his priorities were Wales, golf, and Madrid \u2013 and in that order. That sounded pretty good to Wales fans, already on his side. Songs followed swiftly and so did the flags. One of them found its way on to the pitch and into the players\u2019 hands as they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/19/wales-hungary-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report\">celebrated reaching Euro 2020</a>. Dancing about and grinning right behind it is Bale, enjoying the silliness of it all, the caption covering half his body: \u201cWales. Golf. Madrid. In that order.\u201d</p> <p>Bale had said he was aware of the chant, the slogan, and here it was in black and white (and green and red). \u201cI\u2019ve heard it, especially when I was on the bench, and the boys were laughing,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a good bit of fun.\u201d Which it may be to him, although there is something pointed in it too, but a lot of people don\u2019t see the funny side. Some of them are at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u: Madrid are not amused. This has not pleased anyone there, but nor has it entirely surprised them: there is a sense that this does not break anything, exactly; it merely underlines that something was already broken. It was a joke, they know, but not in great taste and with a message attached to it \u2013 if only because he didn\u2019t distance himself from it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/20/aaron-ramsey-wales-euro-2020\">Aaron Ramsey targets Euro 2020 success after \u2018special\u2019 qualification</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet if they didn\u2019t see the funny side, many didn\u2019t see the point either \u2013 starting with the fact that this is a message delivered tongue in cheek. \u201cBale mocks/disrespects/provokes Real Madrid\u201d the many, many headlines run on Wednesday morning. But it is not so much Real Madrid that line mocks as what some see as the media agenda against him. Often, the media here claims to speak in name of supporters, and there is something in that, many of them far from happy with Bale, but some Madrid fans embrace the words of the Wales fans: they see it instead as someone poking fun at the media and the sometimes toxic environment around the club, saying the things that too few in Spain will say.</p> <p>At times, the coverage has been a little daft and very pointed, it is true. Golf has become a running joke, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/05/gareth-bale-very-happy-called-golfer-real-madrid\">a punchline flogged to death</a>. At times it can feel like no one can resist, endlessly resorting to some forced golfing reference. As if enjoying a round was the most heinous of crimes, eclipsing all else, definitive proof that he just doesn\u2019t care. La Libreta de Van Gaal, a comedy podcast dedicated to the sillier moments in the sports media, put together a montage of golf-related sentences handed down to Bale, accompanied by the sound of a swinging club. There clips were many \u2013 and that\u2019s just the ones that made it into the show.</p> <p>There is something of that in this banner, mocking the press: you want golf? You call him the golfer? Here, take golf.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is the slow agony of a candle dying out, and all that is left is resentment</p> <footer> <cite>Marca</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One front page of the sports daily AS listed three things he had done that concerned Madrid \u2013 pushing for a January departure, wanting to play for Wales after a month out, leaving matches early and heading off to London rather than training \u2013 and used a photo of him on the golf course. \u201cTriple Bogey,\u201d the headline read. \u201cI\u2019ve never had one of those in my life,\u201d Bale said, laughing. \u201cAt least make it an albatross.\u201d He claimed that he doesn\u2019t read anything; occasionally, though, friends send him \u201cfunny pictures\u201d. There have been a lot of them; countless column inches and hours of radio and TV.</p> <p>When Bale recently said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/15/gareth-bale-real-madrid-wales\">playing with Wales was different</a>, that was seized upon as proof too. Few listened to the original remarks, which were reasonable enough, and not offered up directly in response to the difference between playing for club and country but the idea of breaking out of the \u201crobotic\u201d chore of professionalism. He talked about how playing with men he had known since they were kids was like being down the park on a Sunday, a kickabout with friends. He insisted that did not mean he ever gave anything less than his all, whoever he was playing for. He also said it was easier in his own language \u2013 another stick with which he is beaten. But there it was: more proof that he likes Wales more, ergo he doesn\u2019t like Madrid at all.</p> <p>The banner is a laugh. And yet, importantly, Bale surely knows that most won\u2019t find it funny. He knows it can damage his relationship there, that it will wind many up. The thing is, he does not appear to care. Or perhaps more accurately, he does care: he seems to welcome it, enjoy making a point or having others make it for him. Many a true word said in jest and all that. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there\u2019s something pointed in this too, a tightening of the screw. As if he embraces the irritation it causes. Make no mistake, while there\u2019s an element of poking fun at the press, some of this is aimed at the club too.</p> <p>In the summer, he had been on the verge of a departure to China, only for the deal to break down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/28/gareth-bale-move-china-blocked-by-real-madrid-board\">when Madrid shifted their demands</a>. So, he stayed and started this year. He played reasonably well, too. The fans even applauded him, having whistled him last year.

      "bodyText": "It was Pedja Mijatovic who started it. One night on the radio, the former Real Madrid player and sporting director said he hadn\u2019t spoken to Gareth Bale but the impression he got was that his priorities were Wales, golf, and Madrid \u2013 and in that order. That sounded pretty good to Wales fans, already on his side. Songs followed swiftly and so did the flags. One of them found its way on to the pitch and into the players\u2019 hands as they celebrated reaching Euro 2020. Dancing about and grinning right behind it is Bale, enjoying the silliness of it all, the caption covering half his body: \u201cWales. Golf. Madrid. In that order.\u201d Bale had said he was aware of the chant, the slogan, and here it was in black and white (and green and red). \u201cI\u2019ve heard it, especially when I was on the bench, and the boys were laughing,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a good bit of fun.\u201d Which it may be to him, although there is something pointed in it too, but a lot of people don\u2019t see the funny side. Some of them are at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u: Madrid are not amused. This has not pleased anyone there, but nor has it entirely surprised them: there is a sense that this does not break anything, exactly; it merely underlines that something was already broken. It was a joke, they know, but not in great taste and with a message attached to it \u2013 if only because he didn\u2019t distance himself from it. Yet if they didn\u2019t see the funny side, many didn\u2019t see the point either \u2013 starting with the fact that this is a message delivered tongue in cheek. \u201cBale mocks/disrespects/provokes Real Madrid\u201d the many, many headlines run on Wednesday morning. But it is not so much Real Madrid that line mocks as what some see as the media agenda against him. Often, the media here claims to speak in name of supporters, and there is something in that, many of them far from happy with Bale, but some Madrid fans embrace the words of the Wales fans: they see it instead as someone poking fun at the media and the sometimes toxic environment around the club, saying the things that too few in Spain will say. At times, the coverage has been a little daft and very pointed, it is true. Golf has become a running joke, a punchline flogged to death. At times it can feel like no one can resist, endlessly resorting to some forced golfing reference. As if enjoying a round was the most heinous of crimes, eclipsing all else, definitive proof that he just doesn\u2019t care. La Libreta de Van Gaal, a comedy podcast dedicated to the sillier moments in the sports media, put together a montage of golf-related sentences handed down to Bale, accompanied by the sound of a swinging club. There clips were many \u2013 and that\u2019s just the ones that made it into the show. There is something of that in this banner, mocking the press: you want golf? You call him the golfer? Here, take golf. One front page of the sports daily AS listed three things he had done that concerned Madrid \u2013 pushing for a January departure, wanting to play for Wales after a month out, leaving matches early and heading off to London rather than training \u2013 and used a photo of him on the golf course. \u201cTriple Bogey,\u201d the headline read. \u201cI\u2019ve never had one of those in my life,\u201d Bale said, laughing. \u201cAt least make it an albatross.\u201d He claimed that he doesn\u2019t read anything; occasionally, though, friends send him \u201cfunny pictures\u201d. There have been a lot of them; countless column inches and hours of radio and TV. When Bale recently said that playing with Wales was different, that was seized upon as proof too. Few listened to the original remarks, which were reasonable enough, and not offered up directly in response to the difference between playing for club and country but the idea of breaking out of the \u201crobotic\u201d chore of professionalism. He talked about how playing with men he had known since they were kids was like being down the park on a Sunday, a kickabout with friends. He insisted that did not mean he ever gave anything less than his all, whoever he was playing for. He also said it was easier in his own language \u2013 another stick with which he is beaten. But there it was: more proof that he likes Wales more, ergo he doesn\u2019t like Madrid at all. The banner is a laugh. And yet, importantly, Bale surely knows that most won\u2019t find it funny. He knows it can damage his relationship there, that it will wind many up. The thing is, he does not appear to care. Or perhaps more accurately, he does care: he seems to welcome it, enjoy making a point or having others make it for him. Many a true word said in jest and all that. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there\u2019s something pointed in this too, a tightening of the screw. As if he embraces the irritation it causes. Make no mistake, while there\u2019s an element of poking fun at the press, some of this is aimed at the club too. In the summer, he had been on the verge of a departure to China, only for the deal to break down when Madrid shifted their demands. So, he stayed and started this year. He played reasonably well, too. The fans even applauded him, having whistled him last year. He\u2019d been gone, everyone thought, especially him, but there he was. It might have been a second chance, a fresh start; but it wasn\u2019t. There was a hangover from everything that went before, which was only deepened by the fact that his departure had not been completed after Zidane had publicly welcomed that departure. \u201cI\u2019m playing, but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m playing happily,\u201d he said at the start of the season. Nothing changed. Or if it did, it got worse. He had felt gone, and perhaps there is an element of liberation in the mind of a man who had virtually left, a boldness in his behaviour. There is also a sense of defiance now, a challenge laid down. It may be a joke but it also feels deliberate, a point made, a role played, pressure building. Like Bale is forcing the issue. And that flag, those celebrations, do not appear in isolation. \u201cBale will never be a legend at Real Madrid,\u201d wrote Rub\u00e9n Jim\u00e9nez in Marca on Wednesday, merely the most pointed of a lot of voices, speaking for many \u2013 and that point is a pity, given what he has won.

      "bodyText": "Aston Martin Lagonda has unveiled its first sports utility vehicle in an attempt to compete in the fast growing luxury SUV car market and reverse the 75% slide in its share price since the company floated last year. The British company, which supplies cars to James Bond in the 007 films, said it hoped the long-awaited \u00a3158,000 DBX model would widen its appeal to wealthy women, as almost all of its current customers are men. The new car, which has a top speed of 181mph and goes from 0-62mph in 4.5 seconds, will emit more than three times as much carbon dioxide as a Ford Fiesta. The DBX travels 19.7 miles per gallon of petrol, compared with an average of 51.7mpg for new cars in the UK. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasise enough how incredibly exciting and significant DBX is for Aston Martin,\u201d said Andy Palmer, its chief executive. \u201cWe have both delivered this model through our expertise, but also by garnering invaluable experience and knowledge from external counsel, including our female advisory board. This is a real landmark for this great British brand and I promise that DBX will reward all who experience it in their everyday lives.\u201d Palmer did not address the car\u2019s carbon footprint or poor fuel efficiency. In the small print of the car\u2019s particulars, the company said it \u201ctargeted\u201d 269g of CO2 emissions per kilometre. This compares with an average of 120.4g/km of new cars registered in the EU, according to the European Environment Agency. Aston Martin hopes the car, which will built in St Athan, south Wales, on the site where the RAF used to house Vulcan bombers, will help the firm halt a decline in sales and the steep drop in its share price since it floated on the stock market in October 2018. Shares in Aston Martin, which has gone bankrupt seven times in its 106-year history, have dropped from its initial public offering price of \u00a318 a share to 430p. The shares slid a further 2.6% on Wednesday despite the launch of the DBX, which the company hopes will start rolling-off its production line in spring 2020. The DBX is designed to compete against Bentley\u2019s \u00a3133,000 Bentayga, Rolls-Royce\u2019s \u00a3264,000 Cullinan, Porsche\u2019s \u00a3101,000 Cayenne Turbo and Lamborghini\u2019s \u00a3160,000 Urus. At the launch event held simultaneously in Los Angeles and Beijing, Aston Martin said the DBX had been \u201cvery deliberately created with instant familiarity and ease of use from the start\u201d. \u201cEach button and dial has been carefully positioned following extensive testing from external counsel, including the brand\u2019s female advisory board and multiple customer clinics with HNWIs [high net worth individuals] of mixed demographic, ensuring the cabin develops a feeling of instant familiarity,\u201d the company said. A spokesman added: \u201cWe do intend to make this car much more female-friendly. Until now our customer base has been predominantly male. Except for China where it is 50-50. We want to broaden that out. We\u2019re not talking about making cars only for women, but rather to make our cars more practical for women and families, as well as men.\u201d Aston Martin set up its female advisory board in 2015.

      "bodyText": "The lament that football has traded its soul for money has been associated with a departing manager of Tottenham Hotspur long before Mauricio Pochettino was sacked five months after taking the club to a miraculous Champions League final. The famous quote from Keith Burkinshaw, as he walked away from White Hart Lane in 1984 despite having won the Uefa Cup, was attributed to him by the veteran sportswriter Ken Jones: \u201cThere used to be a football club over there.\u201d Burkinshaw was working at a club which had sought to exploit new money coming into football by becoming the first to float on the stock market, bypassing the game\u2019s century-old restrictions on owners making money out of clubs. Eight years later Alan Sugar had a vote as the Spurs owner to select BSkyB as the exclusive pay-TV broadcaster for the Premier League over free-to-air ITV, at the same time that Sugar\u2019s company Amstrad was making the satellite dishes. Any remembered feeling that football was once the people\u2019s game with a pure sporting heart is a nostalgic oversimplification, but idealists still cherish the Spurs 1961 Double-winning captain Danny Blanchflower\u2019s paean. \u201cThe great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning,\u201d Blanchflower said. \u201cIt is nothing of the kind. The game is about glory, it is about doing things in style and with a flourish.\u201d Whatever the combined headache of factors that led the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, to see Pochettino out of the new stadium door and sweep in Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s deadpan unromanticism, it is fair to say he is not signed up to all of Blanchflower\u2019s manifesto. The remarkable ascendancy of Spurs under Pochettino will always be remembered for the Champions League final and those dramatic comeback victories at Manchester City and Ajax on the way, when the coach was overwhelmed by emotion and humility for his achievement. After he had gathered himself, Pochettino tearfully thanked the game of football itself, for its marvellous gifts. Levy was in the cushioned seats in those stadiums, memorably shown on television in a group of Spurs high-ups, applauding Pochettino as he wept his way around the pitch. But now, so soon after, business is business. Blanchflower, Burkinshaw, perhaps Lord Sugar himself could probably never have envisaged the huge financial architecture with which modern football is now surrounded. Nor how it must be contemplated by Levy, chairman of a club owned by currency trader Joe Lewis via the Bahamas, with the monumental new stadium to pay for. The sacking of Pochettino so early in the season, to give Mourinho time for his medicine to work, is a reminder of the adamant priority given to Champions League qualification, and the stressful way it operates for England\u2019s football corporations. Put simply, the Premier League has a top six of clubs by earnings and regular performance, but four regular qualification places for the Champions League. Two from six have to miss out, but when they do, they suffer a football and financial hit which is the closest feeling they know to relegation. Pochettino can be seen partly as a victim of his own overachievement, as he secured serial Champions League participation with Spurs still at White Hart Lane then temporarily at Wembley, and by some way in sixth place of the Premier League\u2019s top six earning clubs. Uefa has not yet published the distribution to the clubs of the euro-millions from last season\u2019s Champions League, the first from the increased \u20ac4bn TV deals covering 2018-21. Spurs received \u20ac61m from Uefa in 2017-18 when they went out of the competition in the first knockout round, and last season\u2019s figures, which Uefa will release in the next few days, must be expected to show that in excess of \u20ac80m was paid to Spurs from Pochettino\u2019s run to the final. Those sums, which help to elevate the Premier League\u2019s top six above their aspirant competitors, are Uefa\u2019s distributions alone. The participating clubs also earn from hosting the big European nights at their stadiums, increased sponsorships and other uplifts, although players are paid some of it in bonuses. For Spurs the new stadium project has turned Champions League participation from a glad bonus to a target approaching a requirement, with the club having borrowed \u00a3637m, which Levy refinanced in September. To make the repayments, fully exploit the commercial benefits of that luxury new stadium in the inner city of London, and maintain Spurs\u2019 place in the moneyed big six, Levy\u2019s patience with a cherished manager has lasted only 12 league matches this season. There still is a football club over there, but Tottenham Hotspur themselves charted the course from glory game to industry, decades ago.",

People living in overcrowded camps on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos will be moved to closed complexes for identification, relocation and deportation with a capacity of at least 5,000 people each. More than 27,000 people are currently housed on the three islands \u2013 which have a nominal capacity of just 4,500 \u2013 under conditions that have been repeatedly castigated by rights groups and the Council of Europe. \u201cDecongesting the islands is a priority at this stage,\u201d said Alkiviadis Stefanis, Greece\u2019s deputy defence minister.

Asylum seekers will not be allowed to move freely in and out of the camps, said officials, but will instead be locked up until they are either granted refugee status and relocated to the mainland or rejected and sent back to Turkey. The government has vowed to relocate 20,000 asylum-seekers to camps on the mainland by early 2020.

      "body": "<p>Last week Jeremy Corbyn was branded a \u201cterrorist sympathiser\u201d by a heckler in Glasgow, who demanded to know where his \u201cIslamic jihad scarf\u201d could be found.</p> <p>The moment, <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1203857/election-2019-jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-glasgow-heckler-video-IRA\" title=\"\">gleefully covered</a> by the rightwing press, lost some of its lustre when it emerged that the heckler, a Church of Scotland minister called Richard Cameron, allegedly had a back catalogue of Islamophobic and homophobic tweets. But the reverend\u2019s terrorist sympathiser insult did not come out of nowhere. David Cameron, then serving as prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/01/cameron-accuses-corbyn-of-being-terrorist-sympathiser\" title=\"\">denounced Corbyn</a> and his colleagues in precisely the same terms when he opposed airstrikes in Syria in December 2015. And Boris Johnson  <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/news/86272/boris-johnson-calls-corbyn-terror-speech-absolutely-monstrous\" title=\"\">accused</a> Jeremy Corbyn of seeking to \u201clegitimate the actions of terrorists\u201d in his <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/05/jeremy-corbyn-speech-terrorism-and-foreign-policy-full-text\" title=\"\">speech</a> after the 2017 Manchester bombing.</p> <p>Johnson seemed confident that public opinion would share his view of Corbyn\u2019s speech as \u201cabsolutely monstrous\u201d. But <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-foreign-terror-links-uk-public-agree-latest-poll-labour-policies-a7764476.html\" title=\"\">polls</a> suggested that the majority of people agreed with the Labour leader that terrorist attacks on British soil were connected, at least in part, to the country\u2019s foreign policy. The \u201cterrorist sympathiser\u201d label appears to be as subjective as the word \u201cterrorist\u201d itself. </p> <p>Much of the criticism directed at Corbyn focuses on his relationship with Sinn F\u00e9in in the 1980s and 90s. During the 2017 general election campaign, Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/borisjohnson/status/868536614246658052\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> a photo of Corbyn with Martin McGuinness in 1995, deriding his claim to have never met the IRA: \u201cYou cannot trust this man!\u201d By the time that photo was taken, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Gerry Adams, had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/world/gerry-adams-shakes-hands-with-clinton.html\" title=\"\">already shaken hands</a> with the then US president, Bill Clinton; two years later, McGuinness would be a guest in Downing Street. It has been widely reported that Adams and McGuinness were still <a href=\"https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/robinson-names-ira-army-council-members-26086260.html\" title=\"\">members of the IRA\u2019s army council</a> at the time. But Clinton, Tony Blair and the Unionist leader David Trimble all held talks with them in their capacity as Sinn F\u00e9in politicians \u2013 a distinction vital for the entire peace process.</p> <p>While successive prime ministers insisted publicly that they would never \u201ctalk with terrorists\u201d, there was in fact discreet contact between British government officials and the IRA throughout the conflict. William Whitelaw, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland at the time, even <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/10/newsid_2499000/2499643.stm\" title=\"\">negotiated directly with the IRA leadership</a> during the truce of 1972. Pragmatic considerations trumped any sense of moral outrage.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s critics insist that his record of engagement with Irish republicans is very different, because he supported their political goals. It\u2019s quite true that leading voices of the British Labour left argued for Irish unity in the 1980s, much to the displeasure of unionists in Britain and Northern Ireland alike. Corbyn himself wasn\u2019t a prominent figure at the time, and became an MP only in 1983; Ken Livingstone, then head of the Greater London Council, was much better known, and his comments on the Northern Irish conflict attracted a great deal of controversy. If support for a united Ireland made Corbyn and Livingstone into fellow travellers of the IRA, by the same logic, those who defended the union with Britain shared a political objective with the loyalist paramilitaries responsible for hundreds of deaths during the Troubles. The argument of guilt by association can easily backfire on those who deploy it.</p> <p>The Labour leader has also faced sharp criticism for his meeting with representatives of Hamas in 2009. But even Mike Gapes, the former Labour MP who is one of Corbyn\u2019s fiercest critics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/13/foreignpolicy.israel\" title=\"\">had called for talks </a>with the \u201cmoderate\u201d elements of Hamas in 2007, and Tony Blair later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/14/tony-blair-hamas-gaza-boycott-wrong\" title=\"\">described</a> the boycott of Hamas after it won the 2006 Palestinian elections as a mistake.

      "bodyText": "Last week Jeremy Corbyn was branded a \u201cterrorist sympathiser\u201d by a heckler in Glasgow, who demanded to know where his \u201cIslamic jihad scarf\u201d could be found. The moment, gleefully covered by the rightwing press, lost some of its lustre when it emerged that the heckler, a Church of Scotland minister called Richard Cameron, allegedly had a back catalogue of Islamophobic and homophobic tweets. But the reverend\u2019s terrorist sympathiser insult did not come out of nowhere. David Cameron, then serving as prime minister, denounced Corbyn and his colleagues in precisely the same terms when he opposed airstrikes in Syria in December 2015. And Boris Johnson accused Jeremy Corbyn of seeking to \u201clegitimate the actions of terrorists\u201d in his speech after the 2017 Manchester bombing. Johnson seemed confident that public opinion would share his view of Corbyn\u2019s speech as \u201cabsolutely monstrous\u201d. But polls suggested that the majority of people agreed with the Labour leader that terrorist attacks on British soil were connected, at least in part, to the country\u2019s foreign policy. The \u201cterrorist sympathiser\u201d label appears to be as subjective as the word \u201cterrorist\u201d itself. Much of the criticism directed at Corbyn focuses on his relationship with Sinn F\u00e9in in the 1980s and 90s. During the 2017 general election campaign, Boris Johnson tweeted a photo of Corbyn with Martin McGuinness in 1995, deriding his claim to have never met the IRA: \u201cYou cannot trust this man!\u201d By the time that photo was taken, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Gerry Adams, had already shaken hands with the then US president, Bill Clinton; two years later, McGuinness would be a guest in Downing Street. It has been widely reported that Adams and McGuinness were still members of the IRA\u2019s army council at the time. But Clinton, Tony Blair and the Unionist leader David Trimble all held talks with them in their capacity as Sinn F\u00e9in politicians \u2013 a distinction vital for the entire peace process. While successive prime ministers insisted publicly that they would never \u201ctalk with terrorists\u201d, there was in fact discreet contact between British government officials and the IRA throughout the conflict. William Whitelaw, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland at the time, even negotiated directly with the IRA leadership during the truce of 1972. Pragmatic considerations trumped any sense of moral outrage. Corbyn\u2019s critics insist that his record of engagement with Irish republicans is very different, because he supported their political goals. It\u2019s quite true that leading voices of the British Labour left argued for Irish unity in the 1980s, much to the displeasure of unionists in Britain and Northern Ireland alike. Corbyn himself wasn\u2019t a prominent figure at the time, and became an MP only in 1983; Ken Livingstone, then head of the Greater London Council, was much better known, and his comments on the Northern Irish conflict attracted a great deal of controversy. If support for a united Ireland made Corbyn and Livingstone into fellow travellers of the IRA, by the same logic, those who defended the union with Britain shared a political objective with the loyalist paramilitaries responsible for hundreds of deaths during the Troubles. The argument of guilt by association can easily backfire on those who deploy it. The Labour leader has also faced sharp criticism for his meeting with representatives of Hamas in 2009. But even Mike Gapes, the former Labour MP who is one of Corbyn\u2019s fiercest critics, had called for talks with the \u201cmoderate\u201d elements of Hamas in 2007, and Tony Blair later described the boycott of Hamas after it won the 2006 Palestinian elections as a mistake. Blair himself met in private the Hamas leaders Khaled Meshaal and Ismail Haniyeh only four years ago. And while Corbyn expressed \u201cregret\u201d for using the term \u201cfriends\u201d in reference to delegates from Hamas \u2013 after it elicited an indignant response from critics \u2013 there was no such outrage when Conservative and Labour politicians referred to the Saudi royal family as valued \u201cfriends\u201d, allies and partners of the UK in the course of a parliamentary debate on continued arms sales for the Yemen war, which those MPs supported. It is certainly difficult to imagine a consistent set of principles for a prospective British prime minister that would put Hamas beyond the pale yet allow for a close relationship with the Saudi Arabian monarchy, given the UK\u2019s support for its war in Yemen, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians. Of course, violence against civilians \u2013 from the Isis-inspired massacres in France to the deliberate targeting of civilians in Yemen \u2013 is a crime in all circumstances. But the way we talk about terrorism, and the application of the \u201cterrorist\u201d label by governments, has always been arbitrary and self-serving. In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan denounced the African National Congress in South Africa as terrorists, while supporting insurgent groups elsewhere whose record of violence against civilians was incomparably worse, from Angola to Afghanistan, Cambodia to Nicaragua. The Clinton administration initially branded the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) as a terrorist organisation, before enlisting it as an ally against Slobodan Milosevic. In recent years, the US and the UK have kept the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) on their list of proscribed terrorist groups, but accepted Syrian groups closely linked with the PKK as partners in the war against Isis. \u201cTerrorism\u201d, in this sense, is simply the use of violence by non-state groups without the blessing of the US State Department. If Corbyn had been willing to internalise this value system and its peculiar set of taboos, he would have attracted much less controversy in his time as Labour leader. But the foreign policy consensus works much better when it doesn\u2019t have to be explicitly articulated by those who support it.

The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, summoned the Chinese ambassador to demand an explanation after Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen who worked for the British government for two years, went public with his account of repeated physical and mental torture for the first time since his release on 24 August.

They also yelled verbal abuse at him during the whole torture process, saying he was an \u201cintelligence officer sent by the UK\u201d and \u201cworse then shit\u201d. \u201cThere is no human rights for intelligence officers from the UK,\u201d his captors told him. Another police officer called him \u201ca traitor to the motherland\u201d and said that because Cheng was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d they were able to practise \u201cautocratic rule\u201d on him. Cheng said he was subjected to nights of sleep deprivation and if he fell asleep he was woken up and forced to sing the Chinese national anthem.

A UK consulate source said: \u201cSimon\u2019s decision to resign was his own. He was a valued member of the British consulate general team.\u201d Cheng\u2019s treatment echoed China\u2019s treatment of political and human rights activists: in a widespread round-up of human rights lawyers in 2015, at least 300 legal professionals and activists were held in incommunicado detention of six months, where they were kept in solitary confinement, subjected to physical and psychological abuses and denied access to family and lawyers. Raab said he was \u201cshocked and appalled by the mistreatment Cheng suffered while in Chinese detention, which amounts to torture\u201d and said he expected Chinese authorities to \u201cinvestigate and hold those responsible to account\u201d. The Foreign Office said it had offered Cheng and his fiancee a two-year visa to come and live in the UK, and that it was possible he would be allowed to stay longer if he wished to do so after that point. As a locally employed staff member of the consulate, Cheng does not enjoy diplomatic immunity. The FCO said it had reviewed its advice to staff travelling into mainland China, but was not willing to discuss whether the seizure of Cheng\u2019s phone and extraction of details of British consulate staff had compromised UK security or led to any changes in personnel. Hong Kong\u2019s justice secretary Teresa Cheng, speaking to reporters at the Chinese embassy in London, said the former British Foreign Office employee should report the matter to the relevant Chinese authorities. \u201cThere are many things that are often reported and sometimes it is extremely important to gather the whole facts and veracity of it before any view is to be formed,\u201d Cheng, who is not related to Simon Cheng, said in English when asked if she was alarmed by the account of torture. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee in the last parliament, said Cheng\u2019s account was extremely serious. \u201cThere has been a pattern of accusations by the Chinese embassy against the UK concerning UK interference when the only real diplomatic interference that has been occurring has been by the Chinese with its Confucius centres and activities in British universities as well as other incidents listed in the recent foreign affairs select committee report,\u201d he added. \u201cIt all reveals a pattern of autocratic behaviour being exercised. Britain must stand up and defend itself against such abuses.\u201d",

Allen put its lengthy gestation down to the success of two game-changing films.</p> <p>\u201cWhen 12 Years a Slave became a hit and did a couple hundred million dollars worldwide, I told my agent, \u2018You can\u2019t say this kind of story won\u2019t make money now.\u2019 Then Black Panther really blew the doors open,\u201d Allen said.</p> <p>Roberts\u2019s casting would have been perceived as grotesque even in 1994. Hollywood\u2019s most notorious cases of blackface occurred more than 60 years ago, including John Wayne\u2019s Genghis Khan, Mickey Rooney\u2019s Japanese neighbour in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s and Laurence Olivier\u2019s Othello.</p> <p>More recent casting decisions that have raised eyebrows were Christian Bale as Moses and Joel Edgerton as Ramses in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/09/christian-bale-defends-ridley-scott-exodus-whitewashing\">2014 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/09/christian-bale-defends-ridley-scott-exodus-whitewashing\">biblical epic Exodus: Gods and Kings</a>, and Angelina Jolie darkening her skin and donning a curly wig to play the French-born, African-Chinese-Cuban-Dutch Mariane Pearl in A Mighty Heart in 2007.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The producer of a new biopic of the celebrated abolitionist Harriet Tubman has said that Julia Roberts was originally tipped to star. In an official publicity Q&amp;A to promote Harriet, which is released this month, the film\u2019s screenwriter and producer, Gregory Allen Howard, said that when the film was in its planning stages 25 years earlier, \u201cthe climate in Hollywood \u2026 was very different\u201d. \u201cI was told how one studio head said in a meeting, \u2018This script is fantastic. Let\u2019s get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman,\u2019\u201d Allen explained. \u201cWhen someone pointed out that Roberts couldn\u2019t be Harriet, the executive responded, \u2018It was so long ago. No one is going to know the difference.\u2019\u201d According to reports in 2015, the film was once due to star Viola Davis, but now is winning Oscar buzz for Cynthia Erivo\u2019s lead performance. Allen put its lengthy gestation down to the success of two game-changing films. \u201cWhen 12 Years a Slave became a hit and did a couple hundred million dollars worldwide, I told my agent, \u2018You can\u2019t say this kind of story won\u2019t make money now.\u2019 Then Black Panther really blew the doors open,\u201d Allen said. Roberts\u2019s casting would have been perceived as grotesque even in 1994. Hollywood\u2019s most notorious cases of blackface occurred more than 60 years ago, including John Wayne\u2019s Genghis Khan, Mickey Rooney\u2019s Japanese neighbour in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s and Laurence Olivier\u2019s Othello. More recent casting decisions that have raised eyebrows were Christian Bale as Moses and Joel Edgerton as Ramses in the 2014 biblical epic Exodus: Gods and Kings, and Angelina Jolie darkening her skin and donning a curly wig to play the French-born, African-Chinese-Cuban-Dutch Mariane Pearl in A Mighty Heart in 2007.",

How can we be sure that certain foods are \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d for society and the planet? As Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University of London and the co-author of <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/sustainable-diets/tim-lang/9780415744720\" title=\"\">Sustainable Diets</a>, puts it: \u201cWhen you come to \u2018judge\u2019 food, you end up with an enormous list of variables, from taste to health outcomes to biodiversity.\u201d Here are some of today\u2019s most controversial products \u2013 and some thoughts that may help you when shopping.</p> <h2><strong>Avocado</strong><strong>s</strong><br></h2> <p>Let\u2019s start with an easy one ... No, sorry: this brunch staple is deeply problematic. The global hunger for avocados indirectly fuels deforestation, while in Chile, from where many UK supermarkets get their supplies, it has reduced drought-stricken farmers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/17/chilean-villagers-claim-british-appetite-for-avocados-is-draining-region-dry\" title=\"\">diverting water from emptying rivers</a>. It is hard to make the case for avos when the nutritional benefits (vitamins E and K, monounsaturated oils) are readily available in products closer to home, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/12/hispters-handle-unpalatable-truth-avocado-toast\" title=\"\">says the investigative journalist Joanna Blythman</a>. But if the thought of life without guac grieves you, be prepared to fork out for Fairtrade avocados, such as those from the Mexican growers collective <a href=\"https://equalexchange.coop/our-partners/farmer-partners/pragor\" title=\"\">Pragor</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Bagged salad</strong><br></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in plastic, it\u2019s the most thrown-away food item, at this time of year it\u2019s grown under LED lights in the Netherlands \u2013 it\u2019s pointless,\u201d is Lang\u2019s damning verdict. About 40% of the bagged salad we buy every year in Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/24/salad-days-soon-over-consumers-throw-away-40-bagged-leaves\" title=\"\">is thrown out</a> \u2013 because it is often bought without a meal in mind, and because use-by dates are so conservative. Tesco introduced resealable bags for salad in 2017, but even then, there\u2019s the plastic and the carbon footprint of transportation to contend with, not to mention the ensuing deterioration of flavour. Come summer, buy whole, British-grown lettuce; meanwhile, consider cabbage or winter greens.</p> <h2><strong>Beef</strong><br></h2> <p>Leaving aside the slaughter of sentient beings for human consumption (if you can), arguments against beef revolve around greenhouse gases. <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/\" title=\"\">According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)</a>, cattle (raised for both beef and milk) are the animal species responsible for the most emissions; yet this dismal statistic hides a wide variation in production practices and thus emission intensity, as the FAO acknowledges.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between the way beef is produced here than in the US,\u201d Blythman says. \u201cThere is no convincing evidence that rearing cattle in regenerative, pasture-based systems is bad for the environment; on the contrary, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/agphome/documents/climate/AGPC_grassland_webversion_19.pdf\" title=\"\">these permanent pastures act as carbon sinks.\u201d</a> To dig them up would \u201crelease the carbon locked into the soil\u201d.</p> <p>The UK is not free of intensive farms, but, \u201cgenerally, our standard of beef production is high\u201d. Buy organic and grass-reared, buy infrequently and, if you\u2019re eating out look for beef from retired dairy cows. \u201cI love the flavour and, more to the point, the concept of respecting the animal at the end of its working life,\u201d says the chef and sustainability pioneer Adam Handling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc5860acb33a73a0830daa86e32d14672419a035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc5860acb33a73a0830daa86e32d14672419a035/0_276_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isn\u2019t it good ...

Norwegian cod.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Cod</strong><br></h2> <p>The royal spouse of the seas, no sooner is cod in favour than it is back out again. According to the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/search?name=Cod,%20Atlantic%20Cod\" title=\"\">populations in UK waters are in dire straits</a>. The status of Norwegian cod, however, is quite different: Norway was <a href=\"https://cod.fromnorway.com/sustainability/\" title=\"\">the first country in the world</a> to introduce a quota system for its cod, and its fishing culture is built around the quality, sustainability and safety of this historic resource. \u201cIt\u2019s not always the most ethical choice to use produce from close to home, and cod is a good example of this,\u201d says Handling. \u201cI only buy cod from Norway, where I know that maintaining the stock is encouraged and supported.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Milk</strong><br></h2> <p>\u201cMilk is rich in nutrients,\u201d says Blythman, and cheaper than alternatives such as oat or almond milk. \u201cWe are a wet country, where grass grows everywhere \u2013 even in places unsuitable for arable crops.\u201d How better to utilise this land than to convert that grass into nutrient-dense food? But this argument only holds if you are talking about milk from cows on a grass-based diet, as opposed to those intensively farmed on grains. So you will have to pay for high-welfare, free-range milk in every cuppa. And there is no getting away from the fact that cattle still die as part of milk production, from unwanted male calves to \u201cretired\u201d dairy cows.</p> <h2><strong>Nut butters and palm oil</strong><br></h2> <p>\u201cNot this as well,\u201d I hear you cry, a spoonful of almond butter halfway to your mouth. Well, it\u2019s complicated. The first thing to ask of your nut butter is: is it palm oil-free? Palm is one of the biggest drivers of global deforestation, and while there are sustainable sources, neither Lang nor Blythman is convinced. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to what extent certified sustainable palm oil reduces deforestation,\u201d says Lang.</p> <p>That\u2019s before you get to the nuts, which could be causing water shortages (Californian almonds), child labour (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-49741675\" title=\"\">Turkish hazelnuts</a>) or human rights abuses (<a href=\"https://traidcraftexchange.org/\" title=\"\">Vietnamese cashew nuts</a>). As ever, governments in these countries claim \u2018\u201csystems are being put in place\u201d \u2013 but the scale and distance of these industries makes traceability very difficult. Buying nuts closer to home isn\u2019t necessarily lower-carbon, but at least you have a better idea of what has been going on. Buy in bulk from suppliers such as <a href=\"https://www.foodandforest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Food &amp; Forest</a>, which supports mixed farming systems in Spain, Italy and the UK, and make your own, or stick to classic (palm oil-free) peanut butter. <a href=\"https://thesustainabilityalliance.us/u-s-peanuts-fact-sheet/\" title=\"\">Peanuts are naturally a sustainable crop</a> that demands little water, has nitrogen-fixing properties and, when planted in rotation with other crops, reduces soil erosion.</p> <h2><strong>Soya</strong><br></h2> <p>The proportion of soya consumed directly by humans <a href=\"http://awsassets.wwfdk.panda.org/downloads/wwf_soy_report_final_jan_19.pdf\" title=\"\">is relatively small</a>, so it is misleading to put deforestation at the door of tofu and soya milk. If you are vegan, \u201cbad\u201d soya is easy enough to avoid: <a href=\"https://www.taifun-tofu.de/en/where-find-taifun-tofu\" title=\"\">tofu made from US and European soya </a>is increasingly available, and <a href=\"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2019/01/30/Soy-this-year-s-dirty-commodity\" title=\"\">most of the soya used by Alpro is European</a>. Problems arise when it comes to meat, fish and dairy, says Lang \u2013 which is <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/soya/\" title=\"\">where the vast majority of the world\u2019s soya is used</a>. \u201cIt is almost impossible to know whether what you are buying has been fed soya\u201d \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/soya/\" title=\"\">whether it has come from Brazil and Argentina</a>, where soya-farming fuels deforestation. Buy organic, local and as directly from the farm or fishery as you can.</p> <h2><strong>Chocolate</strong><br></h2> <p>With most big-brand bars containing soya and palm oil, chocolate carries ethical baggage before you even consider the cocoa. Factor in that most cocoa comes from smallholders in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana, who bear the burden of price fluctuations, and you are looking at entrenched poverty and all the consequences. <a href=\"https://www.voicenetwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2018-Cocoa-Barometer.pdf\" title=\"\">The 2018 Cocoa Barometer</a>, produced by a consortium of not-for-profits, reported that, on average, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire cocoa farm households earn only 37% of a living income. As a result, \u201cnot a single company \u2026 is even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labour by 2020\u201d, let alone the complete elimination they are supposedly working towards. Then there is deforestation: more than 90% of West Africa\u2019s original forests are gone thanks partly to the demand for cheap cocoa. With the Rainforest Alliance concentrating on environmental protections and Fairtrade focusing on living and working standards, it is hard to find a bar that delivers on both issues. \u201cFairtrade is still not delivering enough money to primary producers,\u201d says Lang, <a href=\"https://www.bioversityinternational.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Baseline_Stonian_2016_revised.pdf\" title=\"\">citing an academic study that reported that Fairtrade-certified cocoa farmers in Ghana earned only $36 in a growing season more than non-certified ones</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Octopus</strong><br></h2> <p>Although ethical waters are rarely clear, they are particularly murky when it comes to octopus. On the one hand, octopuses are highly intelligent and there is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/do-lobsters-and-other-invertebrates-feel-pain-new-research-has-some-answers/2014/03/07/f026ea9e-9e59-11e3-b8d8-94577ff66b28_story.html\" title=\"\">compelling evidence to suggest they experience pain-like feelings</a>. On the other, says Jon Ablett, senior curator of mollusca at the Natural History Museum, cephalopods are \u201cquite a sustainable group [of sea creatures] to eat. They only live for one to two years, and we tend to catch adults that have already reproduced. You just need to avoid those caught through deep sea trawling.\u201d Although octopuses can be overfished, they reproduce quickly. \u201cOne interesting commonality between humans and octopus is that they find new ways to live as their environment changes,\u201d says the marine biologist Danna Saaf. As cephalopods fill the gap left by their overfished predators, so humans may come to depend on them for survival.</p> <h2><strong>Prawns</strong><br></h2> <p>There is a new \u201cseafood imperialism\u201d abroad, and our appetite for large prawns is in part to blame, says Lang. Large \u2013 tiger and king \u2013 prawns are farmed in warm waters in countries such as Thailand, Sri Lanka and Madagascar, where production is often \u201cheavily involved in the destruction of mangrove swamps\u201d. Takeaway prawns are particularly perilous, says the MCS, because they are generally giant river prawns, the <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/fish/425\" title=\"\">production of which is seriously depleting wild stock.</a> Choose small cold-water prawns \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/blog/post/pondering-prawns\" title=\"\">best choice, says the MCS</a> \u2013 or prawns from <a href=\"https://www.thehappyprawn.co/\" title=\"\">the Happy Prawn Co</a>, an ethical company that produces 100% natural and traceable black tiger prawns from Indonesia.</p>",

Takeaway prawns are particularly perilous, says the MCS, because they are generally giant river prawns, the production of which is seriously depleting wild stock. Choose small cold-water prawns \u2013 best choice, says the MCS \u2013 or prawns from the Happy Prawn Co, an ethical company that produces 100% natural and traceable black tiger prawns from Indonesia.",

This is the big question: is the Portuguese a spent force? Is he yesterday\u2019s man whose scintillating peak came from 2002-10?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/20/mourinho-pochettino-amazon-documentary-spurs-win-nothing\">Mourinho for Pochettino: are Spurs run by Amazon\u2019s documentary makers? | Max Rushden</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Highlights then included two consecutive Primeira Ligas, the Uefa Cup and a Champions League with Porto; two consecutive Premier Leagues for Chelsea; and at Internazionale a treble of the Serie A title, Champions League and Copa Italia (plus another <em>scudetto</em>).</p> \n<p>That was the (very) good Mourinho. The man with the magical winning touch whose players adored him, whose arrival at Stamford Bridge in 2004 sent a shockwave through predominant Manchester United, and who in May 2010 handed Inter a first European Cup since 1965.</p> \n<p>Yet on taking over at Old Trafford six years after that triumph at the Bernab\u00e9u, Mourinho\u2019s mystique was gone. The major trophies had continued with a La Liga title at Real Madrid and a third Premier League in 2014-15 after returning to Chelsea. But now the bad \u2013 and the ugly \u2013 had become a prevailing part of the manager\u2019s narrative.</p> \n<p>To look at the picture of him poking a finger into the eye of Barcelona\u2019s assistant coach Tito Vilanova in August 2011 is to see a man out of control. A man who then sanctioned his spokesperson Eladio Param\u00e9s to say: \u201cJos\u00e9 will not ask for forgiveness. He firmly believes he was defending the interests of Real Madrid.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet there is a view that Mourinho is in the game only and always for himself. At United in July 2016 he began with an odd media conference in which his record of promoting young players was defended by a claim that 49 had been elevated to the first team during his career. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/06/jose-mourinho-list-young-players-fact-fiction\" title=\"\">To say the number was questionable is being polite</a> and supporters will have taken note of his comment, on being announced as Spurs manager, that \u201cthe academy excites me\u201d.</p> \n<p>In that same briefing a barb was aimed at his predecessor, Louis van Gaal, when Mourinho stated there would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/05/jose-mourinho-unveiled-manchester-united-manager-louis-van-gaal\" title=\"\">no hiding behind \u201cphilosophies\u201d</a>, a favoured term of the Dutchman. Yet what unfolded as his tenure entered a third season \u2013 always a difficult period for him \u2013 was the sight of Mourinho hiding behind the details on his stellar CV.</p> \n<p>His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/27/jose-mourinho-respect-manchester-united-tottenham\" title=\"\">\u201crespect, respect, respect\u201d tirade</a> after United had been trounced 3-0 by Spurs in August 2018 signalled a discontent. During the same discourse Mourinho held up three fingers and explained this represented the number of English titles he had won, more \u201cthan the other 19 managers together\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3d625afc-d411-48aa-8425-aef2b69990bf\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GvU-qPs-ii8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It all seemed a bit desperate and pointed to the deep fissure between Mourinho and Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, and the players. These are the two key dynamics at any football club: the manager and highest-ranking suit; the manager and his squad. How each unfolds at Tottenham will fascinate.</p> \n<p>How the Portuguese handles his relationship with Daniel Levy, who is no yes man, will dictate 50% of the story of his success \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 in north London. The other half will be the tale of Mourinho and a group of talented footballers who have just got Pochettino sacked.</p> \n<p>It is four and a half years since Mourinho last won the Premier League. At United he captured the League Cup and the Europa League in 2016-17. The latter came with Champions League qualification, however, so it signified a fine start, and he took United to second place the following May.

      "bodyText": "The good, the bad and the ugly: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s appointment as head coach by Tottenham Hotspur means his managerial modus operandi is back in the Premier League. Fans of Spurs and some of their players may mourn the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino and question their new No 1, wondering which Mourinho has just walked through the door. This is the big question: is the Portuguese a spent force? Is he yesterday\u2019s man whose scintillating peak came from 2002-10? Highlights then included two consecutive Primeira Ligas, the Uefa Cup and a Champions League with Porto; two consecutive Premier Leagues for Chelsea; and at Internazionale a treble of the Serie A title, Champions League and Copa Italia (plus another scudetto). That was the (very) good Mourinho. The man with the magical winning touch whose players adored him, whose arrival at Stamford Bridge in 2004 sent a shockwave through predominant Manchester United, and who in May 2010 handed Inter a first European Cup since 1965. Yet on taking over at Old Trafford six years after that triumph at the Bernab\u00e9u, Mourinho\u2019s mystique was gone. The major trophies had continued with a La Liga title at Real Madrid and a third Premier League in 2014-15 after returning to Chelsea. But now the bad \u2013 and the ugly \u2013 had become a prevailing part of the manager\u2019s narrative. To look at the picture of him poking a finger into the eye of Barcelona\u2019s assistant coach Tito Vilanova in August 2011 is to see a man out of control. A man who then sanctioned his spokesperson Eladio Param\u00e9s to say: \u201cJos\u00e9 will not ask for forgiveness. He firmly believes he was defending the interests of Real Madrid.\u201d Yet there is a view that Mourinho is in the game only and always for himself. At United in July 2016 he began with an odd media conference in which his record of promoting young players was defended by a claim that 49 had been elevated to the first team during his career. To say the number was questionable is being polite and supporters will have taken note of his comment, on being announced as Spurs manager, that \u201cthe academy excites me\u201d. In that same briefing a barb was aimed at his predecessor, Louis van Gaal, when Mourinho stated there would be no hiding behind \u201cphilosophies\u201d, a favoured term of the Dutchman. Yet what unfolded as his tenure entered a third season \u2013 always a difficult period for him \u2013 was the sight of Mourinho hiding behind the details on his stellar CV. His \u201crespect, respect, respect\u201d tirade after United had been trounced 3-0 by Spurs in August 2018 signalled a discontent. During the same discourse Mourinho held up three fingers and explained this represented the number of English titles he had won, more \u201cthan the other 19 managers together\u201d. It all seemed a bit desperate and pointed to the deep fissure between Mourinho and Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, and the players. These are the two key dynamics at any football club: the manager and highest-ranking suit; the manager and his squad. How each unfolds at Tottenham will fascinate. How the Portuguese handles his relationship with Daniel Levy, who is no yes man, will dictate 50% of the story of his success \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 in north London. The other half will be the tale of Mourinho and a group of talented footballers who have just got Pochettino sacked. It is four and a half years since Mourinho last won the Premier League. At United he captured the League Cup and the Europa League in 2016-17. The latter came with Champions League qualification, however, so it signified a fine start, and he took United to second place the following May. Yet the team finished 19 points behind Manchester City and for Mourinho subsequently to cite this as one of his finest achievements is telling. There a dig was aimed at Woodward for the squad he was working with, and also at the players, for being nowhere near the level of Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. It illustrated how far Mourinho had fallen, from the swaggering Porto manager with the George Clooney looks and movie star ability to cast a spell over players and opposition alike. In Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min, Harry Winks, Danny Rose, Toby Alderweireld, Ben Davies, Hugo Lloris, Lucas Moura, Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko there is a squad at Spurs that is a far better starting point than Mourinho had at United. What will this group be thinking about the new manager? Mourinho likes a totemic No 9 \u2013 think Didier Drogba and Romelu Lukaku \u2013 so Kane is sure to be the side\u2019s focal point. But how will Mourinho instruct Eriksen, Alli, Winks et al to get the ball to him? The football his United team produced was stodgy and unimaginative. If this was no surprise \u2013 Mourinho\u2019s fare has always veered close to ugly \u2013 an eyebrow-raiser was Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s assessment that the squad he inherited was not fit enough. Tottenham\u2019s vast improvement under Pochettino was founded on a rapid pressing game that requires running from first whistle to last so an eye should be kept on the distances players cover for Mourinho. His opening match is Saturday\u2019s derby at West Ham United, whose manager, Manuel Pellegrini, is another the Portuguese has clashed with. This is the Mourinho way. In search of success for a Spurs team who have won nothing for 11 years, Levy\u2019s calculation is this: that his new man\u2019s trophy count is the good that far outweighs the bad and ugly he may have also just welcomed to the club.

In this session, led by a specialist on European Jewish history, we will analyse the histories of antisemitism and philosemitism, and ask: what lessons can we draw for the protection of cultural pluralism?</p></li> <li><p><strong>The French roots of Islamophobia denialism with Dr Reza Zia-Ebrahimi: </strong>This session will examine the reasons behind \u2018Islamophobia denialism\u2019, and trace its origins to a well-established intellectual tradition across the English Channel. Although Islamophobia today is well-documented by scholars, and its most murderous forms (as in the Christchurch attack) reported and discussed in the media, the general public \u2013 led by a number of prominent public figures \u2013 still has a hard time recognising the possibility of racism against individuals presumed to be Muslim.</p></li> <li><p><strong>West Africa, from the slave trade to revolution with Dr Toby Green:</strong> Since the early 19th century, Western stereotypes have portrayed Africa as the \u201ccontinent without history\u201d \u2013 a perception that has endured to this day. In this session, you will explore new research and discoveries that show how African history provides a fundemental new perspective to understanding world history today.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Napoleon\u2019s empire with Dr Michael Rowe:</strong> In this session, you will learn about the extent and diversity of Napoleon\u2019s empire, the \u201ccivilising mission\u201d of France, the collaborators and guerrillas, and Napoleon\u2019s ambiguous legacy.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Health scepticism with Dr Caitjan Gainty:</strong> Throughout history, medical sceptics have refused to comply with conventional medical and public health views. In this session, you will explore the doubt, cynicism, suspicion and distrust that have accompanied medical practice from the mid-20th century to the present day. You will discover new insights into the critical role that doubt has played in the formation of our current medical practice.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Tutor profiles</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"63316c45a896c4ad70de65c10a1534260fbc3e51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63316c45a896c4ad70de65c10a1534260fbc3e51/266_0_490_612/400.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Dawson.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah Dawson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gordon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Dr Hannah Dawson </strong>is a historian of ideas and a lecturer in the history of political thought at King\u2019s College London.

      "body": "<p>The quesadilla, according to chef <a href=\"https://www.theworlds50best.com/The-List-2017/11-20/Pujol.html\" title=\"\">Enrique Olvera</a>, is \u201cthe simplest of pleasures\u201d, and is described by <a href=\"https://www.rickbayless.com/\" title=\"\">Rick Bayless</a> as \u201cthe grilled cheese sandwich of Mexico\u201d \u2013 though, perhaps surprisingly, despite their name, these toasted tortillas <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-07-10/mexico-city-if-you-want-cheese-your-quesadilla-you-have-ask\" title=\"\">don\u2019t always contain cheese</a>. Whatever\u2019s inside, however, they\u2019re the perfect quick feast, as much like an empanada or pasty as a mere sandwich, and best enjoyed hot from the grill with a lick of salsa and a second already on its way. But if you don\u2019t have a taco stall handy, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qdh92tY6fg\" title=\"\">churning out handmade tortillas faster than you can </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qdh92tY6fg\" title=\"\">eat them</a>, what\u2019s the closest to heaven you can get at home?</p> <h2>The tortilla</h2> <p>These North and Central American flatbreads are the thing on which your quesadillas stand or slump. In the north of Mexico, they\u2019re often, though not always, made with wheat flour, while in the south, corn is far more prevalent \u2013 which type you opt for ought to be a matter of taste, but for most of us in the UK, it isn\u2019t, because although I can buy 14 different kinds of \u201cwrap\u201d at my local supermarket, the only one that contains any corn at all also contains twice as much wheat.</p> <p>Fortunately, as I happen to prefer the flavour and texture of corn tortillas, they\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.coolchile.co.uk/tortillas\" title=\"\">available online in a variety of colours</a> (well, blue and white, anyway) and sizes, and they occasionally pop up in the \u201cfree-from\u201d sections of larger supermarkets, thanks to their lack of gluten. Olvera recommends 15cm wraps in his contribution to Vice\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34128280-munchies\" title=\"\">Munchies: Late-Night Meals from the World\u2019s Best Chefs</a>, while over at Serious Eats <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/02/food-lab-great-quesadillas.html\" title=\"\">J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt suggests 14cm flour wraps</a>. Any bigger, and they become unwieldy for the amateur quesadilla cook, though if you go to Los Machetes Amparito in Mexico City, you\u2019ll see them cooking up <a href=\"https://culinarybackstreets.com/cities-category/mexico-city/2014/los-machetes-amparito/\" title=\"\">giant versions in 70cm tortillas</a>.</p> <p>But not so fast: \u201cThough you can make quesadillas with ready-made corn tortillas folded over melting cheese and coated on a griddle,\u201d Bayless writes in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/158470.Rick_Bayless_s_Mexican_Kitchen\" title=\"\">his book Mexican Kitchen</a>, \u201cI prefer making them with homemade tortillas, as they do through central and southern Mexico\u201d. Olvera concurs in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=719102530&amp;t=1572438075110\" title=\"\">his own book, Tu Casa Mi Casa</a>, as does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/07/thomasina-miers-on-diana-kennedy-mexican-recipes-books\" title=\"\">Diana Kennedy in The Essential Cuisines of Mexico</a>. Despite this heavyweight support, it cannot be denied that <a href=\"https://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/000160.html\" title=\"\">making your own tortillas is more of a faff than ordering them online</a>, but it\u2019s not an altogether pointless one. For a start, once you\u2019ve bought the <em><a href=\"https://www.mexgrocer.co.uk/Masa-Harina/\" title=\"\">masa harina</a></em>, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixtamalization\" title=\"\">nixtamalised</a> ground corn, you\u2019ll be within half an hour of fresh corn tortillas wherever you live (though a tortilla press would also come in helpful). Second, Laura Reyes-Montiel, a \u201cMexican Mancunian\u201d, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itzeltresmon/status/1186975130951585792?s=20\" title=\"\">helpfully advises me on Twitter</a> that this means \u201cyou can make them a little bit thicker than the ready-made tortillas\u201d, so they get \u201ccrunchy on the outside, while [staying] a bit soft inside \u2013 yum!\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://roadsandkingdoms.com/2019/nud-dudhia-london-taco-scene/\" title=\"\">Nud Dudhia</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/06/breddos-tacos-london-ec1-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\" title=\"\">Breddo\u2019s Tacos</a> agrees that the hand-pressed tortillas used in most food stalls never get as thin as the machine-made kind, which makes these crisp, yet soft and ever-so-slightly doughy versions stupidly delicious, even in my incompetent hands. Fresh corn tortillas are also easier to seal up like empanadas, as Kennedy and Bayless instruct their readers to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"83121a93814dcf4ff199bf4fc0256bf49bbf996e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83121a93814dcf4ff199bf4fc0256bf49bbf996e/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We tried a lot of cheese\u2019 says Felicity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We tried a lot of cheese,\u2019 says Felicity. (Thumbnails by Felicity Cloake).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The cheese</h2> <p>In Mexico, quesadillas are ready \u201cin five minutes, the classic and ubiquitous dish that you make for yourself at home when you don\u2019t feel like cooking an elaborate meal, but want a feast for yourself\u201d, as Olvera puts it. But it\u2019s quickly becoming apparent that here, they have the potential to take rather longer to put together. Chef <a href=\"https://www.hot-dinners.com/201811307939/Gastroblog/Latest-news/kol-santiago-lastra-noma-london-restaurant\" title=\"\">Santiago Lastra</a>, whose first solo venture, Kol, opens in London next spring, tells me that \u201cthe perfect quesadilla would be made from scratch using <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpf6D1iGFA0\" title=\"\">fresh Oaxaca cheese</a>, a Mexican type of string cheese \u2013 in fact, we make [it] in Kent [with] a farmer named Jeremy \u2013 and freshly made heritage corn masa. When you have the right ingredients,\u201d Lastra reassures me, \u201cthe process is quite simple.\u201d</p> <p>You can find masa harina here, but <a href=\"https://cheesemaking.com/products/queso-oaxaca-recipe\" title=\"\">unless you also happen to be a farmer named Jeremy</a> (or Lastra begins selling the cheese), it\u2019s now impossible to find Oaxaca-style cheese in the UK: the only British producer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/13/meet-the-producer-mexican-cheesemaker\" title=\"\">Gringa Dairy</a>, recently shut up shop. Opinions as to the best substitute vary, to put it politely \u2013 Gringa\u2019s Kristen Schnepp says \u201can extremely mild, cornershop cheddar can be OK, but it\u2019s best to mix it with mozzarella. Mozzarella alone is too bland.\u201d She also suggests trying monterey jack, which Olvera and Bayless also concede is an option if you can\u2019t get Oaxacan cheese, while L\u00f3pez-Alt recommends \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d.</p> <p>Mozzarella is a popular choice, because, as Kennedy notes, a cheese that \u201c\u2018strings\u2019 nicely \u2026is a Mexican requirement\u201d. (She suggests chihuahua cheese, which is another one that\u2019s disappeared from our landscape along with Gringa, though I get one of the last blocks and can confirm it would have been a good choice in happier times). That said, moisture is your enemy here \u2013 soggy tortillas are for <em><a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/chipotle-chilaquiles\" title=\"\">chilaquiles</a></em> \u2013 so this isn\u2019t a time for balls of fresh buffalo mozzarella; seek out the blocks sold for cooking, or, if you can find it, the ready-grated kind, which, tossed with potato starch, is driest of all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"940d28f85017c217b7d420a742a26ef4eb569e96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/940d28f85017c217b7d420a742a26ef4eb569e96/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"J Kenji Lopez Alt\u2019s quesadilla: swiss cheese, spinach and black beans: \u2018the cosmic oneness theory of quesadillas\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s quesadilla features swiss cheese, spinach and black beans, otherwise known as \u2018The cosmic oneness theory of quesadillas\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://amexicancook.ie/about/about-lily\" title=\"\">Mexican-Irish food writer Lily Ramirez-Foran</a>, of Dublin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.picadomexican.com/\" title=\"\">Picado Mexican</a>, says she loves using gubbeen or extra-mature Irish cheddar, \u201cbut if I\u2019m super-stuck [with] only supermarket cheese, I do 60% mozzarella to 40% cheddar\u201d. Others, including <a href=\"http://marlenaspieler.com/about-marlena/\" title=\"\">Marlene Spieler</a>, author of several books on Mexican cooking, suggest lancashire, edam and even red leicester.</p> <p>As far as I\u2019m concerned at least, there is no such thing as bad melted cheese, and my testers and I enjoyed all of the above. In fact, we found ourselves in profound disagreement over the merits of mature versus mild cheddar as a partner for mozzarella. This is <em>my</em> column, however, and I preferred the mild sort, because it is, as Schnepp says, less oily when melted. It\u2019s also less emphatically cheesy \u2013 and my memory of Oaxacan cheese is that the flavour is more milky, and faintly salty, which makes mild cheddar, or monterey jack, if you can find it, a better choice than anything too strong.</p> <p>Even better, however, in my opinion at least, is the mixture of mozzarella and halloumi favoured by Reyes-Montiel. Halloumi, of course, doesn\u2019t melt, but it does have the right kind of flavour, if somewhat saltier, though that\u2019s easily balanced by bland mozzarella. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChefVGDG\" title=\"\">Chef and restaura</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChefVGDG\" title=\"\">teur Victor Garvey</a> tweets that, according to \u201ca Mexican foodie friend of mine \u2026 the cheese in a quesadilla should be the binder of everything and not the main flavour\u201d \u2013 and this mixture is, for me, the perfect stringy glue, fulfilling <a href=\"https://nicmillerstales.com/2015/09/10/tamales-are-my-home-girl/\" title=\"\">food writer Nicola Miller\u2019s requirement</a> that the cheese should stretch out \u201clike the strings of a harp\u201d (which, I admit, is a lot more appetising than \u201cstringy glue\u201d). I also try mixing the mozzarella with havarti, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/quarterlara/status/1188947248320790528?s=20\" title=\"\">as suggested by Lara Q on Twitter</a>, who remembers being recommended it by Mexican friends in Canada, which also does the job, although it\u2019s slightly sweeter than the halloumi.</p> <p>In short, if you\u2019ve made it this far, mozzarella is a must for the Oaxaca-deprived \u2013 I prefer to mix it with halloumi, but you could also use mild cheddar, or havarti, or monterey jack, depending on your taste and what you have to hand. This is casual food, after all.</p> <h2>Other fillings</h2> <p>Having waxed on about cheese at some length, I won\u2019t dwell on other possibilities \u2013 as Bayless explains, \u201cquesadillas can take practically any filling you are drawn to\u201d.</p> <p>Dudhia tells me that \u201cin Mexico, the classic pairing is with courgette flowers and perhaps some poblano chilli saut\u00e9ed with <em><a href=\"https://www.coolchile.co.uk/shop-mexican-food/mexican-epazote-25g\" title=\"\">epazote</a></em> \u2026 you also find many traders selling quesadillas filled with <em>huitlacoche</em> (corn smut/fungus) which you only get in Mexico, or chorizo or potatoes\u201d. Lastra adds: \u201cthe stuffing should always be seasonal. I love to make a quesadillas filled with wild porcini mushrooms, smoked bone marrow, roasted pumpkin and a touch of wild kale with a salsa made with pumpkin seeds, cherry tomato and arbol chilli.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"22f53dff0148553f39640c992bbecc41332bac93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22f53dff0148553f39640c992bbecc41332bac93/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Bayless\u2019 quesadilla: \u2018they can take practically any filling you are drawn to\u2019 he says.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rick Bayless\u2019 quesadilla: \u2018They can take practically any filling you are drawn to,\u2019 he says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That sounds a bit too ambitious for me, but I do try chorizo and potatoes from Kennedy\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/02/spinach-black-bean-chipotle-quesadilla-recipe.html\" title=\"\">spinach and black beans</a> from L\u00f3pez-Alt, and <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JMxLEsZYF2sC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=rick+bayless+quesadilla+rajas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5V98eF4PRa&amp;sig=ACfU3U1m_Wb3_khJNzQWp9sX52t30BpSmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjApOT0u8HlAhX1URUIHVCWBbAQ6AEwD3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rick%20bayless%20quesadilla%20rajas&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Bayless\u2019 quesadillas with roasted poblano chilli</a> \u201crajas\u201d (strips of roast pepper sauteed with onion, garlic and dried epazote). All are, of course, delicious, but whatever you go for, heed L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s advice and \u201ccut, chop, or shred the fillings into bite-sized pieces before tossing them together with the shredded cheese, so that everything forms a single, cohesive filling when the quesadilla cooks. Think of it,\u201d he adds, \u201cas the cosmic oneness theory of quesadillas.\u201d I\u2019d add, as with the cheese, just make sure that whatever you choose is as dry as possible \u2013 drain off excess grease from sauteed chorizo, wring out wilted spinach, drain beans thoroughly, leave boiled potatoes to steam a while, and so on.</p> <p>For a basic quesadilla, however, a few slices of crunchy jalape\u00f1o, and a little epazote, a slightly bitter, grassy herb with, according to <a href=\"https://www.coolchile.co.uk/shop-mexican-food/mexican-epazote-25g\" title=\"\">the Cool Chile Co</a> \u201ca whiff of pencil sharpenings\u201d, will do nicely \u2013 after all, if it\u2019s good enough for Olvera, whose Mexico City restaurant, Pujol, is currently ranked 20th in the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants list, it\u2019s good enough for me after a night out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8e89026f4276e02daed487754916cfbe5a1e1a18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e89026f4276e02daed487754916cfbe5a1e1a18/0_1191_7337_4403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect quesadillas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect quesadillas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The method</h2> <p>More important is the way you cook it. I discover early on that the way I\u2019ve always made quesadillas is wrong \u2013 rather than sandwiching two tortillas together with filling and flipping them over with a plate, it\u2019s far easier to fold the tortilla itself over the filling, to make a half-moon, pasty shape, which you can then seal if you happen to have fresh tortillas. Don\u2019t be tempted to overfill them; contrary to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/quesadillas/?hl=en\" title=\"\">pictures found on certain social media sites</a>, quesadillas should not be spilling over with molten cheese and sausage (or, indeed, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2016/11/29/taco-bell-cheetos-quesadilla/?europe=true\" title=\"\">macaroni cheese and Cheetos</a>); rather, they should be fairly flat or they\u2019ll be hard to eat.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez-Alt recommends frying the tortilla in \u201cplenty of oil\u201d (or lard), which means \u201ceven if the quesadilla pushes away a little, it\u2019ll still be in contact with that oil, ensuring good browning and crisping all over its surface\u201d. This is true, but we find them too crispy for our taste: a quesadilla ought to be have a slightly crunchy outside, but these are almost more like stuffed tortilla chips (though deep-fried quesadillas are popular in Mexico City, so if the idea floats your boat, be my guest).</p> <p>Ideally, however, you\u2019d cook them on a greased, flat, cast-iron griddle (if you don\u2019t have one of those,a heavy-based frying pan will do) over a fairly low heat, \u201cto build up a good crust on the tortilla while the cheese mix ingredients inside get to know each other\u201d, as Dudhia puts it. Eat immediately, or put in a low oven to keep warm while you make the rest \u2013 but don\u2019t leave them for too long, or I\u2019ll have to come round and have a word.</p> <h2>Perfect quesadillas</h2> <p>Prep <strong>5 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>4 min each</strong><br>Makes<strong> 8</strong></p> <p><strong>80g cooking mozzarella</strong>, preferably ready-grated<br><strong>48g halloumi, mild cheddar, monterey jack or havarti</strong>, grated<br><strong>8 corn or flour tortillas</strong>, about 15cm<br><strong>2 green jalape\u00f1o chillies</strong>, cut into rounds<br><strong>1 tsp dried epazote or oregano</strong> (preferably Mexican)</p> <p>To serve<br><strong>Salsa and soured cream or crumbled lancashire cheese and shredded iceberg lettuce</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39b5b407de78ce1ec2e0eee18be26de2decb5d02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39b5b407de78ce1ec2e0eee18be26de2decb5d02/0_0_7676_7196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lay a tortilla in a hot pan and top with cheese.

      "bodyText": "The quesadilla, according to chef Enrique Olvera, is \u201cthe simplest of pleasures\u201d, and is described by Rick Bayless as \u201cthe grilled cheese sandwich of Mexico\u201d \u2013 though, perhaps surprisingly, despite their name, these toasted tortillas don\u2019t always contain cheese. Whatever\u2019s inside, however, they\u2019re the perfect quick feast, as much like an empanada or pasty as a mere sandwich, and best enjoyed hot from the grill with a lick of salsa and a second already on its way. But if you don\u2019t have a taco stall handy, churning out handmade tortillas faster than you can eat them, what\u2019s the closest to heaven you can get at home? The tortilla These North and Central American flatbreads are the thing on which your quesadillas stand or slump. In the north of Mexico, they\u2019re often, though not always, made with wheat flour, while in the south, corn is far more prevalent \u2013 which type you opt for ought to be a matter of taste, but for most of us in the UK, it isn\u2019t, because although I can buy 14 different kinds of \u201cwrap\u201d at my local supermarket, the only one that contains any corn at all also contains twice as much wheat. Fortunately, as I happen to prefer the flavour and texture of corn tortillas, they\u2019re available online in a variety of colours (well, blue and white, anyway) and sizes, and they occasionally pop up in the \u201cfree-from\u201d sections of larger supermarkets, thanks to their lack of gluten. Olvera recommends 15cm wraps in his contribution to Vice\u2019s book Munchies: Late-Night Meals from the World\u2019s Best Chefs, while over at Serious Eats J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt suggests 14cm flour wraps. Any bigger, and they become unwieldy for the amateur quesadilla cook, though if you go to Los Machetes Amparito in Mexico City, you\u2019ll see them cooking up giant versions in 70cm tortillas. But not so fast: \u201cThough you can make quesadillas with ready-made corn tortillas folded over melting cheese and coated on a griddle,\u201d Bayless writes in his book Mexican Kitchen, \u201cI prefer making them with homemade tortillas, as they do through central and southern Mexico\u201d. Olvera concurs in his own book, Tu Casa Mi Casa, as does Diana Kennedy in The Essential Cuisines of Mexico. Despite this heavyweight support, it cannot be denied that making your own tortillas is more of a faff than ordering them online, but it\u2019s not an altogether pointless one. For a start, once you\u2019ve bought the masa harina, or nixtamalised ground corn, you\u2019ll be within half an hour of fresh corn tortillas wherever you live (though a tortilla press would also come in helpful). Second, Laura Reyes-Montiel, a \u201cMexican Mancunian\u201d, helpfully advises me on Twitter that this means \u201cyou can make them a little bit thicker than the ready-made tortillas\u201d, so they get \u201ccrunchy on the outside, while [staying] a bit soft inside \u2013 yum!\u201d Nud Dudhia of Breddo\u2019s Tacos agrees that the hand-pressed tortillas used in most food stalls never get as thin as the machine-made kind, which makes these crisp, yet soft and ever-so-slightly doughy versions stupidly delicious, even in my incompetent hands. Fresh corn tortillas are also easier to seal up like empanadas, as Kennedy and Bayless instruct their readers to do. The cheese In Mexico, quesadillas are ready \u201cin five minutes, the classic and ubiquitous dish that you make for yourself at home when you don\u2019t feel like cooking an elaborate meal, but want a feast for yourself\u201d, as Olvera puts it. But it\u2019s quickly becoming apparent that here, they have the potential to take rather longer to put together. Chef Santiago Lastra, whose first solo venture, Kol, opens in London next spring, tells me that \u201cthe perfect quesadilla would be made from scratch using fresh Oaxaca cheese, a Mexican type of string cheese \u2013 in fact, we make [it] in Kent [with] a farmer named Jeremy \u2013 and freshly made heritage corn masa. When you have the right ingredients,\u201d Lastra reassures me, \u201cthe process is quite simple.\u201d You can find masa harina here, but unless you also happen to be a farmer named Jeremy (or Lastra begins selling the cheese), it\u2019s now impossible to find Oaxaca-style cheese in the UK: the only British producer, Gringa Dairy, recently shut up shop. Opinions as to the best substitute vary, to put it politely \u2013 Gringa\u2019s Kristen Schnepp says \u201can extremely mild, cornershop cheddar can be OK, but it\u2019s best to mix it with mozzarella. Mozzarella alone is too bland.\u201d She also suggests trying monterey jack, which Olvera and Bayless also concede is an option if you can\u2019t get Oaxacan cheese, while L\u00f3pez-Alt recommends \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d. Mozzarella is a popular choice, because, as Kennedy notes, a cheese that \u201c\u2018strings\u2019 nicely \u2026is a Mexican requirement\u201d. (She suggests chihuahua cheese, which is another one that\u2019s disappeared from our landscape along with Gringa, though I get one of the last blocks and can confirm it would have been a good choice in happier times). That said, moisture is your enemy here \u2013 soggy tortillas are for chilaquiles \u2013 so this isn\u2019t a time for balls of fresh buffalo mozzarella; seek out the blocks sold for cooking, or, if you can find it, the ready-grated kind, which, tossed with potato starch, is driest of all. Mexican-Irish food writer Lily Ramirez-Foran, of Dublin\u2019s Picado Mexican, says she loves using gubbeen or extra-mature Irish cheddar, \u201cbut if I\u2019m super-stuck [with] only supermarket cheese, I do 60% mozzarella to 40% cheddar\u201d. Others, including Marlene Spieler, author of several books on Mexican cooking, suggest lancashire, edam and even red leicester. As far as I\u2019m concerned at least, there is no such thing as bad melted cheese, and my testers and I enjoyed all of the above. In fact, we found ourselves in profound disagreement over the merits of mature versus mild cheddar as a partner for mozzarella. This is my column, however, and I preferred the mild sort, because it is, as Schnepp says, less oily when melted. It\u2019s also less emphatically cheesy \u2013 and my memory of Oaxacan cheese is that the flavour is more milky, and faintly salty, which makes mild cheddar, or monterey jack, if you can find it, a better choice than anything too strong. Even better, however, in my opinion at least, is the mixture of mozzarella and halloumi favoured by Reyes-Montiel. Halloumi, of course, doesn\u2019t melt, but it does have the right kind of flavour, if somewhat saltier, though that\u2019s easily balanced by bland mozzarella. Chef and restaurateur Victor Garvey tweets that, according to \u201ca Mexican foodie friend of mine \u2026 the cheese in a quesadilla should be the binder of everything and not the main flavour\u201d \u2013 and this mixture is, for me, the perfect stringy glue, fulfilling food writer Nicola Miller\u2019s requirement that the cheese should stretch out \u201clike the strings of a harp\u201d (which, I admit, is a lot more appetising than \u201cstringy glue\u201d). I also try mixing the mozzarella with havarti, as suggested by Lara Q on Twitter, who remembers being recommended it by Mexican friends in Canada, which also does the job, although it\u2019s slightly sweeter than the halloumi. In short, if you\u2019ve made it this far, mozzarella is a must for the Oaxaca-deprived \u2013 I prefer to mix it with halloumi, but you could also use mild cheddar, or havarti, or monterey jack, depending on your taste and what you have to hand. This is casual food, after all. Other fillings Having waxed on about cheese at some length, I won\u2019t dwell on other possibilities \u2013 as Bayless explains, \u201cquesadillas can take practically any filling you are drawn to\u201d. Dudhia tells me that \u201cin Mexico, the classic pairing is with courgette flowers and perhaps some poblano chilli saut\u00e9ed with epazote \u2026 you also find many traders selling quesadillas filled with huitlacoche (corn smut/fungus) which you only get in Mexico, or chorizo or potatoes\u201d. Lastra adds: \u201cthe stuffing should always be seasonal. I love to make a quesadillas filled with wild porcini mushrooms, smoked bone marrow, roasted pumpkin and a touch of wild kale with a salsa made with pumpkin seeds, cherry tomato and arbol chilli.\u201d That sounds a bit too ambitious for me, but I do try chorizo and potatoes from Kennedy\u2019s book, spinach and black beans from L\u00f3pez-Alt, and Bayless\u2019 quesadillas with roasted poblano chilli \u201crajas\u201d (strips of roast pepper sauteed with onion, garlic and dried epazote). All are, of course, delicious, but whatever you go for, heed L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s advice and \u201ccut, chop, or shred the fillings into bite-sized pieces before tossing them together with the shredded cheese, so that everything forms a single, cohesive filling when the quesadilla cooks. Think of it,\u201d he adds, \u201cas the cosmic oneness theory of quesadillas.\u201d I\u2019d add, as with the cheese, just make sure that whatever you choose is as dry as possible \u2013 drain off excess grease from sauteed chorizo, wring out wilted spinach, drain beans thoroughly, leave boiled potatoes to steam a while, and so on. For a basic quesadilla, however, a few slices of crunchy jalape\u00f1o, and a little epazote, a slightly bitter, grassy herb with, according to the Cool Chile Co \u201ca whiff of pencil sharpenings\u201d, will do nicely \u2013 after all, if it\u2019s good enough for Olvera, whose Mexico City restaurant, Pujol, is currently ranked 20th in the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants list, it\u2019s good enough for me after a night out. The method More important is the way you cook it. I discover early on that the way I\u2019ve always made quesadillas is wrong \u2013 rather than sandwiching two tortillas together with filling and flipping them over with a plate, it\u2019s far easier to fold the tortilla itself over the filling, to make a half-moon, pasty shape, which you can then seal if you happen to have fresh tortillas. Don\u2019t be tempted to overfill them; contrary to pictures found on certain social media sites, quesadillas should not be spilling over with molten cheese and sausage (or, indeed, macaroni cheese and Cheetos); rather, they should be fairly flat or they\u2019ll be hard to eat. L\u00f3pez-Alt recommends frying the tortilla in \u201cplenty of oil\u201d (or lard), which means \u201ceven if the quesadilla pushes away a little, it\u2019ll still be in contact with that oil, ensuring good browning and crisping all over its surface\u201d. This is true, but we find them too crispy for our taste: a quesadilla ought to be have a slightly crunchy outside, but these are almost more like stuffed tortilla chips (though deep-fried quesadillas are popular in Mexico City, so if the idea floats your boat, be my guest). Ideally, however, you\u2019d cook them on a greased, flat, cast-iron griddle (if you don\u2019t have one of those,a heavy-based frying pan will do) over a fairly low heat, \u201cto build up a good crust on the tortilla while the cheese mix ingredients inside get to know each other\u201d, as Dudhia puts it. Eat immediately, or put in a low oven to keep warm while you make the rest \u2013 but don\u2019t leave them for too long, or I\u2019ll have to come round and have a word. Perfect quesadillas Prep 5 min Cook 4 min each Makes 8 80g cooking mozzarella, preferably ready-grated 48g halloumi, mild cheddar, monterey jack or havarti, grated 8 corn or flour tortillas, about 15cm 2 green jalape\u00f1o chillies, cut into rounds 1 tsp dried epazote or oregano (preferably Mexican) To serve Salsa and soured cream or crumbled lancashire cheese and shredded iceberg lettuce Mix the two cheeses in a bowl. Heat a well-greased, flat, cast-iron griddle or heavy-based frying pan on a medium-low heat. Once it\u2019s hot, lay in a tortilla and sprinkle with two tablespoons of the cheese mix, making sure you leave a decent border all around the edge. When the cheese begins to melt, add a few slices of chilli and a pinch of epazote (or oregano), and fold over the tortilla, pressing it down to help seal it. (At this point, if there\u2019s room in the pan, start cooking the next quesadilla now.) Continue to cook until golden, then carefully turn over and repeat on the other side. Serve with salsa and soured cream or sprinkled with crumbled lancashire cheese and shredded iceberg lettuce, as you like. \u2022 Quesadillas: corn or flour, cheese or cheese-less, deep-fried or griddled \u2013 how do you like yours, and what\u2019s the best substitute for Mexican cheese?

      "bodyText": "A prominent Maltese businessman has been arrested onboard his yacht as it was heading out to sea, in an operation linked to the murder of the Maltese anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Armed forces personnel boarded a vessel at about 5.30am on Wednesday and detained Yorgen Fenech. The arrest came less than 24 hours after Malta\u2019s prime minister offered immunity from prosecution to an alleged middleman in exchange for information about those who ordered the murder of the journalist two years ago. One of the last investigations on which Caruana Galizia was working at the time of her death was a massive leak of data from Fenech\u2019s business. Police did not officially comment on the operation, but a high-ranking police source told AFP: \u201cWe have arrested a man as part of our investigations into the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.\u201d Fenech was \u201ca person of interest\u201d in the case, the source added. Officers have 48 hours in which to bring charges against Fenech. Addressing journalists shortly after the arrest, the Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, confirmed Fenech\u2019s detention and described him as a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the case. He said there was nothing pointing towards the involvement of members of his administration in the murder. It emerged on Wednesday that control of Fenech\u2019s Tumas Group businesses, which span energy, property and gaming, were passed to family members on 12 November. Galizia, whose work exposed corruption among Malta\u2019s political and business elite, was killed by a car bomb in October 2017. Within a few weeks three men accused of planting the explosive device were arrested and are awaiting trial, but those who masterminded the murder are yet to be identified. Concerns about the time it has taken to bring her killers to book have led to questions about the rule of law in Europe\u2019s smallest member state. Malta\u2019s opposition leader responded with fresh calls for the prime minister\u2019s resignation. A subsequent investigation by the Daphne Project, a collective of journalists set up to continue Caruana Galizia\u2019s reporting and investigate her death, reported last year that Fenech was the owner of a shell company called 17 Black. Caruana Galizia had reported that 17 Black was due to make substantial payments into two other shell companies, registered in Panama, and belonging to two members of the country\u2019s ruling Labour administration. The information had come from the Panama Papers, a leak from a firm of offshore lawyers.

His lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday. Witnesses quoted by the Times of Malta said Fenech\u2019s motor yacht was intercepted by an armed patrol boat as it left the Portomaso, north of the capital, Valletta. In a statement, Caruana Galizia\u2019s family welcomed the arrest, saying it was \u201coverdue\u201d. They added: \u201cWe now expect the authorities to continue investigating the links our mother uncovered between Fenech and the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff and minister Konrad Mizzi.\u201d Pressure is building on Mizzi and Schembri to step down. The MEP Sven Giegold, who helped produce a parliamentary report into Caruana Galizia\u2019s death, welcomed the progress after what he described as \u201ctwo years of inaction\u201d. He said: \u201cGiven the links between the suspect Yorgen Fenech, his company 17 Black and the minister for tourism, Konrad Mizzi, and the chief of staff, Keith Schembri, both must now step down.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The first televised leaders\u2019 debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn attracted an average audience of 6.7 million viewers to ITV, suggesting the public is taking an increasing interest in a general election campaign that has so far struggled to draw a significant TV or online audience. With little over three weeks until polling day, the debate attracted a third of the British television audience on Tuesday night. A snap YouGov poll found the public thought there was no clear winner, with Boris Johnson polling at 51% and Jeremy Corbyn at 49%. The programme attracted a healthy audience in the 16 to 34 age bracket, with about 1 million younger viewers \u2013 who have largely abandoned traditional television news \u2013 tuning in to watch the Conservative and Labour leaders go head to head. Tuesday night\u2019s viewing figures are a substantial increase on the 2017 general election, when Theresa May boycotted most of the televised debates, resulting in much of the public choosing not to watch. It also bodes well for public interest in the BBC\u2019s head-to-head debate on 6 December, while emphasising the damage done to the Liberal Democrats and the SNP by the decision of broadcasters \u2013 in conjunction with Labour and the Conservatives \u2013 to give a platform only to the leaders of the two major parties. Although online attention has focused on the Conservatives\u2019 factchecking pretence, other popular topics on Twitter and Facebook include Johnson\u2019s defence of the royal family, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attempts to explain his policy on Brexit, and the Labour leader\u2019s apparently wonky glasses. However, few clips from the debate went viral immediately, suggesting there was no single moment that could dramatically change the direction of campaign. Political parties are now aware that a much bigger audience can often be reached with short pithy viral moments clipped from the main programme, reaching millions more viewers online who never saw the original broadcast.",

      "body": "<p>To be poor anywhere in the world is hard, but being poor in America is especially difficult. While the income of wealthier Americans has grown significantly in the recent decades, the wages of the country\u2019s worst-off have stagnated. The available social benefits (for unemployment, illness or old age, for instance) pale in comparison with those enjoyed by poor people in other advanced countries. America\u2019s poor also work longer hours than their counterparts elsewhere, while their children have less opportunity to escape poverty than if they lived in Europe.</p> <p>On these and other fronts America has let them down. From time to time, observers, like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/opinion/why-dont-the-poor-rise-up.html\">Thomas Edsall</a> of the New York Times and the former United States secretary of labor <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2014/01/27/robert_reich_3_reason_why_we_havent_had_a_progressive_revolution_yet_partner/\">Robert Reich</a>, have asked why the poor don\u2019t rebel despite these stark inequities. As <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2014/01/21/why-arent-the-poor-storming-the-barricades\">the Economist</a> recently put it, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the poor storming the barricades?\u201d For answers, we have to take into account the intensity of their patriotic feelings.</p> <p>If we define patriotism not only as an attachment to country but also as a belief in its greatness, if not superiority \u2013 the brand of patriotism expressed by America\u2019s poor is extraordinary. Data analysis from the authoritative General Social Survey (run by the National Opinion Research Center<strong> </strong>at the University of Chicago) shows that over 90% of America\u2019s poorest would rather be citizens of the United States than of any other nation. The figure is higher than that for working-class, middle-class and upper-class Americans. About 80% also believe that America is a \u201cbetter\u201d country than most other countries.</p> <p>In parallel, data from the World Values Survey indicate that 100% of Americans who belong to the lowest income group are either \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cquite\u201d proud of their country. This isn\u2019t the case for any other major advanced country in the world. These positive feelings are also resilient: they intensified, in fact, during the Great Recession of the late 2000s.</p> <p>As long as they remain deeply patriotic, America\u2019s poor won\u2019t rise up. Indeed, they\u2019ll continue to fill the ranks of the military, strive and sacrifice to help America assert itself in the world, and even feed into and support the slogans and successes of the country\u2019s political leaders \u2013 starting with Donald Trump. So, a pressing question arises: why are America\u2019s poor so patriotic?</p> <p>To find out, I spent time in Alabama and Montana, two \u201chotbeds\u201d of patriotism among the poor as measured with data from the General Social Survey. I headed to urban and rural settings in both states, and spoke to people in bus stations, laundromats, homeless shelters, used clothing stores, senior citizen centers, public libraries and other places. I talked with people of different races, genders, religious and political orientations, histories of military service and ages. The <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=27272\">findings</a> were at once striking and humbling.</p> <p>First, America\u2019s poor still see their country as the \u201clast hope\u201d for themselves specifically and for humanity more generally. Because of its foundational social contract, the country offers each citizen a sense of dignity. As Ray (all names have been disguised), an older African American man in Birmingham, Alabama, told me, only in America is everybody equal in principle to everyone else:</p> <p>\u201cFor me, yeah, it starts with the individual, naturally. And according to our constitution, rules and rights, you know \u2026 everybody is afforded that without question \u2026 I believe, right, that I can have a conversation not just with you; I could sit down, talk with the President of the United States \u2026 you know?\u201d Add to this the lingering traces of Manifest Destiny, the long-held belief that America is God\u2019s country, and why would anyone \u2013 especially someone poor \u2013 not want to live here? God, I was told by many, loves all of humanity \u2013 but God loves America best of all.</p> <p>Certainly, as one man told me, the government or some leaders have at times gone astray from the country\u2019s promises. But the essence of the nation is pure and unique. And this serves as a lifeline for those who struggle financially. Thus, as Darrius, a middle-aged white man living out of a car in Billings, Montana, with his young and pregnant wife, stated:</p> <p>\u201cYou have to have some shred of dignity. Even the bottom-of the-barrel person has to have some shred of dignity \u2026 and so when we\u2019re struggling and we\u2019re super poor and broke and going through all these things, you almost have to believe in something better or higher \u2026 and the Americans\u2019 ideals ring on that level because they\u2019re a lot different than maybe other countries\u2019 because the American ideals are supposed to embody those things that are, are like good for humanity, you know \u2026&#xa0;and it\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>Second, to many, America is seen as the land of \u201cmilk and honey\u201d. It\u2019s perceived as a rich and generous place, where those who work hard can achieve much. The people I spoke with took personal responsibility for the difficult trajectories they had experienced, even if in fact all odds were stacked against them. As Kysha, an African American woman in her 60s in a shelter in Birmingham, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s on you \u2026 you got a chance like anyone else \u2026 everybody got a chance. Some people don\u2019t wanna do right. You gotta realize that.\u201d America, moreover, gives money to countries all over the world: it\u2019s a place of abundance, that attracts people from all over the world. Under this reasoning, anyone who\u2019s poor in America should be thankful to be here.</p> <p>Third, the US is seen as the land of freedom \u2013 in the physical, spiritual and mental senses. Marshall, a young man from Montana, told me he was homeless by choice because he wanted a \u201csabbatical\u201d from life. \u201cNobody bothers me for it, if I am not bothering anybody.\u201d Where else, he asked me, could he be left alone and not be, \u201cyou know, herded off or \u2026 jailed\u201d? America is seen as a place of self-determination and choice. Guns came up often in my conversations with people. People mentioned them for the very practical reason that they\u2019re needed to hunt for food. How else to put meat on the table or in the freezer? The constitution grants the right to bear arms, and guns are perceived as essential symbols of freedom. Just think back to the American Revolution, when the settlers had to make their own weapons to fight British oppression.</p> <p>In Montana, these thoughts often took on libertarian tones, while in Alabama they often connected to the civil rights movement. Some variations could also be seen across racial and other dimensions. But, on the whole, they amounted to a surprisingly consistent and strong perspective shared by most of the people I met.</p> <p>What at first looks like a puzzle may not be a puzzle at all. America\u2019s poor hang on fiercely to the ideals of freedom, dignity, abundance, and self determination that America has long represented precisely because they have so little else to depend on. Is this a kind of delusion on the part of poor Americans? Is there cynicism or exploitation in the country\u2019s continued promotion of those ideals? Or is there nothing negative or sinister about it? Is it merely an example of what\u2019s beautiful and inspiring about the strength and perseverance of the human spirit and, yes, America itself? I leave the answer to you.</p> <ul> <li><p>Francesco Duina is professor of sociology at Bates College.

      "body": "<p>At the end of every video game console generation, the industry reaches a crossroads in relation to its future. This year, however, that point feels more like some kind of spaghetti junction. Sony and Microsoft have new machines coming out in 2020: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/apr/16/playstation-5-sony-ps5-first-details-of-its-next-generation-console\">PS5</a>, and the Xbox One follow-up known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jun/09/project-scarlett-microsoft-announces-details-of-new-xbox-games-console\">Project Scarlett</a>. Both companies have subscription-based services running on their current machines, and Microsoft is pitching its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/15/x019-event-rare-and-obsidian-announce-new-games-and-xcloud-service-expands\">xCloud</a> game streaming platform against the recently launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/18/google-stadia-review-gylt\">Google Stadia</a>, both of which allow users to play console-quality games on a variety of devices without having to actually own a console.</p> <p>So what is the future of gaming? Will it continue to feature increasingly powerful consoles and PCs that you have to replace every few years? Or will they be jettisoned in favour of streaming services that enable the games to be played on anything with a screen?</p> <p>If anyone should know, it\u2019s Phil Spencer, head of Xbox at Microsoft. Since his appointment in 2014, he has pushed a \u201cgamer first\u201d agenda, prioritising the experience and culture of games over business or technology speak. Now reporting directly to Microsoft CEO <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/04/microsoft-satya-nadella-new-ceo\">Satya Nadella</a>, Spencer shares many of the same concerns about diversity and accessibility as his boss.

We probably won\u2019t get everything right, but I love taking that step. Gaming has a unique ability to bring people together. It\u2019s a shared experience. We can save the world from the aliens together without being judged based on what we look like, how much money we have, where we come from, what political affiliation we have, what gender we are. I think that the game stories are going to start bringing that to life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0113da05569cb478bf1a1e8f9fcfd885df8b0b66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0113da05569cb478bf1a1e8f9fcfd885df8b0b66/217_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018What does it mean for us to tell that story\u2019 \u2026 Phil Spencer on Tell Me Why, one of whose lead characters is a trans man.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What does it mean for us to tell that story\u2019 \u2026 Phil Spencer on Tell Me Why, one of whose lead characters is a trans man.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dontnod Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So where does he stand on the issue of the day \u2013 game streaming v game hardware? Given the development of console-free technology, was there always going to be a successor to Xbox One?</p> <p>\u201cWhen we created Project Scarlett, and it was years ago that we started, we had the discussion as a leadership team: should we do another console?\u201d he says. \u201cForget about streaming for a second \u2013 do we think there is a design point that matters beyond what Xbox One is capable of today? When we designed Xbox One X, we said we wanted to bring in true 4k Gaming. Do we think there\u2019s something to design for that\u2019s beyond that? We do. And we found that with Project Scarlett.\u201d</p> <p>The forthcoming machine sounds impressive technically, with its custom AMD Zen 2 processor promising four times the power of Xbox One X, AMD Navi graphics processor, built-in SSD and support for 8k displays. But Spencer says it\u2019s not just about improving the visuals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65b0e6af49d301903dc6b60faaae122dcea61468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65b0e6af49d301903dc6b60faaae122dcea61468/0_0_5111_3067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019ve really focused on how games feels\u2019 ...

Spencer announced the forthcoming Xbox console, currently known as Project Scarlett, in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve really focused on with Scarlett is how games feel,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just feel in terms of input, though that is a big focus, but also, how long does it take me to get into a game? CPU capability is a part of that. Current gen consoles are like arm wrestlers \u2013 they have one big arm, which is the GPU, and one little arm, which is the CPU. When those things are more balanced, it will allow us to provide a better game feel through frame rate consistency and lower input latency. But I also think that can transfer through to the emotional feel we get in game. As you remove some of the \u2018noise\u2019 that we have to block out when we\u2019re playing a game, developers will be able to use that sense of immersion to drive ever more thoughtful storytelling.\u201d</p> <p> For Spencer, storytelling sits at the heart of emerging technologies such as game streaming. When talking about xCloud \u2013 in a testing phase with an invite-only beta programme and no word yet on how people will pay to use it \u2013 Spencer wants to highlight how the service will benefit developers and the games they make. For the last five years, studios have faced exponentially greater development costs, without being able to grow their revenues from straightforward game purchases. Many have started to think of \u201cgames as a service\u201d, adding downloadable content, season passes and microtransactions to their titles, which don\u2019t work as well with single-player narrative games and are controversial with players.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Supporting games from Africa or India is a great opportunity for us to tell new stories.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Spencer believes the new era of subscription and streaming services could help solve all this, partly because there\u2019s now a whole strata of companies with money to spend on gaining exclusive content for their services. \u201cAs development costs increase, publishers have to find ways to recoup that investment, because your misses cost you more and the hits then need to cover those losses, plus turn a profit,\u201d he says. \u201cI talked to many of my friends in the development industry and, with us and Apple and Epic and Google Stadia all signing deals to get content, they can almost cover the costs of the development before they launch. They can really focus on building the game. And with something such as Game Pass, once the game gets launched, millions and millions of people are going to get to play it.\u201d</p> <p>One interesting element of xCloud is that it opens up a massive new global market for Xbox games. Microsoft recently revealed that the service will launch in India in 2020, a market where console sales have always been low, but where there are 300m gamers, mostly playing on smartphones. Spencer also talks about the possibility of launching in Africa. \u201cI was there in April, and we opened two African development centres,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are 1.2 billion people on the continent and the average age is 19. For the games industry, it\u2019s just a pure growth opportunity.\u201d It\u2019s also ripe for game creation, and Spencer visited studios in Kenya and Nigeria. He is keen for the next generation of narrative games to move beyond what he terms \u201ca bunch of white guy stories\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was interesting because they\u2019re trying to figure what games they should build,\u201d says Spencer. \u201cWhat I was trying to tell them was, you don\u2019t need to focus on where you are geographically, because your life experiences will come through in the games you build. You can build a story that is set on your continent, or you can just build a game through your own lens, your own life experience, and that will be different from what people would build in other parts of the world. I think that\u2019s a great thing in games \u2013 they allow you to live someone else\u2019s life. That is unique to our art form. [Supporting] games from Africa or India is a great opportunity for us to tell new stories with lead characters we\u2019ve never seen in gaming before.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da4560f2b6aa9b66c7081d4e22aaadf3b379bc94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da4560f2b6aa9b66c7081d4e22aaadf3b379bc94/240_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The xCloud platform now offers over 50 titles for testers to stream, including the critically acclaimed Devil May Cry 5\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The xCloud platform now offers over 50 titles for testers to stream, including the critically acclaimed Devil May Cry 5.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Games Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seems as if both xCloud and Game Pass \u2013 a subscription service that lets Xbox One owners download a large number of games for one monthly fee \u2013 will fulfil a range of roles in the future.

There is room, too, for other subscription services within the same package. \u201cWe\u2019ll also look more and more at how we can help other subscriptions, as well as our customers, by maybe landing subscriptions inside Game Pass,\u201d says Spencer. \u201cYou might have seen <a href=\"https://www.onmsft.com/news/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-now-includes-ea-access-discord-nitro-and-spotify\">the promotion we did with Spotify</a> [which provided Game Pass subscribers six-months of Spotify access for no extra charge]. I think you\u2019ll see us do more of that.\u201d</p> <p>So, according to Spencer, it seems the near future will see a range of complimentary streaming and subscription services, but at the heart of it, there will still be a specialist console.</p> <p>\u201cThe best way for you to play in your home \u2013 today, tomorrow, next year \u2013 is going to be on a local piece of hardware,\u201d he says. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s not a future in cloud. Right now, xCloud is in preview, because we don\u2019t think we\u2019ve figured out all the answers to what cloud gaming is about, and we don\u2019t want to try to get people to buy into the unknown. But we\u2019re a big company. We can support the unknown. We will evolve.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>England\u2019s shortage of affordable rented housing shows no sign of ending, as <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-affordable-housing-supply\">official figures</a> revealed on Wednesday that only 37,825 new homes were built to be let at discounted rents last year, despite a national housing waiting list of more than 1.1 million households.</p> <p>The number of new homes classed as social housing and available at the cheapest rents from councils remained historically low at a mere 6,287, the second-lowest level in peacetime since council house building began in earnest in 1921.</p> <p>The shortfall in new affordable homes is likely to fuel householders\u2019 reliance on the private rental market.

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s shortage of affordable rented housing shows no sign of ending, as official figures revealed on Wednesday that only 37,825 new homes were built to be let at discounted rents last year, despite a national housing waiting list of more than 1.1 million households. The number of new homes classed as social housing and available at the cheapest rents from councils remained historically low at a mere 6,287, the second-lowest level in peacetime since council house building began in earnest in 1921. The shortfall in new affordable homes is likely to fuel householders\u2019 reliance on the private rental market. New research also published on Wednesday showed such housing is almost completely unaffordable in many areas for people who rely on housing benefit, which has been frozen since 2016. In a third of areas of England fewer than 10% of homes are now affordable to welfare recipients, according to a study by the Chartered Institute of Housing and the homelessness charity Crisis.

Key witnesses recall concern over Trump\u2019s Ukraine call Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, faces a public interrogation at the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, with the hearing expected to focus on a phone call he took from the president in a Ukrainian restaurant in July, when the two allegedly discussed Trump\u2019s desire for investigations of his political rival, Joe Biden. The White House is reportedly fearful of what might emerge from Sondland\u2019s session, after a day of damning testimony from officials including Lt Col Alexander Vindman. \u2018Three amigos\u2019. Sondland was one of the so-called \u201cthree amigos\u201d used by Trump to bypass normal diplomatic channels to Ukraine, along with the energy secretary, Rick Perry, and the diplomat Kurt Volker, whose testimony backfired on Republicans on Tuesday when he appeared to implicate the president. Omar urges compassion for man who threatened to kill her The Democratic Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar urged a New York judge to show mercy to the man who this week pleaded guilty to threatening her life. Patrick Carlineo called Omar\u2019s office in March, telling a staffer the progressive lawmaker was a \u201cterrorist\u201d and that \u201csomebody ought to put a bullet in her skull\u201d. In an open letter to Judge Frank Geraci, Omar suggested a prison sentence \u201cwould only increase his anger and resentment\u201d, saying: \u201cThe answer to hate is not more hate; it is compassion.\u201d Community service. Carlineo\u2019s crime is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, but Omar suggested community integration and social services would be a better solution. Fossil fuel output to double safe limit set by Paris deal The first report to compare countries\u2019 stated plans for fossil fuel extraction with the goals of the Paris climate accord has found the world is on track to produce more than double the amount of coal, oil and gas in 2030 than is considered safe to avoid global temperatures rising by more than 1.5C. Produced by the UN Environment Programme and a coalition of research organisations, the report compounds an earlier UN analysis suggesting even the Paris emissions targets will lead to a disastrous 3-4C rise. North Sea solution? A report backed by the oil industry suggests the North Sea\u2019s elderly oilfields could provide an unlikely climate solution, with empty undersea caverns being used to store carbon emissions. Investigation finds Facebook lobbyists\u2019 deep ties to Congress This year, Facebook has employed 68 federal lobbyists and spent more than $12m on its lobbying efforts. An investigation by investigative news website Sludge, in partnership with the Guardian, has found that those lobbyists have previously worked for 29 members of Congress, including several senior Democrats, potentially giving them special access to promote the firm\u2019s interests at a time when it is under heavy scrutiny for its policies on privacy and political advertising. Pelosi and co. Four of the lobbyists have worked in the office of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, while others have worked for the House Democratic Caucus chair, Hakeem Jeffries, the House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer. Cheat sheet Trump has insisted his unscheduled visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center over the weekend was for nothing more than \u201ca very routine physical\u201d, amid speculation that the president may have suffered a heart attack. China has condemned a bill passed by the US Senate, aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong amid the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters by the city\u2019s authorities, saying it \u201cseriously violated international law\u201d. The former vice-president to ousted Bolivian leader Evo Morales has told the Guardian the pair made mistakes during their 14 years in power, but that Morales, the country\u2019s first indigenous leader, had been toppled by a rightwing, racist coup. A pregnant, 29-year-old French woman has been killed by a pack of deer hunting hounds while out walking her own dog in woods outside the town of Villers-Cotter\u00eats, near Paris.

Must-reads My beloved Hong Kong has become a war zone Like many other Hongkongers, five months of unrest have left Verna Yu feeling helpless, anxious and overwhelmed. With schools, roads and public transport paralysed by another week of violence, she writes, normal life in her beloved city is simply on hold. How Bikram\u2019s yoga empire was built on abuse Bikram Choudhury, the speedo-clad creator of the cultish Bikram yoga, built a worldwide brand based on sweat and devotion. But as Adrian Horton learns from a new Netflix documentary, Choudhury\u2019s success was undergirded by sexual harassment, rape and maniacal control. Democrats to woo black voters in Atlanta The leading 10 Democratic presidential candidates will take to the stage for their fourth televised debate on Wednesday night. This time the venue is Atlanta, where black voters will hold the balance of power in the Georgia primary \u2013 and perhaps, writes Oliver Laughland, in the general election. Opinion At a meeting of wealthy Democratic donors last week, Barack Obama appeared to caution the party against adopting an overtly progressive platform in 2020. These patronising lectures are getting old, says Arwa Mahdawi. We have run out of time for vague promises of hope. Obama may think he is being practical, but he misunderstands the urgency of the current moment. Sport The moody, magisterial Portuguese Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has been unveiled as the new manager of Tottenham Hotspur, following the struggling Premier League side\u2019s shock decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday evening. The former New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown has publicly apologised to the team\u2019s owner, Robert Kraft, for comments he made after he was released in September, about Kraft being caught in a prostitution sting at a Florida massage parlor. Brown was let go following accusations of rape and sexual misconduct. Sign up The US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

      "body": "<p>Thirty years ago, the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/contents\" title=\"\">Children Act 1989</a> received royal assent and fundamentally changed children\u2019s standing in law. Central to the act was recognition that the child\u2019s best interest and welfare is the first and paramount consideration, thus rebalancing children\u2019s and parents\u2019 rights. We work to a children\u2019s act, not a parents\u2019 act.</p> <p>Then, 15 years ago, the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/31/contents\" title=\"\">2004 act</a> went further, providing the legal underpinning for the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/every-child-matters\" title=\"\">Every Child Matters framework</a>. This act gave clear accountability for children\u2019s outcomes in a local area in the form of the new role of director of children\u2019s services (DCS).</p> <p>It seems right on these twin anniversaries that we reflect on the successes of the acts and the challenges facing children, families and services today.</p> <p>Both acts laid the pathway to real progress at national and local levels. The care system is delivering better outcomes than ever and we are getting better at achieving permanent arrangements. We\u2019re good at child protection: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/mar/14/the-uk-child-protection-system-is-laudable-why-risk-it-with-reform\" title=\"\">England has one of the safest child protection systems in the world</a> and we have a better understanding of vulnerability.</p> <p>I look back on well over 30 years of public service with a great deal of pride at what we have achieved for children. I have been privileged to spend my professional life working alongside countless committed professionals who share a determination to improve children\u2019s lives. I see daily that frontline practice and strategic work builds around the child\u2019s voice, their views and wishes in a way that was barely evident 30 years ago. I am proud of how much more we know about what good looks like and how to deliver it.</p> <p>However, I fear that if national policies remain unchanged, then more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/02/child-poverty-britain-set-to-soar-to-new-record-ifs\" title=\"\">5 million children will soon be living in poverty</a>.

      "bodyText": "Thirty years ago, the Children Act 1989 received royal assent and fundamentally changed children\u2019s standing in law. Central to the act was recognition that the child\u2019s best interest and welfare is the first and paramount consideration, thus rebalancing children\u2019s and parents\u2019 rights. We work to a children\u2019s act, not a parents\u2019 act. Then, 15 years ago, the 2004 act went further, providing the legal underpinning for the Every Child Matters framework. This act gave clear accountability for children\u2019s outcomes in a local area in the form of the new role of director of children\u2019s services (DCS). It seems right on these twin anniversaries that we reflect on the successes of the acts and the challenges facing children, families and services today. Both acts laid the pathway to real progress at national and local levels. The care system is delivering better outcomes than ever and we are getting better at achieving permanent arrangements. We\u2019re good at child protection: England has one of the safest child protection systems in the world and we have a better understanding of vulnerability. I look back on well over 30 years of public service with a great deal of pride at what we have achieved for children. I have been privileged to spend my professional life working alongside countless committed professionals who share a determination to improve children\u2019s lives. I see daily that frontline practice and strategic work builds around the child\u2019s voice, their views and wishes in a way that was barely evident 30 years ago. I am proud of how much more we know about what good looks like and how to deliver it. However, I fear that if national policies remain unchanged, then more than 5 million children will soon be living in poverty. Poverty damages childhoods; it damages life chances; and it stores up costs for the NHS and adult social care. There is no excuse for the state\u2019s inadequate response to tackle child and family poverty. The drafters of the acts could not have envisioned that children\u2019s services would be working with current levels of pressure.

It sits above his most memorable adage: \u201cAll things are poison \u2026 the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison.\u201d Next to this is the logo of British American Tobacco (BAT), whose cigarettes have poisoned to death more people than it would probably care to calculate.</p> <p>The lab, part of the tobacco company\u2019s sprawling research and development centre, is a rare indoor space where smoking is legal. Marianna Gaca, a BAT biologist, shows me a robot. A dozen or so steel mouths spin on a wheel, each designed to hold a cigarette. Fat syringes draw the tobacco smoke along tubing into sealed petri dishes that contain human lung cells. The machine used to be part of BAT\u2019s doomed attempts to make its cigarettes safer.

The liquids are mostly propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine, organic compounds used in foods and medicines. They are blended with nicotine and food-grade flavours and turn to vapour when warmed by the battery-powered device.</p> <p>Gaca reaches for three plastic dishes containing filter pads that have been exposed to either smoke or vapour. \u201cThis is from the cigarette,\u201d she says, pointing to a pad that is thick with a muddy-brown tar. \u201cThis is from one of our e-cigarettes, and this one is just fresh air.\u201d These two pads are indistinguishable, remaining a brilliant white. \u201cThis is such a huge evolution,\u201d Gaca adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0459816f8a651a142e0955eaef7597b57d8db2dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0459816f8a651a142e0955eaef7597b57d8db2dd/0_95_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scientist at work in the BAT lab.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scientist at work in the BAT lab.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The newspaper headlines on the week of my visit seem to point to another story, however. \u201cIs this proof vaping can kill?\u201d; \u201cE-cig danger \u2018timebomb\u2019\u201d; \u201cVaping horror stories\u201d, they read. A decade after e-cigarettes went on sale, we are in the grip of, depending who you talk to, a major health scare or a moral panic. Alarm is even greater in the US, <a href=\"https://www.nst.com.my/world/world/2019/11/538806/us-vaping-related-deaths-rise-42-cases-illness-2172\" title=\"\">where 42 deaths from respiratory illness have been reported</a> among people with a history of vaping. More than 2,000 lung injuries have also been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US health agency. While it investigates the outbreak, which began in April, and its apparent link to vaping, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html\" title=\"\">CDC has advised</a> Americans not to vape products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active compound in cannabis, or to use vaping products from \u201cinformal\u201d sources.</p> <p>Coverage in the UK intensified with the first reported death linked to vaping. Terry Miller, a 57-year-old factory worker from Gateshead, died of lipoid pneumonia in 2010, a rare condition in which fat particles get into the lungs. His inquest recorded an open verdict, but his widow, Glynis Miller, has always suspected her husband\u2019s e-cigarettes. \u201cWho says they are safe?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/who-says-they-are-safe-demands-vapers-widow-rqnm3dst6\" title=\"\">she asked in an interview in September</a>.</p> <p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which regulates vaping products in the UK, has recorded 74 reports of health problems over the past five years. The agency said this did not prove a link to vaping; only that those reporting their conditions suspected it as a cause.</p> <p>In 2016, Gareth Walters, a respiratory consultant in Birmingham, treated a 34-year-old woman with lipoid pneumonia. She had used e-cigarettes for two years. \u201cOn the balance of probability, vaping was the only likely cause,\u201d Walters says. When he wrote to the manufacturer, an obscure company, the name of which he can\u2019t now remember, it did not respond to his request for a list of ingredients. Last week, Ewan Fisher, a 19-year-old former smoker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/12/uk-teenager-needed-life-support-over-vaping-linked-disease\" title=\"\">urged people not to vape</a> three years after he suffered serious respiratory failure in a case his consultant also linked to e-cigarettes.</p> <p>More than 3.6 million Britons vape, according to survey data collected by the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). A handful of suspected health problems does not make an epidemic. But decades after the link was established between smoking and cancer, the public could be forgiven for thinking e-cigarettes are roughly as bad. \u201cI see kids using them and I think: \u2018Oh, my God. You don\u2019t know what you are taking into your body!\u2019\u201d Miller said.</p> <p>David O\u2019Reilly is sitting in BAT\u2019s windowless \u201cR&amp;D Live\u201d visitor centre, a slick corporate display of devices and information. He joined BAT almost 30 years ago and sits on its management board as its director of scientific research. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about what is happening in the US,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we stand behind our products, and the work we do here to make sure that what we put into them will not lead to these acute diseases.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Reilly, who is 53, is keen to point out a difference between vaping in the UK and the US. Here, MHRA regulation and EU law heavily restrict what can be sold. While several US states have now lined up to ban vaping, national regulation still barely exists. Vaping devices are being used to consume cannabis. Many of the US deaths have been linked to THC and to high levels of vitamin E acetate, an oily additive. Many suspect cartridges had been sold illicitly on a hidden market for bootleg blends that has flourished in the absence of regulation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The consequence of this panic is that people will go back to smoking and die as a result</p> <footer> <cite>Public Health England</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>BAT has a big interest in protecting the reputation of its \u201creduced risk products\u201d. As well as vape pens, it makes \u201cheat-not-burn\u201d devices, which heat a stick of blended tobacco at much lower temperatures than cigarettes. Global revenues from the products hit almost \u00a31bn last year, a number that the company expects to rise to \u00a35bn by 2023. BAT says it makes up 39% of the UK vape market by value. By comparison, its cigarette revenues last year (its brands include Dunhill and Camel) were \u00a315.5bn, but most cigarette markets, including the UK\u2019s, are shrinking. As part of a fraught transition, BAT has announced plans to cut 2,300 of its 55,000 jobs globally by January.</p> <p>Yet tobacco companies are not alone in defending e-cigarettes. \u201cThe consequence of this panic [about vaping] is that people will go back to smoking and die as a result,\u201d says Martin Dockrell, the tobacco control programme lead at Public Health England. While the agency has called for more research into the long-term effects, and advises non-smokers not to vape, it still estimates that \u2013 because the constituents of cigarette smoke that harm health are either absent in e-cigarette vapour or present at much lower levels \u2013 vaping is, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/456704/McNeill-Hajek_report_authors_note_on_evidence_for_95_estimate.pdf\" title=\"\">in the long term, 95% less harmful than smoking</a>. Dockrell says he has already seen case reports of vapers going back to cigarettes. \u201cUK deaths from regulated e-cigarette products in the UK are nil,\u201d he adds. \u201cSmoking still kills 220 people every day.\u201d</p> <p>Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of Ash, says a colleague was advised by his GP to stop vaping because it was more dangerous than smoking. \u201cIt really worries me because GPs reflect what everyone else is seeing, which is this panic,\u201d she says. <a href=\"https://ash.org.uk/media-and-news/press-releases-media-and-news/in-2019-around-half-as-many-britons-now-vape-as-smoke-and-the-majority-are-ex-smokers/\" title=\"\">According to Ash\u2019s latest survey</a>, 22% of smokers believe vaping is as dangerous or more dangerous than cigarettes, a proportion that may rise. \u201cI\u2019m with Public Health England,\u201d says Walters, the Birmingham lung doctor. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to give up smoking, then vaping is a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>Public health experts are not easy allies of big tobacco, even if they are both pursuing alternatives to cigarettes. The tone of the scare betrays some of this tension. Before it started, the US was already on edge about Juul, a California startup that launched sleek e-cigarettes in 2015. It promoted its flavours on Instagram and connected with young people. According to <a href=\"http://monitoringthefuture.org/pressreleases/18drugpr.pdf\" title=\"\">one US survey</a> last year, one in five 12th grade students (aged 16-18) had vaped in the previous 30 days.</p> <p>The youth \u201caddiction crisis\u201d, as the Food and Drug Administration called it, intensified in December when Altria Group, formerly known as Philip Morris Companies (its brands include Marlboro), bought a 35% stake in Juul for $12.8bn (\u00a310bn). The billionaire philanthropist Michael Bloomberg has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.org/press/releases/bloomberg-philanthropies-launches-new-160-million-program-end-youth-e-cigarette-epidemic/\" title=\"\">accused</a> tobacco companies with vape brands of \u201cpreying on America\u2019s youth \u2026 using the same marketing tactics that once lured kids to cigarettes\u201d.</p> <p>The industry had taken a while to get involved in vaping. A Chinese pharmacist and smoker called Hon Lik is credited with inventing the modern device. The first e-cigarettes hit the UK market in 2008, a year after the indoor smoking ban. Smokers were ready to try something different (indoor vaping bans by businesses came later). Small companies met the demand and vaping spread quickly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f85df2341cdc18ab9b15949485d4b50559a2914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f85df2341cdc18ab9b15949485d4b50559a2914/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vaping products being tested in the BAT lab.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vaping products being tested in the BAT lab.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fearing a \u201cKodak moment\u201d, as Arnott puts it, the tobacco companies began to buy up the competition. Blu eCigs, which was founded in Australia in 2009, is now owned by Imperial Brands (which owns the Virginia, Drum and Rizla brands). BAT launched its first electronic device in 2012, and Vype in 2013. Altria\u2019s grip on Juul tightened in September when it replaced the company\u2019s CEO, Kevin Burns, with a previous employee, KC Crosthwaite.</p> <p>As tobacco companies marched into the new market, suspicions of their intentions intensified. Their earlier attempts to create less deadly products had already failed: in the 1970s, \u201csafer\u201d filtered or light cigarettes only slowed the delivery of nicotine. To compensate, smokers puffed more deeply, inhaling more tar. They also continued to smoke because it felt safer. Ash <a href=\"http://ash.org.uk/media-and-news/press-releases-media-and-news/why-low-tar-cigarettes-dont-work-how-the-tobacco-industry-fooled-the-smoking-public/\" title=\"\">described</a> the cigarettes as \u201ca grotesque confidence trick\u201d.</p> <p>Electronic cigarettes produce no tar at all, but for the tobacco control movement, big tobacco\u2019s growing involvement in vaping comes with unsettling echoes. The companies have spent millions on advertising, 16 years after cigarette adverts were banned from British billboards. Instagram is the new battleground. Ash has accused BAT of breaching guidelines by using its Vype Instagram account to target young people, pairing images of cool young vapers with unrelated trending hashtags including the names of celebrities. The Advertising Standards Authority is investigating. \u201cWe have marketing principles that stipulate responsible use of social media and any complaints we take very seriously,\u201d O\u2019Reilly says. Juul shut down its Instagram account last November.</p> <p>Arnott is also concerned about BAT\u2019s revived interest in policymaking. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/09/birmingham-city-council-project-british-american-tobacco-a-disgrace\" title=\"\">it emerged</a> that BAT was working on a pilot scheme with Birmingham city council to promote its vaping products. The MP Steve Brine, then a health minister, called it \u201ca disgrace\u201d that BAT was \u201cexploiting\u201d smokers for profit, adding: \u201cWe have a duty to protect our public health services from the commercial interests of the tobacco industry.\u201d BAT defended the scheme as a success, \u201cwith many participants making a switch from cigarettes\u201d.</p> <p>O\u2019Reilly says BAT is committed to developing safer alternatives to cigarettes \u2013 and shouting about it. \u201cBut for a number of people in the tobacco-control movement, it was an abhorrent idea that suddenly this industry, which had been vilified and demonised, was suddenly going to be a big part of the solution,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I\u2019d say to them is: we\u2019re not running this business in the 1970s. We should be judged not on our history, but on our actions today.\u201d</p> <p>Yet tobacco firms have been accused very recently of using old tactics to push cigarettes in markets without profitable alternatives. In 2017, the Guardian exposed BAT for trying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/12/big-tobacco-dirty-war-africa-market\" title=\"\">to use the courts</a> to crush anti-smoking regulations in Kenya and Uganda. The company said it reserved the right to ask courts to intervene where it believed regulations may not comply with the law. \u201cWe would support all regulation that we think will have an effect on public health,\u201d O\u2019Reilly adds. Last month, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/31/bat-faces-landmark-legal-case-over-malawi-families-poverty-wages\" title=\"\">Guardian revealed that BAT faces court action in London</a> after claims that families in Malawian tobacco fields were forced by poverty wages to use their children as unpaid labour (BAT says it had told farmers not to use child labour).</p> <p>If BAT is so committed to public health and the transition to healthier devices, why not stop making cigarettes? \u201cWell, it\u2019s a good question,\u201d O\u2019Reilly says. \u201cIt is still the core of our business and we need the profits from our cigarette business to fuel the innovation and commercialisation of new categories.\u201d He adds: \u201cObviously, we also have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to give them a return on their investment.\u201d O\u2019Reilly owns shares worth more than \u00a31m, according to the company\u2019s annual report.</p> <p>BAT now employs more than 1,500 scientists, almost all of them working on electronic devices. Sami Haikala joined BAT last year after jobs at Microsoft and Nokia. To reach his lab, I walk through a test production line for cigarettes that reeks of sweet tobacco. The lab itself is full of electron microscopes and 3D x-ray machines. A drop test chamber containing an e-cigarette turns like a tombola, the device clunking with each turn. \u201cIf it can tolerate 200 drops, then it\u2019s good,\u201d Haikala says.</p> <p>Back in the lab, Gaca, who is 47, recalls joining BAT 15 years ago, before e-cigarettes appeared on the horizon. \u201cWhen I talked to my peers about it, they said: \u2018Why are you going there? Nobody will talk to you \u2013 you\u2019ll be the black sheep,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThey said the industry was not in a good place; that it had a bad name. But I saw real opportunities here.\u201d She comes from a family of smokers, and says her husband used vaping to quit cigarettes. What does he think now? \u201cWe can only stand by our data,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2020 because an earlier version wrongly suggested that there was legislation banning indoor vaping. The article has been clarified to refer to indoor vaping bans by individual businesses.</p>",

The liquids are mostly propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine, organic compounds used in foods and medicines. They are blended with nicotine and food-grade flavours and turn to vapour when warmed by the battery-powered device. Gaca reaches for three plastic dishes containing filter pads that have been exposed to either smoke or vapour. \u201cThis is from the cigarette,\u201d she says, pointing to a pad that is thick with a muddy-brown tar. \u201cThis is from one of our e-cigarettes, and this one is just fresh air.\u201d These two pads are indistinguishable, remaining a brilliant white. \u201cThis is such a huge evolution,\u201d Gaca adds. The newspaper headlines on the week of my visit seem to point to another story, however. \u201cIs this proof vaping can kill?\u201d; \u201cE-cig danger \u2018timebomb\u2019\u201d; \u201cVaping horror stories\u201d, they read. A decade after e-cigarettes went on sale, we are in the grip of, depending who you talk to, a major health scare or a moral panic. Alarm is even greater in the US, where 42 deaths from respiratory illness have been reported among people with a history of vaping. More than 2,000 lung injuries have also been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US health agency. While it investigates the outbreak, which began in April, and its apparent link to vaping, the CDC has advised Americans not to vape products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active compound in cannabis, or to use vaping products from \u201cinformal\u201d sources. Coverage in the UK intensified with the first reported death linked to vaping. Terry Miller, a 57-year-old factory worker from Gateshead, died of lipoid pneumonia in 2010, a rare condition in which fat particles get into the lungs. His inquest recorded an open verdict, but his widow, Glynis Miller, has always suspected her husband\u2019s e-cigarettes. \u201cWho says they are safe?\u201d she asked in an interview in September. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which regulates vaping products in the UK, has recorded 74 reports of health problems over the past five years. The agency said this did not prove a link to vaping; only that those reporting their conditions suspected it as a cause. In 2016, Gareth Walters, a respiratory consultant in Birmingham, treated a 34-year-old woman with lipoid pneumonia. She had used e-cigarettes for two years. \u201cOn the balance of probability, vaping was the only likely cause,\u201d Walters says. When he wrote to the manufacturer, an obscure company, the name of which he can\u2019t now remember, it did not respond to his request for a list of ingredients. Last week, Ewan Fisher, a 19-year-old former smoker, urged people not to vape three years after he suffered serious respiratory failure in a case his consultant also linked to e-cigarettes. More than 3.6 million Britons vape, according to survey data collected by the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). A handful of suspected health problems does not make an epidemic. But decades after the link was established between smoking and cancer, the public could be forgiven for thinking e-cigarettes are roughly as bad. \u201cI see kids using them and I think: \u2018Oh, my God. You don\u2019t know what you are taking into your body!\u2019\u201d Miller said. David O\u2019Reilly is sitting in BAT\u2019s windowless \u201cR&amp;D Live\u201d visitor centre, a slick corporate display of devices and information. He joined BAT almost 30 years ago and sits on its management board as its director of scientific research. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about what is happening in the US,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we stand behind our products, and the work we do here to make sure that what we put into them will not lead to these acute diseases.\u201d O\u2019Reilly, who is 53, is keen to point out a difference between vaping in the UK and the US. Here, MHRA regulation and EU law heavily restrict what can be sold. While several US states have now lined up to ban vaping, national regulation still barely exists. Vaping devices are being used to consume cannabis. Many of the US deaths have been linked to THC and to high levels of vitamin E acetate, an oily additive. Many suspect cartridges had been sold illicitly on a hidden market for bootleg blends that has flourished in the absence of regulation. BAT has a big interest in protecting the reputation of its \u201creduced risk products\u201d. As well as vape pens, it makes \u201cheat-not-burn\u201d devices, which heat a stick of blended tobacco at much lower temperatures than cigarettes. Global revenues from the products hit almost \u00a31bn last year, a number that the company expects to rise to \u00a35bn by 2023. BAT says it makes up 39% of the UK vape market by value. By comparison, its cigarette revenues last year (its brands include Dunhill and Camel) were \u00a315.5bn, but most cigarette markets, including the UK\u2019s, are shrinking. As part of a fraught transition, BAT has announced plans to cut 2,300 of its 55,000 jobs globally by January. Yet tobacco companies are not alone in defending e-cigarettes. \u201cThe consequence of this panic [about vaping] is that people will go back to smoking and die as a result,\u201d says Martin Dockrell, the tobacco control programme lead at Public Health England. While the agency has called for more research into the long-term effects, and advises non-smokers not to vape, it still estimates that \u2013 because the constituents of cigarette smoke that harm health are either absent in e-cigarette vapour or present at much lower levels \u2013 vaping is, in the long term, 95% less harmful than smoking. Dockrell says he has already seen case reports of vapers going back to cigarettes. \u201cUK deaths from regulated e-cigarette products in the UK are nil,\u201d he adds. \u201cSmoking still kills 220 people every day.\u201d Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of Ash, says a colleague was advised by his GP to stop vaping because it was more dangerous than smoking. \u201cIt really worries me because GPs reflect what everyone else is seeing, which is this panic,\u201d she says. According to Ash\u2019s latest survey, 22% of smokers believe vaping is as dangerous or more dangerous than cigarettes, a proportion that may rise. \u201cI\u2019m with Public Health England,\u201d says Walters, the Birmingham lung doctor. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to give up smoking, then vaping is a good thing.\u201d Public health experts are not easy allies of big tobacco, even if they are both pursuing alternatives to cigarettes. The tone of the scare betrays some of this tension. Before it started, the US was already on edge about Juul, a California startup that launched sleek e-cigarettes in 2015. It promoted its flavours on Instagram and connected with young people. According to one US survey last year, one in five 12th grade students (aged 16-18) had vaped in the previous 30 days. The youth \u201caddiction crisis\u201d, as the Food and Drug Administration called it, intensified in December when Altria Group, formerly known as Philip Morris Companies (its brands include Marlboro), bought a 35% stake in Juul for $12.8bn (\u00a310bn). The billionaire philanthropist Michael Bloomberg has accused tobacco companies with vape brands of \u201cpreying on America\u2019s youth \u2026 using the same marketing tactics that once lured kids to cigarettes\u201d. The industry had taken a while to get involved in vaping. A Chinese pharmacist and smoker called Hon Lik is credited with inventing the modern device. The first e-cigarettes hit the UK market in 2008, a year after the indoor smoking ban. Smokers were ready to try something different (indoor vaping bans by businesses came later). Small companies met the demand and vaping spread quickly. Fearing a \u201cKodak moment\u201d, as Arnott puts it, the tobacco companies began to buy up the competition. Blu eCigs, which was founded in Australia in 2009, is now owned by Imperial Brands (which owns the Virginia, Drum and Rizla brands). BAT launched its first electronic device in 2012, and Vype in 2013. Altria\u2019s grip on Juul tightened in September when it replaced the company\u2019s CEO, Kevin Burns, with a previous employee, KC Crosthwaite. As tobacco companies marched into the new market, suspicions of their intentions intensified. Their earlier attempts to create less deadly products had already failed: in the 1970s, \u201csafer\u201d filtered or light cigarettes only slowed the delivery of nicotine. To compensate, smokers puffed more deeply, inhaling more tar. They also continued to smoke because it felt safer. Ash described the cigarettes as \u201ca grotesque confidence trick\u201d. Electronic cigarettes produce no tar at all, but for the tobacco control movement, big tobacco\u2019s growing involvement in vaping comes with unsettling echoes. The companies have spent millions on advertising, 16 years after cigarette adverts were banned from British billboards. Instagram is the new battleground. Ash has accused BAT of breaching guidelines by using its Vype Instagram account to target young people, pairing images of cool young vapers with unrelated trending hashtags including the names of celebrities. The Advertising Standards Authority is investigating. \u201cWe have marketing principles that stipulate responsible use of social media and any complaints we take very seriously,\u201d O\u2019Reilly says. Juul shut down its Instagram account last November. Arnott is also concerned about BAT\u2019s revived interest in policymaking. Last year, it emerged that BAT was working on a pilot scheme with Birmingham city council to promote its vaping products. The MP Steve Brine, then a health minister, called it \u201ca disgrace\u201d that BAT was \u201cexploiting\u201d smokers for profit, adding: \u201cWe have a duty to protect our public health services from the commercial interests of the tobacco industry.\u201d BAT defended the scheme as a success, \u201cwith many participants making a switch from cigarettes\u201d. O\u2019Reilly says BAT is committed to developing safer alternatives to cigarettes \u2013 and shouting about it. \u201cBut for a number of people in the tobacco-control movement, it was an abhorrent idea that suddenly this industry, which had been vilified and demonised, was suddenly going to be a big part of the solution,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I\u2019d say to them is: we\u2019re not running this business in the 1970s. We should be judged not on our history, but on our actions today.\u201d Yet tobacco firms have been accused very recently of using old tactics to push cigarettes in markets without profitable alternatives. In 2017, the Guardian exposed BAT for trying to use the courts to crush anti-smoking regulations in Kenya and Uganda. The company said it reserved the right to ask courts to intervene where it believed regulations may not comply with the law. \u201cWe would support all regulation that we think will have an effect on public health,\u201d O\u2019Reilly adds. Last month, the Guardian revealed that BAT faces court action in London after claims that families in Malawian tobacco fields were forced by poverty wages to use their children as unpaid labour (BAT says it had told farmers not to use child labour). If BAT is so committed to public health and the transition to healthier devices, why not stop making cigarettes? \u201cWell, it\u2019s a good question,\u201d O\u2019Reilly says. \u201cIt is still the core of our business and we need the profits from our cigarette business to fuel the innovation and commercialisation of new categories.\u201d He adds: \u201cObviously, we also have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to give them a return on their investment.\u201d O\u2019Reilly owns shares worth more than \u00a31m, according to the company\u2019s annual report. BAT now employs more than 1,500 scientists, almost all of them working on electronic devices. Sami Haikala joined BAT last year after jobs at Microsoft and Nokia. To reach his lab, I walk through a test production line for cigarettes that reeks of sweet tobacco. The lab itself is full of electron microscopes and 3D x-ray machines. A drop test chamber containing an e-cigarette turns like a tombola, the device clunking with each turn. \u201cIf it can tolerate 200 drops, then it\u2019s good,\u201d Haikala says. Back in the lab, Gaca, who is 47, recalls joining BAT 15 years ago, before e-cigarettes appeared on the horizon. \u201cWhen I talked to my peers about it, they said: \u2018Why are you going there? Nobody will talk to you \u2013 you\u2019ll be the black sheep,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThey said the industry was not in a good place; that it had a bad name. But I saw real opportunities here.\u201d She comes from a family of smokers, and says her husband used vaping to quit cigarettes. What does he think now? \u201cWe can only stand by our data,\u201d she says. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2020 because an earlier version wrongly suggested that there was legislation banning indoor vaping. The article has been clarified to refer to indoor vaping bans by individual businesses.",

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">the Care Act</a> was passed, my predecessor as president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) hailed it as the most important legislation for the care and support of adults for 60 years. David Pearson was not wrong, but today we must acknowledge that the act has yet to live up to its potential.</p> <p>The act reframed local authorities\u2019 statutory duties \u2013 moving from providing outdated services for specific groups of people to promoting health and wellbeing. But as Pearson warned, the overall level of funding for social care needs to be sustainable to meet the act\u2019s aspirations. That has not, of course, been the case and today we should be asking ourselves: how far have the ambitions of the Care Act been realised?</p> <p>Adass welcomed all the act\u2019s key pillars: its focus on information and advice to enable people to make informed choices; care and support based around individuals and focused upon wellbeing and control; advocacy for people in need to enable them to speak out; safeguards for individuals at risk of abuse or neglect; and the goal of creating vibrant care markets.</p> <p>Despite these best intentions, it is evident that the act on its own was not enough to achieve fundamental change. An integral part of the legislation, the cap on individual care costs, was delayed by government, then kicked into the long grass and not implemented. And the act came into force when year-on-year savings were being made: adult social care has delivered<a href=\"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7903/CBP-7903.pdf\"> \u00a37.7bn savings in the past decade</a> (pdf) against a backdrop of increasing need.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/02/emergency-funding-for-social-care-to-be-announced-at-tory-conference\">additional short-term funding</a> that\u2019s been made available to social care in recent years has merely served to paper over the cracks \u2013 to keep an ailing system upright. Austerity has profoundly affected care. There has been a drastic retraction in the range and capacity of services and the number of people supported by them. People with the most intense needs have been prioritised \u2013 meaning less resources available to prevent escalating needs in others.</p> <p>Local authorities are working hard to offer support within the spirit of the act. Many are having success, but not at the scale that we\u2019d ideally want to see. Major problems remain with the degree to which the act can be implemented, having a significant impact upon individuals receiving care and their families. This is despite the best efforts and dedication of people working in adult social care.</p> <p>The reality of the current system remains a distant stretch from the one imagined by the legislation. How many more people with a range of support needs could have been supported to live safely and well at home if those \u00a37.7bn savings had not been made? With a properly funded system, the act could be the already-in-place legislation and the answer that many seeking change have been asking for.</p> <p>To fully support the transformation of lives that the act intended, we need long-term funding and reform to build care and support for the millions of us who need it. We need a system linked with other public services that supports individuals, families and communities. Only by giving social care a solid platform to work from can we truly support people in the way envisaged in 2014.</p> <p><em>Julie Ogley is director of social care, health and housing at Central Bedfordshire council and president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When the Care Act was passed, my predecessor as president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) hailed it as the most important legislation for the care and support of adults for 60 years. David Pearson was not wrong, but today we must acknowledge that the act has yet to live up to its potential. The act reframed local authorities\u2019 statutory duties \u2013 moving from providing outdated services for specific groups of people to promoting health and wellbeing. But as Pearson warned, the overall level of funding for social care needs to be sustainable to meet the act\u2019s aspirations. That has not, of course, been the case and today we should be asking ourselves: how far have the ambitions of the Care Act been realised? Adass welcomed all the act\u2019s key pillars: its focus on information and advice to enable people to make informed choices; care and support based around individuals and focused upon wellbeing and control; advocacy for people in need to enable them to speak out; safeguards for individuals at risk of abuse or neglect; and the goal of creating vibrant care markets. Despite these best intentions, it is evident that the act on its own was not enough to achieve fundamental change. An integral part of the legislation, the cap on individual care costs, was delayed by government, then kicked into the long grass and not implemented. And the act came into force when year-on-year savings were being made: adult social care has delivered \u00a37.7bn savings in the past decade (pdf) against a backdrop of increasing need. The additional short-term funding that\u2019s been made available to social care in recent years has merely served to paper over the cracks \u2013 to keep an ailing system upright. Austerity has profoundly affected care. There has been a drastic retraction in the range and capacity of services and the number of people supported by them. People with the most intense needs have been prioritised \u2013 meaning less resources available to prevent escalating needs in others. Local authorities are working hard to offer support within the spirit of the act. Many are having success, but not at the scale that we\u2019d ideally want to see. Major problems remain with the degree to which the act can be implemented, having a significant impact upon individuals receiving care and their families. This is despite the best efforts and dedication of people working in adult social care. The reality of the current system remains a distant stretch from the one imagined by the legislation. How many more people with a range of support needs could have been supported to live safely and well at home if those \u00a37.7bn savings had not been made? With a properly funded system, the act could be the already-in-place legislation and the answer that many seeking change have been asking for. To fully support the transformation of lives that the act intended, we need long-term funding and reform to build care and support for the millions of us who need it. We need a system linked with other public services that supports individuals, families and communities. Only by giving social care a solid platform to work from can we truly support people in the way envisaged in 2014. Julie Ogley is director of social care, health and housing at Central Bedfordshire council and president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services",

      "bodyText": "The battle between Republicans and Democrats in the state of Georgia is still raging over a year after the historic midterm elections. The Republican-led state ethics commission filed a lawsuit against rising star and former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams\u2019s 2018 campaign insisting it had not received all relevant communications, in addition to bank records requested in April. Abrams\u2019s former campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, now the CEO of Abrams\u2019s national campaign against voter suppression, Fair Fight Action, called the demand for the documents \u201cbogus\u201d and part of a \u201cpolitically motivated investigation\u201d, in a series of tweets. Thousands of pages of the campaign\u2019s financial documents were handed over earlier this year, she added.

      "body": "<h2>1) Wales\u2019 new generation reward Giggs</h2> <p>With the reality of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/19/wales-hungary-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report\">reaching a third tournament finals</a> still sinking in as elated Wales supporters furrowed out of the turnstiles in Cardiff, five precious words will have stirred further excitement. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Ryan Giggs said. And he has a point. Giggs put the onus on young players in his first qualifying campaign in charge of his country and how the new generation rewarded him, with Daniel James, David Brooks, Harry Wilson, Ethan Ampadu and Joe Morrell \u2013 all of whom are 22 or under \u2013 complementing headline acts such as Gareth Bale and, after returning to fitness, Aaron Ramsey. Next summer Giggs will hope to call on Brooks and Joe Rodon, the latest Swansea academy graduate to make an impression in a Wales shirt, with both absent on Tuesday. Others, too, could stake a claim, including Leeds\u2019 Tyler Roberts, Manchester United\u2019s Dylan Levitt and the 19-year-old Schalke winger Rabbi Matondo. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/20/which-footballers-have-scored-a-hat-trick-of-free-kicks\">Which footballers have scored a hat-trick of free-kicks? | The Knowledge</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2) England strolls cannot mask midfield dilemmas</h2> <p>England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/17/england-euro-2020-gareth-southgate-confidence-kosovo-victory\">emerged creditably from a trying week</a> but there are still questions in key areas. Places in the midfield, which will surely be the decisive battleground against better opponents than Montenegro and Kosovo next summer, look particularly up for grabs and an ideal balance remains elusive. Declan Rice occupied the holding role in Pristina but did not impress against a nimble, technical home side and at times he looks like what, essentially, he is: a converted centre-back. Harry Winks adds extra passing range in that position, as he showed against Montenegro, but his defensive attributes need work and there is a sense England remain short of a top-quality operator to act as the team\u2019s pivot. Jordan Henderson will surely occupy one of the other two spots but after that the picture muddies again. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain looked visibly frustrated upon coming off after a patchy display in Pristina while Mason Mount, Ross Barkley and James Maddison all have their pros and cons. It does not help, either, that Dele Alli seems far from the picture right now and Gareth Southgate may end up chewing over his best combination right up until Euro 2020. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> <h2>3) Finland need others to step up besides Pukki</h2> <p>You would have said it was inevitable were it not for the fact they had never done it before, but Finland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/15/finland-liechtenstein-teemu-pukki-norway-faroe-islands-euro-2020\">secured qualification</a> to a major international tournament by beating Liechtenstein 3-0 last weekend. With their talismanic striker, Teemu Pukki, scoring twice, a national Pukki party followed but so did defeat in Greece on Monday night and the realisation that the Suomi will be seeded fourth, not third, in the European Championship draw. Iceland were similarly placed last time following their qualifying miracle, and went on to beat everyone\u2019s expectations (and England to boot). Perhaps Finland will be able to do the same, but they will need to expand their leading men beyond Pukki if that is to happen. Well-placed to step up is Glen Kamara. The 24-year-old has been impressive at the base of midfield, just as he has been for Rangers this season, and looks comfortable controlling games at this level. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae88c3f5f441a3256ba570ebda82eb2ec46c346c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae88c3f5f441a3256ba570ebda82eb2ec46c346c/0_198_2976_1786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glen Kamara, right, has been impressive in midfield for Finland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glen Kamara, right, has been impressive in midfield for Finland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kalle Parkkinen/Sipa/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Cazorla is simply astonishing</h2> <p>Maybe it\u2019s time to take away the \u201cconsidering\u201d when discussing Santi Cazorla. It\u2019s amazing how well he plays considering he\u2019s 34. It\u2019s astonishing what he does, considering the horrific injury that might have ended his career. No. It\u2019s amazing, full stop. Consider nothing, except the football. And against Romania, Cazorla \u2014 who scored his first Spain goal in 1,463 days in the previous match \u2014 was again the best player on the pitch, handed a standing ovation when he was withdrawn. Lining up on the left of a front three, a different role to the one he had played three days earlier, he seemed to be involved in everything that was good about Spain, his vision unmatched. One turn and shot off the bar was particularly gorgeous. Cazorla got his first international call-up in more than three years in May and although he missed out in September he is there again now \u2014 and on merit, in the starting XI. He has arguably been La Liga\u2019s best player this season and although there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/19/luis-enrique-spain-fiesta-crisis-robert-moreno\">uncertainty with the change of manager</a>, on this form Cazorla should be in the team next summer. He\u2019s not good considering the injury and the age, he\u2019s just good. Very, very good. More so than anyone else. <strong>Sid Lowe</strong></p> <h2>5) Doherty should start for Republic in play-offs</h2> <p>Matt Doherty\u2019s lapse of concentration allowed Denmark to nick the goal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/18/republic-of-ireland-denmark-euro-2020-qualifying-match\">ultimately sent them through</a> to Euro 2020 at the Republic of Ireland\u2019s expense. But everything else Doherty did during that match was excellent, including his equalising goal. His performance showed that, fitness permitting, he should start in the play-off in March even if S\u00e9amus Coleman is available. Mick McCarthy should also consider redeploying the 3-5-2 that he experimented with against Switzerland, with Doherty and Enda Stevens in the wing-back roles and Aaron Connelly or Troy Parrott alongside David McGoldrick up front. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd417de52bc4d280fa0c77de85da29100ae2e7f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd417de52bc4d280fa0c77de85da29100ae2e7f2/0_0_4452_2981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Doherty heads home a late equaliser for Republic of Ireland against Denmark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Doherty heads home a late equaliser for Republic of Ireland against Denmark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben McShane/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) Will O\u2019Neill manage Northern Ireland in play-offs?</h2> <p>Whether or not Michael O\u2019Neill can maintain his position as Northern Ireland\u2019s manager for the play-off in March is surely linked to success or otherwise at Stoke. This doesn\u2019t feel anywhere near as cut and dried a scenario as portrayed. O\u2019Neill bridled when asked in the immediate aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/16/northern-ireland-netherlands-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report\">their draw with the Netherlands</a> whether it is practical for the manager of a Championship club to simultaneously prepare an international side. In O\u2019Neill\u2019s mind the Northern Irish squad \u2013 and team \u2013 virtually picks itself, it would be unfair to those players to introduce a new manager before key games and the March window is an international break for clubs anyway. O\u2019Neill has no plans to scout individuals for international duty in the coming months. Apart from anything else, this raises questions as to what international managers are paid for over the winter break. If Stoke find themselves still immersed in a relegation scrap by the play-off juncture, it will be unpalatable to their support for O\u2019Neill to return \u2013 even briefly \u2013 to Northern Ireland matters. The Irish Football Association, you have to assume, has a succession plan in mind. Or does it want O\u2019Neill to linger for Euro 2020 in the event of qualification? If O\u2019Neill oversees a sharp upturn in Stoke\u2019s fortunes, he will afford himself considerably more leeway. But contrary to what he may want, he hasn\u2019t heard the last of questions relating to this unusual scenario yet. <strong>Ewan Murray</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7) Zaniolo emblematic of Mancini\u2019s vibrant new Italy</h2> <p>\u201cWe are entering a new era,\u201d Roberto Mancini said after Italy\u2019s two recent wins (3-0 against Bosnia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/18/euro-2020-roundup-italy-crush-armenia-spain-win\">9-1 against Armenia</a>) and he is the main reason for that. Eighteen months ago, when Mancini took over, Italy were in a terrible place, having missed out on a place in the World Cup. Now they have 11 wins in a row, and are producing some impressive performances with the manager\u2019s 4-3-3. Leonardo Bonucci is leader of the defence now that Giorgio Chiellini is injured and in midfield Jorginho is playing in a \u201cregista\u201d role with the youngsters Sandro Tonali and Nicol\u00f2 Barella alongside him. The biggest change, though, has been the amount of goals Italy have been scoring. Ciro Immobile and Andrea Belotti are both in good form but the biggest surprise has been the consistency of Roma\u2019s Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo. He is only 20 years old but he could be one of the breakthrough players at next summer\u2019s tournament. <strong>Fabrizio Romano</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cafbf79452929499f32b2da137d3d8d832238a65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cafbf79452929499f32b2da137d3d8d832238a65/0_0_2997_1974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italy\u2019s 20-year-old attacking midfielder Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo celebrates after scoring against Armenia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carmelo Imbesi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8) Will the real Croatia please stand up</h2> <p>Croatia ultimately steered their qualifying campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/16/euro-2020-roundup-croatia-germany-austria-seal-qualification\">into the Euro harbour </a>on Saturday, but not without some stress and anxiety first. Needing only a point at home to secure qualification, they went in at 0-1 at half-time in Rijeka to a clearly inferior Slovakia side who they had thrashed 4-0 away only two months earlier. But then Nikola Vlasic and Bruno Petkovic, both of whom have been revelations this year for the manager, Zlatko Dalic, scored two in four minutes, with Ivan Perisic later adding a third. The match very much summarised Croatia of late: they can be brilliant and dreary, sometimes switching between their ruthless and toothless faces within the same game. \u201cUnstable\u201d is probably the best word to describe them, but when they get going they look good for the very top again. The not-so-dark horse for the Euros. <strong>Aleksandar Holiga</strong></p> <h2>9) Soyuncu not the only swashbuckling Turkey defender</h2> <p>Turkey have not looked this strong since Senol Gunes guided them to a third-placed finish at the 2002 World Cup. Gunes is back at the helm but there is something radically different about this side; they have learned how to defend. The Crescent-Stars conceded only three goals in 10 qualifiers, keeping eight clean sheets in a group that featured Iceland and France. Leicester\u2019s Caglar Soyuncu has been the rock at the back while the Lille right-back Mehmet Zeki Celik and Le Havre left-back Umut Meras have been revelations. Furthermore, with players such as the Juventus centre-back Merih Demiral, Schalke\u2019s 19-year-old Ozan Kabak and the 22-year-old Roma defender Mert Cetin there is a lot of depth at the back. Defensive aficionados are going to love watching the swashbuckling adventures of this defence. Meanwhile, the midfield is industrious and there is quality in attack with Roma\u2019s Cengiz Under in the mix. This is starting to look more and more like a golden generation for Turkey who have the potential to be dark horses next summer. <strong>Emre Sarigul</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"116299611c503424e5c0a6d4968512f21febeeae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/116299611c503424e5c0a6d4968512f21febeeae/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turkey\u2019s Merih Demiral, centre, celebrates with teammates after Turkey secured qualification for the Euro 2020 finals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkey\u2019s Merih Demiral, centre, celebrates with teammates after Turkey secured qualification for the Euro 2020 finals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Bozo\u011flu/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10) Bulgaria try to repair reputation</h2> <p>One month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/14/bulgaria-england-euro-2020-qualifying-match-report\">the disastrous 6-0 defeat against England</a>, which was marred by racist chanting, Bulgaria tried to clear up their reputation both on and off the pitch. Before last Thursday\u2019s home friendly against Paraguay the Bulgarian FA launched a campaign called The Scarf of Respect, with all proceeds to be donated to various projects tackling discrimination in football. Three days later Bulgaria managed their first win in over a year, beating the Czech Republic 1-0 in their final Euro 2020 qualifier and their first game under Georgi Dermendzhiev, who has replaced Krasimir Balakov. The game was played behind closed doors \u2013 apart from around 300 children in the stands \u2013 following Uefa\u2019s ban after the racist incidents during the England match. Bulgaria are now awaiting the play-off draw but will be without their captain, Ivelin Popov, who surprisingly called time on his international career on Sunday. <strong>Metodi Shumanov</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2020-qualifiers/table\">\u2022 Euro 2020 qualifying: view the final group standings</a></p>",

Next summer Giggs will hope to call on Brooks and Joe Rodon, the latest Swansea academy graduate to make an impression in a Wales shirt, with both absent on Tuesday. Others, too, could stake a claim, including Leeds\u2019 Tyler Roberts, Manchester United\u2019s Dylan Levitt and the 19-year-old Schalke winger Rabbi Matondo. Ben Fisher 2) England strolls cannot mask midfield dilemmas England emerged creditably from a trying week but there are still questions in key areas. Places in the midfield, which will surely be the decisive battleground against better opponents than Montenegro and Kosovo next summer, look particularly up for grabs and an ideal balance remains elusive. Declan Rice occupied the holding role in Pristina but did not impress against a nimble, technical home side and at times he looks like what, essentially, he is: a converted centre-back. Harry Winks adds extra passing range in that position, as he showed against Montenegro, but his defensive attributes need work and there is a sense England remain short of a top-quality operator to act as the team\u2019s pivot. Jordan Henderson will surely occupy one of the other two spots but after that the picture muddies again. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain looked visibly frustrated upon coming off after a patchy display in Pristina while Mason Mount, Ross Barkley and James Maddison all have their pros and cons. It does not help, either, that Dele Alli seems far from the picture right now and Gareth Southgate may end up chewing over his best combination right up until Euro 2020. Nick Ames 3) Finland need others to step up besides Pukki You would have said it was inevitable were it not for the fact they had never done it before, but Finland secured qualification to a major international tournament by beating Liechtenstein 3-0 last weekend. With their talismanic striker, Teemu Pukki, scoring twice, a national Pukki party followed but so did defeat in Greece on Monday night and the realisation that the Suomi will be seeded fourth, not third, in the European Championship draw. Iceland were similarly placed last time following their qualifying miracle, and went on to beat everyone\u2019s expectations (and England to boot). Perhaps Finland will be able to do the same, but they will need to expand their leading men beyond Pukki if that is to happen. Well-placed to step up is Glen Kamara. The 24-year-old has been impressive at the base of midfield, just as he has been for Rangers this season, and looks comfortable controlling games at this level. Paul MacInnes 4) Cazorla is simply astonishing Maybe it\u2019s time to take away the \u201cconsidering\u201d when discussing Santi Cazorla. It\u2019s amazing how well he plays considering he\u2019s 34. It\u2019s astonishing what he does, considering the horrific injury that might have ended his career. No. It\u2019s amazing, full stop. Consider nothing, except the football. And against Romania, Cazorla \u2014 who scored his first Spain goal in 1,463 days in the previous match \u2014 was again the best player on the pitch, handed a standing ovation when he was withdrawn. Lining up on the left of a front three, a different role to the one he had played three days earlier, he seemed to be involved in everything that was good about Spain, his vision unmatched. One turn and shot off the bar was particularly gorgeous. Cazorla got his first international call-up in more than three years in May and although he missed out in September he is there again now \u2014 and on merit, in the starting XI. He has arguably been La Liga\u2019s best player this season and although there is uncertainty with the change of manager, on this form Cazorla should be in the team next summer. He\u2019s not good considering the injury and the age, he\u2019s just good. Very, very good. More so than anyone else. Sid Lowe 5) Doherty should start for Republic in play-offs Matt Doherty\u2019s lapse of concentration allowed Denmark to nick the goal that ultimately sent them through to Euro 2020 at the Republic of Ireland\u2019s expense. But everything else Doherty did during that match was excellent, including his equalising goal. His performance showed that, fitness permitting, he should start in the play-off in March even if S\u00e9amus Coleman is available. Mick McCarthy should also consider redeploying the 3-5-2 that he experimented with against Switzerland, with Doherty and Enda Stevens in the wing-back roles and Aaron Connelly or Troy Parrott alongside David McGoldrick up front. Paul Doyle 6) Will O\u2019Neill manage Northern Ireland in play-offs? Whether or not Michael O\u2019Neill can maintain his position as Northern Ireland\u2019s manager for the play-off in March is surely linked to success or otherwise at Stoke. This doesn\u2019t feel anywhere near as cut and dried a scenario as portrayed. O\u2019Neill bridled when asked in the immediate aftermath of their draw with the Netherlands whether it is practical for the manager of a Championship club to simultaneously prepare an international side. In O\u2019Neill\u2019s mind the Northern Irish squad \u2013 and team \u2013 virtually picks itself, it would be unfair to those players to introduce a new manager before key games and the March window is an international break for clubs anyway. O\u2019Neill has no plans to scout individuals for international duty in the coming months. Apart from anything else, this raises questions as to what international managers are paid for over the winter break. If Stoke find themselves still immersed in a relegation scrap by the play-off juncture, it will be unpalatable to their support for O\u2019Neill to return \u2013 even briefly \u2013 to Northern Ireland matters. The Irish Football Association, you have to assume, has a succession plan in mind. Or does it want O\u2019Neill to linger for Euro 2020 in the event of qualification? If O\u2019Neill oversees a sharp upturn in Stoke\u2019s fortunes, he will afford himself considerably more leeway. But contrary to what he may want, he hasn\u2019t heard the last of questions relating to this unusual scenario yet. Ewan Murray 7) Zaniolo emblematic of Mancini\u2019s vibrant new Italy \u201cWe are entering a new era,\u201d Roberto Mancini said after Italy\u2019s two recent wins (3-0 against Bosnia and 9-1 against Armenia) and he is the main reason for that. Eighteen months ago, when Mancini took over, Italy were in a terrible place, having missed out on a place in the World Cup. Now they have 11 wins in a row, and are producing some impressive performances with the manager\u2019s 4-3-3. Leonardo Bonucci is leader of the defence now that Giorgio Chiellini is injured and in midfield Jorginho is playing in a \u201cregista\u201d role with the youngsters Sandro Tonali and Nicol\u00f2 Barella alongside him. The biggest change, though, has been the amount of goals Italy have been scoring. Ciro Immobile and Andrea Belotti are both in good form but the biggest surprise has been the consistency of Roma\u2019s Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo. He is only 20 years old but he could be one of the breakthrough players at next summer\u2019s tournament. Fabrizio Romano 8) Will the real Croatia please stand up Croatia ultimately steered their qualifying campaign into the Euro harbour on Saturday, but not without some stress and anxiety first. Needing only a point at home to secure qualification, they went in at 0-1 at half-time in Rijeka to a clearly inferior Slovakia side who they had thrashed 4-0 away only two months earlier. But then Nikola Vlasic and Bruno Petkovic, both of whom have been revelations this year for the manager, Zlatko Dalic, scored two in four minutes, with Ivan Perisic later adding a third. The match very much summarised Croatia of late: they can be brilliant and dreary, sometimes switching between their ruthless and toothless faces within the same game. \u201cUnstable\u201d is probably the best word to describe them, but when they get going they look good for the very top again. The not-so-dark horse for the Euros. Aleksandar Holiga 9) Soyuncu not the only swashbuckling Turkey defender Turkey have not looked this strong since Senol Gunes guided them to a third-placed finish at the 2002 World Cup. Gunes is back at the helm but there is something radically different about this side; they have learned how to defend. The Crescent-Stars conceded only three goals in 10 qualifiers, keeping eight clean sheets in a group that featured Iceland and France. Leicester\u2019s Caglar Soyuncu has been the rock at the back while the Lille right-back Mehmet Zeki Celik and Le Havre left-back Umut Meras have been revelations. Furthermore, with players such as the Juventus centre-back Merih Demiral, Schalke\u2019s 19-year-old Ozan Kabak and the 22-year-old Roma defender Mert Cetin there is a lot of depth at the back. Defensive aficionados are going to love watching the swashbuckling adventures of this defence. Meanwhile, the midfield is industrious and there is quality in attack with Roma\u2019s Cengiz Under in the mix. This is starting to look more and more like a golden generation for Turkey who have the potential to be dark horses next summer. Emre Sarigul 10) Bulgaria try to repair reputation One month after the disastrous 6-0 defeat against England, which was marred by racist chanting, Bulgaria tried to clear up their reputation both on and off the pitch. Before last Thursday\u2019s home friendly against Paraguay the Bulgarian FA launched a campaign called The Scarf of Respect, with all proceeds to be donated to various projects tackling discrimination in football. Three days later Bulgaria managed their first win in over a year, beating the Czech Republic 1-0 in their final Euro 2020 qualifier and their first game under Georgi Dermendzhiev, who has replaced Krasimir Balakov. The game was played behind closed doors \u2013 apart from around 300 children in the stands \u2013 following Uefa\u2019s ban after the racist incidents during the England match. Bulgaria are now awaiting the play-off draw but will be without their captain, Ivelin Popov, who surprisingly called time on his international career on Sunday.

Although the sector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/jun/14/innovation-tech-social-care-services%0D\" title=\"\">has been seen as slow to pick up on the potential</a>, more and more providers are experimenting with ways to supplement hands-on care.</p> <p>Pete Dowds, chief executive of Elder, a group which runs care homes and assisted living schemes, says technology-driven solutions must be the way forward. \u201cThere will be a million people living with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/28/dementia-care-failings-cost-businesses-in-england-32bn\">dementia</a> by 2025. It\u2019s clear that digital technology and the use of AI in care homes can play a much greater role.\u201d</p> <p>In one such innovation, an app and platform called <a href=\"https://remelife.com/\" title=\"\">RemindMe</a> is being trialled in a number of care homes as a way of engaging people with dementia. Co-creator Simon Hooper came up with the idea in response to issues in his own family.</p> <p>\u201cA few years ago, my mother developed the early signs of dementia and I soon realised that she needed some support to enhance and maintain her quality of life,\u201d Hooper says. \u201cAn IT colleague and myself devised the concept, which is very easy to use and only requires wifi, a tablet and a TV.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/28/dementia-how-we-car-for-people-living-with-it-sarah-boseley\">\u2018Eventually I knew she was no longer safe alone\u2019: how do we care for family with dementia?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe tablet format of the app gives users a range of options, including setting an alert for their medication. The format also suggests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/09/music-connects-people-dementia-campaign\">music</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/26/arts-care-homes-healthy\">activities</a> that the person could engage in with their carer or family member, and offers suggestions for activities at different times of the day to encourage people to stay alert.\u201d</p> <p>One of the homes trialling the app is Sherwood Grange care home in Kingston, south London, run by Care UK. Kimberley Atkin, the home\u2019s lifestyle lead, says the trial has been positive and has shown benefits for carers as well as for residents.</p> <p>\u201cWe have used \u2018life story\u2019 picture books for some years, but the advantage of RemindMe is that new pictures can be added all the time. As the family have access to it remotely, their children in Australia, for example, can add new pictures every week, or a message, and this helps to stimulate the resident and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/15/care-home-1950s-diner-residents\">sparks conversation</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition, it helps staff to have a focus of attention for interacting with the resident and encourage their participation in activities.\u201d</p> <p>Another app called PainChek is being used in pain assessments of people with dementia. Developed in Switzerland, the device allows care staff to assess whether the person is in pain and would benefit from pain-relief medication. Such symptoms are often missed or misdiagnosed, resulting in administration of inappropriate antipsychotic drugs. The app, on a smartphone, takes a 10-second video clip of the person\u2019s face and analyses it to check against a criteria used in registering pain (the Abbey pain scale), augmented by replies from the care worker to question prompts on the app.</p> <p>Jonathan Papworth, co-founder of Person Centred Software, which is marketing the app in the UK, says it has been used successfully in care homes in Australia where it has significantly reduced use of dementia medication.</p> <p>\u201cFor people who are unable to communicate their level of pain, the result can be that they display \u2018bad behaviour\u2019 and get angry,\u201d says Papworth. \u201cBehavioural drugs are commonly used in residential care to address challenging behaviour. But without the ability to understand if a person is in pain, the individual may be wrongly diagnosed.\u201d</p> <p>Papworth says that as much as 30% of behaviour deemed \u201cchallenging\u201d in people with dementia could be attributed to untreated pain.</p> <p>Daniel Throssell, compliance manager for Graham Care, which runs seven care homes in south-east England and has been trialling the app in one, says that the home\u2019s nurses use the app when carrying out a pain assessment. \u201cThey like it as it helps them in their clinical decision-making. The other advantage is that it helps build up a picture of the person\u2019s behaviour, and their experience of pain.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/04/diagnosed-dementia-thought-end-world-its-not\">When I was diagnosed with dementia I thought it was the end of the world.

      "bodyText": "As councils struggle to meet soaring demand for adult social care, digital technology and artificial intelligence (AI) look set to play a growing role. Although the sector has been seen as slow to pick up on the potential, more and more providers are experimenting with ways to supplement hands-on care. Pete Dowds, chief executive of Elder, a group which runs care homes and assisted living schemes, says technology-driven solutions must be the way forward. \u201cThere will be a million people living with dementia by 2025. It\u2019s clear that digital technology and the use of AI in care homes can play a much greater role.\u201d In one such innovation, an app and platform called RemindMe is being trialled in a number of care homes as a way of engaging people with dementia. Co-creator Simon Hooper came up with the idea in response to issues in his own family. \u201cA few years ago, my mother developed the early signs of dementia and I soon realised that she needed some support to enhance and maintain her quality of life,\u201d Hooper says. \u201cAn IT colleague and myself devised the concept, which is very easy to use and only requires wifi, a tablet and a TV. \u201cThe tablet format of the app gives users a range of options, including setting an alert for their medication. The format also suggests music or activities that the person could engage in with their carer or family member, and offers suggestions for activities at different times of the day to encourage people to stay alert.\u201d One of the homes trialling the app is Sherwood Grange care home in Kingston, south London, run by Care UK. Kimberley Atkin, the home\u2019s lifestyle lead, says the trial has been positive and has shown benefits for carers as well as for residents. \u201cWe have used \u2018life story\u2019 picture books for some years, but the advantage of RemindMe is that new pictures can be added all the time. As the family have access to it remotely, their children in Australia, for example, can add new pictures every week, or a message, and this helps to stimulate the resident and sparks conversation. \u201cIn addition, it helps staff to have a focus of attention for interacting with the resident and encourage their participation in activities.\u201d Another app called PainChek is being used in pain assessments of people with dementia. Developed in Switzerland, the device allows care staff to assess whether the person is in pain and would benefit from pain-relief medication. Such symptoms are often missed or misdiagnosed, resulting in administration of inappropriate antipsychotic drugs. The app, on a smartphone, takes a 10-second video clip of the person\u2019s face and analyses it to check against a criteria used in registering pain (the Abbey pain scale), augmented by replies from the care worker to question prompts on the app. Jonathan Papworth, co-founder of Person Centred Software, which is marketing the app in the UK, says it has been used successfully in care homes in Australia where it has significantly reduced use of dementia medication. \u201cFor people who are unable to communicate their level of pain, the result can be that they display \u2018bad behaviour\u2019 and get angry,\u201d says Papworth. \u201cBehavioural drugs are commonly used in residential care to address challenging behaviour. But without the ability to understand if a person is in pain, the individual may be wrongly diagnosed.\u201d Papworth says that as much as 30% of behaviour deemed \u201cchallenging\u201d in people with dementia could be attributed to untreated pain. Daniel Throssell, compliance manager for Graham Care, which runs seven care homes in south-east England and has been trialling the app in one, says that the home\u2019s nurses use the app when carrying out a pain assessment. \u201cThey like it as it helps them in their clinical decision-making. The other advantage is that it helps build up a picture of the person\u2019s behaviour, and their experience of pain.\u201d Another care home group, WCS Care, has devised an innovation hub which assesses technology for social care as it emerges. It receives visits from other care providers, academics and politicians interested in its applications. Christine Asbury, WCS chief executive, says the group has adopted an \u201cacoustic listening\u201d system at night for residents \u2013 with their and their families\u2019 consent \u2013 which alerts care workers to any unusual noise or activity. \u201cAs we have a limited number of care assistants on duty at night, the system helps them to pick up any potential problems with residents getting up and moving around.\u201d WCS, which has some 600 residents in 13 care homes, has also adopted a system of electronic care records to help reduce medication errors and identify behavioural issues. \u201cOur ambition for our residents,\u201d Asbury adds, \u201cis to be able to say: \u2018That is a day well-lived.\u2019\u201d Read more features on social care trends in the 2019 supplement",

North East Derbyshire is a patchwork of ex-mining villages, the sort of place that by tradition is as red as a rose. In 2017, at the height of the \u201cCorbyn surge\u201d, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/29/derbyshire-north-east-jeremy-corbyn-wasnt-an-asset\" title=\"\">voted in a Tory MP for the first time </a>since the 1930s. As I watched the Labour candidate Chris Peace talk to voters, the most common reaction I saw was weariness: oh, this again. A kind of numbness to both men, who they see as \u201cweak\u201d (Corbyn) or \u201ca fool\u201d (Johnson). And I understood Peace\u2019s biggest fear, which is not that voters will actively switch from red to blue \u2013 but that they stay home in the middle of winter and let the Tories back in.</p> <p>That is what Corbyn is up against. It\u2019s not good enough for his supporters to point to their underdog status and claim a score draw is truly, actually, plausible. It isn\u2019t. Getting people to be slightly less hostile to you isn\u2019t the same as them being your friend. Voters need a reason to trudge out in the dark and cold to a polling booth. Among Labour\u2019s biggest prompts surely is that the other guy is a serial liar who heads a cabinet of chancers and a party that has failed this country for a decade.

The first half on Brexit went predictably badly, with Labour continuing to pay the price for three years of playing the biggest strategic decision now facing Britain as if it were merely about tactics. The party\u2019s position is not as terrible as the mockers make out; what\u2019s costing them dear is the \u2013 to coin a phrase \u2013 the dither and delay it has taken to adopt it. Corbyn trotting out his line on Brexit again and getting laughed at by a studio audience on national television must hurt. A nervous-looking Johnson got his own share of jeering laughter, which is part of what\u2019s reflected in those snap polls that show the debate as a score draw. Like the rest of the country, the audience can see a profligate liar when he\u2019s tousling his hair in front of them. And as we saw in 2017, when Corbyn is allowed to talk straight to the public, without the relentless distortion of the media, they tend to like him. For my money, the true winners of the debate were members of the audience \u2013 for making clear their contempt for political bullshit, for worrying about Johnson\u2019s trustworthiness, for laughing at the wreck that is Prince Andrew\u2019s reputation. Sure, there were some sticky moments around climate change, with what sounded like a heckle when Corbyn said that the poorest in the poorest countries would be worst affected. But all those on Twitter getting upset about those might benefit from watching a politician go door-knocking. Last Wednesday, I did just that: visiting a seat that Labour badly need to win if they\u2019re to have a shot at forming any kind of government. North East Derbyshire is a patchwork of ex-mining villages, the sort of place that by tradition is as red as a rose. In 2017, at the height of the \u201cCorbyn surge\u201d, it voted in a Tory MP for the first time since the 1930s. As I watched the Labour candidate Chris Peace talk to voters, the most common reaction I saw was weariness: oh, this again. A kind of numbness to both men, who they see as \u201cweak\u201d (Corbyn) or \u201ca fool\u201d (Johnson). And I understood Peace\u2019s biggest fear, which is not that voters will actively switch from red to blue \u2013 but that they stay home in the middle of winter and let the Tories back in. That is what Corbyn is up against. It\u2019s not good enough for his supporters to point to their underdog status and claim a score draw is truly, actually, plausible. It isn\u2019t. Getting people to be slightly less hostile to you isn\u2019t the same as them being your friend. Voters need a reason to trudge out in the dark and cold to a polling booth. Among Labour\u2019s biggest prompts surely is that the other guy is a serial liar who heads a cabinet of chancers and a party that has failed this country for a decade. Yet Corbyn could barely bring himself to murmur any of this. He could have asked Johnson about Jennifer Arcuri, 2019\u2019s great unexploded electoral device. Corbyn could have hammered the claim that \u201cour inability to fund the NHS is because of our failure to get Brexit done\u201d, which is a prizewinning pork pie. He could have asked if Johnson\u2019s willingness to jettison austerity proved that the deaths of those who lost their benefits or their homes were in vain. Given a question about trust, he could have brought up the \u00a3350m bus, the lies about Turks queueing at the border, the fact that two of Johnson\u2019s ex-bosses sacked him. But no. Nothing. No teeth were bared, nor blood spilled. I dimly remember some guff about a kinder, gentler politics, but an election is a war. Right now, Corbyn is three weeks from what might be his last ever contest \u2013 or the one that enables him to take out Johnson, block his disastrous hard Brexit and finally reverse some of the destruction wreaked by the Tories. He and his team have a fighting chance. But to take it, they need actually to fight. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist",

You won\u2019t get any consensus from metalheads on whether it\u2019s a good or bad thing, but over the last 15 years this extreme offshoot of heavy rock has gone from being the most reviled youth subculture there has ever been to being ushered in from the cold. (Initially hated by even the most open-minded of critics, it has a history of being <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/pmrcs-filthy-15-where-are-they-now-60601/motley-crue-bastard-180863/\">targeted by politicians</a>, demonised by the religious right, and <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/judas-priests-subliminal-message-trial-rob-halford-looks-back-57552/\">dragged </a><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/judas-priests-subliminal-message-trial-rob-halford-looks-back-57552/\">through the courts</a> for spurious reasons.) The band are now more prone to play a set in a concert hall at London\u2019s Southbank Centre than appear at Monsters of Rock, and as likely to be interviewed by Artforum as Metal Hammer. This is because metal is now hip, fetishised by intellectuals \u2013 who gather under the umbrella of the International Society for Metal Music Studies \u2013 and slavered over by streetwear labels such as Vetements and Supreme. Metal has inspired visual artists Jake and Dinos Chapman and Monster Chetwynd, among others, and been strip-mined by design, film, TV and indeed music itself.</p> <p>The band have been an oblique influence in the world of industrial and avant techno; Samuel Kerridge is just one producer who has talked of his Damascene conversion after watching them play live. The hard-edged celestial psychedelia of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/16/blanck-mass-animated-violence-mild-review\">Blanck Mass</a>, which follows movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn\u2019s \u201cstart with an earthquake and build to a climax\u201d school of dynamics is clearly the work of a Sunn O))) fan.

Geoff Barrow of Portishead, another fan, has mined parallel veins in his own soundtrack work, on such scores as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/22/annihilation-review-natalie-portman-thriller-leaves-a-haunting-impression\">Annihilation</a>. Similar things can be said about the soundtrack work of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis and one-time Sunn O))) touring partner Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir, who recently composed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/07/chernobyl-review-chaos-reigns-in-confusing-nuclear-disaster-epic\">Chernobyl</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/06/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-ace-turn\">Joker</a>. In the field of Americana, Marissa Nadler\u2019s turn towards the reverberant country gothic owes a debt to one of Sunn O)))\u2019s more placid moments, The Sinking Belle (Blue Sheep). More recently, their influence can be felt in the Californian folk doom of Chelsea Wolfe, and the austere but beautiful organ music of Anna von Hausswolff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff610bb4bd920b55bd9bf4b76d633ebda1cba5f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff610bb4bd920b55bd9bf4b76d633ebda1cba5f9/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen O\u2019Malley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The axeman cometh ... Stephen O\u2019Malley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why have they been so particularly influential? Metal has, for the most part, always been modernist and avant garde \u2013 qualities that have rarely been commented on. Critical revulsion \u2013 traditionally class-based but also in some cases responding to disastrous dragon-based aesthetics and questionable gender politics \u2013 often stood hand-in-hand with metalheads\u2019 stubborn wish to be misunderstood or to antagonise metropolitan tastemakers. During the 1980s, this led to the incredible situation where even the London-based heavy-metal press often seemed to despise or ridicule now-canonical bands such as Venom, Slayer, Napalm Death, Metallica, Death, Autopsy and Carcass while they were blazing through their most important work. Try looking on eBay for issues of Kerrang! magazine from these acts\u2019 innovative phase \u2013 you\u2019re much more likely to encounter issues with Rick Springfield, <a href=\"https://www.picclickimg.com/d/l400/pict/254325992549_/KERRANG-Magazine-62-1984-Genesis-Motley-Ozzy-Poster.jpg\">Phil Collins</a>, Prince or Bon Jovi on the cover.</p> <p>And when the scene made the unbelievably progressive sonic leap forward of second-wave black metal in the early 90s, this was overshadowed, understandably, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/22/before-you-know-it-its-not-a-big-deal-to-kill-a-man-norwegian-black-metals-murderous-past\">the Norwegian scene</a>\u2019s tragic and hateful spiral into murder, suicide, racism and arson. But if the notoriety and difficulty of black metal ensured the mainstream gave it a wide berth, it also created space for it to evolve.</p> <p>Sunn O)))\u2019s 2005 album Black One is a a full house on the bingo card of \u201ctrue\u201d progressive black metal: collaborations with US black metal vocalists Malefic and Wrest, sonic and lyrical references to foundational groups such as Bathory, a cover version of Immortal\u2019s Cursed Realms of the Winterdemons and suitably grandiose technique, as when Malefic delivers his vocals from inside a coffin in the back of a hearse. But importantly, it achieved all this while essentially remaining a hip ambient drone recording.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"42372cdae2c1bad8ae0de9f207a19ffab3091211\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42372cdae2c1bad8ae0de9f207a19ffab3091211/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Attila Csihar of Sunn O))).\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attila Csihar of Sunn O))).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Jefferis/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By creating something new while paying all-important tribute to the authenticity of metal, they realised they could take huge leaps forward. In 2009, they released Monoliths &amp; Dimensions, a groundbreaking experimental metal album that owed as much to spiritual jazz, fusion and minimalist composition as it did to devil-horn throwing, bullet-belt wearing, amplifier-worshipping tradition. When the band became one of the first heavy metal groups to grace the cover of The Wire magazine, an apoplectic reader wrote in threatening to cancel his subscription if they featured any more \u201clong-haired idiots\u201d on the front. But a change that would add colour, texture and new meaning to the coming decade was now in full swing, and angry jazz fans were no less able to hold back the tide than King Canute. The world was being forced to confront the idea that heavy metal was, in fact, a valid art form.</p> <p>You can argue chicken and egg over whether Sunn O))) generated this change in perception themselves or merely rode a new wave. It is probably a mix of both. But there has to be more to it than just metal\u2019s newfound respectability, otherwise I could just as well be writing this feature about the profound cultural importance of Pissgrave or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGxvZDuGPLE\">Skullshitter</a>.</p> <p>Sunn O))) have chimed with the times in other important ways. The monk\u2019s habits and dry ice that typify their shows were initially adopted to mask O\u2019Malley and Anderson\u2019s discomfort at playing live to a sometimes antagonistic audience, but they also helped reconfigure the gigs as rituals, further amplifying the potent sense of spirituality that suffuses metal. My feeling is that the success of Sunn O))) is one of innumerable symptoms regarding the tendency of millennials and Gen Z folk to turn away from the militant atheism of Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and seek meaningful new ritual outside of organised religion. Others include the phenomenal rise in popularity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/19/new-generation-follows-pack-tarot-makes-comeback\">tarot cards</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/mar/11/star-gazing-why-millennials-are-turning-to-astrology\">rehabilitation of astrology</a> and the rise of the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/11/20/witch-population-doubles-as-millennials-cast-off-christianity/\">Tumblr witch</a>, all perhaps connected to the existential threat posed by the climate crisis.</p> <p>Certainly, alternative methods of combating life\u2019s stresses are being sought with an increasing number of people finding relief from anxiety in yoga and meditation. Sunn O))) have become a soundtrack for the former \u2013 there are now doom metal yoga classes \u2013 and are absolutely perfect for the latter, as far as I\u2019m concerned. While I don\u2019t want to tar them as hippies, Sunn O))) are, to a certain extent, fellow travellers with musicians operating in the realm of the once derided but now popular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/12/new-age-music-revival-california-new-york\">new age movement</a>, and : the band have always identified as ambient, albeit with the amusing prefix \u201cpower\u201d.</p> <p>The ultimate intention of the duo\u2019s music, and the crux of the live experience, is transcendence: a positive aim. This may not translate immediately into pure pleasure for the neophyte, as there is a lot to get used to: the pressure, the volume, the vibration. Instead, the experience creates what the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan would have called <em>jouissance</em> \u2013 this is music with a BDSM vibe, an experience that could be viewed as uncomfortable until acclimatised to. At its best, the true psychedelic experience is an analogue of psychotherapy: you are encouraged to lean in to something potentially rupturing or even disturbing, in an attempt to achieve deep personal resolution rather than simply mind-scrambling hedonism or entertainment (which, to be fair, the group can provide as well).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVOWnojv_jQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jVOWnojv_jQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVOWnojv_jQ&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Sun O))): Life Metal - full album</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This tacit acknowledgement of positivity is where Sunn O))) differ radically from other revered maverick metal acts such as Mayhem and Napalm Death when it comes to mainstream acceptance \u2013 the transgressive history of the former and the strident anarchism of the latter aren\u2019t things that one has to wrestle with in order to enjoy Sunn O))). The knowing pun on death metal in the title of <a href=\"https://sunn.bandcamp.com/album/life-metal\">Life Metal</a>, the first of two albums the group released this year, tells you all you need to know. Despite clear and longstanding links with the extreme worlds of black metal, power electronics, industrial, sludge metal and doom, Sunn O))) have created a space that now stands beyond any obvious scene signifiers. This zone of pure affect \u2013 and what they hope will be a healing experience \u2013 is welcome to all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/18/how-ed-sheeran-brought-pop-back-down-to-earth\">Grounded: how Ed Sheeran brought pop back down to earth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not just their positivity that has endeared them to an urban audience of hip new adopters. While not everyone agrees, I don\u2019t consider the band\u2019s masterful riffology to be weak or diluted, but they have also removed two of the highest and most forbidding aesthetic bars that have previously repelled listeners: the ear-baffling speed and the horrifically gruff vocals of most extreme metal.</p> <p>So, heavy metal becoming respectable was only the start of it. In an age where people crave spiritual meaning, psychological healing and escape from the hellscape of rolling news and the \u201cconstant on\u201d of social media in VR or expensive \u201cimmersive experiences\u201d, Sunn O))) offer access to a genuinely new, ego-dissolving space that \u2013 outside of smoking DMT or taking ayahuasca in a mud hut in the Amazon basin \u2013 knocks all of the others into a cocked hat. They have created a numinous, reality-altering antechamber to a different realm. And this space offers one of life\u2019s most rewarding pleasures: after a long period of hearing something that sounded forbidding or blankly uniform, there is a moment of realisation when the sound suddenly comes into sharp, crystalline focus, presenting an unexplored space of fractal depth, emotion and texture. And then, finally, you can pass into a whole new cultural world.</p>",

The hard-edged celestial psychedelia of Blanck Mass, which follows movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn\u2019s \u201cstart with an earthquake and build to a climax\u201d school of dynamics is clearly the work of a Sunn O))) fan. The links between the band and digital dub/dancehall are even clearer: Kevin Martin (The Bug/King Midas Sound) has long been a vocal supporter of the group and recently graced the cover of The Wire alongside O\u2019Malley. One of composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson\u2019s final pieces of work before his death was the drone metal-inspired soundtrack to Mandy (which was produced by Sunn O))) collaborator Randall Dunn). Geoff Barrow of Portishead, another fan, has mined parallel veins in his own soundtrack work, on such scores as Annihilation. Similar things can be said about the soundtrack work of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis and one-time Sunn O))) touring partner Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir, who recently composed for Chernobyl and Joker. In the field of Americana, Marissa Nadler\u2019s turn towards the reverberant country gothic owes a debt to one of Sunn O)))\u2019s more placid moments, The Sinking Belle (Blue Sheep). More recently, their influence can be felt in the Californian folk doom of Chelsea Wolfe, and the austere but beautiful organ music of Anna von Hausswolff. Why have they been so particularly influential? Metal has, for the most part, always been modernist and avant garde \u2013 qualities that have rarely been commented on. Critical revulsion \u2013 traditionally class-based but also in some cases responding to disastrous dragon-based aesthetics and questionable gender politics \u2013 often stood hand-in-hand with metalheads\u2019 stubborn wish to be misunderstood or to antagonise metropolitan tastemakers. During the 1980s, this led to the incredible situation where even the London-based heavy-metal press often seemed to despise or ridicule now-canonical bands such as Venom, Slayer, Napalm Death, Metallica, Death, Autopsy and Carcass while they were blazing through their most important work. Try looking on eBay for issues of Kerrang! magazine from these acts\u2019 innovative phase \u2013 you\u2019re much more likely to encounter issues with Rick Springfield, Phil Collins, Prince or Bon Jovi on the cover. And when the scene made the unbelievably progressive sonic leap forward of second-wave black metal in the early 90s, this was overshadowed, understandably, by the Norwegian scene\u2019s tragic and hateful spiral into murder, suicide, racism and arson. But if the notoriety and difficulty of black metal ensured the mainstream gave it a wide berth, it also created space for it to evolve. Sunn O)))\u2019s 2005 album Black One is a a full house on the bingo card of \u201ctrue\u201d progressive black metal: collaborations with US black metal vocalists Malefic and Wrest, sonic and lyrical references to foundational groups such as Bathory, a cover version of Immortal\u2019s Cursed Realms of the Winterdemons and suitably grandiose technique, as when Malefic delivers his vocals from inside a coffin in the back of a hearse. But importantly, it achieved all this while essentially remaining a hip ambient drone recording. By creating something new while paying all-important tribute to the authenticity of metal, they realised they could take huge leaps forward. In 2009, they released Monoliths &amp; Dimensions, a groundbreaking experimental metal album that owed as much to spiritual jazz, fusion and minimalist composition as it did to devil-horn throwing, bullet-belt wearing, amplifier-worshipping tradition. When the band became one of the first heavy metal groups to grace the cover of The Wire magazine, an apoplectic reader wrote in threatening to cancel his subscription if they featured any more \u201clong-haired idiots\u201d on the front. But a change that would add colour, texture and new meaning to the coming decade was now in full swing, and angry jazz fans were no less able to hold back the tide than King Canute. The world was being forced to confront the idea that heavy metal was, in fact, a valid art form. You can argue chicken and egg over whether Sunn O))) generated this change in perception themselves or merely rode a new wave. It is probably a mix of both. But there has to be more to it than just metal\u2019s newfound respectability, otherwise I could just as well be writing this feature about the profound cultural importance of Pissgrave or Skullshitter. Sunn O))) have chimed with the times in other important ways. The monk\u2019s habits and dry ice that typify their shows were initially adopted to mask O\u2019Malley and Anderson\u2019s discomfort at playing live to a sometimes antagonistic audience, but they also helped reconfigure the gigs as rituals, further amplifying the potent sense of spirituality that suffuses metal. My feeling is that the success of Sunn O))) is one of innumerable symptoms regarding the tendency of millennials and Gen Z folk to turn away from the militant atheism of Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and seek meaningful new ritual outside of organised religion. Others include the phenomenal rise in popularity of tarot cards, the rehabilitation of astrology and the rise of the Tumblr witch, all perhaps connected to the existential threat posed by the climate crisis. Certainly, alternative methods of combating life\u2019s stresses are being sought with an increasing number of people finding relief from anxiety in yoga and meditation. Sunn O))) have become a soundtrack for the former \u2013 there are now doom metal yoga classes \u2013 and are absolutely perfect for the latter, as far as I\u2019m concerned. While I don\u2019t want to tar them as hippies, Sunn O))) are, to a certain extent, fellow travellers with musicians operating in the realm of the once derided but now popular new age movement, and : the band have always identified as ambient, albeit with the amusing prefix \u201cpower\u201d. The ultimate intention of the duo\u2019s music, and the crux of the live experience, is transcendence: a positive aim. This may not translate immediately into pure pleasure for the neophyte, as there is a lot to get used to: the pressure, the volume, the vibration. Instead, the experience creates what the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan would have called jouissance \u2013 this is music with a BDSM vibe, an experience that could be viewed as uncomfortable until acclimatised to. At its best, the true psychedelic experience is an analogue of psychotherapy: you are encouraged to lean in to something potentially rupturing or even disturbing, in an attempt to achieve deep personal resolution rather than simply mind-scrambling hedonism or entertainment (which, to be fair, the group can provide as well). This tacit acknowledgement of positivity is where Sunn O))) differ radically from other revered maverick metal acts such as Mayhem and Napalm Death when it comes to mainstream acceptance \u2013 the transgressive history of the former and the strident anarchism of the latter aren\u2019t things that one has to wrestle with in order to enjoy Sunn O))). The knowing pun on death metal in the title of Life Metal, the first of two albums the group released this year, tells you all you need to know. Despite clear and longstanding links with the extreme worlds of black metal, power electronics, industrial, sludge metal and doom, Sunn O))) have created a space that now stands beyond any obvious scene signifiers. This zone of pure affect \u2013 and what they hope will be a healing experience \u2013 is welcome to all. It\u2019s not just their positivity that has endeared them to an urban audience of hip new adopters. While not everyone agrees, I don\u2019t consider the band\u2019s masterful riffology to be weak or diluted, but they have also removed two of the highest and most forbidding aesthetic bars that have previously repelled listeners: the ear-baffling speed and the horrifically gruff vocals of most extreme metal. So, heavy metal becoming respectable was only the start of it. In an age where people crave spiritual meaning, psychological healing and escape from the hellscape of rolling news and the \u201cconstant on\u201d of social media in VR or expensive \u201cimmersive experiences\u201d, Sunn O))) offer access to a genuinely new, ego-dissolving space that \u2013 outside of smoking DMT or taking ayahuasca in a mud hut in the Amazon basin \u2013 knocks all of the others into a cocked hat. They have created a numinous, reality-altering antechamber to a different realm. And this space offers one of life\u2019s most rewarding pleasures: after a long period of hearing something that sounded forbidding or blankly uniform, there is a moment of realisation when the sound suddenly comes into sharp, crystalline focus, presenting an unexplored space of fractal depth, emotion and texture. And then, finally, you can pass into a whole new cultural world.",

It was already turning into a reasonably interesting show. Did they have to go this big this early? Perhaps they were bored by the Manchester City one.

Chalamet, who came to prominence with his film role in Luca Guadagnino\u2019s gay romance Call Me By Your Name, will star alongside Eileen Atkins in Herzog\u2019s play, which the Old Vic artistic director, Matthew Warchus, called \u201cgorgeous\u201d. \u201cAmy Herzog is one of my favourite living writers \u2013 she writes with a deceptively powerful simplicity, full of extraordinary grace, precision and radiance,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very much looking forward to working with this exceptional cast on her gorgeous play which abounds with intimate beauty and truth.\u201d Herzog\u2019s work was nominated for a Pulitzer in 2013, and the New York Times said plays that were as \u201ctruthful and touching and fine\u201d as 4,000 Miles came along \u201conce or maybe twice a season, if we\u2019re lucky\u201d. Chalamet\u2019s debut on a London stage will be one of the starriest theatre moments of 2020. The Hollywood star, who first appeared as a child actor in Channel 4\u2019s Homeland, has also been cast as Paul Atreides in a forthcoming remake of Dune, and will appear in the sequel to Call Me By Your Name, which is called Find Me. 4,000 Miles is the story of 21-year-old Leo who goes on a cross-country cycling tour with his best friend. After weeks of no contact he arrives alone at the home of his 91-year-old grandmother, Vera, and the pair begin an unlikely co-existence together in Manhattan. The play has been staged in the UK before, in 2013 at the Ustinov in Bath. The Guardian gave it three stars, praising Herzog\u2019s \u201cunderstated play\u201d but added that it tugged \u201cat heartstrings with peculiarly American determination\u201d. Herzog\u2019s 4,000 Miles will form part of Warchus\u2019s fifth season as artistic director at the Old Vic, with other already announced productions including A Christmas Carol, Local Hero, Endgame (in a double bill with Rough for Theatre II, starring Alan Cumming and Daniel Radcliffe).",

      "body": "<p>A new integrated apprenticeship in health and social care is being developed that will equip staff with the skills to work in either sector. Trailblazer groups are seeking to create a workable model which could be in the workplace within two years.</p> <p>Helen Wilcox, chair of the adult social care trailblazer group, says: \u201cIt\u2019s early days and it\u2019s not been nailed yet, but we are starting a scoping exercise to see if anybody can come up with a formula that can work.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t see [health and social care] integration happening, then perhaps at least we can integrate the workforce so that the experience of people receiving care and support is one where they don\u2019t need to feel the joins.\u201d</p> <p>Pilot projects \u2013 mostly involving hospital trusts and care providers \u2013 have already tested different integrated apprenticeship models. One obstacle that emerged was the time needed to support an apprentice in the care sector, where services are typically delivered by small- and medium-sized enterprises often lacking their own training departments. But the main obstacle proved to be differences between the sectors in pay and employment benefits. \u201cThat\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d says Wilcox.</p> <p>A homecare provider in Gloucestershire, aVida Care, was behind a year-long pilot integrated health and social care level 2 apprenticeship that it ran with Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS foundation trust. Apprentices spent six months with aVida and another six on a medical care ward for older people.</p> <p>Jacqui Adams, registered manager and director of aVida, believes a key challenge in designing an integrated apprenticeship will be governance. \u201cThere are core skills across health and social care apprentices but also key differences,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example in domiciliary care at level 2, we allow our care workers to administer medication \u2013 but this is not permitted in hospitals, where only registered nurses can do it.\u201d</p> <p>Care Development East, formerly The Suffolk Brokerage, is a not-for-profit organisation that secures funding for social care training across the county. It also provides information, advice and guidance in health and social care training. It helped set up an integrated health and social care apprenticeship pilot in hospital, community service and residential care settings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2019/mar/05/the-nhs-apprenticeships-offering-a-new-route-to-health-and-social-care\">The NHS apprenticeships offering a new route to health and social care</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOne issue was the nature of the commitment required from the care sector,\u201d says Emma White, workforce manager at Care Development East. \u201cSome in social care feel they are the poor relation and that they would invest all this time into an integrated apprenticeship, but then lose the apprentice to health because that is where they want to work.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, the first three recruits graduated from the integrated health and care apprenticeship run by North Devon healthcare NHS trust and Devon county council. They completed a level 2 clinical healthcare support award \u2013 the qualification typically required to work in an acute hospital trust \u2013 and the care certificate, the minimum needed to work in care. They also completed other qualifications in clinical competencies. All three apprentices chose to work in the NHS.</p> <p>The trust and county council are now evaluating the programme before deciding whether it should become a permanent fixture. Gail Richards, the trust\u2019s training manager and apprentice lead, says conflicting terms and conditions were an issue, but not insurmountable. \u201cI think there are a few learning points for us, but I am sure we will continue to offer this option. It\u2019s been absolutely great for the students \u2013 it makes them a much more rounded carer.\u201d</p> <h2>Experience: \u2018The training has helped me feel so confident\u2019</h2> <p><em>An integrated apprenticeship gave Maisy Parks the chance to try three different sectors before deciding to become a healthcare assistant</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"373cd37e64937a569d25bc89c1af88fa7a429d36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/373cd37e64937a569d25bc89c1af88fa7a429d36/1477_91_2741_2741/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maisy Parks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maisy Parks</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maisy Parks completed her integrated health and social care apprenticeship in north Devon in March this year. She spent six months working on a surgical ward, six months working in a care home for adults with dementia and another six months working at a day centre for adults with learning disabilities.</p> <p>Parks, 20, says the experience meant she could dip her toe into different sectors before deciding where she wanted to start her career. \u201cI could have become a healthcare assistant in a hospital when I left college, but I thought if I didn\u2019t like it I would be stuck in a job.</p> <p>\u201cWhat appealed to me was that the integrated apprenticeship gave me the chance to work in different settings.\u201d</p> <p>She is now employed as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/06/interested-in-working-in-healthcare-an-apprenticeship-could-be-for-you\">healthcare assistant </a>on a hospital surgical ward, but knows the apprenticeship has made her a \u201cmore rounded\u201d employee. \u201cI think it\u2019s definitely helped me in my current job.

But because of my day centre placement I know how to communicate non-verbally \u2013 it doesn\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p> <p>The cross-sector training has also given Parks more career options and future-proofed her working life, she says. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely got more employment flexibility. I\u2019m young now and wanted to work in the hospital because of the variety, but when I\u2019m older I might go and work in a care home because I know what it\u2019s like and it impressed me so much.\u201d <strong>DA</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/social-care-2019\">Read more features on social care trends in the 2019 supplement</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "A new integrated apprenticeship in health and social care is being developed that will equip staff with the skills to work in either sector. Trailblazer groups are seeking to create a workable model which could be in the workplace within two years. Helen Wilcox, chair of the adult social care trailblazer group, says: \u201cIt\u2019s early days and it\u2019s not been nailed yet, but we are starting a scoping exercise to see if anybody can come up with a formula that can work. \u201cIf we can\u2019t see [health and social care] integration happening, then perhaps at least we can integrate the workforce so that the experience of people receiving care and support is one where they don\u2019t need to feel the joins.\u201d Pilot projects \u2013 mostly involving hospital trusts and care providers \u2013 have already tested different integrated apprenticeship models. One obstacle that emerged was the time needed to support an apprentice in the care sector, where services are typically delivered by small- and medium-sized enterprises often lacking their own training departments. But the main obstacle proved to be differences between the sectors in pay and employment benefits. \u201cThat\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d says Wilcox. A homecare provider in Gloucestershire, aVida Care, was behind a year-long pilot integrated health and social care level 2 apprenticeship that it ran with Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS foundation trust. Apprentices spent six months with aVida and another six on a medical care ward for older people. Jacqui Adams, registered manager and director of aVida, believes a key challenge in designing an integrated apprenticeship will be governance. \u201cThere are core skills across health and social care apprentices but also key differences,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example in domiciliary care at level 2, we allow our care workers to administer medication \u2013 but this is not permitted in hospitals, where only registered nurses can do it.\u201d Care Development East, formerly The Suffolk Brokerage, is a not-for-profit organisation that secures funding for social care training across the county. It also provides information, advice and guidance in health and social care training. It helped set up an integrated health and social care apprenticeship pilot in hospital, community service and residential care settings. \u201cOne issue was the nature of the commitment required from the care sector,\u201d says Emma White, workforce manager at Care Development East. \u201cSome in social care feel they are the poor relation and that they would invest all this time into an integrated apprenticeship, but then lose the apprentice to health because that is where they want to work.\u201d Earlier this year, the first three recruits graduated from the integrated health and care apprenticeship run by North Devon healthcare NHS trust and Devon county council. They completed a level 2 clinical healthcare support award \u2013 the qualification typically required to work in an acute hospital trust \u2013 and the care certificate, the minimum needed to work in care. They also completed other qualifications in clinical competencies. All three apprentices chose to work in the NHS. The trust and county council are now evaluating the programme before deciding whether it should become a permanent fixture. Gail Richards, the trust\u2019s training manager and apprentice lead, says conflicting terms and conditions were an issue, but not insurmountable. \u201cI think there are a few learning points for us, but I am sure we will continue to offer this option. It\u2019s been absolutely great for the students \u2013 it makes them a much more rounded carer.\u201d Experience: \u2018The training has helped me feel so confident\u2019 An integrated apprenticeship gave Maisy Parks the chance to try three different sectors before deciding to become a healthcare assistant Maisy Parks completed her integrated health and social care apprenticeship in north Devon in March this year. She spent six months working on a surgical ward, six months working in a care home for adults with dementia and another six months working at a day centre for adults with learning disabilities. Parks, 20, says the experience meant she could dip her toe into different sectors before deciding where she wanted to start her career. \u201cI could have become a healthcare assistant in a hospital when I left college, but I thought if I didn\u2019t like it I would be stuck in a job. \u201cWhat appealed to me was that the integrated apprenticeship gave me the chance to work in different settings.\u201d She is now employed as a healthcare assistant on a hospital surgical ward, but knows the apprenticeship has made her a \u201cmore rounded\u201d employee. \u201cI think it\u2019s definitely helped me in my current job. If we get a call saying a patient with a learning disability is coming on to the ward, I feel so confident in being able to look after them. \u201cBefore, if I had been told that the patient had autism and couldn\u2019t communicate verbally I wouldn\u2019t have known what to do. But because of my day centre placement I know how to communicate non-verbally \u2013 it doesn\u2019t scare me.\u201d The cross-sector training has also given Parks more career options and future-proofed her working life, she says. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely got more employment flexibility. I\u2019m young now and wanted to work in the hospital because of the variety, but when I\u2019m older I might go and work in a care home because I know what it\u2019s like and it impressed me so much.\u201d DA Read more features on social care trends in the 2019 supplement",

be tentative in how it approaches reform.</p> <p>In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/workplace-relations/report\">the Productivity Commission </a>said the range of matters permitted in enterprise agreements was an area of \u201cfierce contention\u201d between employers and employee groups.</p> <p>\u201cEmployers generally wish to reduce the range of matters over which bargaining can occur, based on the primacy they give to managerial prerogative, while employees seek a more expansive range of matters,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>It recommended that the Fair Work Act be amended to prohibit restrictions in EBAs that required businesses to engage subcontractors on the same terms as employees or limit the employment of casual and labour hire employees.</p> <p>Unions argue that such prohibitions put downward pressure on wages by allowing lower-paid labour hire and subcontractor workers to operate alongside those employed on agreements.</p> <p>The PC review also raised concerns about the functioning of the Fair Work Commission, saying the agency can sometimes give \u201ctoo much weight to procedure and too little to substance\u201d, which can lead to unnecessary compliance costs and poor outcomes.</p> <p>This has also been a key gripe of employer groups, who say minor procedural or technical errors can stymie approval of agreements by the FWC.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/industrial-relations/industrial-relations-publications/Documents/towards_more_productive_and_equitable_workplaces_an_evaluation_of_the_fair_work_legislation.pdf\">2012 McCallum review</a>, undertaken by the former Labor government, did not accept the argument that the permitted matters for negotiation in enterprise agreements \u201cshould be restricted to those permitted in the Work Choices framework.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison will also flag the government\u2019s support for greater flexibility in the length of enterprise agreements allowed for major infrastructure, resources and energy projects, saying business has made a \u201cpersuasive argument\u201d.</p> <p>The prospect of new greenfield agreements were included in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/19/wage-theft-coalition-says-tough-new-penalties-wont-apply-for-genuine-mistakes\">the first of the government\u2019s industrial relations discussion papers</a>, with the proposal also backed by Bill Shorten when Labor leader.</p> <p>\u201cWith approximately $250bn of new project capital in the investment pipeline \u2013 with the potential of more than 100,000 new jobs \u2013 it\u2019s hard to deny the scope for shared gains for companies and workers,\u201d Morrison said.</p> <p>Employer groups, particularly in the mining and energy sectors, want life-of-project agreements in place of the current four-year limit of agreements to ensure developments are not stalled by industrial disputes mid-construction.</p> <p>Morrison\u2019s wide-ranging speech on the economy also outlines a series of deregulation reforms, including better using technology to improve productivity.</p> <p>Along with the new online environmental approval process, the reforms will include establishing a new modern business registry to allow sole traders to more quickly update regulatory information, a new digital export documentation process, and new online tools to help small businesses employ new workers.</p>",

In comments that will spark union fears of a return to WorkChoices-style restrictions on the content of workplace agreements, Morrison expressed his support for removing \u201cunnecessary clutter\u201d in agreement-making and award compliance. \u201cWhile the number of awards has reduced, it appears that they have not become simpler \u2013 indeed many believe that they have become more complex,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThe degree of administrative clutter associated with the compliance regime and the enterprise bargaining process can also detract from business improvements that can arise from working together for mutual benefit.\u201d Morrison said that provisions that had added \u201cunnecessary clutter\u201d to agreement-making and award compliance had been identified in past reviews of the Fair Work Act. But he said the business community needed to \u201cmarshall the evidence\u201d and make the case for changing the system, suggesting the government will be tentative in how it approaches reform. In 2014, the Productivity Commission said the range of matters permitted in enterprise agreements was an area of \u201cfierce contention\u201d between employers and employee groups. \u201cEmployers generally wish to reduce the range of matters over which bargaining can occur, based on the primacy they give to managerial prerogative, while employees seek a more expansive range of matters,\u201d the report said. It recommended that the Fair Work Act be amended to prohibit restrictions in EBAs that required businesses to engage subcontractors on the same terms as employees or limit the employment of casual and labour hire employees. Unions argue that such prohibitions put downward pressure on wages by allowing lower-paid labour hire and subcontractor workers to operate alongside those employed on agreements. The PC review also raised concerns about the functioning of the Fair Work Commission, saying the agency can sometimes give \u201ctoo much weight to procedure and too little to substance\u201d, which can lead to unnecessary compliance costs and poor outcomes. This has also been a key gripe of employer groups, who say minor procedural or technical errors can stymie approval of agreements by the FWC. The 2012 McCallum review, undertaken by the former Labor government, did not accept the argument that the permitted matters for negotiation in enterprise agreements \u201cshould be restricted to those permitted in the Work Choices framework.\u201d Morrison will also flag the government\u2019s support for greater flexibility in the length of enterprise agreements allowed for major infrastructure, resources and energy projects, saying business has made a \u201cpersuasive argument\u201d. The prospect of new greenfield agreements were included in the first of the government\u2019s industrial relations discussion papers, with the proposal also backed by Bill Shorten when Labor leader. \u201cWith approximately $250bn of new project capital in the investment pipeline \u2013 with the potential of more than 100,000 new jobs \u2013 it\u2019s hard to deny the scope for shared gains for companies and workers,\u201d Morrison said. Employer groups, particularly in the mining and energy sectors, want life-of-project agreements in place of the current four-year limit of agreements to ensure developments are not stalled by industrial disputes mid-construction. Morrison\u2019s wide-ranging speech on the economy also outlines a series of deregulation reforms, including better using technology to improve productivity. Along with the new online environmental approval process, the reforms will include establishing a new modern business registry to allow sole traders to more quickly update regulatory information, a new digital export documentation process, and new online tools to help small businesses employ new workers.",

      "body": "<p>What could have possibly lured Marie Welsh and two friends from southern Ireland to a freezing cold stadium in Queens, New York, on a Saturday afternoon in Novemberto lunch on $7.25 Nathan\u2019s hot dogs slathered in red onion sauce?</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s a long way to Tipperary,\u201d Marie said deadpan.</p> <p>They and 11,211 others had come to the home of Major League Baseball\u2019s Mets to watch the first New York Hurling Classic, a tournament with the teams who made the semi-finals of the All-Ireland Hurling Championships this summer: Limerick, Wexford, Kilkenny and Tipperary.</p> <p>Limerick beat Wexford and Kilkenny beat Tipperary in the semi-finals at Citi Field, and Welsh and her friends stuck around for the final, won by Kilkenny, even though their side had been routed in the real All Ireland Final in September this year. They had spent $80 each for tickets, and said it was worth it. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted we came, despite the score,\u201d Welsh said, before adding, \u201cbut we don\u2019t mind. We have the All-Ireland Trophy!\u201d</p> <p>Hurling is a 3,000-year-old Irish sport which bears some, but not much, resemblance to lacrosse or field hockey. Players in helmets but no pads use a curved wooden stick with a flat end, a <em>hurley</em>, to advance a hard ball, a <em>sliotar</em>, scoring by hitting the baseball-size ball at up to 100 miles an hour past a keeper into a soccer-size goal which counts for three points, or above the crossbar for a single point.</p> <p>Hurling, along with its sister sport Gaelic football, dominates Ireland\u2019s summer sporting calendar with games played to huge crowds from June to September. The final is played before 82,000 people in Dublin\u2019s Croke Park. The players, all amateurs, represent the county in which they were born (hurling is played throughout the 32 counties of Ireland and Northern Ireland) and so these players, and teams, are rooted in their communities. They play among their own, and for their own. It is uniquely Irish.</p> <p>Hurling, which has its own hashtag, #<em>ancientwarriorsport</em>, is a punishing, fast-paced physical game and organizers brought it to New York after three similar events at Fenway Park in Boston in the last four years.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an opportunity to introduce a sport where they have a rich tradition of Gaelic sports and hurling,\u201d said Mark Lev, the president of Fenway Sports Management, the organizer. \u201cThere are plenty of seats available to sell here, but for the first year, we\u2019re pleased.\u201d</p> <p>Aer Lingus sponsored the tournament, and Welsh and her friends came over as part of a package to New York, where they also took in a New York Knicks game and went shopping in New Jersey. But most of the people who came were from the New York metropolitan area.</p> <p>Although the food and drink served at Citi Field were standard ballpark fare (although one beer seller was hawking cans of Guinness in the main concourse).</p> <p>\u201cMakes it a lot easier to have a match here where they can bring their kids,\u201d John Kiely, the Limerick manager, said of the Irish in the crowd.</p> <p>And most of those people were either expats or people of Irish heritage, including Brian Patrick, a resident of Staten Island who\u2019d always wanted to see hurling in person. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a quick pace, which I like, and there\u2019s contact. It\u2019s fun.\u201d</p> <p>This version of hurling, called Super 11s, was not exactly the same game they play in Ireland. A standard hurling pitch is enormous: 140 to 160 yards long, 90 to 100 yards wide. That would be impossible to squeeze into a baseball park or even an NFL stadium, so a pitch the size of a soccer field was used in New York. There were two 20-minute halves in each game, half as long as usual.</p> <p>There were 11 players instead of 15, the ball was lighter than the one used in Ireland, and there was a shot clock. In Ireland, players get a point for hitting the ball between uprights jutting from the goal, but those did not count here. A player receives six points from scoring outside a box about 20 yards from the end line, and four points from inside the box.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a player\u2019s point of view, it was very, very enjoyable,\u201d said William O\u2019Donoghue, the Limerick captain, his bare legs rubbed raw. \u201cIt\u2019s just a pity we didn\u2019t get a trophy in the end.\u201d</p> <p>The idea was to give spectators a general feel for the sport \u2013 but this was not an exhibition, either. It got pretty feisty in Kilkenny\u2019s 64-40 victory over Limerick in the title game, with Darragh O\u2019Donovan flattening Kilkenny goalkeeper Eoin Murphy with a hockey-style cross-check that earned him a red card.</p> <p>Murphy seemed to be in good spirits afterwards. They don\u2019t play this version of the game much outside of training, and Murphy thought the matches in New York were \u201ccool. It\u2019s really, really fast to watch, but it\u2019s different to watch.\u201d Later, Murphy said of the ambience, \u201cYou sort of know how much home means to people.\u201d</p> <p>The teams had done some events with their supporters\u2019 clubs while in New York \u2013 part of the reason for their visit was to \u201cgrow\u201d the sport \u2013 then were given some time to explore the city. Murphy and a teammate, for example, rented bicycles to tour Central Park the day before the tournament. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect it to be as big as it is, and we didn\u2019t expect the hills, either,\u201d Murphy said with a smile.</p> <p>He planned to spend the next day sitting on a high stool in a pub watching NFL action, and specifically his favorite team, the Baltimore Ravens. Kilkenny will return to the US for a holiday in Orlando, and he hopes to catch a flight to Baltimore for the Pittsburgh game at the end of December.</p> <p>Murphy understood that the tournament trophy hardly erased losing to Tipperary in the match for the the Liam McCarthy Cup at Croke Park earlier this year. \u201cGive it time, and all anybody is going to be talking about is Tipperary,\u201d he said at Citi Field.</p> <p>But he\u2019d had a good time, and even the Tipperary fans said they had a good time, too. \u201cWe want to come here again!\u201d said Mairead Brophy, Marie Welsh\u2019s traveling buddy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What could have possibly lured Marie Welsh and two friends from southern Ireland to a freezing cold stadium in Queens, New York, on a Saturday afternoon in Novemberto lunch on $7.25 Nathan\u2019s hot dogs slathered in red onion sauce? \u201cAnd it\u2019s a long way to Tipperary,\u201d Marie said deadpan. They and 11,211 others had come to the home of Major League Baseball\u2019s Mets to watch the first New York Hurling Classic, a tournament with the teams who made the semi-finals of the All-Ireland Hurling Championships this summer: Limerick, Wexford, Kilkenny and Tipperary. Limerick beat Wexford and Kilkenny beat Tipperary in the semi-finals at Citi Field, and Welsh and her friends stuck around for the final, won by Kilkenny, even though their side had been routed in the real All Ireland Final in September this year. They had spent $80 each for tickets, and said it was worth it. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted we came, despite the score,\u201d Welsh said, before adding, \u201cbut we don\u2019t mind. We have the All-Ireland Trophy!\u201d Hurling is a 3,000-year-old Irish sport which bears some, but not much, resemblance to lacrosse or field hockey. Players in helmets but no pads use a curved wooden stick with a flat end, a hurley, to advance a hard ball, a sliotar, scoring by hitting the baseball-size ball at up to 100 miles an hour past a keeper into a soccer-size goal which counts for three points, or above the crossbar for a single point. Hurling, along with its sister sport Gaelic football, dominates Ireland\u2019s summer sporting calendar with games played to huge crowds from June to September. The final is played before 82,000 people in Dublin\u2019s Croke Park. The players, all amateurs, represent the county in which they were born (hurling is played throughout the 32 counties of Ireland and Northern Ireland) and so these players, and teams, are rooted in their communities. They play among their own, and for their own. It is uniquely Irish. Hurling, which has its own hashtag, #ancientwarriorsport, is a punishing, fast-paced physical game and organizers brought it to New York after three similar events at Fenway Park in Boston in the last four years. \u201cIt was an opportunity to introduce a sport where they have a rich tradition of Gaelic sports and hurling,\u201d said Mark Lev, the president of Fenway Sports Management, the organizer. \u201cThere are plenty of seats available to sell here, but for the first year, we\u2019re pleased.\u201d Aer Lingus sponsored the tournament, and Welsh and her friends came over as part of a package to New York, where they also took in a New York Knicks game and went shopping in New Jersey. But most of the people who came were from the New York metropolitan area. Although the food and drink served at Citi Field were standard ballpark fare (although one beer seller was hawking cans of Guinness in the main concourse). \u201cMakes it a lot easier to have a match here where they can bring their kids,\u201d John Kiely, the Limerick manager, said of the Irish in the crowd. And most of those people were either expats or people of Irish heritage, including Brian Patrick, a resident of Staten Island who\u2019d always wanted to see hurling in person. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a quick pace, which I like, and there\u2019s contact. It\u2019s fun.\u201d This version of hurling, called Super 11s, was not exactly the same game they play in Ireland. A standard hurling pitch is enormous: 140 to 160 yards long, 90 to 100 yards wide. That would be impossible to squeeze into a baseball park or even an NFL stadium, so a pitch the size of a soccer field was used in New York. There were two 20-minute halves in each game, half as long as usual. There were 11 players instead of 15, the ball was lighter than the one used in Ireland, and there was a shot clock. In Ireland, players get a point for hitting the ball between uprights jutting from the goal, but those did not count here. A player receives six points from scoring outside a box about 20 yards from the end line, and four points from inside the box. \u201cFrom a player\u2019s point of view, it was very, very enjoyable,\u201d said William O\u2019Donoghue, the Limerick captain, his bare legs rubbed raw. \u201cIt\u2019s just a pity we didn\u2019t get a trophy in the end.\u201d The idea was to give spectators a general feel for the sport \u2013 but this was not an exhibition, either. It got pretty feisty in Kilkenny\u2019s 64-40 victory over Limerick in the title game, with Darragh O\u2019Donovan flattening Kilkenny goalkeeper Eoin Murphy with a hockey-style cross-check that earned him a red card. Murphy seemed to be in good spirits afterwards. They don\u2019t play this version of the game much outside of training, and Murphy thought the matches in New York were \u201ccool. It\u2019s really, really fast to watch, but it\u2019s different to watch.\u201d Later, Murphy said of the ambience, \u201cYou sort of know how much home means to people.\u201d The teams had done some events with their supporters\u2019 clubs while in New York \u2013 part of the reason for their visit was to \u201cgrow\u201d the sport \u2013 then were given some time to explore the city. Murphy and a teammate, for example, rented bicycles to tour Central Park the day before the tournament. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect it to be as big as it is, and we didn\u2019t expect the hills, either,\u201d Murphy said with a smile. He planned to spend the next day sitting on a high stool in a pub watching NFL action, and specifically his favorite team, the Baltimore Ravens. Kilkenny will return to the US for a holiday in Orlando, and he hopes to catch a flight to Baltimore for the Pittsburgh game at the end of December. Murphy understood that the tournament trophy hardly erased losing to Tipperary in the match for the the Liam McCarthy Cup at Croke Park earlier this year. \u201cGive it time, and all anybody is going to be talking about is Tipperary,\u201d he said at Citi Field. But he\u2019d had a good time, and even the Tipperary fans said they had a good time, too. \u201cWe want to come here again!\u201d said Mairead Brophy, Marie Welsh\u2019s traveling buddy.",

      "bodyText": "From Penzance to Perth, a dire shortage of staff has deepened a crisis in adult social care already struggling to cope with a decade of cuts to budgets, rising demand for services and continued absence of sorely-needed reform. Latest figures show that almost 1.5 million people work in the care sector in England alone. Yet many of the workforce feel undervalued, resulting in annual turnover exceeding 30% and 122,000 vacancies. The impact is seen in long waits for homecare packages, delayed hospital discharges and care home closures. But there are glimmers of hope. In Cornwall, where a rapidly ageing population and seasonal job opportunities add to pressures on the sector, an innovative pilot aims to show the rest of the UK how care workers themselves can be the best recruiters \u2013 using technology already in their pockets. Over the past three months, 25 providers in the county, big and small, have signed up to Care Friends \u2013 a mobile app which taps into workers\u2019 social networks.

Take the notion that wealthy Conservatives would <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/11/corbyn-and-mcdonnell-want-you-to-attack-their-broadband-pledge/\" title=\"\">prefer to pay for their own services</a> out of concern for the poorest. Even progressives have questioned a strategy that, on the face of it, gives perks to the rich (I\u2019ve been torn on whether free tuition would be better spent on equalising early-years education, for example), but this dilemma means little without a desire to invest money elsewhere.</p> <p>I don\u2019t recall many of the commentators outraged over high earners getting free antibiotics expressing concern when disabled people were having to choose between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/video/2017/may /30/living-with-disabilities-youre-treated-worse-than-a-farm-animal-video\" title=\"\">buying medicine and food</a>.

      "bodyText": "When Labour releases its manifesto on Thursday, all eyes will be on the policies, from high-speed broadband, scrapping prescription charges and ending tuition fees to free dental check-ups. What\u2019s really interesting, though, isn\u2019t the policies themselves but the principle that binds them: universal services. Be it healthcare or access to the internet, the message that comes with these measures is one of collective politics \u2013 the notion that the state has a duty to provide top-rate services for all, and that a society is better when it pools resources to ensure no one misses out. Predictably, it has come under fire from critics. \u201cWhy not throw in free Sky TV? Free iPhones? Netflix and Xboxes all round?\u201d asked the former Labour MP Chris Leslie. Or, as the Times journalist Iain Martin put it in his aghast response to Labour\u2019s broadband announcement last week: \u201cEverything is horribly, brutally possible.\u201d The arguments against universal services are noticeably weak. Take the notion that wealthy Conservatives would prefer to pay for their own services out of concern for the poorest. Even progressives have questioned a strategy that, on the face of it, gives perks to the rich (I\u2019ve been torn on whether free tuition would be better spent on equalising early-years education, for example), but this dilemma means little without a desire to invest money elsewhere. I don\u2019t recall many of the commentators outraged over high earners getting free antibiotics expressing concern when disabled people were having to choose between buying medicine and food. Indeed, those claiming the funds needed for universal services could be better spent on the poorest are typically the same people who eagerly supported austerity measures that have left many to live on a pittance. Others point to how much blanket provision would cost. While it\u2019s true there\u2019s a considerable price tag to universal services, it saves money in a number of ways. Providing universal effective broadband will increase productivity, for example; free dental check-ups will save on hospital bills from the many people who can\u2019t afford to visit dentists \u2013 the 515,000 patients who go to GPs or A&amp;E with toothache cost the NHS more than \u00a338m every year alone. Besides, means-testing is notoriously ineffective and costly \u2013 why not spend all those resources on alleviating the problems themselves rather than gatekeeping who \u201cdeserves\u201d help? Underneath resistance to universal services sit certain assumptions that have long plagued British politics \u2013 ones that equate shrinking the state with common sense. The same social and economic orthodoxy that favours making large cuts during a recession contrary to evidence consistently presents means-testing \u2013 and privatising key services \u2013 as efficient.

The <a href=\"https://howardleague.org/news/criminalisation-of-children-in-residential-care-should-be-a-national-concern/\">fallout is bleak</a>: care leavers are 15 times more likely to end up in the criminal justice system and <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Care-leavers-transition-to-adulthood.pdf\">25% of homeless people</a> have come through care.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t do it to their own children but we do it to some of the most vulnerable children in our society,\u201d says Akpan-Inwang. And so Lighthouse plans to open semi-independent accommodation for over 18s within walking distance of the Sutton home.</p> \n<p>Of course, Denmark and Britain are very different places, requiring nuanced approaches. When Lighthouse was looking for its residential site, careful risk assessments were carried out to ensure there was no gang activity in the area.

Josephine Schneider\u2019s House specialises in children who turn their anger inward. \u201cThat is our challenge,\u201d she continues. \u201cChildren with aggression issues tend to be referred elsewhere.\u201d Akpan-Inwang visited a home in the north of Denmark where children had \u201csome of the most extreme behaviour\u201d, but he returned satisfied. \u201cEven those children were doing fantastically well. It gave me a lot more confidence about what we\u2019re implementing in the UK.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s worth bearing in mind that a typical UK placement in 2014 <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/388701/Childrens_Homes_data_pack_Dec_2014.pdf\">cost about \u00a32,900 a week</a>, or roughly \u00a3150,000 a year; and costs have been rising year on year since then. At Josephine Schneider\u2019s House, it\u2019s 720,000 Danish kroner (about \u00a383,000) a year. However, Akpan-Inwang points out that with better planning, these costs can be reduced and money provided by the local authority will stretch further as there\u2019s not a goal to make a profit: \u201cAdditional funding isn\u2019t going back into the pockets of shareholders, it\u2019s going towards making sure young people get the best experience possible.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Akpan-Inwang and his team work hard to bring their vision to life, they hope others will follow their lead. \u201cWe want to work with other parts of the sector to innovate together.\u201d The past five years have seen a 20% increase in the number of children in care in the UK. So the Lighthouse vision is needed now more than ever.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are no short cuts when it comes to children\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d says Olsen. \u201cI see more and more in the UK and elsewhere a move towards quick fixes, patching people up. But you only have one chance at childhood. And if you get it wrong, you\u2019re going to get an adult who needs more help and has problems later on. Taking a short-term approach to the welfare of children is a real failure of vision.\u201d</p> \n<p>Not something that\u2019s going to happen on Olsen\u2019s watch.</p> \n<p><em>This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The room\u2019s occupant is gesturing with sparkly nails, giving a tour of the premises and explaining how she picked out her own furniture and fittings from Ikea when she first arrived. This is Josephine Schneider\u2019s House \u2013 a grand, 13-roomed residence built in 1906 in a leafy suburb of Copenhagen, funded by a Danish philanthropist of the same name to care for children who don\u2019t have parents or whose parents can\u2019t look after them. Our nine-year-old tour guide has lived at Josephine Schneider\u2019s House for two years. \u201cI like it here,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI get to play with the bigger girls \u2013 they\u2019re 13 \u2013 and we all got to go to Majorca this summer.\u201d An annual \u201cfamily\u201d holiday is a Josephine Schneider\u2019s tradition, along with celebrating Christmas, Easter and the myriad festivals that make up the Danish calendar. This set-up could not be further from what many young people currently experience within the UK\u2019s care home system, where 73% of homes are run for profit. Privatisation and a target-driven culture have seen nurture replaced by the very worst of institutional cold-shouldering for some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable children. At the same time, the number of children in care in England is increasing sharply. But a British social entrepreneur is so impressed with the Danish model that he wants to import it to the UK, with the first facility set to open in Surrey in 2020. Emmanuel Akpan-Inwang \u2013 founder and director of the Lighthouse charity \u2013 was teaching English at a Birmingham secondary school in 2011 when he noticed a gross disparity in achievements. Only 4% of those from children\u2019s homes were achieving five A* to C grades in English and maths at GCSE (levels nine to four), compared with more than 60% among all children. He decided to look into a new approach, dedicating evenings and weekends to research. He called on help from fellow teachers and a broad spectrum of experts; volunteered in a cross-section of UK homes; went full-time and funded in 2017; and, perhaps most importantly, spent two summers visiting lauded examples of residential care in Germany and Denmark. At Josephine Schneider\u2019s House, staff and children sit down to eat together at a vast oak dining table with proper place settings and candles \u201cfor extra hyggeligt\u201d in winter months. Once a week, the older children cook for everyone. \u201cNothing fancy, just pasta or burgers or pizza, mostly,\u201d explains Alexander, a boy of 18 who has lived at Josephine Schneider\u2019s for seven years.

Josephine Schneider\u2019s House specialises in children who turn their anger inward. \u201cThat is our challenge,\u201d she continues. \u201cChildren with aggression issues tend to be referred elsewhere.\u201d Akpan-Inwang visited a home in the north of Denmark where children had \u201csome of the most extreme behaviour\u201d, but he returned satisfied. \u201cEven those children were doing fantastically well. It gave me a lot more confidence about what we\u2019re implementing in the UK.\u201d It\u2019s worth bearing in mind that a typical UK placement in 2014 cost about \u00a32,900 a week, or roughly \u00a3150,000 a year; and costs have been rising year on year since then. At Josephine Schneider\u2019s House, it\u2019s 720,000 Danish kroner (about \u00a383,000) a year. However, Akpan-Inwang points out that with better planning, these costs can be reduced and money provided by the local authority will stretch further as there\u2019s not a goal to make a profit: \u201cAdditional funding isn\u2019t going back into the pockets of shareholders, it\u2019s going towards making sure young people get the best experience possible.\u201d As Akpan-Inwang and his team work hard to bring their vision to life, they hope others will follow their lead. \u201cWe want to work with other parts of the sector to innovate together.\u201d The past five years have seen a 20% increase in the number of children in care in the UK. So the Lighthouse vision is needed now more than ever. \u201cThere are no short cuts when it comes to children\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d says Olsen. \u201cI see more and more in the UK and elsewhere a move towards quick fixes, patching people up. But you only have one chance at childhood. And if you get it wrong, you\u2019re going to get an adult who needs more help and has problems later on. Taking a short-term approach to the welfare of children is a real failure of vision.\u201d Not something that\u2019s going to happen on Olsen\u2019s watch.

She caused the whole family to relocate back to England, where she recovered. Her parents thought her recovery miraculous and had been achieved, they said, through constant prayer.

First the apology: \u201cWe would like to offer an apology for the distressing start to her trip to Spain.\u201d Then the excuse: \u201cThe car rental brands we work with are responsible for managing their own fleets and updating what is available to customers. We have been in touch with Rhodium to ensure this situation doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Then the promise: \u201cWe have looked into the case and issued the full refund for both the initial booking with Rhodium, plus the difference in price for her second car from Firefly.\u201d Finally, the self-justification: \u201cWe continually monitor customer feedback via our Customer Centre of Excellence and appropriate action is taken if any car hire brands do not meet the standards required.\u201d Instead of a letter offering the apology and the refund, you then received a request for paperwork you\u2019d already submitted so that an investigation could begin \u2013 three months after your complaint. Only after further nudges from the Observer did it finally stump up the money. As for Rhodium, it laid the blame squarely on Holiday Autos which it said linked the booking reference to an invalid voucher number then cancelled the reservation.

The Conservative party announced on Sunday it was going to increase the surcharge from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625 a year for all non-EU migrant workers and extend it to all EU citizens who migrate to the UK after Brexit. The fee is payable for each member of a family migrating, meaning nurses from popular recruitment spots such as the Philippines and India who come to Britain with a spouse and two children will have to pay the government \u00a32,500 a year for the privilege of working in the NHS. The leader of Britain\u2019s 400,000 nurses called the move inhumane and medical associations warned it would further deter health professionals from coming to the UK where they were desperately needed to alleviate continual and chronic staff shortages. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN), British Medical Association (BMA) and Royal College of Physicians have criticised the plans as short-sighted and written to Johnson warning him that the move will prove counterproductive.

      "body": "<p>Almost as soon as the fishermen arrive with their haul, it disappears. The fish market in Epe, at the edge of Lagos, now runs like a kind of seafood cabal, with demand so high that many miss out. The major buyers are served as a priority \u2013 the big Lagos restaurants, a few cold room owners, then the rest. Sometimes smaller fishermen will sell to favoured market-stall holders. There is simply not enough to go around.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I couldn\u2019t find red snappers in Victoria Island, a friend suggested I go to the Epe market. But the snappers were not there either,\u201d says Enita Aderemi, a local freelance writer. \u201cThe freshwater catfish I found cost three times the price I bought them for three months ago, a price that was already high.\u201d</p> <p>The one-hour drive from her home to Epe is now a regular fixture in Aderemi\u2019s life as she searches for seafood amid the rising prices and demand for fish in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"035a6980b59403c999dfff7928831ab046a56878\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/035a6980b59403c999dfff7928831ab046a56878/45_0_5261_3157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset on Victoria island, Lagos, Nigeria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lagos is set to double in size by 2050 and local fishers are struggling to keep up with demand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wayne Parsons/Getty Images/Gallo Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nigeria is Africa\u2019s largest importer of foreign fish, <a href=\"https://fcwc-fish.org/uncategorized/nigeria-fishery-statistics-2016-summary-report\">with a demand for </a><a href=\"https://fcwc-fish.org/uncategorized/nigeria-fishery-statistics-2016-summary-report\">more than </a><a href=\"https://fcwc-fish.org/uncategorized/nigeria-fishery-statistics-2016-summary-report\">3m metric tonnes</a> each year. Despite having an Atlantic coastline of 853km (530 miles), the country is unable to provide fish for a population that is <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/africa/nigerias-population-projected-double-2050\">predicted to double by 2050</a>.</p> <p>In Lagos, and particularly in Epe, fishermen and farmers are having to travel further to get fish. The Lekki lagoon, previously a fisherman\u2019s paradise, is being slowly depleted by various megacity projects, the biggest of which is an oil refinery owned by Africa\u2019s richest man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/03/aliko-dangote-nigeria-cement-africa\">Aliko Dangote</a>.</p> <p>The Dangote refinery in the Lekki free trade zone, which is partially on the lagoon, lies on roughly <a href=\"https://allafrica.com/stories/201907300426.html\">2,500 hectares (6,177 acres) of swampland</a>. It is hoped that it will process 650,000 barrels of oil a day when completed, becoming Africa\u2019s biggest such installation.</p> <p>Nigeria currently exports all its oil as crude and then reimports refined petroleum products for use inside the country. The $12bn (\u00a39.3bn) refinery is expected to eliminate Nigeria\u2019s dependence on imported petroleum products, in turn lowering demand for foreign exchange, which the government says is a contributor to economic problems.</p> <p>However, nearby coastal towns and communities are seeing a change in their local ecosystems. \u201cThe dredging of the coast to sand fill the lagoon for the construction of the refinery made the fish in the area disappear. We had to travel far into the ocean to get fish, but even that became dangerous because the waves became unpredictable,\u201d explains former fisherman Ayo Falade.</p> <p>With a family of four to feed, Falade moved inland, to the lagoon. But even there, fish are disappearing. \u201cA conservationist came and told us that the sand-filling was changing the local ecosystem,\u201d he says.</p> <p>People living in coastal communities around the refinery and free trade zone are already in danger of losing their homes.</p> <p>As fishing activity in the area has declined, fishermen are having to make longer trips to other communities to meet the growing demand.</p> <p>Shakiru Tijani, a fisherman in Epe, is among those who say development in the area has come at a personal cost. \u201cWhen the industrial projects began, I and others lost the dams we had made to catch fish. We now have to go for two or three hours into the water to catch fish and usually it\u2019s not enough for the customers we have.\u201d</p> <p>The fish market is controlled by the sellers, mostly wives of fishermen turned brokers. \u201cBefore, they would come back with fish and then, we would sell. Now, we are able to look at how much fish might be needed and fund fishing trips with our money,\u201d says a woman named Babalola.</p> <p>Babalola and other fish brokers are often able to raise between 150,000 and 300,000 naira (\u00a3322\u2013\u00a3645) for a trip. The price of fish has quadrupled since 2015 when work on the refinery began.</p> <p>Lani Akinbo-Michaels, a seafood dealer who heads Lani\u2019s Farmer\u2019s Market, says fish is becoming a luxury in the country. \u201cNot only here, but in Makoko and Badagry, it is difficult to get fish. The fish is smaller and more expensive, some species are slowly fading away.\u201d</p> <p>To make way for infrastructure development, the government of Lagos has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/may/31/destroyed-community-lagos-nigeria-residents-forced-evictions-demolitions\">evicting waterfront communities</a> and building high-rise housing projects on the land. More than 30,000 people have been displaced, reducing the number of people able to fish and farm in Lagos\u2019 waters.</p> <p>Since 2017, the price of shrimps and prawns has more than tripled says Akinbo-Michaels. \u201cFormer communities like Otodo Gbame had shrimp and prawn farmers, but since they were demolished by the government, people in Lagos have had to turn to imported fish products. There just is not enough to serve all of Lagos.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Lucian Obinnaya Chukwu of the department of marine sciences at the University of Lagos believes there are many reasons fish are disappearing, in addition to the impact of the refinery and other development projects on marine habitats. </p> <p>\u201cThe ever-changing nature of Lagos coupled with climate change means that unprotected marine population[s] will be at the receiving end of development,\u201d he says. \u201cIncreasing sea levels and rising global temperatures will affect the fish population in Nigeria.\u201d</p> <p>While guidelines are in place to protect Nigeria\u2019s waters and environment, enforcement has been a problem. In 1991, Nigeria\u2019s Department of Petroleum Resources released <a href=\"https://ngfcp.dpr.gov.ng/media/1066/dprs-egaspin-2002-revised-edition.pdf\">environmental guidelines</a> for the petroleum industry in Nigeria.

      "bodyText": "Almost as soon as the fishermen arrive with their haul, it disappears. The fish market in Epe, at the edge of Lagos, now runs like a kind of seafood cabal, with demand so high that many miss out. The major buyers are served as a priority \u2013 the big Lagos restaurants, a few cold room owners, then the rest. Sometimes smaller fishermen will sell to favoured market-stall holders. There is simply not enough to go around. \u201cWhen I couldn\u2019t find red snappers in Victoria Island, a friend suggested I go to the Epe market. But the snappers were not there either,\u201d says Enita Aderemi, a local freelance writer. \u201cThe freshwater catfish I found cost three times the price I bought them for three months ago, a price that was already high.\u201d The one-hour drive from her home to Epe is now a regular fixture in Aderemi\u2019s life as she searches for seafood amid the rising prices and demand for fish in Nigeria\u2019s largest city. Nigeria is Africa\u2019s largest importer of foreign fish, with a demand for more than 3m metric tonnes each year. Despite having an Atlantic coastline of 853km (530 miles), the country is unable to provide fish for a population that is predicted to double by 2050. In Lagos, and particularly in Epe, fishermen and farmers are having to travel further to get fish. The Lekki lagoon, previously a fisherman\u2019s paradise, is being slowly depleted by various megacity projects, the biggest of which is an oil refinery owned by Africa\u2019s richest man, Aliko Dangote. The Dangote refinery in the Lekki free trade zone, which is partially on the lagoon, lies on roughly 2,500 hectares (6,177 acres) of swampland. It is hoped that it will process 650,000 barrels of oil a day when completed, becoming Africa\u2019s biggest such installation. Nigeria currently exports all its oil as crude and then reimports refined petroleum products for use inside the country. The $12bn (\u00a39.3bn) refinery is expected to eliminate Nigeria\u2019s dependence on imported petroleum products, in turn lowering demand for foreign exchange, which the government says is a contributor to economic problems. However, nearby coastal towns and communities are seeing a change in their local ecosystems. \u201cThe dredging of the coast to sand fill the lagoon for the construction of the refinery made the fish in the area disappear. We had to travel far into the ocean to get fish, but even that became dangerous because the waves became unpredictable,\u201d explains former fisherman Ayo Falade. With a family of four to feed, Falade moved inland, to the lagoon. But even there, fish are disappearing. \u201cA conservationist came and told us that the sand-filling was changing the local ecosystem,\u201d he says. People living in coastal communities around the refinery and free trade zone are already in danger of losing their homes. As fishing activity in the area has declined, fishermen are having to make longer trips to other communities to meet the growing demand. Shakiru Tijani, a fisherman in Epe, is among those who say development in the area has come at a personal cost. \u201cWhen the industrial projects began, I and others lost the dams we had made to catch fish. We now have to go for two or three hours into the water to catch fish and usually it\u2019s not enough for the customers we have.\u201d The fish market is controlled by the sellers, mostly wives of fishermen turned brokers. \u201cBefore, they would come back with fish and then, we would sell. Now, we are able to look at how much fish might be needed and fund fishing trips with our money,\u201d says a woman named Babalola. Babalola and other fish brokers are often able to raise between 150,000 and 300,000 naira (\u00a3322\u2013\u00a3645) for a trip. The price of fish has quadrupled since 2015 when work on the refinery began. Lani Akinbo-Michaels, a seafood dealer who heads Lani\u2019s Farmer\u2019s Market, says fish is becoming a luxury in the country. \u201cNot only here, but in Makoko and Badagry, it is difficult to get fish. The fish is smaller and more expensive, some species are slowly fading away.\u201d To make way for infrastructure development, the government of Lagos has been evicting waterfront communities and building high-rise housing projects on the land. More than 30,000 people have been displaced, reducing the number of people able to fish and farm in Lagos\u2019 waters. Since 2017, the price of shrimps and prawns has more than tripled says Akinbo-Michaels. \u201cFormer communities like Otodo Gbame had shrimp and prawn farmers, but since they were demolished by the government, people in Lagos have had to turn to imported fish products. There just is not enough to serve all of Lagos.\u201d Prof Lucian Obinnaya Chukwu of the department of marine sciences at the University of Lagos believes there are many reasons fish are disappearing, in addition to the impact of the refinery and other development projects on marine habitats. \u201cThe ever-changing nature of Lagos coupled with climate change means that unprotected marine population[s] will be at the receiving end of development,\u201d he says. \u201cIncreasing sea levels and rising global temperatures will affect the fish population in Nigeria.\u201d While guidelines are in place to protect Nigeria\u2019s waters and environment, enforcement has been a problem. In 1991, Nigeria\u2019s Department of Petroleum Resources released environmental guidelines for the petroleum industry in Nigeria. The country is also a signatory to the Abidjan convention on international waters governance. Historically, however, Nigeria has failed to deal with oil spills properly. Years after the Ogoni oil spills, the clean up is not yet underway. In Badagry, the Yinka Folawiyo Petroleum Company is accused of polluting the environment by causing acid rain, and reducing the quality of fish in the waters. \u201cThe moment that the Dangote refinery is turned on, it is is over for us fishermen. What will our lives be then?\u201d says Tijani. There is a fear that an accidental oil leak could leave the land and water in the same state as in Ogoniland. \u201cThe government has not cleaned it up and people have died over nothing.\u201d \u201cWithout any government intervention at this point, we don\u2019t know what will happen to the local fish population,\u201d says Aderemi. \u201cWhat Lagos will we leave for the next generation?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Barack Obama used to be the Hope and Change guy. He wrote a book called The Audacity of Hope. His campaign slogans were: \u201cYes we can!\u201d and: \u201cChange you can believe in\u201d. He inspired people to dream big and, at his rallies, exhilarated crowds chanted: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhWDFgRfi1Q\" title=\"\">\u201cFired up! Ready to go!\u201d</a></p> <p>But that was a long time ago. Obama is older now and wiser. He realises hope can sometimes be too audacious and he appears to have adopted new slogans to reflect that. \u201cNo we can\u2019t!\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t believe in change \u2013 it\u2019s too hard to achieve.\u201d Post-presidency, his rallying cry seems to be: \u201cSimmer down, kids: you\u2019re going way too far to the left.\u201d</p> <p>Last Friday, the former president <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/barack-obama-2020-dems.html\" title=\"\">addressed the annual meeting of the Democracy Alliance</a>, a network of wealthy Democratic donors, and praised realism over idealism. \u201cEven as we push the envelope \u2026 we also have to be rooted in reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it \u2026 They just don\u2019t want to see crazy stuff.\u201d He cautioned against the Democrats adopting too progressive a platform, arguing that \u201cvoters aren\u2019t aligned with the ambitions of certain left-leaning Twitter feeds\u201d or \u201cthe activist wing of our party\u201d.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s remarks to the Democracy Alliance come just weeks after he made similarly disparaging comments about the left during a conversation at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/01/does-obamas-critique-of-radical-politics-help-bring-about-the-change-he-wanted\" title=\"\">Obama Foundation summit in Chicago</a>. \u201cWe can\u2019t completely remake society in a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cThis idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re always politically woke \u2026 you should get over that quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks, Obama, but these patronising lectures are getting old. Most progressives, I\u2019d wager, are well aware change doesn\u2019t happen overnight. But that doesn\u2019t mean we need to compromise our values or ambitions. That doesn\u2019t mean we should \u201cget over\u201d the \u201ccrazy\u201d idea that we can build a more equal world for everyone. </p> <p>While Obama\u2019s recent denunciations of the left are disappointing, they are not exactly surprising. After all, while he may have promised hope and change, Obama was never truly progressive. He <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2fimmigration%2fthe-trump-administrations-immigration-jails-are-packed-but-deportations-are-lower-than-in-obama-era%2f2019%2f11%2f17%2f27ad0e44-f057-11e9-89eb-ec56cd414732_story.html%3f\" title=\"\">deported 1.2 million people</a> during his first three years in office; Trump, by the way, has deported fewer than 800,000 while he has been president. Obama spearheaded a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/14/13577464/obama-farewell-speech-torture-drones-nsa-surveillance-trump\" title=\"\">secretive drone war</a>; he expanded the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/obama-expands-surveillance-powers-his-way-out\" title=\"\">surveillance state</a>; he <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/06/02/obama-wanted-to-cut-social-security-then-bernie-sanders-happened/\" title=\"\">attempted to cut social security benefits</a>, even though his campaign promised he would expand them; he denounced the influence of money in politics and then gave his big-money donors <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/06/20/137286021/report-obama-big-money-donors-got-plum-posts\" title=\"\">plum posts in his administration</a>. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not here to demonise Obama. He did a lot of good and he was a million times better than Trump \u2013 although that is, of course, an incredibly low bar. But he was always centrist. He never believed in systemic change.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the thing, though: we live in an age when wanting systemic change isn\u2019t idealism, it\u2019s realism. Unconscionable inequality and the climate crisis mean that we have run out of time for compromises. We have run out of time for vague promises of hope. Obama may think he is being practical, but he misunderstands the urgency of the current moment. If \u201cliberal\u201d leaders persist in standing in the middle of the road, we will all get run over.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Barack Obama used to be the Hope and Change guy. He wrote a book called The Audacity of Hope. His campaign slogans were: \u201cYes we can!\u201d and: \u201cChange you can believe in\u201d. He inspired people to dream big and, at his rallies, exhilarated crowds chanted: \u201cFired up! Ready to go!\u201d But that was a long time ago. Obama is older now and wiser. He realises hope can sometimes be too audacious and he appears to have adopted new slogans to reflect that. \u201cNo we can\u2019t!\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t believe in change \u2013 it\u2019s too hard to achieve.\u201d Post-presidency, his rallying cry seems to be: \u201cSimmer down, kids: you\u2019re going way too far to the left.\u201d Last Friday, the former president addressed the annual meeting of the Democracy Alliance, a network of wealthy Democratic donors, and praised realism over idealism. \u201cEven as we push the envelope \u2026 we also have to be rooted in reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it \u2026 They just don\u2019t want to see crazy stuff.\u201d He cautioned against the Democrats adopting too progressive a platform, arguing that \u201cvoters aren\u2019t aligned with the ambitions of certain left-leaning Twitter feeds\u201d or \u201cthe activist wing of our party\u201d. Obama\u2019s remarks to the Democracy Alliance come just weeks after he made similarly disparaging comments about the left during a conversation at the Obama Foundation summit in Chicago. \u201cWe can\u2019t completely remake society in a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cThis idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re always politically woke \u2026 you should get over that quickly.\u201d Thanks, Obama, but these patronising lectures are getting old. Most progressives, I\u2019d wager, are well aware change doesn\u2019t happen overnight. But that doesn\u2019t mean we need to compromise our values or ambitions. That doesn\u2019t mean we should \u201cget over\u201d the \u201ccrazy\u201d idea that we can build a more equal world for everyone. While Obama\u2019s recent denunciations of the left are disappointing, they are not exactly surprising. After all, while he may have promised hope and change, Obama was never truly progressive. He deported 1.2 million people during his first three years in office; Trump, by the way, has deported fewer than 800,000 while he has been president. Obama spearheaded a secretive drone war; he expanded the surveillance state; he attempted to cut social security benefits, even though his campaign promised he would expand them; he denounced the influence of money in politics and then gave his big-money donors plum posts in his administration. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not here to demonise Obama. He did a lot of good and he was a million times better than Trump \u2013 although that is, of course, an incredibly low bar. But he was always centrist. He never believed in systemic change. Here\u2019s the thing, though: we live in an age when wanting systemic change isn\u2019t idealism, it\u2019s realism. Unconscionable inequality and the climate crisis mean that we have run out of time for compromises. We have run out of time for vague promises of hope. Obama may think he is being practical, but he misunderstands the urgency of the current moment. If \u201cliberal\u201d leaders persist in standing in the middle of the road, we will all get run over.",

Best of the rest &gt; Dutch authorities have discovered 25 migrants stowed away in a refrigerated container on the England-bound ferry DFDS Britannia Seaways. The ferry returned to the port of Vlaardingen upon their discovery. Two people were seen at hospital for possible hypothermia while the others received a medical check-up in the port before being processed by police, emergency services said. &gt; The world is on track to produce more than twice as much coal, oil and gas as can be safely burned if the rise in global temperature is to be held at 1.5C, analysis shows. \u201cWe\u2019re in a deep hole \u2013 and we need to stop digging,\u201d said M\u00e5ns Nilsson, executive director of the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI). Separately, North Sea Oil executives are plugging the idea that the emptying undersea basin could be pumped full of carbon emissions to keep them out of the atmosphere. &gt; Up to 12 Eurasian beavers are to be introduced on National Trust land to ease flooding and improve biodiversity. Beavers were hunted to extinction 400 years ago in the UK but in recent years there has been a series of controlled reintroductions. The releases will take place at Holnicote estate on Exmoor, in Somerset, and at Valewood on the Black Down estate, on the border of West Sussex and Surrey. Today in Focus podcast: The climate frontline in Wales Rachel Humphreys reports on her time in Fairbourne, which will be dismantled by 2045 due to rising sea levels, while Sandra Laville looks at why flooding and the climate crisis should be a key issue in the general election. And Lily Kuo on the Hong Kong protesters still inside the Polytechnic University. Lunchtime read: \u2018My beloved Hong Kong is a war zone\u2019 As another week of violence grips the city, normal life is on hold. People cannot work, schools are closed, the roads are paralysed, children are terrified and social lives have ground to a halt. Verna Yu\u2019s heartbreak over the crisis in Hong Kong. Sport Tottenham have moved quickly to hire Jos\u00e9 Mourinho after the club\u2019s brutal but also oddly inevitable decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino last night was met with shock and surprise. Ryan Giggs savoured \u201cone of the greatest nights\u201d of his career after leading Wales to Euro 2020 and insisted his team can continue to flourish after Aaron Ramsey struck twice to secure passage to a third major tournament finals. Elsewhere, Serge Gnabry\u2019s hat-trick condemned Northern Ireland to a heavy defeat in their final fixture of qualifying as outgoing manager Michael O\u2019Neill suffered the second heaviest defeat of his eight-year reign. Great Britain\u2019s tennis players are feeling the Madrid chill this week but their resolve to win the Davis Cup again is underpinned by their long-established bonhomie.

The pound is worth $1.290 and \u20ac1.165 and at time of writing the FTSE is flat ahead of the open. The papers Top billing on most of the front pages today is given to the election leaders\u2019 debate. The Mail focuses on the fact the Labour leader refused nine times to answer a question on Brexit: \u201cLaughable, Mr Corbyn\u201d, as does the Daily Express: \u201cCorbyn dodges Brexit question nine times\u201d. The Guardian focuses on what the two men focused on in the debate: \u201cLeaders stake their ground: Johnson Brexit, Corbyn NHS\u201d. The FT has \u201cJohnson survives hazardous duel with Corbyn in first TV debate\u201d. The Times reports the closeness of the result according to a snap YouGov poll: \u201cNeck and neck after TV clash\u201d, the i has \u201cInsults fly at leaders\u2019 TV debate\u201d.

The presale for Lizzo\u2019s January 2020 Truth Hurts tour event in Sydney began on Wednesday, ahead of general sale on Thursday, but very early on fans began reporting being as far back as 11,000th in the queue waiting for tickets. There are fewer than 6,000 seats in the venue. Some fans suggested that the Sydney Opera House ticket buying system had been hit by ticket bots used by scalpers to buy up the tickets to then on-sell via ticket resale sites such as Viagogo. Tickets for Lizzo\u2019s Melbourne show have already begun appearing on Viagogo for as much as $19,000. But the Opera House said it was monitoring fraudulent behaviour, and would not send out tickets until the day of the event. \u201cThe Sydney Opera House takes ticket scalping seriously. Across all Sydney Opera House events we have system checks in place to monitor fraudulent behaviours, and tickets may be cancelled without notice if these checks detect any anomalies,\u201d it said. \u201cAs is standard practice, tickets for Lizzo\u2019s Sydney Opera House show will only be dispatched on the day of the event \u2013 Monday 6 January, 2020 \u2013 to restrict unauthorised resales.\u201d Ticket-buying bots are illegal in NSW, but not across the rest of Australia. Fines for people using ticket bots in NSW are as high as $110,000, and the law also requires people reselling tickets to keep prices within 10% of the original price. No Lizzo tickets for Sydney were on Viagogo as of Wednesday afternoon, and tickets for other Sydney shows for bands like U2 seemed to be closer to face value than Lizzo\u2019s Melbourne show. The federal government said in a regulatory impact statement published in November last year that a nationwide ban on bots would give consumers fairer access to tickets but said more work was required to develop an enforcement and penalty regime for the ban. Instead, the government opted to require ticket resellers to disclose the face value of the tickets, and that the websites selling those tickets are not the primary ticket sellers. Restricting reselling to face value or a cap of 10% above ticket price, as in NSW, would cost the industry $20m over 10 years to implement, the federal government said. At the last meeting of state and federal consumer law ministers in August, the federal government said it would provide a written update to the state and territory ministers on options to ban ticket-buying bots.",

      "bodyText": "North Sea oil executives believe the ageing fossil fuel basin may still lead a global climate revolution by providing a testbed for clean energy breakthroughs. An industry report has revealed that the North Sea could emerge as an unlikely climate hero by becoming a global showcase for the energy transition after decades producing fossil fuels. The basin has produced almost 40bn barrels of oil over the last 40 years, but as oilfields decline the empty caverns could be used to store carbon emissions, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The advisory firm added that North Sea gas producers may eventually be able to produce zero-carbon hydrogen by using electricity generated by offshore wind turbines to split the carbon molecules from natural gas. The North Sea is already equipped with major offshore infrastructure, such as pipelines and platforms, which could be used to help transport and store the carbon emissions captured by UK factories and hydrogen producers. Drew Stevenson, PwC\u2019s UK energy sector leader, said there is \u201chuge potential\u201d for the North Sea to help meet the \u201cnecessary urgency to move to a low-carbon world\u201d by focusing on low-carbon innovations and new technology. PwC based its report on interviews with 20 key energy industry executives to pinpoint how the North Sea could adapt to a net zero-carbon future. \u201cThe appetite exists for the North Sea energy industry to play a significant role in the transition: investor sentiment is rapidly becoming more committed to low carbon technologies while smaller exploration and production companies are looking at ways to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations. All of this creates an opportunity for the North Sea to lead the way in the energy transition,\u201d Stevenson said. The report comes after the government\u2019s climate watchdog warned over the summer that the North Sea would need to embrace technology, such as carbon capture, to earn a role in the UK\u2019s low-carbon future. Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, told the Guardian following its climate progress report in July that the North Sea industry must make sure that it is part of the UK\u2019s net-zero carbon story. \u201cIt would, of course, be an easier task to simply say that we shouldn\u2019t bring oil and gas out of the ground but we know that there will potentially be some uses for those hydrocarbons, in particular for the production of things like hydrogen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key test for whether that can ever be a part of the future scenario is whether the sector itself is supportive of carbon capture and storage and whether the resources in the North Sea are used in an effective net-zero way. If there was ever a point for the industry to feel challenged, it\u2019s now,\u201d he added.",

The Institute for Public Policy Research said Whitehall was failing to maximise the impact of its financial clout despite a procurement budget worth 14% of the economy\u2019s annual output and 36% of total government spending. All the main parties in the general election are proposing to boost spending on public infrastructure projects, such as railways, hospitals and schools, and the IPPR said the standards used to decide which companies won contracts could have a powerful effect in supporting and encouraging good behaviour among businesses. Labour has made clear it will toughen up public procurement rules. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said in a speech that his party would \u201cmove towards a 20:1 pay ratio between lowest and highest paid employees in companies bidding for public sector contracts\u201d. The IPPR\u2019s report says changes needed to be made to the 2012 Social Value Act, which obliges all public bodies to take account of the economic, social and environmental implications of state spending. The thinktank said the 2012 act required public bodies look beyond a crude \u201clowest cost\u201d measure of their decisions and consider the wider value, including boosting local job opportunities and supply chains, raising standards at work, increasing skills and creating opportunities for vulnerable people. But the IPPR said the act only influenced 9% of government procurement spending because it was narrowly focused on the provision of services. It called for the legislation to be strengthened and broadened by: Extending its scope from services to include the procurement of goods and contracts relating to construction and engineering. Requiring public bodies to \u201caccount for\u201d rather than simply \u201cconsider\u201d social value, forcing them to state publicly the additional social benefit they have delivered. Applying it to all contracts but with a lesser expectation depending on the scale. Luke Murphy, the IPPR\u2019s associate director for the energy, climate, housing and infrastructure team, said: \u201cThe public want to see businesses act not just in the interest of short-term profit but for the long-term good of the economy and society. Every year, the public sector spends hundreds of billions of pounds procuring goods and services from the private sector; it can only be right that public money is used to drive better outcomes for us all whether it be boosting local job opportunities or raising standards at work.\u201d The IPPR said it had examined the application of social value within housing as a particular case study. While recognising that there had been \u201cwelcome\u201d progress, it said there was room for improvement. There was a case, the thinktank said, for clearer and more consistent approaches to measuring social value, with less importance given to precise cash figures for any benefits, with other yardsticks also used.

Serious and careful, the episode feels almost like a standalone piece. It leans heavily into the Queen\u2019s delay in visiting the village, her absence from the funeral, and subsequent change of heart. The story is imbued with hindsight \u2013 you can\u2019t watch it and not be reminded of the Queen\u2019s reluctance to return to London after Diana\u2019s death 31 years later, and how that delay reverberated through British culture and changed so much. But the outfit worn by Olivia Colman is an exact replica of what the Queen wore in 1966: the side-buttoning red coat with a fur trim to pick out the matching hat; the darker brown leather gloves; the handbag.

The cult fashion designer Alessandra Rich, a favourite of everyone from Kate Moss to the Duchess of Cambridge, cites Princess Margaret as one of her muses.

The series\u2019 very first shot of her shows a hefty diamond bracelet as a naked arm stretches out of tangled sheets to answer a ringing phone. The second sees her in a floaty, kaftan-style robe, marching across cobbled streets to pick a fight with her beloved. Diamonds, kaftans and lovers\u2019 tiffs: this is as Taylor as it gets. Where Vanessa Kirby\u2019s younger Margaret was delicate and damaged, Bonham Carter brings a Burton-esque exaggeration. She is always either roaring with laughter, the pearls at her throat catching the light as she throws back her head, or she is face-down in a two-day hangover. Her wardobe, like the Queen\u2019s, is in many instances a carbon copy of real life \u2013 for instance, her pink suit at Prince Charles\u2019s investiture is reproduced, along with the matching outsize pink hair bow which, as it happens, is very on trend for this season. But elsewhere, her looks \u2013 sunglasses, cigarette holders, winged eyeliner, a startling pair of floral-printed stilettos, off-the-shoulder dresses that recall Taylor in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049261/\" title=\"\">Giant</a> \u2013 are every inch the movie-star princess.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b48b005827274413bdadb43fd10049c3b1ecfcd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b48b005827274413bdadb43fd10049c3b1ecfcd1/0_550_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Queen with Prince Philip in The Crown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Queen with Prince Philip in The Crown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/Courtesy of Des Willie/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The contrast with her older sister the Queen is exaggerated for comic visual effect: after Margaret has begun her day in diamonds and a kaftan, with a fag and a row, we see the Queen at her breakfast table in a skirt suit, taking her bottled-up emotions out on the butter knife as it rasps a tiny sliver of marmalade across crustless toast. She draws attention to her pearls not when she throws her head back in laughter, but when she clutches her hands to them anxiously, rolling them across her clavicles like worry beads.</p> <p>There are echoes in this show with the other programme everyone watched on television recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/10/breath-of-fresh-heir-how-succession-became-the-must-watch-tv-of-the-year\" title=\"\">Succession</a>. The Rolls-Royce Phantom has swapped in for the yacht, the Bakelite phone in a white gloved hand for the constantly pinging email, but there are the same dysfunctionalities and similarly ludicrous real estate. The Crown exercises artistic licence to make the characters more glamorous, more often than it does to make them more sympathetic, because \u2013 as in Succession \u2013 it is the character flaws that drive the story. The clothes are there to win our votes, even when the characters don\u2019t deserve them. As Harold Wilson says to the Queen, early in this series: \u201cEverything is political.\u201d And some things really don\u2019t change.</p>",

Her wardobe, like the Queen\u2019s, is in many instances a carbon copy of real life \u2013 for instance, her pink suit at Prince Charles\u2019s investiture is reproduced, along with the matching outsize pink hair bow which, as it happens, is very on trend for this season. But elsewhere, her looks \u2013 sunglasses, cigarette holders, winged eyeliner, a startling pair of floral-printed stilettos, off-the-shoulder dresses that recall Taylor in Giant \u2013 are every inch the movie-star princess. The contrast with her older sister the Queen is exaggerated for comic visual effect: after Margaret has begun her day in diamonds and a kaftan, with a fag and a row, we see the Queen at her breakfast table in a skirt suit, taking her bottled-up emotions out on the butter knife as it rasps a tiny sliver of marmalade across crustless toast. She draws attention to her pearls not when she throws her head back in laughter, but when she clutches her hands to them anxiously, rolling them across her clavicles like worry beads. There are echoes in this show with the other programme everyone watched on television recently, Succession. The Rolls-Royce Phantom has swapped in for the yacht, the Bakelite phone in a white gloved hand for the constantly pinging email, but there are the same dysfunctionalities and similarly ludicrous real estate. The Crown exercises artistic licence to make the characters more glamorous, more often than it does to make them more sympathetic, because \u2013 as in Succession \u2013 it is the character flaws that drive the story. The clothes are there to win our votes, even when the characters don\u2019t deserve them. As Harold Wilson says to the Queen, early in this series: \u201cEverything is political.\u201d And some things really don\u2019t change.",

      "body": "<p>During his brief tenure as prime minister, Boris Johnson has flaunted his disregard for the tenets of Tory traditionalism. In an eventful few months, he has misled the monarchy and belittled the judiciary. But the bigger surprise has been his indifference to Conservative unionism. While Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategy faltered partly because she believed in the inviolability of the United Kingdom, Johnson seems relatively relaxed about the prospect of his party surrendering nearly all its seats in Scotland \u2013 and, in theory at least, about sacrificing some of Northern Ireland\u2019s statutory Britishness if it will smooth the passage of a Brexit deal.</p> <p>All of this suggests that Johnson\u2019s vision for government, if it can be called that, is a specifically English one. There is underlying logic here. With Scottish independence and Irish reunification now looming somewhere in the middle distance, it makes sense for Johnson to view unionism as a hopeless cause, and to think about ways of governing England after the United Kingdom crumbles.</p> <p>In fact, this narrowing of Tory strategy is the natural byproduct of an anxiety that has haunted 21st-century culture and politics. Precisely because England is such an ill-defined entity, there have been increasing worries since the millennium about what will be left when imperial \u201cGreat Britain\u201d finally gives up the ghost.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Having sacrificed its sense of self,  England renounced its entitlement, perhaps once and for all, to a coherent national identity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One result has been a sometimes neurotic obsession with defining English identity. While politicians on the left and centre have scrambled to mimic the right\u2019s emphasis on \u201cfamily, faith and the flag\u201d, Englishness has become a rallying point for liberals keen to rediscover a sense of patriotism \u2013 and, relatedly, a cloak of \u201cworking-class\u201d authenticity, as the critic Joe Kennedy argued in his 2018 polemic <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/authentocrats-9781912248179.html\" title=\"\">Authentocrats</a>. \u201cEnglishness is found,\u201d Kennedy writes, \u201cin the way national identity has in recent years been aestheticised and made tasteful by a middle-class, basically middlebrow culture.\u201d</p> <p>Hence the many broadsheet articles about the need to forge a Positive English Identity, a publishing vogue for books that make plain \u201cwhat it means to be English\u201d, and cultural specimens like Jeremy Deller\u2019s art exhibition <a href=\"https://www.jeremydeller.org/EnglishMagic/EnglishMagic_Video.php\" title=\"\">English Magic</a> and Jez Butterworth\u2019s hit play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/26/jerusalem-review-jez-butterworth-rooster-byron-watermill-newbury\" title=\"\">Jerusalem</a>, both of which hinted at the possibility of a new English folk culture.</p> <p>As these last examples underline, there are interesting things to be said about Englishness. But the quest for an authentic national culture is in one sense a form of compensation for the elusiveness of the English nation state.

      "bodyText": "During his brief tenure as prime minister, Boris Johnson has flaunted his disregard for the tenets of Tory traditionalism. In an eventful few months, he has misled the monarchy and belittled the judiciary. But the bigger surprise has been his indifference to Conservative unionism. While Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategy faltered partly because she believed in the inviolability of the United Kingdom, Johnson seems relatively relaxed about the prospect of his party surrendering nearly all its seats in Scotland \u2013 and, in theory at least, about sacrificing some of Northern Ireland\u2019s statutory Britishness if it will smooth the passage of a Brexit deal. All of this suggests that Johnson\u2019s vision for government, if it can be called that, is a specifically English one. There is underlying logic here. With Scottish independence and Irish reunification now looming somewhere in the middle distance, it makes sense for Johnson to view unionism as a hopeless cause, and to think about ways of governing England after the United Kingdom crumbles. In fact, this narrowing of Tory strategy is the natural byproduct of an anxiety that has haunted 21st-century culture and politics. Precisely because England is such an ill-defined entity, there have been increasing worries since the millennium about what will be left when imperial \u201cGreat Britain\u201d finally gives up the ghost. One result has been a sometimes neurotic obsession with defining English identity. While politicians on the left and centre have scrambled to mimic the right\u2019s emphasis on \u201cfamily, faith and the flag\u201d, Englishness has become a rallying point for liberals keen to rediscover a sense of patriotism \u2013 and, relatedly, a cloak of \u201cworking-class\u201d authenticity, as the critic Joe Kennedy argued in his 2018 polemic Authentocrats. \u201cEnglishness is found,\u201d Kennedy writes, \u201cin the way national identity has in recent years been aestheticised and made tasteful by a middle-class, basically middlebrow culture.\u201d Hence the many broadsheet articles about the need to forge a Positive English Identity, a publishing vogue for books that make plain \u201cwhat it means to be English\u201d, and cultural specimens like Jeremy Deller\u2019s art exhibition English Magic and Jez Butterworth\u2019s hit play Jerusalem, both of which hinted at the possibility of a new English folk culture. As these last examples underline, there are interesting things to be said about Englishness. But the quest for an authentic national culture is in one sense a form of compensation for the elusiveness of the English nation state. For a host of historical and political reasons \u2013 largely the fact that the British empire was an amorphous entity based on transnational trade and government \u2013 England simply does not have a strong enough cultural imaginary to meaningfully define itself in the globalised, precarious 21st century. Having sacrificed its sense of self \u2013 first, to the surrounding nations of the British Isles, and then to the wider empire \u2013 England renounced its entitlement, perhaps once and for all, to a coherent national identity. For some, the very nebulousness of Englishness highlights the need to empower England and its citizens. While Conservatives lean toward rejecting unionism in favour of a more limited nationalist strategy, soft-left figures, such as the openDemocracy co-founder Anthony Barnett, have argued persuasively for a more enlightened English revival. For Barnett, the only way to halt the rise of rightwing nationalism is to steal its thunder: by redirecting English identity towards progressive ends, and establishing a new English parliament to parallel Scottish, Welsh and Irish forms of self-government. But if the UK continues down the path to its own dissolution, we should have the courage to imagine far more radical ways of restructuring these islands than an automatic reboot of the four medieval nationalisms. While there are convincing arguments for greater Scottish, Irish and Welsh autonomy, the so-called problem of England is too complex to be solved by way of an \u201cEnglish assembly\u201d resembling the devolved governments in the peripheral nations. Even aside from the hollowness of the whole notion of Englishness (try telling a call-centre worker in Newcastle and a stockbroker in Surrey that \u201cEnglish identity\u201d is what unites them), the most profound divide on the islands is not the separation between nations. Rather, it is the huge disparity between the global mega-city of London with its south-eastern hinterland, and almost all other parts of the British Isles. The only way to counteract the geographical inequalities of the London-dominated capitalist state is by building up the English regions \u2013 not continuing the quest for an artificial, unitary Englishness. A revival of the post-millennium movement for regional devolution \u2013 on hold since a Dominic Cummings-assisted campaign defeated the yes vote in the 2004 north-east England devolution referendum \u2013 would be a very good starting point. But, alongside the regionalist cause, we should also explore ways of connecting the English regions and the non-English nations, so that the boundary lines of our imagined national communities are transcended rather than reinforced. There are many practical ways this project might be embarked on. Extending high-speed rail systems such as the putative northern powerhouse rail scheme, so that northern and western cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle are brought closer to Scottish areas, would be one way to foster the development of an alternative economic sphere to London and the south-east.

Along with the diplomat Kurt Volker and the energy secretary, Rick Perry, Sondland \u2013 a wealthy hotelier who donated $1m to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee \u2013 was one of the so-called \u201cthree amigos\u201d the Trump administration used to bypass normal state department channels to Ukraine. He has already changed his closed-door testimony to admit he told an aide to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that military aid would not be released until Kyiv announced an investigation into a gas company linked to the son of the former vice-president Joe Biden, a potential challenger to Trump in next year\u2019s election. But even the revised statement failed to report that Sondland called Trump from a restaurant in Kyiv on 26 July and discussed \u201cinvestigations\u201d. The president was speaking loudly and the call was overheard by David Holmes, a political counsellor at the US embassy in Ukraine, according to testimony released this week.

      "bodyText": "Attorney general Christian Porter has called for digital platforms, including social media giants, to be treated like other publishers to create a fair media playing field. Although the comments on Wednesday were made in the context of defamation law reform, the sweeping statement has broad implications for social media companies\u2019 future legal liability and the Coalition\u2019s response to the digital platforms review. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission report, released in July and still awaiting a full government response, called for much broader regulation of social media including transparency on ad algorithms, greater control by users of their data, and codes of conduct on revenue sharing and handling of misinformation on the platforms. In a wide-ranging outing at the National Press Club, Porter also signalled the government will shortly announce stronger whistleblower laws, confirmed it would allow religious service providers to refuse to hire staff on the grounds of religion, and agreed to lift the threshold for union deregistration in its Ensuring Integrity bill. Porter said on 29 November he and his New South Wales counterpart will push for immediate release of new draft model defamation provisions at the council of attorneys general. Porter said there are areas where it is \u201cclear that sensible reform is required\u201d including introduction of a serious harm threshold for defamation, clarifying that caps on damages for non-economic loss apply regardless of aggravated circumstances and the creation of a broader defence for responsible communications on matters of public interest. Porter said the \u201coverwhelming bulk of proposals for reform\u201d could be dealt with by July 2020, but the council will also consider \u201ca proposal for stage two reform\u201d in terms of \u201cwhether and how to treat online platforms as publishers\u201d. \u201cMy own view is that these online platforms should be held to essentially the same standards as other publishers but that how this should occur requires a sensible measured approach to reform taking into account the differences in the volume of material hosted between Twitter or Facebook and a traditional newspaper for instance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what is clear is the playing field is not at all fair at the moment. \u201cAfter the very curious decision in Voller v Nationwide News &amp; Ors which held that the respective media companies (not Facebook) were, for the purposes of defamation law, the \u2018publishers\u2019 of third party comments posted to their public Facebook pages \u2013 it is clear that to have a level playing field between online publishers such as Facebook and Twitter and traditional media publishers reform in this area is very necessary.\u201d On whistleblowers, Porter said that the 2016 Moss review provides a \u201cstrong blueprint for reform\u201d.

Porter said the government will soon release its response but \u201cthis reform process will also go further than the Moss recommendations; to ensure that the essential and overall drafting and structure of the Act is easily and readily understandable to the people who need to use it\u201d. On Wednesday Pauline Hanson called on the Coalition to immediately release proposed amendments to the Ensuring Integrity bill, which include a demerit point system negotiated with Centre Alliance so first-strike offences cannot trigger deregistration of unions or disqualification of their officials. \u201cI won\u2019t stand for union bashing and therefore I won\u2019t support the deregistration of organisations for misdemeanour offences like late paperwork submissions,\u201d Hanson said in a statement. \u201cI have however forewarned union bosses that bullying and thuggery must be stamped out in accordance with public expectations.\u201d The intervention creates difficulty for Porter, who still needs the votes of either One Nation or Jacqui Lambie to pass the bill even with Centre Alliance support. At the Press Club, Porter committed to release the amendments and said he expected there to be \u201cgeneral agreement\u201d. \u201cI might also note, with respect to Jacqui Lambie \u2013 she\u2019s on the public record saying unequivocally that, if Mr [John] Setka was still in the union movement, she\u2019d be supporting the bill.

There is no time to waste.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Nicholas Stern, at the London School of Economics, said: \u201cThis important report shows planned levels of coal, oil and gas production are dangerously out of step with the goals of the Paris agreement.\u201d</p> \n<p>The report highlights the nations that are taking some action, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/spain-to-close-most-coal-mines-after-striking-250m-deal\">closure of most coal mines in Spain</a> and some in China, along with the end of new offshore oil and gas exploration licences in New Zealand and some parts of the Arctic governed by Canada, the US and Norway.</p> \n<p>Verkuijl said a global agreement to phase out production would be ideal but is difficult at present with the US under President Donald Trump, as the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/04/donald-trump-climate-crisis-exit-paris-agreement\">is due to withdraw from the Paris agreement</a>. But she said many Democratic presidential candidates have promised to cut fossil fuel production by restricting extraction on public land, for example, or removing subsidies. She said such a candidate beating Trump in the 2020 election would be a \u201cgamechanger\u201d.</p> \n<p>The report said it was crucial that workers in fossil fuel industries were helped into new employment as production ramped down. \u201cLeaders need to [talk with] workers and their unions to plan a just transition away from fossil fuels,\u201d said Sharan Burrow, head of the International Trade Union Confederation.</p> \n<p>The analysis is based on the published national plans of eight key producers: Australia, Canada, Russia, US, China, India, Indonesia and Norway, which account for 60% of global fossil fuel production. The plans of other big producers, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, are not publicly available. The researchers assumed these and other producers would maintain a similar share of global production to today at around 40%.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2019 to clarify the description of the methodology. The researchers did not assume that producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran would follow \u201csimilar paths\u201d as the eight countries that were covered, but that those producers would maintain a similar share of global production as the eight countries that were covered.</p>",

There is no time to waste.\u201d Prof Nicholas Stern, at the London School of Economics, said: \u201cThis important report shows planned levels of coal, oil and gas production are dangerously out of step with the goals of the Paris agreement.\u201d The report highlights the nations that are taking some action, including the closure of most coal mines in Spain and some in China, along with the end of new offshore oil and gas exploration licences in New Zealand and some parts of the Arctic governed by Canada, the US and Norway. Verkuijl said a global agreement to phase out production would be ideal but is difficult at present with the US under President Donald Trump, as the country is due to withdraw from the Paris agreement. But she said many Democratic presidential candidates have promised to cut fossil fuel production by restricting extraction on public land, for example, or removing subsidies. She said such a candidate beating Trump in the 2020 election would be a \u201cgamechanger\u201d. The report said it was crucial that workers in fossil fuel industries were helped into new employment as production ramped down. \u201cLeaders need to [talk with] workers and their unions to plan a just transition away from fossil fuels,\u201d said Sharan Burrow, head of the International Trade Union Confederation. The analysis is based on the published national plans of eight key producers: Australia, Canada, Russia, US, China, India, Indonesia and Norway, which account for 60% of global fossil fuel production. The plans of other big producers, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, are not publicly available. The researchers assumed these and other producers would maintain a similar share of global production to today at around 40%. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2019 to clarify the description of the methodology. The researchers did not assume that producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran would follow \u201csimilar paths\u201d as the eight countries that were covered, but that those producers would maintain a similar share of global production as the eight countries that were covered.",

Coming from a Scottish-Pakistani background, self-deprecation is super in-built.\u201d Saleem thinks that because comedians are \u201cconstantly bleeding themselves dry, mining their lives for those really human moments\u201d, you probably know them better than you might think.</p> <p>Liam Williams started out doing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/10/liam-williams-review-edinburgh-festival-2014-capitalism\">very personal standup shows</a> \u2013 discussing his childhood, break-ups, sex life and depression.

He was being himself but he didn\u2019t enjoy it. \u201cThere\u2019s a maxim \u2013 write what you know \u2013 but through experience I found out that doing standup about what you know can be a bit unpleasant,\u201d he says.</p> <p>During the same period, Williams was also performing sketch comedy as one third of the group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/10/sheeps-live-and-loud-selfie-sex-harry-potter-review-sorrowful-surreal-utterly-sublime\">Sheeps</a>. He and fellow members Al Roberts and Daran Johnson settled into distinct on-stage personas. This was more comfortable: being a character called Liam, but \u201ca massively heightened version of me\u201d, Williams says. The Liam in Sheeps is \u201cgenerally quite gruff, scruffy and idealistic\u201d he says. \u201cWe just picked two traits that we each have and exaggerated them to the hilt. So maybe the last few years of stuff I\u2019ve been doing have been different versions of that.\u201d</p> <p>Williams\u2019 TV series Ladhood, based on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b098sdt6\">his Radio 4 show of the same name</a>, is a fictionalised account of his teenage years in West Yorkshire. But in other shows, too, Williams has almost exclusively played characters called Liam.

In the web comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/08/2016-year-friends-surreal-monthly-web-only-series\">Year Friends</a>, he and comedians Ellie White, Natasia and Jamie Demetriou, plus Roberts and Johnson, all play surreal versions of themselves. (Admittedly, the Liam we meet in Brexit satire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/05/capital-liam-williams-satire-the-thick-of-it-podcast\">Capital</a>, a zealous capital punishment advocate who scorns the metropolitan elite, does seem a few steps further removed from the real Williams.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cd59ea70241e4173d883a951178349e762ee25c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cd59ea70241e4173d883a951178349e762ee25c/154_0_4129_2479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liam Williams with Tim Key in vlogger comedy Pls Like.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Massively heightened\u2019: Liam Williams with Tim Key in vlogger comedy Pls Like.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Shiny Button Productions Limited/LBP-TV 2 Limited</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a mask, a version of yourself that you have an affinity with, but also it\u2019s distant enough that it can do things you\u2019d never do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou feel enough connection with it that it feels real and interesting, but it\u2019s far enough removed from your personal life that it\u2019s not too uncomfortable, it\u2019s not too revealing.\u201d</p> <p>By magnifying character quirks and escalating situations, much like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jun/26/larry-david-interview\">Larry David</a> and co have done before him, Williams found he could more easily place his fictional Liams in hilarious situations. \u201cOften truth and reality is quite boring,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the stuff that we don\u2019t actually dare [do] \u2013 imagine if things were this awkward or imagine if a person was this selfish \u2013 when it gets comedically interesting. With Pls Like, that\u2019s when it was the most funny to me. It was this persona that\u2019s based on me as a miserable misanthropic comedian, but now he\u2019s meeting a beauty vlogger and now he\u2019s doing an exercise regime.

The recommendations follow stark warnings last month from the independent commission against corruption\u2019s chief commissioner, Peter Hall, who said a looming funding shortfall of $4m would have a \u201cimmediate and serious\u201d effect on its ability to fight corruption. Hall proposed a special funding model for Icac, which guaranteed its independence and transparency and prevented it being left at the mercy of the government of the day. \u201cSomething must be done. It must be done quickly,\u201d Hall said in evidence to NSW parliament\u2019s committee on Icac. \u201cIf the commission\u2019s funding under the persuasion or influence of the executive of government, or for any other reason, is reduced or constrained, that of course would inflict considerable damage to the commission\u2019s ability to function.\u201d On Wednesday the Icac committee released its report and agreed with Hall\u2019s proposal. The committee \u2013 which has six Liberal and National MPs, three Labor, one Green and one One Nation \u2013 recommended the government \u201cinvestigates a new independent funding model for the Icac in the current budget cycle\u201d. \u201cAny model chosen should ensure that the Icac is sufficiently funded to continue its core work, provisions for CPI and wage rises, and factors in the fluctuating nature of operational costs,\u201d it said. It also recommended that government \u201cconsider a funding process for the Icac which is separate from the process that applies to other government or independent agencies\u201d. The recommendations for an independent funding model were welcomed by the Greens committee member, Jamie Parker. But he said it appeared to be at odds with the government\u2019s recent decision to refer Icac funding to the auditor-general. \u201cThe Icac doesn\u2019t need auditing, it needs funding,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chief commissioner has told the premier very clearly that in order for the Icac to do its job properly, their whole funding model needs to change. \u201cIcac\u2019s budget needs to increase and should be controlled completely independent of the government of the day.\u201d",

Constitutional uncertainty freezes out all other issues.</p> <p>The Narnia analogy has limits. Davidson, for instance, speaks warmly about his Irishness. He cheers the all-Ireland rugby team and enjoys visiting the Republic of Ireland. \u201cNo hangups whatsoever. People cross the border easily \u2013 Dublin, Donegal for a weekend. I\u2019m as proud to be Irish as I am to be part of the UK. You can\u2019t deny it, you are what you are.\u201d</p> <p>A sense of Britishness, however, trumps everything. It contributed to Davidson\u2019s vote to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. There was too much Euro-meddling, too many immigrants, he says.</p> <p>Davidson \u2013 who wants to secure Brexit and the union \u2013 will vote for the Democratic Unionist Party\u2019s Gavin Robinson who is hoping to be re-elected.

Even worse than Johnson\u2019s \u201cbackstab\u201d deal would be Jeremy Corbyn winning the election and allying with Republicans, he says.</p> <p>Brexit, in other words, has become a trap. Jim blames a pan-nationalist conspiracy, Tory duplicity and ungrateful English, Welsh and Scottish people who, according to an opinion poll this week, are <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/11/11/four-ten-mainland-britons-dont-care-about-northern\">willing to lose Northern Ireland</a> in order to obtain their preferred Brexit outcome. \u201cWe\u2019re only British when they need us,\u201d says Jim.</p> <p>He has no great ardour for the DUP but hopes the party will return to Westminster in force to sort out the mess.</p> <p>Interviews with loyalists aged from 18 to 80 yield recurring views: the DUP bungled Brexit and its opposition to marriage equality and abortion rights is \u201cdaft\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d but the party remains the union\u2019s best guarantor.

      "bodyText": "The Newtownards Road that connects east Belfast to the city centre is a rather nondescript artery of houses, shops and offices until you come to CS Lewis Square. Named after The Chronicles of Narnia author who grew up nearby, the square has bronze sculptures featuring characters from his story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, with the latter a portal to a realm frozen in a hundred-year winter. Beyond the square, heading into town, the road changes. Union flags sprout from lampposts and large murals adorn walls. Some celebrate George Best and the workers who built the Titanic at the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard. Others depict first world war soldiers. Most commemorate the Troubles and feature images of people murdered by the IRA, as well as the loyalist paramilitaries who purported to avenge them. A new one, on Belvoir Street, shows two Ulster Volunteer Force figures with balaclavas and rifles flanking an exhortation, or threat: \u201cThe prevention of the erosion of our identity is now our priority.\u201d The mural appeared in recent days but the sentiment harks back to Northern Ireland\u2019s foundation in 1922 as a state for people who wanted to remain British, a resolution frozen in place a century later. \u201cYou always get that impression, every election, that your heritage, your country, is under threat,\u201d says John Davidson, 77, a former shipyard welder who has served for 50 years as treasurer of the Harland &amp; Wolff Welders football and social club. For working-class loyalists, the 12 December vote will be no different, he says. \u201cThey have one eye on Brexit because they want to stay in the union. At the minute, none of us know exactly how it is going to pan out.\u201d Northern Ireland has pressing problems. The power-sharing assembly at Stormont is defunct, leaving a political vacuum. Health services are in crisis, with doctors scaling back hours and nurses voting to strike. Untreated mental health problems have produced high suicide rates. Yet Davidson and others in the East Belfast constituency interviewed for this article agree the election is about Brexit and by extension Northern Ireland\u2019s position in the UK. Constitutional uncertainty freezes out all other issues. The Narnia analogy has limits. Davidson, for instance, speaks warmly about his Irishness. He cheers the all-Ireland rugby team and enjoys visiting the Republic of Ireland. \u201cNo hangups whatsoever. People cross the border easily \u2013 Dublin, Donegal for a weekend. I\u2019m as proud to be Irish as I am to be part of the UK. You can\u2019t deny it, you are what you are.\u201d A sense of Britishness, however, trumps everything. It contributed to Davidson\u2019s vote to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. There was too much Euro-meddling, too many immigrants, he says. Davidson \u2013 who wants to secure Brexit and the union \u2013 will vote for the Democratic Unionist Party\u2019s Gavin Robinson who is hoping to be re-elected. The DUP supported Brexit but vehemently rejects Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, saying it will weaken the union by creating a border down the Irish Sea. Davidson shrugs off any contradictions. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist.\u201d Others here share the bleakness of a new poster up the road that is already peeling in the chill wind: \u201cResist the betrayal act,\u201d it says, over an image of the prime minister. \u201cUlster says no to an economic united Ireland.\u201d Jim, a loyalist in his 60s who withholds his surname, grimaces at mention of the deal. \u201cPeople here won\u2019t stand for it. There\u2019ll be riots.\u201d The former labourer does not want to cancel Brexit, saying that would be a win for Sinn F\u00e9in and the IRA. Even worse than Johnson\u2019s \u201cbackstab\u201d deal would be Jeremy Corbyn winning the election and allying with Republicans, he says. Brexit, in other words, has become a trap. Jim blames a pan-nationalist conspiracy, Tory duplicity and ungrateful English, Welsh and Scottish people who, according to an opinion poll this week, are willing to lose Northern Ireland in order to obtain their preferred Brexit outcome. \u201cWe\u2019re only British when they need us,\u201d says Jim. He has no great ardour for the DUP but hopes the party will return to Westminster in force to sort out the mess. Interviews with loyalists aged from 18 to 80 yield recurring views: the DUP bungled Brexit and its opposition to marriage equality and abortion rights is \u201cdaft\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d but the party remains the union\u2019s best guarantor. A front page headline in the Purple Standard, a loyalist magazine, boiled it all down: \u201cIt\u2019s the constitution, stupid!\u201d On the other side of CS Lewis Square, heading east away from the city centre, flags and murals vanish and the houses grow bigger and fancier. This is the realm of East Belfast\u2019s \u201csoft\u201d unionists and non-aligned voters. Many voted remain. * * * A callout to Guardian readers elicited dozens of responses from Ballyhackamore, Belmont and other suburbs. They expressed concern about health services, schooling, the environment, paramilitary activity and the lack of devolved government but regarded Brexit polarisation as a key election issue. \u201cBrexit has opened Pandora\u2019s Box re: Good Friday agreement and the union,\u201d said a school governor. A 50-year-old architect wrote: \u201cAttitudes have hardened \u2013 the two communities are split by the sectarian divide.\u201d Both, like most respondents, requested anonymity, reflecting skittishness about speaking out. Naomi Long, the leader of the cross-community Alliance party, is running in East Belfast. In an interview at her home Long says Brexit has fanned debate about a united Ireland. \u201cYou have a real challenge to the integrity of the UK.\u201d The tone is rueful, exasperated. Long, 47, advocates a liberal, non-sectarian Northern Ireland that remains in the EU. She accuses the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in of channelling Brexit into traditional tribalism. \u201cI\u2019m not at all surprised it\u2019s become an Orange/Green tussle. It so binary. It\u2019s a very difficult time to feel hopeful in politics.\u201d Long was MP for East Belfast from 2010-15. She lost the seat to Robinson, who did not respond to interview requests, after loyalists accused the Alliance party of backing Republicans in a dispute over flags. Long\u2019s uphill attempt to wrest back the seat will test Alliance\u2019s viability as a third force. The middle ground of \u201cneithers\u201d is surprisingly populous \u2013 50% of people identify as being neither unionist nor nationalist \u2013 but in elections most back unionist or nationalist parties. That may be changing. In May\u2019s European elections Alliance and other non-aligned parties took 21% of the vote, their highest share since the 1960s. Long was elected an MEP, taking a seat traditionally held by the Ulster Unionist party (UUP). Alliance is shunning electoral pacts but under a pro-remain banner Sinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP and Greens are standing aside in East Belfast to help Long. That may backfire. Many view pro-remain pacts here and and in other constituencies as a thinly veiled pan-nationalist accord, one mirrored in North Belfast where the UUP is standing aside to help the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds. Robert McCourt, 66, an Alliance supporter, fears Northern Ireland is adrift. \u201cIt would be nice to have hope but then you see the antics of the DUP \u2013 they defended the referendum when people here voted to stay in Europe,\u201d he said. McCourt comes from a protestant background and was in the same class as Sammy Wilson, the DUP MP and Brexit spokesman. McCourt took a different path, becoming a chartered engineer, working abroad and embracing Irishness more than Britishness. Though a remainer, and no fan of Johnson, McCourt considers the prime minister\u2019s deal economically sensible, echoing many business owners who fear the alternative is a no-deal Brexit. \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful, the way to go,\u201d he says. McCourt likes to think \u201cdinosaurs\u201d such as him will make way for a new generation that will reinvent Northern Ireland. But he worries Brexit is poking at the Troubles\u2019 tangled legacy. \u201cThe wounds are still there. It wouldn\u2019t take much to open them up again.\u201d His French Canadian wife Delphine, 44, agrees. \u201cHere you sense there is still a lot of anger and sadness. If this place could only put aside its divisions \u2013 the people are powerhouses.\u201d The couple plan one day to board their boat, an 11-metre cutter, and sail away for good to somewhere south, somewhere warm.",

      "bodyText": "Two Australian universities have severed ties with a business mentoring charity founded by Prince Andrew after the royal\u2019s train-wreck interview about his links to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The Pitch@Palace program \u2013 founded by the prince in 2014 \u2013 supports entrepreneurs and start-up companies and gives them the opportunity to pitch their idea to business leaders at places including Buckingham Palace. The Australian branch, Pitch@Palace Australia, held its annual pitching contest on 4 October, at Government House in Perth, hosted by Prince Andrew himself. Pitch@Palace Australia lists four universities as \u201chost partners\u201d, but Melbourne\u2019s RMIT University and Bond University in Queensland have now formally ended their association. Another, the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, said it would be reviewing their relationship. The fourth \u201chost partner\u201d, Murdoch University in Western Australia, has been contacted for comment. Over the past few days, multiple corporate partners have also deserted the charity \u2013 including Standard Chartered, Aon and KPMG. On Saturday night, the Duke of York gave a much-derided interview to the BBC where he denied accusations of sexual assault and defended his links to the financier and convicted child sex offender Epstein. In response to allegations from Virginia Giuffre (formerly Roberts) that she was trafficked to the duke and had sex with him when she was 17, Prince Andrew claimed he was at home after a pizza party. The duke also said he regretted staying at Epstein\u2019s house, but thought it was the \u201chonourable and right\u201d thing to do, and a \u201cconvenient place to stay\u201d at the time. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Bond University confirmed that its involvement with the charity would end \u201cin light of recent events\u201d. \u201cOur current agreement with Pitch@Palace Australia finished this year,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have previously said any new agreement would be considered in 2020. \u201cHowever, in light of recent events, the university does not intend to seek any further involvement.\u201d A spokesman for RMIT said its involvement in Pitch@Palace \u201cconcluded in October 2019\u201d. \u201cWe remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring RMIT is a safe and inclusive place to work and study.\u201d The University of Wollongong said it was \u201ccurrently undertaking an annual review of its future involvement in Pitch@Palace\u201d. \u201cThe university remains committed to supporting entrepreneurship and small business in Australia, and its assessment will include consideration of whether Pitch@Palace remains an effective avenue to deliver that support. \u201cThe university will reach a considered decision about its future involvement with Pitch@Palace based on the university\u2019s strategic objectives, institutional values and the program\u2019s potential for success.\u201d Pitch@Palace was founded in 2014 to \u201cprovide a platform to amplify and accelerate the work of entrepreneurs\u201d, according to its website. An Australian version began in 2017, and the third instalment (Pitch@Palace Australia 3.0) took place in October. According to the website, 42 entrepreneurs took part this year, pitching to \u201can influential audience of potential supporters, including CEOs, influencers, mentors and business partners\u201d. Three winners were invited to the global event, held in St James\u2019s Palace in London. The global program claims to have generated more than \u00a31.3bn ($2.46bn) in global economic activity across 64 countries.",

      "bodyText": "The defence has finished laying out its case in the Grace Millane murder trial, putting forward an expert in modern sexual practices who told the court BDSM has become more mainstream and socially acceptable. The 27-year-old man accused of murdering the British backpacker, whose name is suppressed, has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say Millane, 21, was strangled to death by accident during consensual sex. The prosecution say she was murdered. In the second and final day of defence arguments, Professor Clarissa Smith, from the University of Sunderland in the UK, gave evidence to Auckland high court via video link. She told the court that the BDSM sub-culture was generally not one of aggression and that practices were designed to be mutually pleasurable. \u201cTo people on the outside these things may not look interesting or pleasant, but for those on the inside it certainly is. That\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for.\u201d Although there was a lack of robust data on what proportion of the population engaged in BDSM it was estimated about 25% of adults expressed some interest in one or more elements of it, and this rate was likely higher among young people, the jury heard. Smith said although consent and safe practice was paramount in BDSM, inexperienced people might not always know where to access the best information \u2013 and alcohol, drugs or passion could get in the way. \u201cSometimes the desire for something will override one\u2019s sensible head.

The court has previously heard Millane had accounts on websites and apps for those interested in BDSM. The defence called a British man who matched with Millane on BDSM websites in the past.

She\u2019s shivering!\u2019 \u2026 He was so kind and considerate and cared about me as a human being.\u201d Since Game of Thrones, she said, she has become \u201ca lot more savvy\u201d with what she\u2019s comfortable with, and with the level of nudity that\u2019s needed for a scene. \u201cI\u2019ve had fights on set before where I\u2019m like, \u2018No, the sheet stays up,\u2019 and they\u2019re like, \u2018You don\u2019t wanna disappoint your Game of Thrones fans.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Fuck you.\u2019 \u201d Representatives for HBO and Game Of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss have been contacted for comment.",

Aerial photography grants us the god-like experience of surveying an environment instantly, rather than within the limits of human sight lines. Helicopter or drone footage swoops us through built environments like an angel or superhero. We no longer identify with the \u201clittle people\u201d looking up but with the powerful people looking down. It\u2019s a forced perspective. We\u2019re still surveilled but this time, by the glowing lozenges we cradle in our palms, the ones that keep our heads bowed and shoulders aching. Progress is often framed as self-evidently virtuous, in contrast with conservative stasis. But in 1940, as the world consumed itself in war, despair gripped the German critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin. He imagined history through the gaze of a melancholy angel caught in widening gyres, impelled inexorably into the future while staring helplessly at the wreckage of the past. However, the Romantic philosophers, poets and artists understood the sublime subversion of looking up. During the rapidly industrialising 18th and 19th centuries, they sought profound thrills in primal experiences of nature. They reimagined the upward gaze as an escape into another dimension of feeling \u2013 away from the relentless forward momentum of modernity. Last Christmas is deeply corny, but it gets this. It\u2019s a Brexit movie. And for Tom, looking up is a defiant everyday act of agency: a magical reprieve from an anxious world whose heart cannot hold.",

      "bodyText": "Two witnesses in the impeachment inquiry have described their concern over an \u201cunusual\u201d call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president in July, in which Trump ignored official talking points about fighting corruption to instead \u201cdemand\u201d an investigation tied to Joe Biden. \u201cWhat I heard was inappropriate and I reported it,\u201d said Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine adviser on the National Security Council. \u201cI did so out of a sense of duty.\u201d Vindman and Jennifer Williams, a foreign policy adviser to the vice-president, Mike Pence, became the first public witnesses to offer a direct description of the 25 July call in which Trump asked Volodymyr Zelenskiy for a political \u201cfavor\u201d. \u201cIt was improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigation of a US citizen and a political opponent,\u201d Vindman said. In a further blow to Trump and his defenders, a witness requested by Republicans, the former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, said the investigations Trump requested of Zelenskiy were based on \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and that \u201cthe allegations against Vice-President Biden were self-serving and not credible\u201d. The House intelligence committee questioned the witnesses at the opening of a blockbuster week in which nine witnesses are expected to testify about the suspension last summer of US military aid for Ukraine and Trump administration attempts to get Zelenskiy to announce political investigations. Trump has said the request for investigations sprang from a desire to address corruption in Ukraine. That excuse was eroded badly on Tuesday, as Vindman testified that in the July phone call with Zelenskiy and an earlier call, Trump ignored talking points steering him to bring up anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. \u201cThe president can choose to use the talking points or not, he\u2019s the president,\u201d Vindman said. But what Trump spoke about instead on the second call \u2013 investigations of Biden and the gas company Burisma \u2013 sparked Vindman to action. \u201cWithout hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel,\u201d he said. \u201cI had concerns and it was my duty to report my concerns to the proper people in the chain of command.\u201d Before he saw an account of the call, Volker said, he thought he and others were pursuing an investigation of Burisma that did not involve a Biden angle. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently,\u201d Volker said, \u201cand had I done so, I would have raised my own objections\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think that raising 2016 elections or Vice-President Biden, these things that I consider to be conspiracy theories \u2026 they\u2019re not things that we should be pursuing as part of national security strategy with Ukraine.\u201d Republicans have argued that the Trump administration never directly tied military aid or the prospect of a White House visit to the announcement of investigations. But Vindman and Volker also provided the first public testimony about a scene in which Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, did just that. The former national security adviser John Bolton cut short a 10 July White House meeting with Ukrainian officials that Vindman also attended, Vindman said, \u201cwhen Sondland started to speak about delivery of investigations\u201d. Sondland continued to press the request for investigations of \u201c2016 elections, Biden and Burisma\u201d in a second meeting, Vindman said. \u201cI stated to Ambassador Sondland that this was inappropriate and had nothing to do with national security,\u201d he said. Volker and Tim Morrison, a senior National Security Council (NSC) official, testified in the afternoon. All four witnesses were previously deposed in closed-door meetings with the House intelligence committee, which is leading the investigation. Trump has denied wrongdoing and attacked the witnesses on Twitter, baselessly calling both Vindman and Williams \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d, meaning dyed-in-the-wool Trump critics. The Connecticut Democrat Jim Himes asked Vindman if he would call himself a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d call myself \u2018never partisan\u2019,\u201d Vindman said. An active-duty army officer who came to the US from the Soviet Union at age three, Vindman appeared in his dress uniform, bearing a combat infantry badge and a Purple Heart medal, bestowed when he was wounded in Iraq. In a dramatic opening statement \u2013 with his twin brother Yevgeny, who serves on the National Security Council, seated behind him \u2013 he said his ability to testify about the president without fear for his life spoke to his father\u2019s wisdom to move the family to America. \u201cDad, this is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth.\u201d Answering the New York Democrat Sean Maloney\u2019s question about why he wasn\u2019t worried, Vindman said: \u201cCongressman, because this is America. This is the country that I have served and defended, that all of my brothers have served. And here, right matters.\u201d The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, released a statement saying the Democrats were \u201cblinded by hatred\u201d. \u201cWe have learned nothing new in today\u2019s illegitimate \u2018impeachment\u2019 proceedings,\u201d she said. Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, who was senior counsel to Kenneth Starr in the Whitewater investigation during the Clinton administration, told the Guardian that Republicans had been struggling to mount an effective defense. \u201cThe factual development is continuing to put the Republicans in a position of defending a difficult set of facts, and they haven\u2019t figured out a way to do that yet,\u201d Rosenzweig said. Trump appeared pleased by the testimony offered by Volker and Morrison, who were more skeptical than previous witnesses have been of the assertion that the president had engaged in wrongdoing. \u201cA great day for Republicans, a great day for our Country!\u201d Trump tweeted after the hearing, which ended nearly 12 hours after it began and just over 12 hours before Wednesday\u2019s hearing \u2013 expected to be the most consequential of the week\u2019s events \u2013 was due to begin. \u201cGood night,\u201d Nunes told the emptying room after disparaging the inquiry. \u201cSee ya tomorrow.\u201d",

We\u2019ll be back early tomorrow, when House investigators will hear from more witnesses including Gordon Sondland, the EU ambassador; Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russian, Ukrainian, and Eurasian affairs; and David Hale, the under secretary of state for political affairs. You can catch up on the day\u2019s excitement with reporting from my Washington colleagues Tom McCarthy and Lauren Gambino. The afternoon hearing has finally concluded, after hours of fascinating testimony. Republican Devin Nunes used his closing remarks to broadly attack the impeachment investigation, which he described as the \u201cculmination of three years of Democratic efforts\u201d to find an excuse to impeach the president. \u201cToday we are witnesses the Ukraine hoax \u2026 the plot is hard to follow and the evidence shifts from day to day,\u201d he said. Democrat Adam Schiff used his closing remarks to focus on Volker\u2019s testimony . Addressing viewers directly, he said: \u201cWhy should Americans care about Ukraine?\u201d \u201cThey will need to ask themselves \u2013 are we prepared to accept that a president of the United States can leverage official acts, military assistance, White House meetings, to get an investigation of a political rival?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to go there.\u201d The hearings are still going, but energy from the crowd has evidently waned after hours and hours of testimony. A reporter from the Huffington Post tweeted a photo showing a row of empty chair. Time Magazine is reporting that Mike Pompeo has told three prominent Republicans that he plans to resign as secretary of state to run for senate in Kansas in the 2020 election. The Republicans told Time that Pompeo initially planned to stay on as secretary of state until next year, but is now rethinking his decision amid the impeachment inquiry. More from Time: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told three prominent Republicans in recent weeks that he plans to resign from the Trump Administration to run for the U.S. Senate from Kansas in next year\u2019s elections. The problem: how to get out in one piece. Pompeo\u2019s plan had been to remain at the State Department until early spring next year, the three Republicans tell TIME, but recent developments, including the House impeachment inquiry, are hurting him politically and straining his relationship with Trump. So Pompeo is rethinking his calendar, say the top Republicans, one who served in the Trump Administration, another who remains in government, and a third who served in several high-ranking posts and is active in GOP politics. The timing of Pompeo\u2019s resignation now will be decided by his ability to navigate the smoothest possible exit from the administration, the three Republicans say. As the afternoon\u2019s testimony approaches its conclusion, here are some striking images from inside the hearing room. Members of the House intelligence committee are now taking short turns questioning the witness. Donald Trump, it appears, has been following along too. Trump fiercely attacked impeachment witness Maria Yovanovitch during her testimony on Friday. Democrats described his tweets as \u201cwitness intimidation\u201d. This afternoon Trump has spent his time retweeting favorable clips from Fox News and from fellow Republicans. He shared an exchange between Republican counsel Steve Castor and Kurt Volker in which Castor asked Volker to confirm that he had \u201cin no way shape or form\u201d received indication of anything that resembled a quid-pro-quo. Volker replied that was correct. In non-impeachment news, California governor Gavin Newsom halted approval for hundred of fracking permits until independent scientists can approve them. Newsom also temporarily banned new wells using a high-pressure steam to extract oil \u2013 a process that regulators believe is linked to the spill at a Chevron oil field in the Central Valley. More from the AP: California has 263 pending fracking permits but has not approved any of them since July. That\u2019s when Newsom fired California\u2019s top oil and gas regulator after learning the state had increased fracking permits by 35% since he took office in January, angering environmental groups.Newsom, a Democrat, called the crackdown necessary to strengthen the state\u2019s oversight of oil and gas extraction \u201cas we phase out our dependence on fossil fuels and focus on clean energy sources.\u201d\u201cThis transition cannot happen overnight; it must advance in a deliberate way to protect people, our environment and our economy,\u201d Newsom said.The oil industry called Newsom\u2019s changes \u201cdisappointing,\u201d with the Western States Petroleum Association saying California\u2019s environmental regulations already lead the world.\u201cEvery barrel delayed or not produced in this state will only increase imports from more costly foreign sources that do not share our environmental safety standards,\u201d group president Catherine Reheis-Boyd. Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chair, questioned Volker about a 10 July meeting with Ukrainian officials, in which he was present alongside Gordon Sondland, the EU ambassador, and John Bolton, the former national security adviser. Schiff asked Volker why he did not mention in his deposition that Sondland made a \u201cgeneric comment\u201d about \u201cinvestigations\u201d at the meeting. Volker said the testimony of others reminded him that it came up. He added that \u201cI think all of us thought it was inappropriate\u201d to bring it up and described it as an \u201ceye roll\u201d moment. In news relating to the earlier testimony of Jennifer Williams this morning, the White House has released a statement from Keith Kellogg, the national security advisor to vice-president Mike Pence. Williams was Kellogg\u2019s direct report at the vice-president\u2019s office, and she testified she found the 25 July phone call \u201cunusual\u201d since it \u201cinvolved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter\u201d. \u201cI heard nothing wrong or improper on the call. I had and have no concerns,\u201d Kellogg wrote in his statement today. \u201cMs Williams was also on the call, and as she testified, she never reported any personal or professional concerns to me, her direct supervisor, regarding the call.\u201d My colleague Tom McCarthy rounded up the key top things to know from this morning\u2019s hearings. For the first time, witnesses who listened to a 25 July phone call in which Donald Trump asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy testified publicly, confirming the facts of the call and the widespread concern it prompted.* Vindman, a combat veteran who received a Purple Heart after being wounded in Iraq, appeared in his US army dress uniform \u2013 but found himself under attack from Republicans who questioned his loyalty to the United States. One witness requested by Republicans, Kurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, said that Trump\u2019s request of an investigation of Joe Biden made him realize that he failed to equate discussions of the gas company Burisma with Biden. Testimony on Tuesday provided evidence of Trump\u2019s direct role in the plot. Volker and a fellow witness, the National Security Council official Tim Morrison, both testified that Sondland was in regular communication with Trump. Three witnesses confirmed that they had heard the president personally request, in his July call with Zelenskiy, an investigation of Joe Biden and coordination with Giuliani. Witness after witness has described Sondland as a key figure pressing the Ukrainians at various moments for specific \u201cinvestigations\u201d. When he was originally deposed last month, Sondland said he took Trump at his word that \u201cthere was no quid pro quo\u201d involving US military aid. Sondland is scheduled to testify on Wednesday morning. And we\u2019re back! The House intelligence committee has called for a short break in the impeachment hearing, which will likely become more like a 20-minute recess. Morrison, the National Security Council director for Russia, has criticized an earlier impeachment inquiry witness, Lt Col Alexander Vindman, who testified just this morning. Morrison answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether he was concerned that Vindman had taken his concerns about the 25 July call between Trump and Zelenskiy directly to National Security Council lawyers and had not notified him first. \u201cIf he had concerns about the content of the call I would expect to have been notified,\u201d he said, adding that he is Vindman\u2019s superior in the chain of command. Republican counsel Steve Castor asked the witnesses about the US decision to delay a military aid package to Ukraine. Morrison said that during a meeting in which he was present with Ukrainian officials, in which Zelenskiy raised the issue of the aid, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, told Zelenskiy that the US was examining what more Europe could do for Ukrainian security and taking a look at how Ukraine was reforming a history of corruption. He said there was no mention of Burisma, Biden and the 2016 election. Volker testified that he did not know about the hold on aid until he was made aware of it by a Politico article. He says when he became aware of it, he \u201cimmediately\u201d raised objections. He said he thought it was \u201ca bad decision\u201d to hold up aid to Ukraine as it weakened the US\u2019s position with Russia. Asked if he believed the aid was held up in connection with the investigations Trump had requested, he said: \u201cNo, I did not.\u201d Trump\u2019s views on Ukraine are \u201cchronically negative\u201d, Volker testifies. He says he saw it as his job to convince Trump that Ukrainian president Zelenskiy was on his level. He says that after Zelenskiy was elected, Trump said Ukraine was filled with \u201cterrible people\u201d. Kurt Volker testified that he found the allegations against Joe Biden \u201cself-serving and not credible\u201d. Democratic committee chairman Adam Schiff asked: \u201cWhy was it that you found the allegations against Joe Biden related to his son and Burisma not to believed?\u201d Volker responded: \u201cSimply because I\u2019ve known former vice-president Biden for a long time and I know how he respect the duties of his higher office.\u201d Hello readers, Mario Koran here taking over the blog. Opening statements have been made and Volker and Morrison are now taking questions from Democrats and Republicans. According to his prepared opening statement, Kurt Volker only later came to appreciate that an investigation of Burisma was connected to an investigation of Joe Biden and his son. \u201cAt no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\u201d Volker\u2019s statement reads. \u201c I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump, until the transcript of that call was released on September 25, 2019. \u201cThroughout this time, I understood that there was an important distinction between \u2018Burisma\u2019 and \u2018Biden\u2019, and urged the Ukrainians to maintain such a distinction. I did not know that President Trump or others had raised Vice President Biden with the Ukrainians, or had conflated the investigation of possible Ukrainian corruption, with investigation of the former Vice President. In retrospect, for the Ukrainians, it clearly would have been confusing. \u201cIn hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company, \u2018Burisma,\u2019 as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden.\u201d Kurt Volker appeared to be using his opening statement to impeachment investigators to amend his closed-door testimony in which he denied knowledge of any quid pro quo in connection to the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military assistance. The former Ukraine envoy claimed US officials were offering a very positive view of Ukraine as Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, painted a very different picture for Trump. \u201cThe problem was that despite the unanimous, positive assessment and recommendations of those of us who were part of the U.S. Presidential Delegation that attended the inauguration of President Zelenskyy, President Trump was receiving a different, negative narrative about Ukraine and President Zelenskyy,\u201d Volker said. \u201cThat negative narrative was fueled by accusations from Ukraine\u2019s then-Prosecutor General and conveyed to the President by former Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\u201d In his opening statement, Tim Morrison emphasized he would not use his testimony to raise doubts about the judgement of any of his former national security council colleagues. \u201cI have great respect for my former colleagues from the NSC and the rest of the interagency,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI am not here today to question their character or integrity.\u201d However, Morrison did express doubts about Lt Col Alexander Vindman\u2019s judgement in his closed-door testimony, which the White House cited in a tweet attacking Vindman. The lieutenant colonel responded to Morrison\u2019s doubts this morning by reading from former White House official Fiona Hill\u2019s glowing performance review of him. Former NSC official Tim Morrison used his opening statement to lay out some parameters he intends to follow during his testimony today. \u201cI do not know who the whistleblower is, nor do I intend to speculate as to who the individual may be,\u201d Morrison told impeachment investigators. Adam Schiff has accused some of the House intelligence committee\u2019s Republican members of trying to use their witness questioning to identify the whistleblower. Morrison, who listened in on Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president, said he feared reports of the conversation could heighten polarization. \u201cAs I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington\u2019s political climate,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cMy fears have been realized.\u201d Tim Morrison and Kurt Volker have been sworn in for this afternoon\u2019s public impeachment hearing and will now deliver their opening statements. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, used his opening statement to reiterate his accusations that Democrats are seeking to oust Trump simply because of political animus. The California Republican claimed Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry \u201csolely because they despise\u201d Trump and because they are \u201cafraid he will win reelection next year.\u201d House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff began his opening statement by noting that this afternoon\u2019s witnesses, Tim Morrison and Kurt Volker, were requested by the Republican minority. The committee\u2019s Republican members initially complained that they weren\u2019t allowed to call officials to testify in the impeachment inquiry, but Schiff eventually approved three of the minority\u2019s witness requests. However, this did not quash GOP complaints because Republicans expressed dismay that Schiff denied their requests to have Hunter Biden or the whistleblower whose complaint initiated the impeachment inquiry publicly testify. The second public impeachment hearing of the day, featuring testimony from former NSC official Tim Morrison and former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, has been gaveled in. The House has passed an interim spending bill to fund the government through Dec. 20, averting a shutdown as public impeachment hearings continue in the House. However, the Dec. 20 deadline to pass another funding bill could result in a partisan battle over government spending just as the House is considering whether to impeach Trump. The New York Times reports: The specter of last year\u2019s 35-day shutdown drove a slim bipartisan margin on Tuesday, as most lawmakers agreed that a temporary spending bill maintaining current levels of funding for another four weeks was preferable to an encore of the breach last year, which lasted into January. ... Left unresolved, however, are the dozen must-pass bills that would maintain funding for the remainder of the fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1. Lawmakers on the traditionally bipartisan Appropriations Committees have failed to reach an agreement over funding Mr. Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise to build a wall between the United States and Mexico \u2014 the same fraught debate that led to the nation\u2019s longest government shutdown nearly a year ago. Oleksander Danylyuk, the former chairman of the national security and defence council in Ukraine, said the job offer extended to Lt Col Alexander Vindman was \u201cclearly a joke.\u201d \u201cWe both smiled and laughed,\u201d Danylyuk told the Daily Beast. Vindman similarly described the offer to become Ukrainian defense minister as \u201ccomical\u201d during this morning\u2019s impeachment hearing. The Republican counsel on the House intelligence committee appeared to be trying to paint the job offer as indicative of Vindman\u2019s non-existent dual loyalty. Republicans on the House intelligence committee pushed back against Democratic accusations that questions about Lt Col Alexander Vindman being offered the job of Ukrainian defense minister were meant to resurface baseless allegations of dual loyalty. When Vindman responded to questions about the defense minister job, the lieutenant colonel emphasized he was an American above all else and never entertained the \u201ccomical\u201d offer. The two witnesses in this afternoon\u2019s public impeachment hearing, former NSC official Tim Morrison and former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, have arrived on Capitol Hill, but it\u2019s unclear when they will begin their testimony. The second hearing was originally scheduled to begin about 10 minutes ago, but the House intelligence committee appears to be running behind. The White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham has released a statement condemning the impeachment inquiry following this morning\u2019s public hearing. \u201cWe have learned nothing new in today\u2019s illegitimate \u2018impeachment\u2019 proceedings,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cHowever, buried among the witnesses\u2019 personal opinions and conjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both witnesses testified the July 25 transcript was \u2018accurate\u2019 and nothing President Trump has done or said amounts to \u2018bribery\u2019 or any other crime.\u201d Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams did testify to the accuracy of the White House memo on Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. However, that memo shows the US president asking Ukraine for a \u201cfavor,\u201d and Vindman testified he believed Trump was trying to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden. Committee chairman Adam Schiff argued during the hearing that Vindman and Williams were not asked to make a determination on whether Trump attempted to bribe Ukraine because they were merely meant to serve as \u201cfact witnesses\u201d in the inquiry. The first public impeachment hearing today has concluded, and the second hearing with former NSC official Tim Morrison and former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker is scheduled to begin in about 40 minutes. Here\u2019s what we learned from the first hearing: Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams provided firsthand accounts of Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president, which sparked the impeachment inquiry. Vindman said he immediately notified White House lawyers of the \u201cimproper\u201d call because he was alarmed by Trump\u2019s apparent efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. Williams added that Trump\u2019s mention of Biden and his son sounded \u201cpolitical\u201d to her, which was not in keeping with a typical call to a foreign leader. Republicans on the House intelligence committee tried to undermine Vindman\u2019s credibility by alluding to a possible loyalty to Ukraine, which he denied, and by accusing him of going outside the chain of command to report his concerns on the call, which he contradicted. But GOP members did not try to seriously contest the witnesses\u2019 key assertions about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. The White House sent a tweet raising doubts about Vindman\u2019s judgement by quoting the closed-door testimony of Morrison. However, during the hearing, Vindman pushed back against Morrison\u2019s concerns by quoting a glowing performance review by former White House official Fiona Hill. Williams and Vindman denied they are \u201cnever Trumpers,\u201d despite the president\u2019s accusations. Vindman said he would describe himself as \u201cnever partisan.\u201d The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. The first of two public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry has concluded after about four and a half hours of testimony from Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams. In his closing statement, Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, declared, \u201cAct one of today\u2019s circus is over.\u201d But committee chairman Adam Schiff used his opening statement to once again lay out the accusations against Trump and argue the witnesses\u2019 testimony today had contradicted Republicans\u2019 claims that the president mentioned investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election because he cared about Ukrainian corruption. Democratic representative Raja Krishamoorthi expressed his concerns that Lt Col Alexnader Vindman was being attacked partly because he is an immigrant. Krishamoorthi, a fellow immigrant, added that he hoped Vindman was as proud to be an American as he was, becoming emotional as he spoke. Moments ago, Lt Col Alexander Vindman dismissed a conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election as a \u201cRussian narrative that President Putin has promoted.\u201d The US intelligence community has thoroughly confirmed that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, but Republicans on the House intelligence committee have attempted to resurface the baseless allegations against Ukraine during the public impeachment hearings. Some of those watching today\u2019s impeachment testimony from the public seating section of the hearing room applauded after Lt Col Alexander Vindman explained why he felt comfortable publicly sharing his concerns about the president. \u201cThis is America,\u201d Vindman said in response to a question from Democratic representative Sean Maloney about whether his father was concerned about him testifying. \u201cHere, right matters.\u201d For a lighter moment in the impeachment hearing, presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro responded to a claim from his brother, representative Joaquin Castro, that he made him grow a beard to make it easier to tell the identical twins apart. Representative Jim Jordan, one of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, used his final five minutes of questioning to accuse Democrats of trying to undo the results of the 2016 presidential election through the impeachment inquiry. The Ohio Republican did not ask a single question to today\u2019s witnesses, Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams. The White House tweet raising doubts about the judgement of Lt Col Alexander Vindman is particularly shocking considering the Iraq war veteran still serves on the national security council. Meanwhile, over on Trump\u2019s Twitter account, the president is resharing messages from Republican accounts downplaying the testimony from Vindman and Jennifer Williams. The White House Twitter account has just sent a message raising doubts about the judgement of Lt Col Alexander Vindman as the NSC official testifies in the impeachment inquiry. The White House tweet quoted the closed-door testimony from Tim Morrison, who was Vindman\u2019s superior on the national security council. However, asked about Morrison\u2019s testimony earlier, Vindman cited his glowing performance review from former White House official Fiona Hill, who praised the Iraq war veteran\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cunflappable\u201d demeanor. Representative Joaquin Castro got a laugh during the impeachment hearing by making a joke about being an identical twin, as Lt Col Alexander Vindman is. Castro said it was \u201cgreat to talk to a fellow identical twin\u201d and added he hoped Vindman\u2019s brother was \u201cnicer to you\u201d and doesn\u2019t \u201cmake you grow a beard.\u201d The Texas congressman\u2019s brother, Juli\u00e1n Castro, is currently running for president, and Joaquin grew a beard in part to help tell the two apart. Under questioning from Republican representative Elise Stefanik, Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams both acknowledged there was the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest in Hunter Biden\u2019s work for the Ukrainian company Burisma. George Kent, the state department official who raised concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest in Biden\u2019s work for Burisma in 2015, testified last week that he never saw any effort by US officials to shield the company from scrutiny. Republican representative Chris Stewart pressed Lt Col Alexander Vindman on why he corrected Devin Nunes after the GOP ranking member incorrectly called the Iraq war veteran \u201cMr Vindman.\u201d \u201cYou always insist on civilians calling you by your rank?\u201d Stewart asked. Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient, replied that he considered the correction appropriate given that he is in his military uniform and because he has been the subject of attacks meant to \u201cmarginalize\u201d his service. Trump also touched on Vindman\u2019s correction of Nunes when speaking to reporters during his cabinet meeting this afternoon. \u201cI don\u2019t know him,\u201d Trump said of Vindman. \u201cI don\u2019t know, as he says, \u2018Lt Colonel.\u2019 I understand somebody had him the misfortune of calling him \u2018Mr\u2019 and he corrected them. I never saw the man. I understand now he wears his uniform when he goes in. No, I don\u2019t know Vindman at all.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that active duty service members are required to wear their military uniforms when appearing before Congress. Lt Col Alexander Vindman testified that after he reported his concerns on Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president, he was excluded from several meetings he usually would have attended in his capacity as the top Ukraine expert on the NSC. Vindman said he could not make a determination on whether that exclusion constituted retaliation after he raised concerns, but he felt it was unusual. Republican representative Brad Wenstrup, an Army reserve officer, accused Lt Col Alexander Vindman of going outside the chain of command by reporting his concerns on Trump\u2019s Ukraine call to the White House counsel\u2019s office rather than Tim Morrison, his direct superior. Vindman testified that Morrison did not make himself available, but Wenstrup pushed back against that. This line of questioning will almost certainly be picked up again this afternoon, when Morrison testifies. Committee chairman Adam Schiff pushed back against Republican representative John Ratcliffe\u2019s line of questioning, which was meant to argue that none of the impeachment witnesses had testified to a bribery scheme in Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine. Schiff said that those testifying during the impeachment hearings are fact witnesses and cannot reach a determination on bribery, pointing out that House members will be required to use their own judgment on the matter. Asked about Rudy Giuliani\u2019s unofficial efforts to influence US-Ukrainian policy, Lt Col Alexander Vindman said that the maneuvers by the president\u2019s personal lawyer were unhelpful to the country\u2019s national security. The next Republican questioner at today\u2019s public impeachment hearing was representative John Ratcliffe, who largely avoided asking the witnesses questions in his five minutes. Instead, he pointed to the ten closed-door depositions he had printed out and argued none of the witness testimony in the inquiry mentioned \u201cbribery\u201d when describing Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine. However, a number of witnesses discussed a potential \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in connection to Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. After another flare-up over protecting the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint initiated the impeachment inquiry, Democratic representative Jim Himes asked Jennifer Williams and Lt Col Alexander Vindman whether they are \u201cnever Trumpers.\u201d The president has previously claimed the witnesses in the impeachment inquiry are only testifying because they are politically opposed to him. But Williams said she did not identify as a \u201cnever Trumper,\u201d and Vindman told Himes, \u201cI\u2019d call myself never partisan.\u201d Republican representative Jim Jordan began his questioning of Lt Col Alexander Vindman by quoting former NSC official Tim Morrison\u2019s closed-door testimony raising doubts about the Iraq war veteran\u2019s reputation. Vindman responded by quoting his performance review from former White House official Fiona Hill just before she left the adminsitration, which applauds Vindman\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cunflappable\u201d demeanor. On the question of whether he ever leaked to the press, Vindman called the query \u201cpreposterous\u201d and reiterated he would never share sensitive information with the media. Describing Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president, Lt Col Alexander Vindman said there was no ambiguity in his mind that the commander-in-chief was asking Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden and his son. The public impeachment hearing has resumed, and Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams will now take series of five-minute questions from members of the House intelligence committee. However, it appears that Trump\u2019s congressional allies have so far been unconvinced by the two officials\u2019 damning testimony about the president\u2019s Ukraine call. As the hearing takes a short break, it\u2019s a good time to return to one answer that Jennifer Williams, an aide to the vice president, provided at the beginning of the House intelligence committee\u2019s questioning. When chairman Adam Schiff asked Williams about Mike Pence\u2019s Sept. 18 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the longtime foreign service officer said she could not take questions about it because the White House had determined the conversation to be classified. Williams said she would be willing to discuss the call in a classified setting or through a written statement to House members. Williams previously testified about the call in her closed-door deposition and said the two leaders had a \u201cvery positive\u201d conversation that did not include discussion of investigations into Joe Biden or the 2016 election. The House intelligence committee has called a five- to ten-minute break in this morning\u2019s public impeachment hearing, which will likely become more like a 20-minute recess. GOP counsel Steve Castor\u2019s questioning to Lt Col Alexander Vindman about whether he considered an offer to become Ukraine\u2019s defense minister seemed to be getting at some Republicans\u2019 baseless claims of the Iraq war veteran\u2019s dual loyalty. The Republican counsel questioned Lt Col Alexander Vindman about whether he entertained an offer to become the defense minister of Ukraine. Vindman emphasized that he was an American and did not consider the offer, calling it \u201ccomical\u201d given his current role, which he said was \u201cnot that senior.\u201d While the press section of the stately hearing room is packed, the public section is scattered with several open seats. The front row is reserved for members of Congress, who have filtered in and out of the hearing. For a brief period in the morning, congressman Eliot Engel, chair of the House Foreign Affairs committee, one of the three panels leading the impeachment inquiry, sat next to congressman Lee Zeldin, a Republican and a leading defender of the president. Several lawmakers sat hunched over their phones, tapping out messages and tweets. But when chair Adam Schiff interrupted ranking member Devin Nunes to admonish the Republican for what he said were questions designed to unmask the whistleblower, Republicans in the room grumbled loudly. Several seats to the left of the lawmakers, a man wore a Make America Great Again hat that jarred with the ornate setting. There were few other displays of partisanship among the audience. Schiff, presiding over the hearing, sat ramrod straight, staring ahead intently at the witnesses. Echoing last week\u2019s hearings, the Republican counsel on the House intelligence committee asked today\u2019s witnesses about Hunter Biden\u2019s qualifications to join the board of the Ukrainian company Burisma. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about Mr. Hunter Biden,\u201d Lt Col Alexander Vindman said in response to questions from GOP counsel Steve Castor. While Devin Nunes was questioning Jennifer Williams and Lt Col Alexander Vindman, Adam Schiff warned his Republican colleague that he was not to use the proceedings to attempt to out the whistleblower whose complaint initiated the impeachment inquiry. Nunes was pressing Williams and Vindman on which officials they spoke to after Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president. Schiff reminded Nunes that committee members were required to protect the identity of the whistleblower, prompting some jeering from Republicans in the hearing room. Vindman responded that he did not know the whistleblower\u2019s identity but had been instructed not to discuss his intelligence community contacts. Nunes told him he was free to plead the Fifth, but Vindman\u2019s attorney pushed back that such protection was not necessary. In another rather tense moment, Vindman corrected Nunes after the congressman referred to the Iraq War veteran as \u201cMr Vindman.\u201d \u201cRanking member, it\u2019s Lt Col Vindman, please,\u201d he said. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, is now using his time to question Jennifer Williams and Lt Col Alexander Vindman about whether they ever leaked to the press about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Williams and Vindman repeatedly said they only spoke to White House staffers and officials with the proper clearances about the call. Adam Schiff and the Democratic counsel have concluded their 45 minutes of questions to Jennifer Williams and Lt Col Alexander Vindman, and Republican Devin Nunes has now begun his questioning. The ranking member of the House intelligence committee opened his questioning by asking the witnesses about Hunter Biden\u2019s connections to the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, even though Williams and Vindman quickly acknowledged they had very little familiarity with the matter. Lt Col Alexander Vindman said his impression from Trump\u2019s communications with the Ukrainian president was that Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u201cwould have to deliver these investigations\u201d into Joe Biden and the 2016 election in order to secure a White House meeting. Answering the Democratic counsel\u2019s question about the placement of the Ukraine call transcript on a highly secure server, Lt Col Alexander Vindman said such decisions were \u201cnot unprecedented.\u201d However, the NSC official noted the decision to move the transcript of Trump\u2019s call to a more secure server was made \u201con the fly.\u201d Lt Col Alexander Vindman said he believed the Ukrainian president may have been briefed on Burisma and its connection to the Bidens, given Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s awareness of the company during his July call with Trump. If Zelenskiy were briefed, it could indicate the Ukrainian president was already aware of Trump allies pushing for the investigations before the July call. Jennifer Williams added that she believed Trump\u2019s reference to the Bidens during the July call sounded \u201cpolitical.\u201d Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams, who listened to Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president, testified they both recalled hearing a reference to Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company with ties to Hunter Biden. Burisma was not mentioned in the White House memo on the July call, even though Vindman said he notified officials that he heard Trump say the company\u2019s name. However, the lieutenant colonel said he did not consider the omission of Burisma to be \u201csignificant.\u201d Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, has weighed in on the impeachment inquiry -- falsely claiming that the constitution requires the president to root out corruption in countries that receive US aid. In his opening statement, Lt Col Alexander Vindman shared his concerns that Giuliani\u2019s unofficial efforts to shape US-Ukrainian policy could jeopardize national security. \u201cIn the Spring of 2019, I became aware of two disruptive actors\u2013-primarily Ukraine\u2019s then-Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko and former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal attorney\u2014 promoting false information that undermined the United States\u2019 Ukraine policy,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cThe NSC and its inter-agency partners, including the State Department, grew increasingly concerned about the impact that such information was having on our country\u2019s ability to achieve our national security objectives.\u201d Responding to questions from committee chairman Adam Schiff, Lt Col Alexander Vindman said he immediately reported Trump\u2019s Ukraine call because he feared it could have implications on US national security. \u201cWithout hesitation, I knew I had to report this to the White House counsel,\u201d Vindman said of the July call, saying he believed he had a \u201cduty\u201d to share his concerns. \u201cIt was improper for the president to request, to demand an investigation into a political opponent,\u201d Vindman said, warning that Trump\u2019s wishes could \u201cundermine our national security.\u201d Lt Col Alexander Vindman outlined his family\u2019s history of fleeing from the Soviet Union and applauded the courage of his colleagues who have testified in the impeachment inquiry. \u201cI want to state that the vile character attacks on these distinguished and honorable public servants is reprehensible,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cIt is natural to disagree and engage in spirited debate, this has been our custom since the time of our Founding Fathers, but we are better than callow and cowardly attacks.\u201d The Iraq war veteran went on to directly address his father, who made the decision to flee to the United States. \u201cDad, my sitting here today, in the US Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision forty years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cDo not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\u201d In his opening statement at this morning\u2019s impeachment hearing, Lt Col Alexander Vindman said he immediately reported Trump\u2019s Ukraine call to White House lawyers \u201cout of a sense of duty\u201d because the conversation was \u201cimproper.\u201d \u201cI was concerned by the call, what I heard was improper, and I reported my concerns to Mr. Eisenberg,\u201d Vindman said, referring to a senior White House lawyer. \u201cIt is improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent.\u201d Vindman stressed that the call could jeopardize US-Ukrainian relations. \u201cIt was also clear that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma, it would be interpreted as a partisan play,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cThis would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing bipartisan support, undermine U.S. national security, and advance Russia\u2019s strategic objectives in the region.\u201d In her opening statement, Jennifer Williams recounted her memory of Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president, which kicked off the impeachment inquiry. \u201cOn July 25th, along with several of my colleagues, I listened to a call between President Trump and President Zelensky\u2014the content of which has since been publicly reported,\u201d Williams, an aide to the vice president, said. \u201cDuring my closed-door deposition, Members of the Committee asked about my personal views and whether I had any concerns about the July 25th call. As I testified then, I found the July 25th phone call unusual because, in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.\u201d Williams also noted that she was told acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney maintained the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military assistance. The longtime foreign service officer said that she learned of the hold in early July, and that hold was discussed at subsequent Policy Coordination Committee meetings. \u201cDuring those meetings, representatives of the State and Defense Departments advocated that the hold should be lifted, and OMB representatives reported that the White House Chief of Staff had directed that the hold should remain in place,\u201d Williams said. Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams have now been sworn in to testify in today\u2019s public impeachment hearing. Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, is currently delivering her opening statement. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, used his opening statement to denounce the media for allegedly spreading false reports about Trump and his aides -- even though a number of the articles Nunes cited were far from false. Nunes applauded pieces from the Hill\u2019s former columnist John Solomon, whose writings about Ukraine are now being reviewed and corrected when necessary. As a New York Times reporter pointed out, the strategy of attacking the media may be far easier for Republicans than attacking today\u2019s witnesses. Adam Schiff emphasized in his opening statement that Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams are not political figures and are not testifying today to argue for or against impeachment. \u201cMs. Williams, we all saw the President\u2019s tweet about you on Sunday afternoon and the insults he hurled at Ambassador Yovanovich last Friday,\u201d Schiff said, referring to the president\u2019s tweet calling Williams a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d \u201cYou are here today, and the American people are grateful.\u201d Schiff continued, \u201cCol. Vindman, we have seen far more scurrilous attacks on your character, and watched as certain personalities on Fox have questioned your loyalty. I note that you have shed blood for America, and we owe you an immense debt of gratitude. \u201cToday\u2019s witnesses, like those who testified last week, are here because they were subpoenaed to appear, not because they are for or against impeachment. \u201cThat question is for Congress, not the fact witnesses.\u201d Committee chairman Adam Schiff used his opening statement at this morning\u2019s impeachment hearing to defend the reputations of Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams. \u201cLieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, whose family fled oppression in the Soviet Union when he was a toddler, is a career Army officer, an Iraq War veteran who was awarded a Purple Heart, and an expert in Russia and Ukraine who has worked at the highest levels of the Pentagon,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cJennifer Williams is a career Foreign Service Officer who is currently detailed to the Office of the Vice-President and responsible for Europe and Eurasia issues.\u201d Republicans on the House intelligence committee reportedly intend to try to undermine Vindman\u2019s testimony by questioning his motives and his loyalty to Trump. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, has gaveled in this morning\u2019s public impeachment hearing. The hearing\u2019s witnesses, Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams, have taken their seats. Williams will deliver her opening statement first, followed by Vindman. Lt Col Alexander Vindman\u2019s twin brother -- Lt Col Yevgeny Vindman, who serves as a lawyer handling ethics issues on the national security council -- will also be in attendance at today\u2019s hearing and will similarly be wearing his military uniform. Hello from the velvet-draped hearing room where we will soon hear testimony from Lt Col Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the national security council, and Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence. Republicans are up with new signage, hoisted high enough to be seen each time a GOP lawmaker speaks. Today\u2019s posters attempt to wield Democrats\u2019 words against them. One sign features a tweet from Intelligence chairman Adam Schiff in September, which states that his team had been in touch with the whistleblower about testifying before the committee. Republicans have demanded the whistleblower, whose complaint touched off the impeachment inquiry, testify. But Democrats have resisted, insisting that it\u2019s unnecessary to risk exposing the whistleblower\u2019s identity because many of the central claims in the complaint have been corroborated by testimony from other witnesses. \u201cWe\u2019re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as next week,\u201d Schiff wrote in the tweet. Another signs says \u201c99 days since Adam Schiff learned the identity of the whistleblower.\u201d Schiff has repeatedly denied that he knows the identity of the whistleblower, a claim that drew snickers from Republicans in the audience on the first day of impeachment hearings last week. The last sign is a quote from Congressman Jeff Van Drew, a Democrat from New Jersey and one of the only members of his party to vote against a resolution formalizing the procedures of the impeachment inquiry. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent millions of dollars in my opinion, tons of money, tons of time, tons of hurt, fracturing the nation apart,\u201d Van Drew said, referring to the inquiry. In big bold, highlighted letters, the rest of his quote states: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this to be a good thing.\u201d According to a new poll out this morning, Americans remain split on impeachment as the second week of hearings begins. The PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll found that 45% of US adults believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office, compared to 44 percent who say he should not be. However, there is much more of a consensus when it comes to whether it\u2019s acceptable for a president to ask a foreign country to investigate one of his political rivals, the central allegation in the impeachment inquiry. The poll found that 70% of Americans would consider this unacceptable, compared to 22% who called it acceptable. Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, has also arrived to testify in this morning\u2019s impeachment hearing. Like Vindman, Williams listened in on Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, and the veteran foreign service officer later told impeachment investigators that she was alarmed by the president\u2019s requests of an investigation into Joe Biden and his son. Williams said the nature of the July conversation with the Ukrainian president struck her as \u201cunusual and inappropriate.\u201d Republicans reportedly intend to try to undermine Lt Col Alexander Vindman\u2019s testimony by questioning the Purple Heart recipient\u2019s motives and loyalty to the president. The Washington Post reports: Since he emerged as a witness last month, Trump and his allies have denounced Vindman. The president called him a \u2018Never Trumper witness,\u2019 and on Fox News, Laura Ingraham described Vindman as \u2018a U.S. national security official . . . working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interests.\u2019 The attacks picked up again on the eve of his testimony. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) suggested in a letter released Monday that Vindman fits the profile of \u2018a significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch [who] have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and . . . react by leaking to the press and participating in the ongoing effort to sabotage his policies and, if possible, remove him from office.\u2019 Vindman\u2019s lawyer, Michael Volkov, called Johnson\u2019s assertion \u2018such a baseless accusation, so ridiculous on its face, that it doesn\u2019t even warrant a response.\u201d\u2019 It will be interesting to see how the public responds if Republicans choose to challenge the credibility of an Iraq war veteran as he testifies in his military uniform. It will be ... quite the visual. Lt Col Alexander Vindman has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify in this morning\u2019s impeachment hearing -- wearing his military uniform, as he did for his closed-door testimony. Some of Trump\u2019s allies tried to smear Vindman\u2019s reputation after the Purple Heart recipient testified that the president\u2019s Ukraine call alarmed him, forcing a number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to defend the longtime public servant and Iraq war veteran. There will actually be two impeachment hearings held on Capitol Hill today. Vindman and Williams will testify starting at 9 a.m. ET, and Kurt Volker and Tim Morrison will testify at 2:30 p.m. ET. Volker, Trump\u2019s former envoy to Ukraine, previously denied knowledge of efforts to pressure Kyiv to investigate Joe Biden. However, since his closed-door testimony, at least eleven other officials have contradicted details of his account. Although Volker may offer more favorable testimony for Trump, Democrats on the House intelligence committee will almost certainly grill him on why his memory differed so drastically from some of his colleagues\u2019. Morrison, the former top Russia expert on the national security council, previously testified that Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, was the one trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, but he told impeachment investigators that Sondland said \u201cthe president was giving him instruction.\u201d Morrison also listened in on Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president and told lawmakers he believed that nothing illegal or improper occurred. Good morning, live blog readers! The second round of impeachment hearings kicks off in about an hour, when Lt Col Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams are scheduled to testify publicly before the House intelligence committee. Vindman is the top Ukraine expert on the national security council and previously told impeachment investigators behind closed doors that Donald Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president so alarmed him that he immediately informed White House lawyers. Williams is an aide to Vice President Mike Pence and also listened in on the Ukraine call, telling the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry that it \u201cshed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold.\u201d The president attacked Williams in a tweet on Sunday -- calling her a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d as he has labeled other witnesses who have testified in the inquiry. Vindman and Williams\u2019 firsthand accounts of the Ukraine call will severely test Republicans\u2019 defense strategy of portraying witness testimony as hearsay, which is how they described the accounts of the diplomats who testified last week. That tension might push Trump\u2019s allies to other, more personal attack strategies, so it\u2019s likely today\u2019s hearing will get ugly fast. The live blog will be providing updates and analysis as the hearing gets underway, so stay tuned.",
