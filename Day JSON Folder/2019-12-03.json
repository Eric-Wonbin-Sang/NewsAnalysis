      "body": "<p>We\u2019ve come a long way from basic aviators. In a world where wild neon, retro oversized, and mirror-lensed sunglasses are high style, it\u2019s hard to fathom that there was a time, not long ago, when it was considered radical - and indulgent - to own more than one basic pair. Most folks, especially those needing a prescription, made a single purchase that was neutral-looking enough to match any outfit and any occasion.</p> <p>Fast forward to today and we\u2019re a nation of proud shades collectors, adventurous and among the quickest to adopt glasses trends - and for good reason. All the sinister things that the sun does to skin apply to vision, too. UV rays penetrate our eyes and cause cumulative damage, irreversible macular degeneration and even cataracts over time.</p> <p>But sunglasses\u2019 serious purpose doesn\u2019t mean they have to be subtle or boring, says Stewart Walton, vice president of product at optical giant Luxottica. \u201cNowadays sunglasses are an extension of a person\u2019s look, a representation of their personality, so we definitely see a lot more people buying multiple pairs at once,\u201d he says.</p> <p>We\u2019re also lucky, Walton says, that the strict standards in this country mean shopping from a high street retailer such as OPSM guarantees sunglasses are safe, no matter how adventurous they are. Advances in technology also mean almost all high street shades - 85% at OPSM, to be precise - can have a prescription added, too.</p> <p>\u201cOnce upon a time, the sunglass business in Australia was centred around Ray-Ban Aviators and Wayfarers, but now people are looking for evolutions of the classics, something with a twist, and interesting colours,\u201d Walton says.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the lowdown of the hottest shade trends for summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca85d579ef9c574bb29eb685d68c3eae3b875e7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca85d579ef9c574bb29eb685d68c3eae3b875e7d/0_0_8660_5773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Friends laughing together at big festivalFriends hanging out at big music festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Friends laughing together at big festival <br>Friends hanging out at big music festival</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Trend #1: Oversized retro</h2> <p>\u201cThere have always been retro influences in our collections, but 1970s-inspired styles are a key trend for next year,\u201d Walton says. \u201cThis includes retro acetate frames, big squares, oversized ovals, and colours that are a more earthy, mottled and neutral. We\u2019re seeing more green lenses coming through, too.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>How to wear it: </strong></em>Earthy colours are almost universally flattering.

Case in point: the limited-edition Post Malone range created with Arnette for OPSM, which includes a bold yellow acetate frame.</p> <p><em><strong>How to wear it:</strong></em> Tempting as it is to keep the rest of your outfit neutral for balance, this trend is best worn with a street-vibe look that also incorporates brights and prints.</p> <p><em><strong>Expert tip:</strong></em> \u201cI have a rule of thumb,\u201d Walton says. \u201cHave a look at your face shape.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve come a long way from basic aviators. In a world where wild neon, retro oversized, and mirror-lensed sunglasses are high style, it\u2019s hard to fathom that there was a time, not long ago, when it was considered radical - and indulgent - to own more than one basic pair. Most folks, especially those needing a prescription, made a single purchase that was neutral-looking enough to match any outfit and any occasion. Fast forward to today and we\u2019re a nation of proud shades collectors, adventurous and among the quickest to adopt glasses trends - and for good reason. All the sinister things that the sun does to skin apply to vision, too. UV rays penetrate our eyes and cause cumulative damage, irreversible macular degeneration and even cataracts over time. But sunglasses\u2019 serious purpose doesn\u2019t mean they have to be subtle or boring, says Stewart Walton, vice president of product at optical giant Luxottica. \u201cNowadays sunglasses are an extension of a person\u2019s look, a representation of their personality, so we definitely see a lot more people buying multiple pairs at once,\u201d he says. We\u2019re also lucky, Walton says, that the strict standards in this country mean shopping from a high street retailer such as OPSM guarantees sunglasses are safe, no matter how adventurous they are. Advances in technology also mean almost all high street shades - 85% at OPSM, to be precise - can have a prescription added, too. \u201cOnce upon a time, the sunglass business in Australia was centred around Ray-Ban Aviators and Wayfarers, but now people are looking for evolutions of the classics, something with a twist, and interesting colours,\u201d Walton says. Here\u2019s the lowdown of the hottest shade trends for summer. Trend #1: Oversized retro \u201cThere have always been retro influences in our collections, but 1970s-inspired styles are a key trend for next year,\u201d Walton says. \u201cThis includes retro acetate frames, big squares, oversized ovals, and colours that are a more earthy, mottled and neutral. We\u2019re seeing more green lenses coming through, too.\u201d How to wear it: Earthy colours are almost universally flattering. Team with whites, creams and natural linens for a laid-back look. Expert tip: \u201cIf you want a prescription added, opt for slightly smaller lenses,\u201d Walton says. \u201cOversized frames can sometimes make adding a script a challenge.\u201d SHOP THE LOOK: Ray-Ban RB3561 ($229) and Tiffany Blue Entry ($430), stockist: opsm.com.au Prada PR 16RSF ($330) and Ralph Lauren RA5138 ($189.95), stockist: opsm.com.au Trend #2: Adventurous This means everything from neon colours to mirrored glass and radical shapes. Just as the high-vis colours of the late \u201980s and early \u201990s have resurged on fashion runways, bright sunglasses now hot property. Case in point: the limited-edition Post Malone range created with Arnette for OPSM, which includes a bold yellow acetate frame. How to wear it: Tempting as it is to keep the rest of your outfit neutral for balance, this trend is best worn with a street-vibe look that also incorporates brights and prints. Expert tip: \u201cI have a rule of thumb,\u201d Walton says. \u201cHave a look at your face shape. Do you have a slightly round face shape or a more angular shape, fine jawline? What is it about your face that\u2019s the most defining quality? Then try to find a frame that\u2019s the opposite.\u201d SHOP THE LOOK: Oakley Frogskins ($174.95), stockist: opsm.com.au Trend #3: Redefined metals \u201cMetals have traditionally been the poor cousin to plastic acetate, particularly in Europe, but there has been a real push over the past two years to do more interesting things with gold, silver, rose-gold, and even gunmetal grey materials,\u201d Walton says. How to wear it: Universally flattering, metal frames are among the easiest to wear, and are especially good teamed with a suited or formal look. Expert tip: Aviators are back with a twist - as prescription glasses. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone from something completely out of fashion to being extremely on trend,\u201d Walton says. \u201cAll the young guys in our office have been rocking aviator [prescription glasses] this year.\u201d SHOP THE LOOK: Ray-Ban Icons ($205), and Ralph Lauren ($189.95), stockist: opsm.com.au Trend #4: Geometrics From triangles to straight edges pressed into ovals, this trend embraces angles and non-organic forms. Prada Sun\u2019s rounded frames with the deep V under the bridge are a more subtle interpretation. At the other end of the spectrum, Burberry\u2019s triangular style means business. How to wear it: Let your shades do the talking and team with a simple white shirt and classic jeans. Expert tip: Be mindful that coloured lenses can something affect safety when driving, Walton says. SHOP THE LOOK: Prada PR 04US ($460), stockist: opsm.com.au Trend #5: Shield Another blast from the past, the full-wrap visor has been championed by celebrity aficionados of late. \u201cFor Australia this is a style really never went away, but now it\u2019s back with a vengeance and being reinvented in a cool and futuristic way,\u201d Walton says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely gone from something daggy to being at the height of cool.\u201d Sex and the City star and style icon Sarah Jessica Parker recently created a collection for Sunglass Hut centred around this shield shape. Likewise, Fendi\u2019s recent collab with rap star Nicki Minaj. How to wear it: The whole point of this trend is to go big and bold, but make sure the frame wraps snugly around your face so it doesn\u2019t feel awkward. Expert tip: \u201cThis is one of the only styles that isn\u2019t usually an option for prescriptions thanks to the single lens,\u201d Walton says. \u201cIn that case, consider asking your optometrist about contact lenses.\u201d SHOP THE LOOK: Versace ($279.95), stockist: opsm.com.au Trend #6: Sports luxe This trend has legs that just keep on running, but next season brings a fresh direction. \u201cMirrored lenses have become a real focus for all sports brands,\u201d Walton says. \u201cA few years ago, it was mainly Oakley that you\u2019d see them in, but I think almost every brand now has a bright popping mirrored lens that really elevates a frame that could otherwise be conservative.\u201d How to wear it: Keep it casual. This is the ideal style for the beach or laid-back days off. Think shorts, relaxed T-shirts and, of course, sporting gear. Expert tip: The beauty of sports-centric frames is they tend to be unisex, which opens up your range of options, Walton says.

      "body": "<p>It was a gripping tale of peril and prowess that captivated the world for more than two tense weeks in the summer of 2018. Twelve boys and their football coach were lost in a subterranean maze in the Tham Luong caves in Thailand. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/british-divers-at-heart-of-thai-cave-rescue-among-best-in-world\">international team of cave divers</a> raced to rescue them before monsoon rains were due to flood the caves. The story was destined to be fodder for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/nov/19/thai-cave-rescue-film-opens-in-bangkok\">Hollywood blockbuster</a> \u2013 and that was before an eccentric billionaire got involved.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a postscript to the feelgood tale of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/14/we-dont-know-how-it-worked-the-inside-story-of-the-thai-cave-rescue\">Tham Luang cave rescue</a> played out in a federal courthouse in Los Angeles as the trial began in a defamation case brought by the British caver Vernon Unsworth against Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk.</p> <p>Musk testified on Tuesday that he was being insulting, not literal, when he called Unsworth a pedophile in a tweet after the diver had ridiculed Musk on CNN. Musk said he was upset the diver had belittled his efforts to help by building a miniature submarine to transport the boys.</p> <p>Unsworth\u2019s comments were \u201can unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids\u201d, Musk said. \u201cIt was wrong and insulting, and so I insulted him back.\u201d</p> <p>Unsworth, a British national who lives in Thailand, was among the first divers to reach the scene of the boys\u2019 disappearance. He was credited by rescuers for his detailed knowledge of the cave system, which helped locate the missing team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/16/elon-musk-defamation-lawsuit-pedo-guy-tweet-diver\">Elon Musk claims he didn't intend to accuse British diver of pedophilia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Musk, the chief of Tesla and SpaceX, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/10/elon-musk-queries-expertise-of-thai-cave-rescue-officials\">assigned a team of engineers</a> to design a submarine that he hoped could be used to guide the boys through underwater tunnels. Although Musk delivered the submarine to the rescue site, the boys were rescued by divers, one of whom died during the operation.</p> <p>Unsworth drew the ire of Musk following the rescue when he gave a brief interview to CNN and ridiculed his submarine, which he said \u201chad absolutely no chance of working\u201d. He added that Musk should \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts\u201d.</p> <p>The billionaire entrepreneur lashed out at Unsworth on Twitter, where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/15/elon-musk-british-diver-thai-cave-rescue-pedo-twitter\">called the caver a \u201cpedo guy\u201d</a> to his 22 million followers. Under intense criticism from the public and his company\u2019s investors, Musk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/18/elon-musk-apologises-for-calling-thai-cave-rescue-diver-a-pedo\">apologi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/18/elon-musk-apologises-for-calling-thai-cave-rescue-diver-a-pedo\">sed</a> and deleted the tweets, but he subsequently revived the baseless allegations in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/29/elon-musk-doubles-down-on-pedo-claims-against-uk-cave-diver\">another series of tweets</a> about a month later. Musk also alleged in another baseless allegation that Unsworth was a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/04/elon-musk-claims-diver-in-thai-cave-rescue-is-child-rapist-without-evidence\">child rapist</a>\u201d in an email to a BuzzFeed reporter.</p> <p>The jury selection process demonstrated Musk\u2019s fame. Numerous members of the jury pool disclosed business ties to Musk\u2019s various companies, which include Tesla, SpaceX, the Boring Company, Open AI and Neuralink. Four potential jurors were Tesla owners. One was dismissed when he said he could not be objective about the case because he was about to interview for a job with SpaceX, while two others were let go after saying they followed Musk on Twitter and knew the details of the case.</p> <p>Only one potential juror, an aesthetician, admitted to having strong opinions about billionaires. She was dismissed. Another juror had \u201cnegative and positive\u201d opinions about Musk, and he was allowed to remain.</p> <p>Attorneys for Unsworth and Musk sketched the contours of their cases in opening statements before the eight empaneled jurors. Taylor Wilson, part of Unsworth\u2019s legal team, focused on the number of times that Musk could have, but did not, clarify or retract his remarks about Unsworth.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until a year later that Musk said in a deposition that \u2018pedo guy\u2019 just meant \u2018creepy old guy\u2019,\u201d Wilson said. The result of Musk\u2019s statements was \u201cshame, mortification, worry and distress\u201d, he added, \u201cduring what should have been one of the proudest moments in [Unsworth\u2019s] life\u201d.</p> <p>Musk\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, dismissed Unsworth\u2019s defamation claim, casting the case as \u201cinsults between two men\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s saying he\u2019s been horribly damaged and he deserves lots of money,\u201d Spiro said of Unsworth. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Spiro described the \u201csleepless nights\u201d Musk\u2019s engineers spent \u201cfrantically trying to help\u201d the boys. He cast Unsworth as the aggressor in the pair\u2019s interactions, noting that the rescue was over and Musk had returned to the US when Unsworth gave his interview to CNN.</p> <p>\u201cWhen he saw this attack it did anger and hurt him,\u201d Spiro said of Musk. \u201cThe real hurtful part was attacking the genuineness of his efforts. That could not go unanswered.\u201d</p> <p>Calling Unsworth a \u201cpedo guy\u201d was not an allegation of pedophilia, but instead a \u201cfill-in-the-blank insult\u201d, the attorney argued. Spiro also introduced an acronym that appears likely to feature heavily in his arguments to come: J-Dart. \u201cIt was a joking, deleted, apologized for, responsive tweet,\u201d he said. \u201cA J-Dart.\u201d</p> <p>Spiro also said Unsworth had not been harmed by Musk\u2019s statements, noting that the cave explorer had since been honored by Queen Elizabeth and Thailand\u2019s King Maha Vajiralongkorn, among others.</p> <p>Later on Tuesday, Musk himself took the witness stand.</p> <p>Musk testified that his Twitter message was sent in response to an \u201cunprovoked\u201d insult he received from Unsworth.</p> <p>\u201cI thought he was just some random creepy guy,\u201d Musk added. \u201cI thought at the time that he was unrelated to the rescue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/juliacarriew/status/1202001027093843968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Highlights so far: <br>- Musk used to have google alerts for his name but no longer does. <br>- He watched video of Unsworth criticizing him 2-3 times before tweeting \u201cpedo guy\u201d<br>- If Musk had really thought Unsworth was a pedo, he would have bet more than $1<br><br> <a href=\"https://t.co/dVmhYBNoSV\">https://t.co/dVmhYBNoSV</a></p>&mdash; Julia Carrie Wong (@juliacarriew) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juliacarriew/status/1202001027093843968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 3, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Musk said he didn\u2019t know Unsworth had helped with the rescue and that his tweet wasn\u2019t intended as an actual allegation. \u201cJust as I hadn\u2019t literally meant he was a pedophile, he didn\u2019t want to shove a sub up my ass,\u201d Musk said.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s trial follows a year of legal wrangling between Unsworth and Musk\u2019s attorneys. Musk had attempted to have the case dismissed, arguing at one point that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/16/elon-musk-defamation-lawsuit-pedo-guy-tweet-diver\">pedo guy</a>\u201d is a common insult in his home country of South Africa and was not intended as an actual accusation of pedophilia. Court filings revealed that Musk had also hired a private investigator to attempt to substantiate his allegations against Unsworth.</p> <p>The US district judge Stephen Wilson ruled in November that Unsworth was not a public figure, lowering the bar for the cave explorer to prove that Musk had defamed him.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a gripping tale of peril and prowess that captivated the world for more than two tense weeks in the summer of 2018. Twelve boys and their football coach were lost in a subterranean maze in the Tham Luong caves in Thailand. An international team of cave divers raced to rescue them before monsoon rains were due to flood the caves. The story was destined to be fodder for a Hollywood blockbuster \u2013 and that was before an eccentric billionaire got involved. On Tuesday, a postscript to the feelgood tale of the Tham Luang cave rescue played out in a federal courthouse in Los Angeles as the trial began in a defamation case brought by the British caver Vernon Unsworth against Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk. Musk testified on Tuesday that he was being insulting, not literal, when he called Unsworth a pedophile in a tweet after the diver had ridiculed Musk on CNN. Musk said he was upset the diver had belittled his efforts to help by building a miniature submarine to transport the boys. Unsworth\u2019s comments were \u201can unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids\u201d, Musk said. \u201cIt was wrong and insulting, and so I insulted him back.\u201d Unsworth, a British national who lives in Thailand, was among the first divers to reach the scene of the boys\u2019 disappearance. He was credited by rescuers for his detailed knowledge of the cave system, which helped locate the missing team. Musk, the chief of Tesla and SpaceX, had assigned a team of engineers to design a submarine that he hoped could be used to guide the boys through underwater tunnels. Although Musk delivered the submarine to the rescue site, the boys were rescued by divers, one of whom died during the operation. Unsworth drew the ire of Musk following the rescue when he gave a brief interview to CNN and ridiculed his submarine, which he said \u201chad absolutely no chance of working\u201d. He added that Musk should \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts\u201d. The billionaire entrepreneur lashed out at Unsworth on Twitter, where he called the caver a \u201cpedo guy\u201d to his 22 million followers. Under intense criticism from the public and his company\u2019s investors, Musk apologised and deleted the tweets, but he subsequently revived the baseless allegations in another series of tweets about a month later. Musk also alleged in another baseless allegation that Unsworth was a \u201cchild rapist\u201d in an email to a BuzzFeed reporter. The jury selection process demonstrated Musk\u2019s fame. Numerous members of the jury pool disclosed business ties to Musk\u2019s various companies, which include Tesla, SpaceX, the Boring Company, Open AI and Neuralink. Four potential jurors were Tesla owners. One was dismissed when he said he could not be objective about the case because he was about to interview for a job with SpaceX, while two others were let go after saying they followed Musk on Twitter and knew the details of the case. Only one potential juror, an aesthetician, admitted to having strong opinions about billionaires. She was dismissed. Another juror had \u201cnegative and positive\u201d opinions about Musk, and he was allowed to remain. Attorneys for Unsworth and Musk sketched the contours of their cases in opening statements before the eight empaneled jurors. Taylor Wilson, part of Unsworth\u2019s legal team, focused on the number of times that Musk could have, but did not, clarify or retract his remarks about Unsworth. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until a year later that Musk said in a deposition that \u2018pedo guy\u2019 just meant \u2018creepy old guy\u2019,\u201d Wilson said. The result of Musk\u2019s statements was \u201cshame, mortification, worry and distress\u201d, he added, \u201cduring what should have been one of the proudest moments in [Unsworth\u2019s] life\u201d. Musk\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, dismissed Unsworth\u2019s defamation claim, casting the case as \u201cinsults between two men\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s saying he\u2019s been horribly damaged and he deserves lots of money,\u201d Spiro said of Unsworth. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d Spiro described the \u201csleepless nights\u201d Musk\u2019s engineers spent \u201cfrantically trying to help\u201d the boys. He cast Unsworth as the aggressor in the pair\u2019s interactions, noting that the rescue was over and Musk had returned to the US when Unsworth gave his interview to CNN. \u201cWhen he saw this attack it did anger and hurt him,\u201d Spiro said of Musk. \u201cThe real hurtful part was attacking the genuineness of his efforts. That could not go unanswered.\u201d Calling Unsworth a \u201cpedo guy\u201d was not an allegation of pedophilia, but instead a \u201cfill-in-the-blank insult\u201d, the attorney argued. Spiro also introduced an acronym that appears likely to feature heavily in his arguments to come: J-Dart. \u201cIt was a joking, deleted, apologized for, responsive tweet,\u201d he said. \u201cA J-Dart.\u201d Spiro also said Unsworth had not been harmed by Musk\u2019s statements, noting that the cave explorer had since been honored by Queen Elizabeth and Thailand\u2019s King Maha Vajiralongkorn, among others. Later on Tuesday, Musk himself took the witness stand. Musk testified that his Twitter message was sent in response to an \u201cunprovoked\u201d insult he received from Unsworth. \u201cI thought he was just some random creepy guy,\u201d Musk added. \u201cI thought at the time that he was unrelated to the rescue.\u201d Musk said he didn\u2019t know Unsworth had helped with the rescue and that his tweet wasn\u2019t intended as an actual allegation. \u201cJust as I hadn\u2019t literally meant he was a pedophile, he didn\u2019t want to shove a sub up my ass,\u201d Musk said. Tuesday\u2019s trial follows a year of legal wrangling between Unsworth and Musk\u2019s attorneys. Musk had attempted to have the case dismissed, arguing at one point that \u201cpedo guy\u201d is a common insult in his home country of South Africa and was not intended as an actual accusation of pedophilia. Court filings revealed that Musk had also hired a private investigator to attempt to substantiate his allegations against Unsworth. The US district judge Stephen Wilson ruled in November that Unsworth was not a public figure, lowering the bar for the cave explorer to prove that Musk had defamed him.

We have no programme to let people know about cholesterol. The first thing I would do is establish a cholesterol knowledge programme.\u201d For young adults the first remedy for high non-HDL cholesterol would be exercise and losing extra weight, followed by eating a healthier diet, said Blankenberg.</p> <p>The UK government\u2019s advisory body SACN (scientific advisory committee on nutrition) has said that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/saturated-fats-and-health-sacn-report\">dairy foods and meat are substantial dietary contributors to non-HDL cholesterol</a>. Frank Kee, a professor at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and another of the authors, said: \u201cThey made a strong recommendation that altering your diet lowered the incidence of [cardiovascular] events.\u201d</p> <p>Some younger people will have higher cholesterol levels for genetic reasons. The lead author of the paper, Fabian Brunner, had his cholesterol levels tested during the research and found that his non-HDL was high, even though he was only 34 and lean and fit.

Although in the short term the drugs are considered safe, with only rare or mild side-effects, experts say, they have not been tested or used over a long period of time.</p> <p>\u201cI myself will, first of all, follow up whether or not I can lower my non-HDL due to lifestyle modifications,\u201d said Brunner. \u201cIf not, I will definitely think about statin intake to prevent future cardiovascular events. However, I\u2019m aware that evidence about the long-term intake of statins \u2013 for me it would be 40-50 years! \u2013 and potential side-effects are sparse.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Baigent, director of the MRC Population Health Research Unit, at at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThis is an important paper because it shows what could be achieved if, starting early in their 40s, healthy people were to start taking a statin so that their bad cholesterol is halved for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, despite the fact that statins are safe and well tolerated, many healthy people would be reluctant to take a statin from early middle age.

      "bodyText": "All adults as young as 25, as well as older people, need to know of their \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d levels so they can change their lifestyle or take drugs to protect themselves against heart attacks or strokes in later life, say scientists. A landmark study involving data from nearly 400,000 people in 19 countries has established for the first time that levels of non-HDL, or \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d, in the blood are closely linked to the risk of heart disease across the entire life course. The research could lead to many younger people taking statins to lower their cholesterol levels. At the moment GPs prescribe the cholesterol-lowering drugs mostly to people in middle age. \u201cBad cholesterol\u201d at a high level, detected in some one under 45, is a greater risk for a heart attack or stroke by the age of 75 than high cholesterol at the age of 60, say the authors of the study, published in the Lancet medical journal. Treating four men in the under-45 age group to reduce \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d could prevent one of them having a heart attack or stroke in their lifetime. In women, such treatment could protect one in eight. The authors said it was important to know your \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol level from young adulthood; it gave you the chance to lower the level through exercise, a healthier diet, or by taking statins. \u201cWe need to start it early,\u201d said Stefan Blankenberg, a professor in Hamburg, Germany, who was part of the multinational cardiovascular risk consortium that carried out the modelling study. He said would he like to see new guidance for doctors. \u201cWe should at least put into the guidelines that non-HDL cholesterol determination should be an obligation. At a very young age \u2013 25 to 30. You need to know it. He added: \u201cIn German schools we have large anti-smoking programmes. We persuade populations not to smoke. We have no programme to let people know about cholesterol. The first thing I would do is establish a cholesterol knowledge programme.\u201d For young adults the first remedy for high non-HDL cholesterol would be exercise and losing extra weight, followed by eating a healthier diet, said Blankenberg. The UK government\u2019s advisory body SACN (scientific advisory committee on nutrition) has said that dairy foods and meat are substantial dietary contributors to non-HDL cholesterol. Frank Kee, a professor at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and another of the authors, said: \u201cThey made a strong recommendation that altering your diet lowered the incidence of [cardiovascular] events.\u201d Some younger people will have higher cholesterol levels for genetic reasons. The lead author of the paper, Fabian Brunner, had his cholesterol levels tested during the research and found that his non-HDL was high, even though he was only 34 and lean and fit. In such cases, doctors would be likely to prescribe statins. But younger people such as Brunner, who might be on the drugs for 40 years or more, might prefer lifestyle changes to medication if they could succeed in bringing down their bad cholesterol levels that way. Although in the short term the drugs are considered safe, with only rare or mild side-effects, experts say, they have not been tested or used over a long period of time. \u201cI myself will, first of all, follow up whether or not I can lower my non-HDL due to lifestyle modifications,\u201d said Brunner. \u201cIf not, I will definitely think about statin intake to prevent future cardiovascular events. However, I\u2019m aware that evidence about the long-term intake of statins \u2013 for me it would be 40-50 years! \u2013 and potential side-effects are sparse.\u201d Colin Baigent, director of the MRC Population Health Research Unit, at at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThis is an important paper because it shows what could be achieved if, starting early in their 40s, healthy people were to start taking a statin so that their bad cholesterol is halved for the rest of their lives. \u201cOf course, despite the fact that statins are safe and well tolerated, many healthy people would be reluctant to take a statin from early middle age. But the striking findings of this study show that a policy of recommending such treatment might be a long-term investment that leads to a substantial improvement in the health of older people in the years to come.\u201d",

When she launched her campaign at an outdoor rally in Oakland, California, in January, few in the crowd of more than 22,000 people could have guessed that she would be gone before Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, or Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur and political novice.</p> <p>In fact that rally was the high point. There was never a better moment in <a href=\"https://members.tortoisemedia.com/2019/09/17/kamala/content.html?sig=y0Oa5G58XzzOAqJLuXR39WsL38MC9dnbh7jld07yOkM\">the Harris campaign</a>.

She seemed to be the ideal person to cross-examine Trump on a debate stage and prosecute the case against his corruption, misogyny and racism.</p> <p>Harris raised an impressive $12m in the first three months of her campaign and quickly secured major endorsements in her home state, which offers the biggest haul of delegates in the Democratic primary contest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f3d036204965f9690bf311e0884d2d744184b5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f3d036204965f9690bf311e0884d2d744184b5e/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kamala Harris arrives at the Blue Jamboree in North Charleston, South Carolina, on 5 October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kamala Harris arrives at the Blue Jamboree in North Charleston, South Carolina, on 5 October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Blanco/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as the competition grew, Harris\u2019s fundraising flatlined and the media shone its light elsewhere. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren pulled in tens of millions of dollars from grassroots supporters, while Buttigieg drew money from traditional donors.</p> <p>Some detected bias. <a href=\"http://www.mslatoshabrown.com/\">LaTosha Brown,</a> co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said: \u201cI feel in many ways the women, and Kamala in particular as a black woman, were not treated the same as the white men in this race. There was an environment of sexism and racism.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, reports emerged that Harris\u2019s staff complained about being badly treated; another female candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar, has faced similar allegations. Brown commented: \u201cI only hear complaints about the women. Either all the men are just nice bosses or they are not judged by the same standard. I have not heard a real critique of what kind of managers the white men are.</p> <p>\u201cThe white men can just turn up and be charismatic and that\u2019s enough. For some reason, a woman has to be an extreme nurturer or a stellar boss. When Pete Buttigieg had a surge, he got all kind of press. I never saw that kind of headline for her; she always came in from behind. If you look at how she was treated as a candidate, it was completely different.\u201d</p> <p>Others argue that Harris, who constantly stressed the need to \u201cspeak the truth\u201d on race and other issues, lacked ideology and seemed vague and inconsistent on policy.</p> <p>Like other Democrats, she stumbled over the issue of healthcare, at first indicating that she supported abolishing private health insurance, then back-pedalling and claiming she had misheard a question at one of the debates. She eventually released a plan that preserved a role for private insurance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"442993a35ecc624f736d0bfb20966498ab81d380\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/442993a35ecc624f736d0bfb20966498ab81d380/0_3_3186_1912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kamala Harris confronts former vice-president Joe Biden during the second Democratic presidential debate in Detroit, Michigan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kamala Harris confronts former vice-president Joe Biden during the second Democratic presidential debate in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in June, struggling to break former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s lock on African American voters, Harris produced arguably the stand-out moment of the primary debates so far.

However, it also produced sympathy for Biden and a backlash that denied Harris momentum. In the following debates, she seemed to fade into the background.</p> <p>Other catchphrases or stunts never quite took off. There was a \u201c3am agenda\u201d about the hopes and fears that wake people up at three in the morning. It echoed, perhaps unfortunately, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 ad about who is best qualified to answer a 3am phone call in a crisis.</p> <p>And Harris could never quite escape progressive scepticism about her past. She started her career in Oakland, serving as a local prosecutor in the 1990s, before becoming the first African American and the first woman elected as San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and as California attorney general in 2010.</p> <p>During her presidential run, Harris billed herself as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d. She titled her first book Smart on Crime \u2013 looking to leave the \u201chard on crime\u201d and \u201csoft on crime\u201d stereotypes behind.</p> <p>Yet Harris\u2019s contradictory, complicated record as a prosecutor in California corroded her presidential bid.

      "bodyText": "Newspaper editors infamously prepare obituaries before their subjects have died, keeping them ominously in reserve until the moment of truth. The writing was on the wall for Senator Kamala Harris last week when both the New York Times and Washington Post published political obituaries about a campaign in disarray. The death of the dream that a woman of colour could become the next US president was officially pronounced at 1.19pm on Tuesday in an email to supporters with the subject heading: \u201cI am suspending my campaign today.\u201d Harris was the biggest name so far to withdraw from a crowded and volatile 2020 presidential race. When she launched her campaign at an outdoor rally in Oakland, California, in January, few in the crowd of more than 22,000 people could have guessed that she would be gone before Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, or Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur and political novice. In fact that rally was the high point. There was never a better moment in the Harris campaign. Apart from a classic debate soundbite, it was all downhill from there for a candidate whose campaign succumbed to factional infighting and whose \u201clet\u2019s have a conversation\u201d mantra was ill-suited to the political moment. \u201cFrom my perspective, she never connected with the electorate,\u201d says Moe Vela, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden and board director for TransparentBusiness. \u201cI don\u2019t think voters ever got to see her true and authentic self due to vacillating policy stances and plans. There was an inconsistency to her at a time when voters are seeking stability. \u201cCombining that with a campaign team that appeared to be in turmoil, you have a recipe for disaster.\u201d On paper, Harris, 55, should have been the ideal antidote to Donald Trump: a \u201cfemale Barack Obama\u201d who could rebuild his coalition. Like the former president, she is mixed race (her father from Jamaica, her mother from India), spent part of her childhood abroad (in Canada) and became a lawyer, then the first black US senator in California\u2019s history. In congressional hearings, Harris had tormented Jeff Sessions and other figures from the Trump administration. She seemed to be the ideal person to cross-examine Trump on a debate stage and prosecute the case against his corruption, misogyny and racism. Harris raised an impressive $12m in the first three months of her campaign and quickly secured major endorsements in her home state, which offers the biggest haul of delegates in the Democratic primary contest. But as the competition grew, Harris\u2019s fundraising flatlined and the media shone its light elsewhere. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren pulled in tens of millions of dollars from grassroots supporters, while Buttigieg drew money from traditional donors. Some detected bias. LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said: \u201cI feel in many ways the women, and Kamala in particular as a black woman, were not treated the same as the white men in this race. There was an environment of sexism and racism.\u201d In recent weeks, reports emerged that Harris\u2019s staff complained about being badly treated; another female candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar, has faced similar allegations. Brown commented: \u201cI only hear complaints about the women. Either all the men are just nice bosses or they are not judged by the same standard. I have not heard a real critique of what kind of managers the white men are. \u201cThe white men can just turn up and be charismatic and that\u2019s enough. For some reason, a woman has to be an extreme nurturer or a stellar boss. When Pete Buttigieg had a surge, he got all kind of press. I never saw that kind of headline for her; she always came in from behind. If you look at how she was treated as a candidate, it was completely different.\u201d Others argue that Harris, who constantly stressed the need to \u201cspeak the truth\u201d on race and other issues, lacked ideology and seemed vague and inconsistent on policy. Like other Democrats, she stumbled over the issue of healthcare, at first indicating that she supported abolishing private health insurance, then back-pedalling and claiming she had misheard a question at one of the debates. She eventually released a plan that preserved a role for private insurance. But in June, struggling to break former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s lock on African American voters, Harris produced arguably the stand-out moment of the primary debates so far. She accused Biden of past opposition to bussing, an effort to racially integrate government schools. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,\u201d Harris said, before delivering the killer line: \u201cThat little girl was me.\u201d Biden\u2019s head snapped around to look at her. It was a blow to the solar plexus. He tried to defend himself but, up against the clock, blurted out: \u201cMy time is up. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The line, \u201cThat little girl was me,\u201d rapidly appeared on T-shirts and a Saturday Night Live parody. However, it also produced sympathy for Biden and a backlash that denied Harris momentum. In the following debates, she seemed to fade into the background. Other catchphrases or stunts never quite took off. There was a \u201c3am agenda\u201d about the hopes and fears that wake people up at three in the morning. It echoed, perhaps unfortunately, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 ad about who is best qualified to answer a 3am phone call in a crisis. And Harris could never quite escape progressive scepticism about her past. She started her career in Oakland, serving as a local prosecutor in the 1990s, before becoming the first African American and the first woman elected as San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and as California attorney general in 2010. During her presidential run, Harris billed herself as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d. She titled her first book Smart on Crime \u2013 looking to leave the \u201chard on crime\u201d and \u201csoft on crime\u201d stereotypes behind. Yet Harris\u2019s contradictory, complicated record as a prosecutor in California corroded her presidential bid. Even as she started programmes to steer low-level drug offenders away from prison, she boasted about increasing conviction rates and supported fellow prosecutors accused of misconduct. Her anti-truancy programme, which led to the arrest of parents whose children were chronically absent, her inaction on police brutality and her opposition to decriminalising sex work also drew criticism from progressive voters. Eventually, she decided to embrace this biography with the slogan \u201cJustice Is on the Ballot\u201d, and by vowing to \u201cprosecute the case\u201d against a \u201ccriminal\u201d president. California, which should have been a stronghold, proved problematic in other ways. Bill Whalen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University, wrote in the Washington Post last month: \u201cAnalysts seeking to understand the Kamala Harris flop need look no further than Harris\u2019s ostensible selling point: her record in California. After nearly three years as the state\u2019s junior senator, Harris doesn\u2019t have much to show for herself. \u201cTake, for example, Harris\u2019s signature policy issue. What is it?

Residents living on Avery Lane in the suburb of Stanford Merthyr were earlier told to seek shelter from the fire and it was too late to leave. \u201cThe fire has escalated quite quickly,\u201d an RFS spokesman said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s moving in an easterly direction towards Avery Lane.\u201d The greater Hunter region was under severe fire danger warnings on Wednesday, with very high fire danger for much of the coastal and northern regions. Western Australia An emergency notice was issued for an out-of-control bushfire in Forrestdale, south-east of Perth in Western Australia on Tuesday evening, threatening lives and homes, before being downgraded overnight. Residents were urged to leave for a safer place if the way was clear, or prepare to shelter in their homes in a room with two exits and water such as a kitchen or laundry. The fire was contained and under control by Wednesday morning, but Forrestdale primary school was closed. Help from Canada A group of 21 Canadian firefighters were preparing to travel to Australia to help with the fires over the Christmas period for an expected 38-day deployment. Australian officials submitted an official request to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, based in Winnipeg, on Friday and at the weekend dozens of experienced firefighters from provinces across Canada volunteered to give up Christmas with their families and fly to Australia. \u201cWe are pleased to help the people of Australia as they face these devastating fires, especially since Manitoba has been on the receiving end of help from friends and neighbours when wildfires and other natural disasters hit our province,\u201d the premier of the Canadian province of Manitoba, Brian Pallister, said. Sydney Smoke haze was again forecast for several regions on Wednesday, including metropolitan Sydney, where temperatures were predicted to reach 33C in the west. A fire at Three Mile, in the Hawkesbury region north-west of Sydney, remained out of control and at a watch and act warning level on Wednesday morning. A fire near Cranebrook in western Sydney was also downgraded to \u201cadvice\u201d level after an emergency alert was issued briefly on Tuesday afternoon. Sydney was ringed by bushfires on Tuesday with thick smoke settling in the city\u2019s basin, blown from large bushfires in the Blue Mountains, near Warragamba Dam and in the Hawkesbury area. Air quality was \u201chazardous\u201d in Sydney\u2019s east and south-west on Tuesday afternoon but \u201cgood\u201d in the city\u2019s north-west. Conditions improved slightly on Wednesday morning. Fitzsimmons said a \u201ctemperature inversion\u201d had trapped the smoke in the Sydney basin and the haze was unlikely to lift in the short term. \u201cAll those fires and some a little further afield are all impacting on the smoke inundation around the Sydney basin,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a general westerly pattern to a lot of these winds that\u2019s going to continue to bring smoke right across the Sydney basin, and if we get another inversion effect like we saw this morning, some of that will get trapped.\u201d On Monday NSW police expressed concerns about the number of people deliberately lighting fires amid increased risk. Lake Illawarra Insp Brian Pedersen said it was distressing to see people ignoring the warnings of emergency services. Police spoke to three 12-year-old boys after two fires were deliberately lit in the Lake Illawarra region at the weekend. \u201cWe are urging the whole community to be vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour,\u201d Pedersen said. Two million hectares of NSW land have burned since July in more than 7,000 fires, with authorities calling it the \u201cmost challenging bushfire season ever\u201d. Six people have died and 673 homes have been destroyed. NSW Health said children, older adults and people with heart and lung conditions were the most susceptible to smoke and air pollution. \u201cIf you have asthma or a lung condition, reduce outdoor activities if smoke levels are high and if shortness of breath or coughing develops, take your reliever medicine or seek medical advice,\u201d it said.

      "bodyText": "Tiger Woods has said he rejected the opportunity to play in a European Tour event in Saudi Arabia for the second year in succession but defended Phil Mickelson\u2019s decision to travel to the Middle East. Woods could have earned $3m from appearing in the Saudi International in late January, with 2020 the second playing of the tournament. Mickelson is the latest and most high-profile player to be subject to a backlash for being part of the field in Saudi Arabia. The country\u2019s appalling record on human rights and role in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi has raised questions about golf\u2019s willingness to stage an event there. Players are paid significant appearance fees but a lucrative cheque was not sufficient to coax Woods. He did not say this troubling backdrop was behind his decision not to take part, however. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to go over there,\u201d the Masters champion said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way.\u201d This week Amnesty International accused the Saudi government of trying to \u201csportswash\u201d the country\u2019s image. Asked whether it is fair Mickelson has been criticised, Woods replied: \u201cI understand the politics behind it but also the game of golf can help heal a lot of that, too. It can help grow it [the game], and also a lot of top players are going to be playing there. \u201cIt\u2019s traditionally not a golf hotbed, the Middle East, but it has grown quite a bit. I remember going to Dubai for my first time and seeing maybe two or three buildings in the skyline. Now there is a New York city skyline. Again, golf has grown. There were only a few courses when I went to Dubai and now they\u2019re everywhere. Same with Abu Dhabi and maybe eventually in Saudi Arabia.\u201d Mickelson, a longtime darling of golf fans, took to social media to post a series of bizarre defences of his Saudi trip. The 49-year-old said his critics will \u201cbe OK\u201d and added: \u201cAfter turning down opportunities to go to the Middle East for many years, I\u2019m excited to go play and see a place in the world I\u2019ve never been.\u201d Mickelson has twice played at the European Tour\u2019s annual event in Abu Dhabi. He insisted it would be \u201cstupid\u201d to visit Saudi Arabia privately \u201cgiven the opportunity I have to go play and compete while visiting\u201d. Jon Rahm, the European Tour\u2019s player of the year, claimed the Saudi Invitational was now a Rolex Series event. While that will not be the case in 2020, the possibility remains live in the future. Rahm has not ruled out a Saudi appearance but cited his preference is to play on the US west coast at that time of year. Woods will have Justin Thomas for playing company in the first round of the Hero World Challenge that begins in the Bahamas on Wednesday.",

Linen, cultivated from the flax plant, is one of the oldest fibres in the world. Ancient Egyptians used fine-woven linen for burial wraps and to project class status.

So it should be no surprise that as consumers become more focused on sustainability, this natural fabric has resonated.</p> <p>And of course linen\u2019s surging popularity can also be attributed to its practicality. Felicity Brand, head buyer and merchandiser of Australian boutiques Mode Sportif, says: \u201cLinen is key to keeping cool from a functional perspective and that is probably why Australian brands excel at it.\u201d</p> <p>Little surprise then that sought after Australian resort wear brands such as Matteau and Albus Lumen are very much linen based. Like fashion, several Australian homewares and bedding companies that specialise in linen have also emerged in the past few years, including Cultiver, Bed Threads, Mother Daughter and In Bed, and children\u2019s linen needs are met by Mini Marley and Children of the Tribe.</p> <p>In Byron Bay, free-range families roam in packs and life is carefully curated for immediate Instagram gratification.

      "bodyText": "We eat off linen tablecloths and sleep on crumpled linen sheets. Our sofas are upholstered with it, our curtains draped from it, our children\u2019s clothes are cut from it and so are our own. According to the global linen supply market 2019 industry research report, the global linen supply market was US$7.5bn in 2018 and is expected to hit US$9.6bn by the end of 2025, at an annual growth rate of 3.1%. Google searches for \u201clinen\u201d always increase in the summer but this November saw Australia\u2019s highest-ever interest in the textile. Gemma Riberti, head of lifestyle and interiors from global trend forecasting agency WGSN, says: \u201cLinen is certainly having a moment, driven by the overarching trend taking over fashion and home, towards celebrating craft and artisanality \u2026 Linen\u2019s rawer, irregular hand resonates well with consumers that seek more honest and authentic lifestyles in reaction to ever-digitised lives.\u201d We\u2019re certainly not the first generation to be wrapped up in the fabric. Linen, cultivated from the flax plant, is one of the oldest fibres in the world. Ancient Egyptians used fine-woven linen for burial wraps and to project class status. From the middle ages through to the 18th century, linen was used for domestic textiles, clothing and bedding. It has eco-friendly credentials, too. The flax plant can grow with just rainwater, without irrigation or pesticides, and when left untreated (ie not chemically dyed) it is fully biodegradable. So it should be no surprise that as consumers become more focused on sustainability, this natural fabric has resonated. And of course linen\u2019s surging popularity can also be attributed to its practicality. Felicity Brand, head buyer and merchandiser of Australian boutiques Mode Sportif, says: \u201cLinen is key to keeping cool from a functional perspective and that is probably why Australian brands excel at it.\u201d Little surprise then that sought after Australian resort wear brands such as Matteau and Albus Lumen are very much linen based. Like fashion, several Australian homewares and bedding companies that specialise in linen have also emerged in the past few years, including Cultiver, Bed Threads, Mother Daughter and In Bed, and children\u2019s linen needs are met by Mini Marley and Children of the Tribe. In Byron Bay, free-range families roam in packs and life is carefully curated for immediate Instagram gratification. For Emma Lane, co-founder of The Farm in Byron Bay, the portrayal of an effortless, linen-clad life has led to a cult-like social media following. Always pictured swathed in billowy linens, she loves linen for its sustainability and its natural, muted colours. \u201cEven in its natural form (ecru, ivory, grey\u2026) it\u2019s so much more beautiful to me.\u201d Aesthetically it matches her bohemian fashion sense and being a mother of four, the durability compared with other fabrics is a bonus, plus \u201cit looks good crumpled\u201d. However, linen\u2019s popularity lies not just in its sustainability, its durability or its simplicity. It owes its popularity to its ability to combine these zeitgeisty sentiments with its status as a premium textile (and a high price tag). Jane Goldney of The Drapery, an eco-friendly fabric retailer in Adelaide, provides an insight into how linen denotes luxury. She says European-sourced linens have sold particularly well since 2013. Though more expensive in terms of supply and production, Goldney says consumers are willing to pay a premium for \u201cquality and tradition\u201d.

Founded in 1949, the treaty provides that if one country is attacked, all Nato members would collectively respond. Nato was set up to counter the threat of the Soviet Union.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The 12 founding members were: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, United Kingdom and the United States.</p>\n    <p>Over the years the organisation has expanded to its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52044.htm\">current membership of 29</a>. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, North Macedonia and Ukraine are recognised as states with aspirations to join.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it meeting in London?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This week's summit marks a celebration of the 70th anniversary of the organisation. London was chosen partly because it was the location of the original headquarters of the organisation when it was founded.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is on the agenda?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>During the two-day gathering there will be addresses by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, a formal reception at Buckingham Palace hosted by the Queen, and a meeting of the North Atlantic Council attended by heads of state and government. The agenda features discussions about Russia, China and the future of arms control. There will also be a series of bilateral meetings between leaders - the most testing of which are likely to feature Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan looking for support for his country's recent incursion into Syria.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What's the context?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Infighting is a major issue. For the third summit in a row, Donald Trump is expected to renew demands that European allies and Canada step up defence spending. He is also unhappy with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, over a tax on American tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook.</p>\n    <p>For his part Macron has lamented Nato's \"brain death\" due to a lack of US leadership, and said the organisation needs a wake-up call. He insists that strategic questions must be addressed, like improving ties with Russia and how to handle an unpredictable ally like Turkey.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In turn, Erdo\u011fan has lashed out at Macron.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has again sought to pile pressure on the Conservative party over the status of the NHS in any future trade deal with the US, as Donald Trump arrived in London just over a week from polling day. Despite the US president insisting that he would not be interested in access to the NHS if it was presented \u201con a silver platter\u201d, the Labour leader said he remained deeply sceptical of Trump\u2019s claims and vowed to tackle him personally over the issue. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, why have these talks gone on for two years?\u201d Corbyn said to the BBC. \u201cWhy have they been kept secret? Why was, on a freedom of information request, the document only produced in redacted form? And eventually the full text has been released.\u201d After Trump touched down for this week\u2019s Nato summit late on Monday night, Johnson spent much of Tuesday trying to avoid the US president \u2013 conscious that he could derail his carefully controlled election campaign \u2013 instead travelling to Salisbury in the Tory election battle bus. Trump, who last time he was in London started a wave of rumours about NHS privatisation post-Brexit, appeared to have been carefully briefed to not upset Johnson\u2019s election campaign. He insisted he had \u201cno thoughts\u201d about the 12 December election, while still noting that he supported Brexit and believed Johnson would \u201cdo a good job\u201d.

We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter. We want nothing to do with it.\u201d Corbyn was attending a reception with Trump at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening outside which noisy protests took place against potential risks to the NHS from a future US-UK trade deal. Asked what he would tell the US president if they chatted, Corbyn said: \u201cI will say, \u2018Welcome to this country. I hope you\u2019ll understand how precious our National Health Service is, and in any future trade relationship with the USA, none of our public services are on the table, none of our public services are for sale.\u201d For his part, when asked whether he could work with Corbyn if the Labour leader won the election, Trump said: \u201cI can work with him.

He wanted to speak only about the club as an opponent. \u201cI\u2019m not a villain, I\u2019m not an enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the coach trying to win against United \u2013 that\u2019s how the United fans are going to look at me.\u201d For Mourinho it always comes down to trophies. \u201cMr Mandela said you never lose, you win or you learn,\u201d he said. \u201cAt United, I won and I learned.\u201d He did not go into specifics as to what he had learned, other than to say he and his assistants had not looked to blame anyone other than themselves for how it ended, but he was happy to remember the trophies. \u201cI have a couple of pictures of my time at United in my office at Spurs,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cOne with the Europa League trophy and my son in Stockholm [where the final was played] and one with the Carabao Cup, when you get the cup at the top of Wembley.\u201d Mourinho feels he is a \u201cbetter coach now than when I was there\u201dand he continues to whisper sweet nothings into the ears of his Spurs players. He said he is \u201cin love with\u201d Son Heung-min and Dele Alli could achieve \u201canything he wants\u201d. The contract rebels, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen, are \u201cgreat professionals\u201d. This is what Mourinho does in the early stages. From leading players down to the ballboys, it is about bolstering belief, instilling a shared sense of purpose. Spurs go to United brimming with confidence after three wins out of three for Mourinho, who is projecting an image of total happiness. Not that he was unhappy in Manchester, where he lived in an apartment at the Lowry hotel \u2013 a subject of no little lampoonery. \u201cI would be unhappy if I was in a house on my own,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI would have to clean; I don\u2019t want. I would have to iron; I don\u2019t know how to. I have to cook \u2026 I would cook fried eggs and sausages \u2013 that\u2019s the only thing I can do. I lived in an amazing apartment \u2013 a flat with \u2018bring me a latte, please\u2019, or \u2018I don\u2019t want to go down for dinner, bring my dinner up\u2019. I had everything. I was more than fine.\u201d",

Yet the manager is confident that supporters can see the bigger picture. \u201cI can just go on the evidence of the game days and supporters I\u2019ve met,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not many I\u2019ve met that say: \u2018You\u2019ve got to do something different.\u2019 They can see what we\u2019re trying to do. They know there\u2019s a lot of work being done behind the scenes \u2013 putting a culture into the team, with what\u2019s happening here at Carrington [in training]. We just need results. All the six games we\u2019ve drawn, I feel we should\u2019ve won. That\u2019s the evidence; that\u2019s all the answer we can give.\u201d As Solskj\u00e6r approaches the one-year anniversary of his interim appointment at the club, on 19 December, he believes patience is required as he attempts to make United contenders again. \u201cEveryone knows continuity is one of the keys of success,\u201d he said. \u201cSome clubs have more patience than others, some clubs don\u2019t have that time and continuity. We have a plan in place and hopefully we can get the results to speed it up. \u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t go at the speed you want but it\u2019s still going in the right direction. There\u2019s different aspects to this: it\u2019s on the pitch, it\u2019s behind the scenes, it\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the club.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r did not wish to offer a precise gauge of United\u2019s progress under him. \u201cHow long is a piece of rope?\u201d he said. \u201cResults will change moods but the mood behind the scenes is positive. I can\u2019t sit here and just talk about that; we want results. I feel we\u2019re going to stick to the plan we\u2019ve put together. Results will probably speed that up.\u201d He says he has no fear of the sack despite the recent removals of Unai Emery by Arsenal, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores by Watford and Mauricio Pochettino by Tottenham. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t make me more concerned. I\u2019m just focusing on my job and that\u2019s doing as well as I can.\u201d Yet unless Spurs, Manchester City on Saturday and then Everton the following weekend are beaten, Solskj\u00e6r will not better the 26 points from 17 matches Jos\u00e9 Mourinho accrued before he was sacked last December. Mourinho returns to Old Trafford as the Tottenham manager and Solskj\u00e6r predicts \u201ca very good reception\u201d. He added: \u201cThat\u2019s just a testament to this club and these supporters, remembering he was here for two and a-half years and won trophies. I\u2019m 100% sure our fans, staff and club will welcome him.\u201d In the close season United bought Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Daniel James and Harry Maguire while selling Romelu Lukaku and allowing Chris Smalling and Alexis S\u00e1nchez to be loaned out, while Ander Herrera departed as a free agent. The manager hinted that the timing of Maguire\u2019s acquisition, three days before the window closed, and Lukaku\u2019s sale 24 hours before the deadline, hampered him in the market. \u201cWe do have a clear picture of what the squad is going to look like in June, July,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHopefully, you get as much done as soon as possible. With Harry coming in, Romelu going out, it was late. We do have a plan now.\u201d Paul Pogba is still not fit as he recovers from an ankle injury. \u201cHe\u2019s still a bit away but working hard so let\u2019s see \u2013 he\u2019s out on the grass,\u201d the manager said. The availability of Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic is also in the balance because of injuries.",

Here are five key findings:</p> \n<h2>1) \u2018The evidence of the president\u2019s misconduct is overwhelming\u2019</h2> \n<p>In reply to Trump and the Republicans\u2019 insistence that the investigation has gathered no evidence of wrongdoing, the 300-page report brandishes 100 hours of testimony from 17 witnesses and 30 hours of public hearings. The report also presents never-before-seen call records showing that Rudy Giuliani was in direct contact with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget after military aid to Ukraine was suspended.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe evidence of the president\u2019s misconduct is overwhelming, and so too is the evidence of his obstruction of Congress.

      "bodyText": "Jamie Jackson has filed his match report, so I shall leave you with that. Thanks for your company - goodnight. Peep peep! Manchester City move to within eight points of Liverpool, at least for the next 24 hours, after a swaggering performance at Turf Moor. Gabriel Jesus scored two fine goals, the superb Rodri scorched a third and the substitute Riyad Mahrez added a fourth. It was close to peak City, although they will be annoyed that they again failed to keep a clean sheet. 90 min Three minutes of added Prime. No clean sheet for City. The ball ricochets around the area and falls kindly for Robbie Brady, who slams it past the outrushing Ederson. Riyad Mahrez hadn\u2019t settled for 3-0. He beats Mee with a stepover on the edge of the area and drives a low right-footed shot into the bottom corner. That\u2019s another excellent goal. In fact, City have produced quite a portfolio tonight. 86 min Hendrick is booked for a naughty lunge at David Silva. 85 min Fernandinho is replaced by Eric Garcia. 85 min Both teams have settled for this scoreline. Saying which, Angelino whistles a cross shot just wide of the far post. 83 min \u201cDecent win for City,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cLooks like they\u2019re really taking control of the battle for third place #bantz\u201d You should banter responsibly. 80 min Phil Foden comes on for the last 10 minutes. He replaces the majestic Kevin De Bruyne. 77 min Mahrez\u2019s imaginative pass/cross towards David Silva is headed behind by the stretching Tarkowski. 76 min \u201cI wish the person Jesus pretends to phone every time he bags a goal would hurry up and call him,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cLike me, it\u2019s getting seriously old.\u201d 75 min Another Burnley change: Robbie Brady replaces the ever impressive Dwight McNeil. 72 min Riyad Mahrez replaces Raheem Sterling, who was a booking away from missing Saturday\u2019s Manchester derby. 70 min Rodri has had a fine game, perhaps his best for City. Rodri makes it 3-0 with a thumping finish. David Silva had a shot blocked by a Burnley defender, with the ball rebounding to Rodri just outside the D. He waited for it to sit up before cutting across a vicious first-time shot that beat Pope and flew into the top of the net. Pick that out. 65 min Burnley have had a bit more of the game since reverting to 4-4-2. City still look very comfortable, mind. 64 min \u201cThe only suspense left in this fixture,\u201d says Mary Waltz, \u201cis whether City can keep a clean sheet.\u201d It\u2019s been a while \u2013 26 October was their last. 62 min A good header from Rodriguez finds McNeil, who galumphs down the left and hits a fine, deep cross that is headed behind by Angelino. 61 min Rodri goes shoulder to shoulder with Barnes, who dives to win a free-kick. McNeil swings a decent effort on target from 25 yards that is comfortbaly saved by Emerson. 60 min \u201cPalace are 5th with 21 points,\u201d says an anonymous emailer. \u201cAdd 12 points and they would only go up to third. Take away 12 and they\u2019d be bottom.\u201d 59 min A double change for Burnley: Jay Rodriguez and Ashley Barnes replace Danny Drinkwater and Chris Wood. 58 min De Bruyne drives high over the bar from 25 yards. 57 min Walker\u2019s shot deflects wide, and then Bernardo Silva\u2019s cutback is cleared desperately. This could get very nasty for Burnley, such are the waves of City attacks. 55 min City have been excellent tonight, especially Gabriel Jesus and the midfield three of Rodri, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne. Burnley have struggled to lay a glove on them. In other news, Crystal Palace have gone fifth in the table after being Bournemouth 1-0 at Selhurst Park. Roy for England! 53 min Gabriel Jesus comes this close to his hat-trick. He turned Tarkowski deliciously on the left side of the area, moved the ball onto his right foot and placed a curling shot just wide from a tight angle. Another fine goal from Gabriel Jesus gives City a deserved two-goal lead. They moved the ball around for ages before Bernardo Silva, on the right, whipped an inswinging cross towards the far post. Jesus got in front of Bardsley, six yards from goal, and adjusted his body smartly to slam a volley into the net via the post. 49 min City have picked up where they left off, with the game being played almost exclusively in Burnley\u2019s half. 47 min \u201cHi again Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI\u2019ve just bought a 7-in-1 multi grooming kit and some chewing gum. It\u2019s getting delivered yesterday, for free. All this, and football too. Jeff Bezos for President!\u201d If he wants my vote he needs to start selling time travel. 46 min Peep peep! City begin the second half, kicking from left to right on the old Amazon Prime app. Half-time chit-chat \u201c\u2018The Sprawling Pope\u2019\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cHow has this pub name not been taken?!?\u201d \u201cWith a great save by Pope and a great goal by Jesus,\u201d says Peter Oh, \u201cthe spirit is certainly moving in this match!\u201d Half-time reading Peep peep! City lead deservedly through Gabriel Jesus\u2019s delicious curler. Burnley\u2019s 4-2-3-1 system has not really worked, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see Ashley Barnes in the second half. 45 min David Silva has been the best player on the field. I thought, earlier in the year, that he was over the hill but he has played beautifully of late. In other news, McNeil\u2019s volley in the 43rd-minute actually hit his team-mate Wood. 44 min Burnley need half-time. At 1-0, they are still in the game. At 2-0, they are likely to suffer. 43 min A chance at both ends! McNeil\u2019s fierce volley was blocked by one of many City bodies in the six-yard box; City raced down the other end, where Bernardo Silva\u2019s low shot was kicked away by Pope. 40 min \u201cHiya Rob,\u201d says Matthew Rodriguez. \u201cWith all the tech talk, any chance we will ever see the interface you guys use to upload your commentary?\u201d Of course. I\u2019ve taken a quick selfie to give you an idea. 38 min Burnley have their first attack in a while. McNeil\u2019s excellent cross is headed behind by the stretching Walker. Hendrick swings it under the bar, where Drinkwater is penalised for manhandling Ederson. 36 min De Bruyne\u2019s deflected long-range shot is comfortably saved by the sprawling Pope. 35 min Burnley haven\u2019t had a kick since going behind. 32 min: Great save from Pope! City moved the ball around for an age before Bernardo Silva released De Bruyne on the right of the area. He crossed low into the six-yard box, where Sterling and Jesus arrived almost simultaneously. Sterling got to the ball first and stabbed a shot that was crucially blocked by the outstretched leg of Pope. 32 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Patrick Cullen. \u201cI was going to try and make myself seem clever by pointing out where the Sparkle Motion quote comes from, but I think we\u2019ve all seen Bonanza...\u201d 31 min City have looked more relaxed in possession since the goal. This is a dangerous spell for Burnley, who have struggled to get out of their half in the last few minutes. 29 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cIs it just me or have referees this season been more alert to Citeh\u2019s penchant for the tactical foul and readier to award cards for it? I\u2019ve no theories about any coincidental decline in performance.\u201d Let me just ask Cyril what I think. 26 min City are unhappy with Tarkowski\u2019s ball-and-man challenge on David Silva near the halfway line. He followed through into the side of Silva\u2019s leg with a fair bit of force, though the officials saw nothing wrong. It has changed the mood at Turf Moor, though, with an affronted home crowd now making plenty of noise. 25 min De Bruyne was down for a little while after a challenge from Cork during that City break. He seems to be fine now. Pieters crossed too close to Ederson and City were straight on the counter-attack. Eventually David Silva played a simple ball to Gabriel Jesus on the left wing. He moved into the area, used Bardsley as a screen and bent a glorious rising shot into the far corner. That was a classic finish, and Pope had no chance. What a beautiful goal! 22 min City have had lots of the ball, with De Bruyne influential as ever, but they are yet to create a chance. I suspect Sean Dyche will be the happier manager just now. 18 min Otamendi is warned by the referee Jon Moss after a foul on Wood. He looks a wee bit rattled by Wood\u2019s fibrous approach. 17 min Bardsley plays a speculative ball over the top for Wood, who is just beaten to it by Ederson. Good goalkeeping. 17 min It\u2019s been a pretty open start to the game. Burnley look like they can cause City problems, which hasn\u2019t always been the case in this fixture. 15 min Bernardo Silva is booked for a tactical foul on McNeil. 12 min De Bruyne surges forward from the halfway line, moves the ball away from Mee and hits a low left-footed shot from 25 yards. It\u2019s too close to Pope, who makes a comfortable save. 11 min \u201cSo,\u201d says Cromwell49, \u201cBournemouth game not worthy of minute-by-minute coverage, eh?\u201d You haven\u2019t read the preamble, have you? Sometimes I seriously doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion. 10 min Bernardo Silva cuts infield and hits a 20-yard shot that is blocked. 9 min A long ball forward gives Wood the chance to manhandle Otamendi, who ends up on all fours in the City penalty area. Nothing comes of it but I doubt Otamendi will be relishing the next hoof forward. 8 min \u201cWhere\u2019s Hendrick playing, Rob?\u201d asks Paul Neilan. He\u2019s in the Pereira role, as a kind of defensive No10. 7 min: JESUS HAS A GOAL DISALLOWED! He was offside. It would have been a lovely goal, mind. De Bruyne drove the corner to the edge of the box, where Angelino belted a volley towards goal. It was slightly off target and came to Jesus, who instinctively flicked the ball behind his standing leg and into the net. He was, alas, a long way offside. 6 min Walker\u2019s cross deflects off Pieters and onto the roof o fthe net. Pope had it covered but it\u2019s a corner for City, the first of the match... 4 min Jesus scoots into the area on the left, turns back inside Mee and is tackled by Tarkowski. No matter: he was offside. 2 min City deal slightly uncomfortably with a couple of long punts forward. 1 min Peep peep! Burnley, in claret and blue, kick off from left to right. City are in their black change strip. The players emerge from the tunnel. It\u2019s a nice December night in Burnley. A little brisk. Burnley\u2019s walk-on music is Wake Up by Arcade Fire, a gesture which makes the world a marginally better place. It\u2019s almost time for the actual football to start. Shame, really, I was enjoying the build-up. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cFor Amazon\u2019s first match, top left of the screen says \u2018Cry Bou\u2019 - which accurately sums up Mamadou Sakho\u2019s night.\u201d In case you\u2019re not a subscriber, Sakho has been sent off for an old-fashioned, thigh-high lunge at Adam Smith. You can follow that match, sort of, here. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI think today, Tuesday 3 December 2019, will be remembered as the day civilisation reached its peak. Streaming live football through an online global website, whilst at the same time buying a voice controlled smart device that enables me to buy more content from said retailer, and having it delivered by a drone at half time while putting up Christmas decorations and emailing the OBO through thought alone. Herbert Chapman and Stan Cullis would have been proud, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Let me just ask my smart assistant, Cyril, what I should think. Ashley Barnes is only fit enough for the bench because of a groin problem, so Burnley have switched from 4-4-2 to 4-2-3-1. Burnley (4-2-3-1) Pope; Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Pieters; Cork, Drinkwater; Lennon, Hendrick, McNeil; Wood. Substitutes: Hart, Lowton, Gibson, Brady, Barnes, Rodriguez, Vydra. Manchester City (4-3-3) Ederson; Walker, Otamendi, Fernandinho, Angelino; De Bruyne, Rodri, D Silva; B Silva, Jesus, Sterling. Substitutes: Bravo, Stones, Mendy, Joao Cancelo, Garcia, Mahrez, Foden. Referee Jon Moss. The lights in the Manchester City dressing-room are not working, apparently. That all sounds very Beckiavellian. Good evening and welcome to a brand new episode of Black Mirror. This one has a cracking synopsis: an American tech giant gets its paws on England\u2019s most popular sport, and all manner of dystopian larks ensue. Well, possibly. We can only surmise the long-term impact of Amazon\u2019s Premier League landgrab but it does feel like 3 December 2019 will eventually sit alongside 16 August 1992 as a landmark in TV coverage of football. For now, the only thing we can say with certainty is that Amazon Prime will be showing 10 live Premier League matches across the next three evenings. Their all-streaming, all-dancing coverage begins with two games tonight: Crystal Palace v Bournemouth and Burnley v Manchester City. The Guardian pockets, alas, are not quite as chasmic as Jeff Bezos\u2019s, so you\u2019re stuck with just one MBM for the match at Turf Moor. Manchester City start the match 11 points behind Liverpool, and with a simple edict: to stop playing silly buggers. Pep Guardiola has had the face on for much of the season, and that seems to have transmitted to his players. City have already dropped 13 points in 14 games, which is almost as many as in each of the last two seasons (14 in 2017-18, 16 in 2018-19). If they are not careful, their title defence will be over before they return to Amazon Prime on 27 December. Kick off is at 8.15pm, buffering permitting.",

But they have also been anxious for him to respond to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s much-repeated allegation (which clearly has some traction with the public) that a Trump trade deal would pose a threat to the NHS, particularly via possible higher drugs prices. As a result, in an extended press briefing this morning, Trump staged an intervention in the election - while claiming to be doing the opposite. The intervention came when he was asked if the NHS should be included in trade negotiations. He replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly ...</p> \n   <p>I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This was, of course, disingenuous because one person who started the rumour was Trump himself, when he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/04/donald-trump-president-visit-uk-press-conference-may-visit-labour-calls-us-president-sexual-predator-and-racist-live-news?page=with:block-5cf68c758f08d4e6b70ddf37#block-5cf68c758f08d4e6b70ddf37\">in a press conference in the UK in June</a> that \u201ceverything is on the table ... NHS or anything else\u201d. Given Trump\u2019s reputation when it comes to honesty, his assurance may have little or no impact on public opinion, and it ignores the granular detail of how a trade deal could impact negatively on British healthcare (which almost certainly would not involve US companies buying NHS hospitals). But, for the Conservatives, it is at least a quote they can use.</p> \n  <p>On broader electoral issues, Trump ostensibly avoided the temptation to take sides.

I am not responsible for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s actions or lack of action, but my position on antisemitism is clear and I think for people who are worried about Corbyn on any issue, far better to have strong, progressive SNP influence on a Labour government, if there is to be a Labour government after this election, than not.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95c12bf18ea09d92dcbb26df16fe24edc9844d7a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95c12bf18ea09d92dcbb26df16fe24edc9844d7a/0_338_6971_4182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon posing for a selfie with a supporter in Perth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon posing for a selfie with a supporter in Perth.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T16:21:52.684Z\">at 4.21pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de67e238f0829bc521b5b6a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T15:59:41.746Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson is only PM because of me, says Farage</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Speaking at a rally in Bassetlaw earlier <strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, the Brexit party leader, claimed that his decision to stand down candidates in Tory-held constituencies might have cost up to 24 seats.

After the launch of the Brexit party in Coventry in April ... we managed to get rid of the worst prime minister we have ever seen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Interesting, this analysis is one that Johnson shares himself. In their excellent new book about the Theresa May premiership, <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/may-at-10\">May at 10,</a> <strong>Anthony Seldon </strong>and<strong> Raymond Newell</strong> quote what Johnson said to his supporter Conor Burns on the day of the final ballot of MPs in the summer leadership contest.

When it was put to him that those papers did not contain evidence of British officials agreeing that the US would get access to the NHS in a trade deal, Corbyn replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Clearly [the officials] were working under authority. And clearly there was a serious discussion about the relationship with access to public services and investor state protection, which is a very bad thing, in my view, because it gives multinational companies the power to sue national governments in an international legal process. That\u2019s already happened with Philip Morris tobacco and various governments around the world. I don\u2019t think we want any of that written into any trade agreement we have with another country. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn dismissed the significance of the claim in the Conservative election manifesto that \u201cwhen we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table.\u201d </strong>Asked about this assurance, Corbyn replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, it absolutely is on the table because they\u2019ve discussed patent extensions. And patents are the things that give us the very high prices for specialist medicines. And if we reduce the length of patents or, if there has been a public investment in those patent researches, we buy that patent, then we get cheaper medicines. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is what the Tory manifesto says in full on this point:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Corbyn said, if he became prime minister, he would be respectful towards Trump in their dealings. Asked how he would treat the US president, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will treat him with respect, as I would everybody else.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. If you\u2019d like to read more on today\u2019s Nato reception, my colleague Caroline Davies has the full story: And Andrew Sparrow has put together this detailed summary of the day\u2019s politics news: The faking of an email that was used to back up the Lib Dems\u2019 claims in a row with a news website over an embarrassing story was \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d, the party\u2019s leader has said. A senior member of the party\u2019s campaign team was suspended over the debacle last week. This evening, the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has said: Clearly, as has been reported, that there was an email that was sent ... which was inaccurate, which was faked and that is not acceptable. There is an investigation. The member of staff has been suspended, and I am not going to comment further on staffing matters. There is an investigation. That particular incident is absolutely unacceptable and that\u2019s why we have taken the swift action and are investigating. We reported earlier that the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had said he was planning to confront Donald Trump over the plausibility of his assurances on the NHS during a reception at Buckingham Palace this evening (see: 2.44pm). There was some skepticism about whether or not Corbyn would be able to address the subject with Trump and the Guardian now understands he did not get the opportunity to do so. Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, were left out in the cold outside No 10 as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, were invited to go inside ahead of them. The world leaders arrived at the Downing Street reception together in the US president\u2019s car, the Beast, this evening. A choir ran through Christmas songs as guests began arriving, including Hark the Herald Angel, Walking in a Winter Wonderland and We Wish You a Merry Christmas. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, had arrived about 20 minutes earlier, followed shortly after by Justin Trudeau, then Angela Merkel, who stopped to admire the choir. The US president and first lady paused on the steps of No 10 for photographs but did not speak before entering. The prime minister has met the German chancellor and the French and Turkish presidents this evening to discuss Syria, Libya and counter-terrorism. A Downing Street spokesman said: The leaders discussed the broad strategic, economic and defence partnerships between their countries and agreed the importance of further deepening these, including through Nato. On Syria, the leaders agreed that humanitarian access, including cross-border, must be ensured and that a UN needs assessment should form the basis for getting aid to those who require it in the north-east. The leaders said they would work to create the conditions for the safe, voluntary and sustainable return of refugees and that the fight must be continued against terrorism in all its forms. They also agreed that all attacks against civilians in Syria, including those in Idlib, must stop. They noted their support to the constitutional committee process and the importance of UNSCR 2254. On Libya, the leaders reiterated their support for SRSG Salame [special envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salam\u00e9] to move forward a Libyan-owned political process, facilitated by the United Nations and supported by the Berlin Format. The leaders agreed that meetings in this format should continue. This is Kevin Rawlinson taking over the liveblog for the evening. My colleague Vikram Dodd has this report on the damning comments of the former head of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, Robert Quick, who attacks the prime minister for peddling \u201ccliches\u201d about sentencing laws after last Friday\u2019s terror attack. Quick says cuts to police numbers have played the greater role in jeopardising public safety. Donald Trump has sought to counter Labour claims that the NHS would be at risk under a UK-US trade deal by saying he would not want it even \u201con a silver platter\u201d. With the election just over a week away, the Tories have been worried that any overt endorsement of Boris Johnson by the US president could backfire. But they have also been anxious for him to respond to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s much-repeated allegation (which clearly has some traction with the public) that a Trump trade deal would pose a threat to the NHS, particularly via possible higher drugs prices. As a result, in an extended press briefing this morning, Trump staged an intervention in the election - while claiming to be doing the opposite. The intervention came when he was asked if the NHS should be included in trade negotiations. He replied: No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly ... I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it. This was, of course, disingenuous because one person who started the rumour was Trump himself, when he said in a press conference in the UK in June that \u201ceverything is on the table ... NHS or anything else\u201d. Given Trump\u2019s reputation when it comes to honesty, his assurance may have little or no impact on public opinion, and it ignores the granular detail of how a trade deal could impact negatively on British healthcare (which almost certainly would not involve US companies buying NHS hospitals). But, for the Conservatives, it is at least a quote they can use. On broader electoral issues, Trump ostensibly avoided the temptation to take sides. He claimed that he had \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the election and, although he said he thought Johnson was \u201cvery capable\u201d, he also said he could work with Corbyn if he became prime minister. Asked about this, he replied: I can work with anybody. I\u2019m a very easy person to work with. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. This was also disingenuous because, only a few weeks ago, Trump had very clear thoughts on the election: he thought Corbyn would be \u201cbad\u201d for the UK, and he wanted Johnson to align with Nigel Farage. In a rare display of self-awareness that helped to explain his relative reticence, Trump also told the press conference today that intervening in the election would not be helpful because in Britain \u201cthey may not like me\u201d. During his day in London Trump also managed to send share prices falling around the world, by saying a trade deal with China might be more than a year away, and to traduce the French president, Emmanuel Macron (for being rude about Nato, of all things - even Trump himself once called it \u201cobsolete\u201d). So, on the Trump mayhem front, the UK got off quite lightly. Corbyn has cast doubt on the plausibility of Trump\u2019s NHS assurances and said he intends to take the matter up with the president at a reception at Buckingham Palace early this evening. As I write, it is not clear yet whether the two men will be able to have a proper conversation \u2013 or whether their encounter (if it happens at all) will not get beyond pleasantries. Channel 4 has been cleared of bias by the media regulator after replacing Johnson with a melting block of ice during last week\u2019s leadership debate on the climate crisis. Nigel Farage has claimed that Johnson only became prime minister because he launched the Brexit party this year out of anger about Theresa May\u2019s handling of Brexit. He may be right. A new biography of May claims Johnson has said something similar in private. Corbyn has apologised for antisemitic incidents involving Labour party members and said he was dealing with the issue. A host of leading cultural figures, including the actors Steve Coogan, Mark Rylance and Julie Christie, the grime artist Kano and the writer and environmentalist Naomi Klein, have united to back Corbyn and praised Labour for prioritising \u201cpeople and planet over profit\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for this evening. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. The BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil has said the Tories are still refusing to suggest a date for his proposed interview with Boris Johnson. These are from my colleague Damien Gayle, who is covering the anti-Trump protest in London this afternoon. And Sky\u2019s Sam Coates has the latest YouGov polling. Here are three polling-related stories/blogs that are worth reading. The Evening Standard says polling in London shows that Labour is increasing support. It says: In a big squeeze on smaller parties as polling day draws closer, Labour appears to be taking votes from the Liberal Democrats and Brexit party, which have both lost support. Labour\u2019s lead in the capital has improved to 17 points, according to the YouGov survey commissioned by Queen Mary University of London\u2019s Mile End Institute, and its leader\u2019s image has improved. But the poll marks a significant decline compared with its 22-point lead in the capital at the 2017 general election, putting at least two Labour marginal seats in danger. This table has the figures. Stephen Bush at the New Statesman says Labour is gaining generally at the Lib Dems\u2019 expense. He says: After weeks of what looked like noise within the margin of error \u2013 thanks in part to the fact that very few pollsters are now doing polls more than once a week, which makes it difficult to draw out trends \u2013 we can now say with certainty that Labour are gaining ground in the polls. They are not doing so at the rate they did at the last election yet, and the Conservatives remain ahead in the polls, but there is a clear trend: of Labour gaining ground thanks to defections from the Liberal Democrats and Greens. As I\u2019ve written repeatedly, you should pay very little attention to the headline figures, because they might be wildly wrong in either direction. As it stands, we are a normal-sized polling error \u2013 that is to say, if either or both of the parties are being systematically under- or over-estimated by three percentage points \u2013 from either a Labour minority government or a Conservative landslide. Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative deputy chairman who is now a polling specialist, says the latest polling he has commissioned shows Boris Johnson extending his lead over Jeremy Corbyn on the best PM measure. He says: Johnson\u2019s lead over Jeremy Corbyn on who would make the best prime minister has widened slightly to 17 points (44% to 27%) from 15 points last week. The proportion of Labour leavers naming Johnson is up slightly from last week at 40%, though still lower than when the campaign began. 84% of 2017 Conservatives name Johnson as the better of the two, while just 55% of 2017 Labour voters name Corbyn. The changes marked in the chart are from last week. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn Boris Johnson floated the idea of introducing charges for the NHS, including for ambulance visits, in a Spectator column in 1995, Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov has revealed. In his story Bienkov reports: \u201cIf NHS services continue to be free in this way, they will continue to be abused, like any free service,\u201d [Johnson] wrote in the Spectator magazine in 1995. \u201cIf people have to pay for them, they will value them more.\u201d He added that those who say \u201cthe future NHS should be for those who are genuinely sick, and for the elderly,\u201d are \u201cbang on the nail.\u201d Writing about his own experience of calling for an ambulance for one of his children, who then turned out not to be seriously ill, he asked: \u201cWhy should I not be charged, say, \u00a350 for that inglorious episode, a fraction of its real cost?\u201d Johnson added that \u201cit seems reasonable that the middle classes should be required to stump up for non-essential services they can well afford.\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has claimed that this proves Johnson has \u201cextremist views on the NHS\u201d and that he does not support the NHS being free at the point of use. At the time Johnson wrote the Spectator article he was not an MP. He has not expressed views like this recently, and the Conservative manifesto describes the NHS as representing \u201cthe best of this country\u201d, particularly because it is free at the point of use. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has said that she does not trust Donald Trump when he says that he does not want the NHS to be included in a UK-US trade deal. (See 10.15am.) Responding to what Trump said this morning, and referring to what the president said in a press conference in Britain in the summer, she said: [Trump] said something different earlier in the year when he said it would certainly be on the table. So, I think he is hardly somebody who is known for you being able to trust what they say. Swinson also suggested that Trump\u2019s comments this morning had been coordinated with No 10. Asked if she thought they had been agreed with Downing Street, she replied: We can just remember what it was like when Trump went on Nigel Farage\u2019s radio show and said that he wanted Farage and Johnson to do a deal, and a few days after that that\u2019s exactly what happened ... I\u2019m sure they have had conversations whether he will be helpful or not during the time that he is here. At a campaign event in Perth, where the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart is hoping to increase his majority of 23 votes over the Tories, I witnessed a phenomenon that it\u2019s important to register is still ongoing: someone bursting into tears as they get a selfie with Nicola Sturgeon. \u201cHow can you not love her?\u201d asked a tearful June Abbott, 69, a long-time independence supporter after the first minister had apologised for making her cry. \u201cShe just feels like she\u2019s one of us.\u201d As cheering activists congregated around Wishart and Sturgeon at the city street stall, many reported what they believe is a change in mood towards their party since the last election campaign. The presence of a Brexit party candidate, who locals say has not been particularly visible, certainly helps in terms of hoovering up some former Tory voters, but Wishart himself was in buoyant mood, telling journalists that the two words doing best on the doorstep were \u201cBoris\u201d and \u201cJohnson\u201d in terms of winning SNP votes. Speaking to reporters during the visit, Sturgeon repeated concerns that Scotland\u2019s NHS was \u201con the line\u201d if a Tory-Trump post-Brexit trade deal were to take place. Asked about continuing concerns from the Scottish Jewish community about the SNP propping up a Corbyn minority administration, she said that she had yet to watch Corbyn\u2019s earlier remarks on antisemitism (see 11.32am), but added: My position is clear. We take action, as we did last week with a candidate [suspending Neale Hanvey, the SNP candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, after allegedly antisemitic social media posts came to light] where there is a need to do that. I am not responsible for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s actions or lack of action, but my position on antisemitism is clear and I think for people who are worried about Corbyn on any issue, far better to have strong, progressive SNP influence on a Labour government, if there is to be a Labour government after this election, than not. Speaking at a rally in Bassetlaw earlier Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claimed that his decision to stand down candidates in Tory-held constituencies might have cost up to 24 seats. He said: If we had stood against the Conservatives in those seats, I think you\u2019d have seen two dozen more Liberal Democrats led by Jo Swinson. Farage also claimed that he deserved the credit for Johnson becoming prime minister. He said: The only reason Boris is prime minister is because, earlier this year, I had had enough. After the launch of the Brexit party in Coventry in April ... we managed to get rid of the worst prime minister we have ever seen. Interesting, this analysis is one that Johnson shares himself. In their excellent new book about the Theresa May premiership, May at 10, Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell quote what Johnson said to his supporter Conor Burns on the day of the final ballot of MPs in the summer leadership contest. Johnson said: There are two people I credit for my emergence as frontrunner: Theresa May for her failure to deliver, and Nigel Farage, who exploited the position left by her failure to deliver. If you can bear reliving the last three years, May at 10 is well worth reading. Some of the revelations are extraordinary. Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor, has posted a very good thread on Twitter explaining the extent to which drug prices would be an issue in a UK-US trade deal. It starts here. And here are his conclusions. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford Here are the main points from what Jeremy Corbyn said in his interview with Jeremy Vine on Radio 2 earlier about President Trump and the NHS. Corbyn said he hoped to be able to tell President Trump tonight that the NHS would not be for sale in UK-US trade talks. The two men are both attending a Buckingham Palace reception for the Nato summit. Corbyn said, if he got the chance, he would deliver a message to Trump. Asked what he would say, he replied: I will say: \u2018Welcome to this country. I hope you\u2019ll understand how precious our national health service is, and in any future trade relationship with the USA, none of our public services are on the table, none of our public services are for sale and investor state protection is not acceptable to our government when we\u2019ve won this election.\u2019 Corbyn also stressed that he would be polite. He was \u201calways polite\u201d, he said. Corbyn said he would ask Trump to change the guidelines issued to his trade negotiators to reflect the fact that the NHS was not on the table. Asked what he would say to Trump if Trump told him that he did not want access to the NHS, Corbyn replied: I will say: \u2018Thank you very much. I assume that will now be the basis of your administration\u2019s talks with our Department of [International] Trade.\u201d But Corbyn also expressed scepticism about the assurances that Trump has given on this subject today. Asked about Trump saying this morning that the US would not want access to the NHS, even if that were offered \u201con a silver platter\u201d (see 10.15am), Corbyn replied: I\u2019m pleased that he said that. But if that\u2019s the case, why have these talks gone on for two years. Why have they been kept secret? Why was, on a freedom of information request, the document only produced in redacted form? And eventually the full text has been released. And I think there [are] very, very legitimate grounds for very, very serious concerns. Corbyn was referring to the talks between UK and US officials described in detail in confidential government papers that were leaked and released by Labour last week. When it was put to him that those papers did not contain evidence of British officials agreeing that the US would get access to the NHS in a trade deal, Corbyn replied: Clearly [the officials] were working under authority. And clearly there was a serious discussion about the relationship with access to public services and investor state protection, which is a very bad thing, in my view, because it gives multinational companies the power to sue national governments in an international legal process. That\u2019s already happened with Philip Morris tobacco and various governments around the world. I don\u2019t think we want any of that written into any trade agreement we have with another country. Corbyn dismissed the significance of the claim in the Conservative election manifesto that \u201cwhen we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table.\u201d Asked about this assurance, Corbyn replied: Well, it absolutely is on the table because they\u2019ve discussed patent extensions. And patents are the things that give us the very high prices for specialist medicines. And if we reduce the length of patents or, if there has been a public investment in those patent researches, we buy that patent, then we get cheaper medicines. This is what the Tory manifesto says in full on this point: When we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. Corbyn said, if he became prime minister, he would be respectful towards Trump in their dealings. Asked how he would treat the US president, he replied: I will treat him with respect, as I would everybody else. And also make very clear that any trade relationship with the USA will not involve investor protection for US companies and will absolutely not involve access to our public services, and crucially, of course, our national health service. And this is from my colleague Rowena Mason, who was with Boris Johnson in Salisbury this morning. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale From BuzzFeed\u2019s Mark Di Stefano Q: You have the lowest popularity ratings for a leader since records began. Does that worry you? Corbyn says he does not comment on polls. He will not start now. This is not just about him, he says. He says he has a lot of highly motivated candidates who want to win the election. The interview is over. Vine says they asked if there was a record Corbyn wanted to play. He says he was told Get Ready, by the Temptations. Corbyn says he would be an \u201chonest broker\u201d in a second referendum campaign. Q: What happens if your team negotiates a fantastic Brexit deal, and you can hardly contain your excitement? Corbyn says he can contain his excitement in all circumstances. Q: But what happens if it is so good that you should campaign for it? Corbyn says he wants the public to take the decision. Q: In your heart of hearts you are a Brexiter, aren\u2019t you? Corbyn says he has been accused of many things. He wants a prosperous economy, and for the people to make the final decision. Q: You are promising lots of free stuff. Can you afford this? Referring to broadband, Corbyn says this is an essential service. Q: The IFS says it is unlikely Labour will be able to raise the sums it needs for its plans. Corbyn says that is what the IFS says. He says Labour thinks it can raise the money. There is a debate to be had about this, he says. He says the Labour party has spoken to the IFS about this. Q: And, after the manifesto came out, you announced plans to spend \u00a358bn compensating the Waspi women. Where does that money come from? Corbyn says Labour would use the \u201cheadroom\u201d available. Is it right to break a contract with these women, he asks. He says these women paid into the system expecting a pension. Q: Shouldn\u2019t Labour have pointed out in the 1990s what the government was doing on this? Corbyn says Labour has said it will address this, and it will. And here are some lines from earlier in the interview. Jeremy Corbyn is being interviewed by Jeremy Vine on Radio 2 now. Q: Dave Merritt, whose father Jack was killed in the London Bridge attack, said he did not want politicians to exploit his son\u2019s death. But hasn\u2019t Labour done some of this as well as the Conservatives, by talking about spending cuts? Corbyn says he met Dave Merritt at the vigil yesterday. He says resources for prisons and the Probation Service are an issue. Q: But won\u2019t lots of people support the Tory \u2018lock them up and throw away the key\u2019 approach? Corbyn says this would require many more prison places. And eventually prisoners come out. Q: Doesn\u2019t this case suggest deradicalisation does not work? Corbyn says the government should not allow prisons to become a breeding ground for extremism. Here is more from what President Trump said in his press briefing earlier. Asked if he could work with a possible Prime Minister [Jeremy] Corbyn, Trump replied: I can work with anybody. I\u2019m a very easy person to work with. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. Trump also seemed to acknowledge that he might not be popular in the UK. This sounded new; on previous visits, he has been keen to boast about how popular he is in the UK. (He isn\u2019t.) In response to a question about the UK election, Trump said in the US, when he endorsed candidates, he helped them win elections. But Britain was different, he said. I\u2019ve won virtually every race that I\u2019ve participated in [in the US, where he has endorsed candidates.]. But this is a different country. I say often, in Germany they like Obama. The reason they like Obama is because Obama gave the ship away. He allowed them to take everything. He gave them things that I wouldn\u2019t do. I love Germany, I love this country, I love other countries. But I\u2019m representing the US. So they may not like me because I\u2019m representing us, and I represent us strong. President Obama did not represent us [strongly]; he gave everything away, and he shouldn\u2019t have done that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re still paying a price for what he did. So, I\u2019ll stay out of the election. Channel 4 has been cleared over its use of an ice sculpture to stand in for Boris Johnson during a debate on climate change, Ofcom has said. As PA Media reports, Ofcom said the prop \u201cwas not a representation of the prime minister personally\u201d, and that \u201clittle editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants\u201d. The Conservatives complained that the broadcaster failed to allow the former environment secretary Michael Gove to be its representative for the debate, during which party leaders faced questions over how they would tackle climate change. Rejecting the complaint, Ofcom said: Broadcasters have editorial freedom in determining the format of any election debate. Depending on the circumstances, they may choose to proceed without having agreed the participation of a particular political party or politician, providing they take steps to ensure the programme complies with our due impartiality and elections rules. In this case, the election committee concluded that, across the one-hour debate and a subsequent news programme, Channel 4\u2019s use of editorial techniques ensured that the Conservative\u2019s viewpoint on climate and environmental issues was adequately reflected and given due weight. The committee also took into account that the globe ice sculpture was not a representation of the prime minister personally, and little editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants. The committee therefore considered that this programme, including the use of the ice sculpture, did not raise issues warranting further investigation under our due impartiality and elections rules. Boris Johnson said he could \u201ccategorically rule out\u201d that \u201cany part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiations\u201d, including pharmaceuticals, when he spoke to reporters during a campaign visit to Salisbury this morning. He described Labour claims that the NHS was under threat (see 9.19am) as \u201cpure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda Triangle stuff\u201d. Asked if Donald Trump\u2019s support was an embarrassment to him, Johnson said: On the contrary and I have good relations with Washington, the president, with President Macron, Chancellor Merkel and that\u2019s vital for the UK and we\u2019ll be having a series of meetings \u2013 bilateral, trilateral of all kinds \u2013 in the course of the next couple of days. Any readers requiring an explanation of the \u201cBermuda Triangle\u201d jibe will find one on Wikipedia here. Like many of Johnson\u2019s cultural references, this one relates to something prominent in the media in the 1970s. Almost a third of voters now say they will vote tactically in the election, according to polling carried out for the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), with the proportion rising rapidly. The polling by BMG found 30% of people said they would be \u201cvoting for the best-positioned party/candidate to keep out another party/candidate that I dislike\u201d on 12 December. This is up from 22% saying this at the start of the election campaign, and 24% in a parallel poll last week. Only 51% of people said they would pick \u201cthe candidate/party I most prefer, regardless of how likely they are to win\u201d. The ERS, which has long campaigned for a move from the first-past-the-post electoral system to a proportional method, said the polling \u201cshould sound alarm bells for our democracy\u201d, adding that given the sometimes contradictory advice on who to vote for tactically in different seats, the election could become \u201ca lottery\u201d. In his ITV This Morning interview Jeremy Corbyn also said that he was \u201cvery sorry\u201d for \u201ceverything that has happened\u201d in his party regarding antisemitism. This came when he came under repeated pressure to say sorry from the presenter, Phillip Schofield. (See 10.56am.) Corbyn said: Our party and me do not accept antisemitism in any form ... Obviously I\u2019m very sorry for everything that has happened. But I want to make this very clear: I am dealing with it, I have dealt with it, other parties are also affected by antisemitism. Candidates have been withdrawn by the Liberal Democrats, and the Conservatives and by us because of it. We just do not accept it in any form whatsoever. Corbyn has apologised to the Jewish community several times in the past for his party\u2019s handling of antisemitism, but he caused controversy when he refused to apologise last week when challenged to do so in his interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. That interview was mostly rather bland, but at the end Jeremy Corbyn said something that at face value sounded very interesting. Phillip Schofield asked: Would you still be Labour leader at the end of, if you were prime minister, or whatever happens on 12 [December], would you still be Labour leader at the end of the next term? Corbyn replied: I hope so, yes, because I feel I\u2019m fit, I feel I\u2019m quite young enough to do the job ... and I\u2019m very determined to carry out what we\u2019ve got there, because we\u2019ve got [to] change our country, we\u2019ve got to change our society, we cannot go on with this massive division between the richest and the poorest, and call ourselves a decent, civilised country. So, I want to help people all across the country. And that\u2019s what I want our government to do. And, do you know what? I\u2019m absolutely looking forward to doing it, starting in Christmas week. Taken literally, Corbyn seems to be saying he intends to stay on as Labour leader for a full parliamentary term regardless of whether or not he wins the election. But, taking into account the context (ie, the reference to carrying out the Labour manifesto, and being in government) it seems much more likely that Corbyn was addressing the point about whether he intended to serve a full term as prime minister if he wins the election. (He does - or at least, he always says he does when asked this question.) There are very few people at the top of the Labour party who would expect him to stay on for another five years as leader if the party loses, and that does not seem to be what he meant to say. But I will ask the party for clarification. UPDATE: I have amended the paragraph above to say there are very few people at the top of the Labour party who think Jeremy Corbyn could stay on for five years if he loses. The original sentence said that was the view in the party as a whole. It might be, but we don\u2019t know that the membership as a whole thinks on this point, and some members would want Corbyn to stay on for as long as he wanted. Q: Aren\u2019t you exhausted by the campaigning? No, says Corbyn. He says he believes in public service. He believes in representing people. And he wants to have a society where we don\u2019t have food banks, or child poverty. He says he is inspired by the wisdom he encounters. He says he goes around with a note book. He writes notes everywhere he goes. He says everyone you meet knows something you don\u2019t. Q: What happens if you don\u2019t win? Corbyn says he intends to win. Q: But if you don\u2019t? Corbyn says his principles and life will be the same. Corbyn says, when he became Labour leader, there were no processes for dealing with antisemitism. He introduced those, plus a fast-track disciplinary system. And a system of education. He says a rabbi was attacked in north London this week. That was disgusting. He has discussed this with other rabbis, he says. Q: Will you apologise to the Jewish community for any antisemitism committed by Labour members? Corbyn starts an explanation. Schofield intervenes: \u201cJust say sorry.\u201d Corbyn says he is sorry for what has happened. He says antisemitism is a poison. You know what happens, from 20th century history, if it is allowed to continue. Q: Many people will fear that, if you tax big business more, prices will go up for everyone. Corbyn says people need higher wages. And we need to so something about child poverty. Raising wages is good, he says. He says he wants to invest in infrastructure and training. Q: President Trump said today he wants nothing to do with the NHS. And it has been claimed that you obtained a dossier about UK-US trade talks that the Russians might have helped to publicise. Corbyn says no one has suggested that that dossier was not accurate. Trump himself has said in the past that everything would be on the table in trade talks. Q: Diane Abbott has called for the abolition of groups like MI5. And you have called for similar things? Corbyn says he is not calling for the abolition of MI5. But he wants these organisations to be accountable. UPDATE: This question relates to an early day motion that Abbott signed in 1989. Abbott does not back the abolition of MI5 now. Jeremy Corbyn is being interview now by Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield. Q: Boris Johnson says in the Sun today that the country would not be safe with you as PM. Is that true? Corbyn says his first job as PM would be to keep people safe. That requires more spending on the police. And, internationally, we should not allow there to be vast areas of ungoverned space. Q: Should terrorists serve life sentences? Corbyn says it depends what they did. Sentences should be decided by courts. But the Prison Service is woefully underfunded, he says. He says the lesson from the London Bridge attack is that we need to improve this. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give an interview to ITV\u2019s This Morning. At his press briefing President Trump was asked about Prince Andrew. Trump claimed he did not know him. As BuzzFeed\u2019s Mark Di Stafano points out, the picture archive suggests otherwise. At his press briefing President Trump was most critical of his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, who recently said that Nato was suffering \u201cbrain death\u201d. Trump said Macron\u2019s comments were \u201cvery insulting\u201d. He also said has \u201cvery surprised\u201d at Macron\u2019s analysis. He said: Turkey responded by saying that he was brain dead which was interesting ... I heard that President Macron said that Nato was brain dead. I think that is very insulting to a lot of different forces. It has a great purpose. Trump said Macron was being \u201cvery disrespectful\u201d to other members of the Nato alliance members, and he attacked Macron\u2019s own domestic record. It is a very, very nasty statement. I think they have a very high unemployment rate in France. France is not doing well economically at all. It is a very tough statement to make when you have such difficulty in France when you look at what is going on with the yellow vests. They have had a very rough year. You just can\u2019t go around making statements like that about Nato. It is very disrespectful. Trump is not necessarily the best person to complain about people being rude about Nato. Before he became president, he called the alliance \u201cobsolete\u201d in an interview in 2016. Only this week he also called some of its members \u201cdelinquent\u201d. The Trump press briefing is over. According to Sky, he was only expected to say a few words at what had been billed as essentially a photo opportunity. Instead he took questions for around 50 minutes. I will be post more from what he said shortly. This is what President Trump said when he was asked if he thought the NHS should be on the table in trade deals. He replied: No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly ... I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it. Trump has just been asked if he thinks Jeremy Corbyn needs to do more to tackle the problem of antisemitism in his party. He says he does not know anything about this issue. This is what President Trump said about the UK election. I have no thoughts on it. It\u2019s going to be a very important election for this great country, but I have no thoughts on it. But Trump also said he would be meeting Boris Johnson while he is in the UK for the Nato meeting. Asked if there would be a meeting, he said: I will be meeting with him, yes ... I have many meetings. I have meetings set up with lots of different countries. Asked why he was staying out of the election, Trump said: Because I don\u2019t want to complicate it. I\u2019ll stay out of the election. You know that I was a fan of Brexit. I called it the day before. I think Boris is very capable and I think he\u2019ll do a good job. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he predicted the result of the Brexit referendum in advance, when he was visiting his golf course in Scotland. As explained here, this is not true. Trump defends his policy towards North Korea. He has a good relationship with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, he says. He says if President Obama were still in the White House, the two countries would be at war. Trump claims he has become \u201ca bigger fan\u201d of Nato because Nato members have been flexible. He also says Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, is doing a great job. Stoltenberg is with him at this press briefing at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence in London, but Stoltenberg is not getting the chance to say very much because Trump is rambling on at length. Here is the NHS quote. Here are more lines from the Trump press briefing. Donald Trump is speaking to reporters at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence, now. He has also claimed he could work with Jeremy Corbyn. He could work with anyone, he said. This is from CNN\u2019s White House correspondent, Kaitlan Collins. As Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart report in their overnight story, No 10 has been very anxious for Trump to avoid doing or saying anything that would be seen as an endorsement of Boris Johnson because, given Trump\u2019s unpopularity in the UK, that would not be helpful. Trump seems to have got the message (although whether he can maintain his self-restraint for two days remains to be seen). Obviously, the claim that Trump has \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the election is not true. He told LBC in an interview last month that Jeremy Corbyn would be \u201cbad\u201d for the country and that Johnson was a \u201cfantastic man\u201d. These are from my colleague Kate Proctor, who has been covering a Jeremy Corbyn event in London this morning. Last night Jeremy Corbyn released the text of an open letter he has written to Donald Trump asking for assurances that the NHS, and drug prices in particular, will not be included in the proposed UK-US trade deal. It is one of those letters from politicians clearly not drafted in the expectation that it might receive a reply, but it is interesting nonetheless, particularly for the amount of detail it contains about the eight changes Corbyn wants to the American negotiating objectives for a UK-US trade deal. Here is the key extract. To assure the British public that the NHS and other UK public services will not be opened up to \u201ctotal market access\u201d and irreversible privatisation, and that all aspects of NHS pharmaceuticals procurement will truly be taken off the table in a US-UK trade agreement, I am writing to you today to ask you to request US negotiating objectives are revised as a matter of urgency so that they: Exclude any reference to pharmaceuticals. Accept the role of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to set the threshold for the cost-effectiveness of drugs for the NHS. Drop the demand for \u201ctotal market access\u201d to UK public services. Explicitly rule out any investor-state dispute settlement mechanism by which the UK government could be sued for protecting public services. Exclude any provision on regulatory exclusivities such as data exclusivity, marketing exclusivity, therapeutic exclusivity and other non-patent monopolies. Exclude any provision that could remove caps on the amount the NHS spends on branded medicines each year, including anything that might enable the US to take legal action against the UK\u2019s voluntary price access scheme. Ensure NHS patient data are fully exempted from digital trade and data sharing provisions in the agreement. Exclude any provision that would prevent the NHS from negotiating deals for the health service as a whole. A revision of the US negotiating objectives along these lines would go a long way to reassuring the British public that the US government will not be seeking total market access to the UK public services; that the NHS will not be on the table in US-UK trade negotiations; that a US-UK trade deal will not open up NHS services to irreversible privatisation; and that the US government accepts that our NHS is not for sale in any form. Corbyn also released this video making the same point. This video features a quote from Trump at a press conference with Theresa May in June saying the NHS would be included in trade talks. But when Trump was asked specifically about the NHS, he did not seem to know what the acronym referred to and later, after his comment provoked a major row, he gave an interview saying he did not want the NHS to be included in trade talks. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Simon Murphy. As reported earlier, in his Today interview Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, was asked by the presenter Nick Robinson about his involvement in a book that advocated privatisation of health services. (See 8.21am) Raab said he has never personally advocated NHS privatisation. Robinson was referring to After the Coalition, a book published in 2011 and written jointly by Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Chris Skidmore, Liz Truss and Raab. At the time they were all Conservative backbenchers. Now three of them are cabinet ministers (Raab, Patel and Truss), Kwarteng attends cabinet as a minister of state and Skidmore is also a minister of state. The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has posted an extract from the book on Twitter. Some would argue that allowing private providers to supply NHS services (which happens quite extensively at the moment) does amount to \u201cprivatisation of the NHS\u201d, which is what Raab said this morning that he opposed. But others would argue that phrase implies the wholesale sell-off of the NHS, which is something quite different. More from Dominic Raab\u2019s interview earlier on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme as the foreign secretary also claimed the Conservatives have no plans to privatise the NHS. It comes after Jeremy Corbyn last week produced leaked papers detailed US trade talks which he claimed proved the NHS was \u201cup for sale\u201d \u2013 an allegation denied by the Tories. \u201c[We\u2019re] absolutely clear there\u2019s going to be no privatisation of the NHS under the Conservatives\u2019 watch or this prime minister\u2019s watch,\u201d Raab said. In relation to drugs, there\u2019s going to be no dilution of our protection of consumers in this country. Obviously we want the cheapest and highest quality medicines coming into the NHS, there\u2019s going to be no dilution of our position on that whatsoever. Asked about his involvement in writing a paper advocating privatisation, he said: You\u2019ve picked probably a snippet from a pamphlet written a long time ago, but I can tell you categorically I\u2019ve never advocated privatisation of the NHS. The Labour shadow minister Laura Piddock has dodged questions on reports suggesting Russia had a role planting a leaked NHS document that Jeremy Corbyn presented last week as proof the country\u2019s health service was on the table in US trade talks. Reuters reported last night that experts at Oxford and Cardiff universities, as well as the Atlantic Council thinktank, said the document\u2019s release on Reddit before it was seized on by Labour \u201cresembles a disinformation campaign uncovered this year that originated in Russia\u201d. \u201cWhoever did this \u2026 was absolutely trying to keep it a secret,\u201d Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, told Reuters. \u201cIt carries the spectre of foreign influence.\u201d The story, which the Daily Telegraph splashed on today, led to questioning of Piddock by Sky\u2019s Kay Burley this morning but she dismissed it as a \u201cmassive distraction\u201d. Footage has emerged of Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade apparently arriving in north London to shouts of abuse last night after he touched down on UK soil in Air Force One. The US president\u2019s motorcade was given a frosty welcome as it passed through Camden, with yells of \u201cget out of here\u201d \u2013 and some ruder cries \u2013 from passersby caught on camera. The foreign secretary also said he sympathised with the father of Jack Merritt, whose son was murdered during the London Bridge terror attack on Friday, after he said the tragedy had been used to \u201cfurther an agenda of hate\u201d. Dave Merritt wrote an impassioned piece in the Guardian saying that his son would have been seething at how his death was being used. \u201cWhat Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge.\u201d Dominic Raab refused to accept that he had a fundamentally different worldview to that of Jack Merritt. \u201cI sympathise with the anguish of the family and can\u2019t imagine what they must be going through. The first duty that we\u2019ve got as a government is to take every measure we can to make sure that we don\u2019t see further families going through that same suffering and anguish,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Our duty is to protect the public and that\u2019s why, and you mentioned prison places, our manifesto is clear, we don\u2019t want to cut those, we want to increase them by 10,000. Of course, we want to reform and rehabilitate criminal offenders where that\u2019s possible but I think, in this case and in the level of very serious dangerous, criminal offenders, it\u2019s clear that some of those we will struggle to be sure that we can reform, that they will rehabilitate. We are absolutely clear, we will not allow the release of people onto the streets who present a danger. He added: \u201cAnd that separates us from Jeremy Corbyn, who has made clear he would be willing to see those sorts of dangerous offenders released.\u201d The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, claims he does not know whether Boris Johnson will be meeting the US president, Donald Trump, for one-on-one talks during his visit to the UK for the Nato summit. Amid claims that the prime minister is dodging bilateral talks with Trump, fearing it would hamper his campaigning efforts in the general election, Raab was evasive on the issue. \u201cI don\u2019t know the full range of bilaterals, those things are always very fluid,\u201d Raab told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Actually, the role of this leaders\u2019 summit, and we are hosting it, is for the prime minister to bring all of our north American and European partners together and show that through Nato we can be bigger than the sum of our parts. Asked to clarify again whether he does not know whether the two leaders will be meeting, Raab said: I said that the arrangements for bilaterals are always quite fluid because they\u2019re done on the margins. This is a meeting for Nato as a whole and the prime minister\u2019s job \u2026 is to bring all of our allies together in the same room, not syphoned off in bilaterals because we\u2019ve got this unity of purpose we need to forge to strengthen Nato and that\u2019s the leadership role that the prime minister is taking. Good morning folks, Simon Murphy here to take you through the morning\u2019s politics news as Donald Trump visits the UK for the Nato summit. Looks like the US president still had his attention on affairs back at home when he touched down on UK soil last night: From Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary Labour has promised to end what it calls the \u201chostile environment\u201d for disabled people in the social security system as part of a raft of plans to tackle discrimination. The party\u2019s disability manifesto, published on Tuesday morning, proposes a range of measures across welfare, public services, transport, housing and jobs to enable disabled people to live independently, be treated with dignity and respect, and participate fully in society. The manifesto promises to sweep away a hostile environment of prejudice against disabled people it says was promoted by government to justify nine years of austerity cuts, and replace it with system that ends poverty and offers people security and dignity. \u201cWhat British democracy needs right now is the advice of a cartoonist who doesn\u2019t even live in your wretched country,\u201d writes Guardian Australia\u2019s cartoonist First Dog on the Moon. The day ahead \u2022 Boris Johnson is expected to be campaigning in south-west England. \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn is due to give a speech in London on workers\u2019 rights. \u2022 Jo Swinson is expected to visit a farm in the east of England. \u2022 Nato leaders are gathering for the alliance summit over Tuesday and Wednesday. The main talks will take place on Wednesday near Watford and Johnson will break off from election campaigning to play host. Good morning and welcome to another day in politics. Today, Donald Trump is in town and his presence in London today for Nato meetings is causing jitters in the Conservative camp, as the Tories worry about the US president\u2019s unpredictability and tendency to say things without necessarily thinking through the consequences. Trump is being seen as a potential liability for Boris Johnson in the campaign, amid Labour\u2019s accusations that a US-UK trade deal will lead to an NHS sell-off and higher drug prices for Britons, with the Guardian\u2019s Rowena Mason writing that Johnson will seek to downplay his relationship with the president in light of the NHS accusations. Johnson has made clear that he would not welcome any input from Trump at such a sensitive time in the campaign, after the US president offered his endorsement over the summer. But Trump has a full two days in the UK and is expected to give a press conference on Wednesday. The Tories will be hopeful he says little or nothing to inflame voter fears. Trump will be among world leaders attending a banquet with the Queen tonight at Buckingham Palace. NHS nurses and doctors will lead a \u201cHands off our NHS\u201d protest starting at Trafalgar Square then heading down the Mall to arrive at Canada Gate, opposite the palace. Also protesting outside Buckingham Palace will be the family of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old who was killed in a motorbike crash in Northamptonshire in August. Anne Sacoolas, the 42-year-old motorist allegedly responsible, claimed diplomatic immunity and was allowed to return to the US. We\u2019ll have all the politics news for, so stay with us. I\u2019ve got the blog for the first hour or so, you can get in touch with me on Twitter. Thanks for reading.",

The Hillsborough families reacted with outrage to the verdict and the way the trial was conducted, arguing that it reversed the April 2016 verdict of new inquests into the disaster, which found that the 96 people were unlawfully killed owing to Duckenfield\u2019s gross negligence manslaughter.<br><br>The inquest\u2019s jury also determined that no behaviour by Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster, rejecting South Yorkshire police officers\u2019 claims that it was exacerbated by supporters being drunk, without tickets and trying to force their way in. At Duckenfield\u2019s prosecution, his barrister, Benjamin Myers QC, nevertheless advanced that case again, and police officers gave evidence to that effect, barely challenged by the Crown Prosecution Service lead barrister, Richard Matthews QC.<br><br>The letter points out that the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, allowed Duckenfield to sit in court with his lawyers rather than in the dock. Openshaw said this was to make allowances for his medical conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, and referred to the defendant in front of the jury as a \u201cpoor chap\u201d when he had a chest infection. Aspinall wrote to Openshaw complaining that he was not being impartial, and that his summing-up in the first trial, which ended in a hung jury, had been one-sided. Openshaw replied that he was maintaining the \u201cstrong convention\u201d that judges do not discuss their cases.<br><br>\u201cWe can only conclude that the English legal system simply does not work for bereaved families, particularly when they are up against public bodies or the state. It is impersonal, insensitive and emphatically not a level playing field,\u201d the letter says, adding that families bereaved by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\">Grenfell fire</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/26/birmingham-pub-bombings-inquest-tributes-paid-to-victims\">Birmingham pub bombings</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/contaminated-blood-scandal\">contaminated blood scandal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/26/bloodysunday.northernireland\">Bloody Sunday</a> face the same disadvantages in their ongoing legal processes.<br><br>\u201cFor bereaved families, walking into an English court is akin to walking into a casino \u2013 a place where money and connections talk and where the odds are heavily stacked against them before proceedings have even started. As we have seen, the different legal proceedings \u2013 public inquiry, prosecutions and inquests \u2013 are not connected, so each successive process can seek to undermine previous findings, however clear and exhaustively reached. <br><br>\u201cThis puts families through torture each and every time.\u201d</p>",

The Hillsborough families reacted with outrage to the verdict and the way the trial was conducted, arguing that it reversed the April 2016 verdict of new inquests into the disaster, which found that the 96 people were unlawfully killed owing to Duckenfield\u2019s gross negligence manslaughter. The inquest\u2019s jury also determined that no behaviour by Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster, rejecting South Yorkshire police officers\u2019 claims that it was exacerbated by supporters being drunk, without tickets and trying to force their way in. At Duckenfield\u2019s prosecution, his barrister, Benjamin Myers QC, nevertheless advanced that case again, and police officers gave evidence to that effect, barely challenged by the Crown Prosecution Service lead barrister, Richard Matthews QC. The letter points out that the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, allowed Duckenfield to sit in court with his lawyers rather than in the dock. Openshaw said this was to make allowances for his medical conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, and referred to the defendant in front of the jury as a \u201cpoor chap\u201d when he had a chest infection. Aspinall wrote to Openshaw complaining that he was not being impartial, and that his summing-up in the first trial, which ended in a hung jury, had been one-sided. Openshaw replied that he was maintaining the \u201cstrong convention\u201d that judges do not discuss their cases. \u201cWe can only conclude that the English legal system simply does not work for bereaved families, particularly when they are up against public bodies or the state. It is impersonal, insensitive and emphatically not a level playing field,\u201d the letter says, adding that families bereaved by the Grenfell fire, the Birmingham pub bombings, the contaminated blood scandal and Bloody Sunday face the same disadvantages in their ongoing legal processes. \u201cFor bereaved families, walking into an English court is akin to walking into a casino \u2013 a place where money and connections talk and where the odds are heavily stacked against them before proceedings have even started. As we have seen, the different legal proceedings \u2013 public inquiry, prosecutions and inquests \u2013 are not connected, so each successive process can seek to undermine previous findings, however clear and exhaustively reached. \u201cThis puts families through torture each and every time.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This may not have been much of a match but it certainly served to show Roy Hodgson\u2019s Crystal Palace in their best light. Down to 10 men after 19 minutes, with another player lost to injury shortly afterwards, Palace not only put their bodies on the line but also had the endurance and ability to grab victory over Bournemouth in the closing stages.</p> <p>None of it was luck, all of it was thoughtful, and a raucous Selhurst Park was delighted with what it witnessed. Jeffrey Schlupp\u2019s goal was a beauty in itself. The Ghana international received the ball on the fringes of the Bournemouth half and drove at goal until there was nigh-on nowhere left to run. At that point his left foot took aim and powered a shot under Aaron Ramsdale. The goalkeeper\u2019s dive was like his team\u2019s performance more generally; it looked decent enough but it certainly was not effective.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/dec/03/burnley-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live\">Burnley v Manchester City: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was absolutely delighted with the performance,\u201d said Hodgson, a broad smile plastered on his face. \u201cWe had to play with 10 men for a long period and they stood their ground, maintained their shape, maintained their discipline and when we did get a chance to come out with the ball we asked a lot of questions. I am really proud of the team and they deserve an awful lot of credit.\u201d</p> <p>Mamadou Sakho was the player sent off, his high lunging challenge on Adam Smith earning a prompt red card from the referee, Anthony Taylor. \u201cYou always feel a bit hard done by in those situations as the ball was there to be won,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cIt was a fierce challenge and there was a time when it was part and parcel of the game.\u201d It sounded like a sympathetic defence but the wince the Palace manager gave as he watched the incident in real time suggested other feelings he had chosen to keep to himself.</p> <p>Sakho\u2019s sending off did not unduly affect Palace\u2019s performance. Nor did the departure of Patrick van Aanholt with what is hoped is only a hamstring strain. The old saw about 10 being harder to play against than 11 does not quite cover it. For not only are Palace temperamentally suited to digging in, but also being denied the option to play expansively in front of their home fans actually took a burden off their shoulders.</p> <p>Hodgson was full of praise for Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 and the way the midfielder deputised as a makeshift defender after Sakho\u2019s dismissal. He called the suggestion that Kouyat\u00e9 had done a good job \u201cone of the biggest understatements I\u2019ve ever heard in football\u201d.</p> <p>Just as impressive as Palace\u2019s defensive anticipation and physical bravery was the direct, brutal nature of their counterattacking.

      "bodyText": "This may not have been much of a match but it certainly served to show Roy Hodgson\u2019s Crystal Palace in their best light. Down to 10 men after 19 minutes, with another player lost to injury shortly afterwards, Palace not only put their bodies on the line but also had the endurance and ability to grab victory over Bournemouth in the closing stages. None of it was luck, all of it was thoughtful, and a raucous Selhurst Park was delighted with what it witnessed. Jeffrey Schlupp\u2019s goal was a beauty in itself. The Ghana international received the ball on the fringes of the Bournemouth half and drove at goal until there was nigh-on nowhere left to run. At that point his left foot took aim and powered a shot under Aaron Ramsdale. The goalkeeper\u2019s dive was like his team\u2019s performance more generally; it looked decent enough but it certainly was not effective. \u201cI was absolutely delighted with the performance,\u201d said Hodgson, a broad smile plastered on his face. \u201cWe had to play with 10 men for a long period and they stood their ground, maintained their shape, maintained their discipline and when we did get a chance to come out with the ball we asked a lot of questions. I am really proud of the team and they deserve an awful lot of credit.\u201d Mamadou Sakho was the player sent off, his high lunging challenge on Adam Smith earning a prompt red card from the referee, Anthony Taylor. \u201cYou always feel a bit hard done by in those situations as the ball was there to be won,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cIt was a fierce challenge and there was a time when it was part and parcel of the game.\u201d It sounded like a sympathetic defence but the wince the Palace manager gave as he watched the incident in real time suggested other feelings he had chosen to keep to himself. Sakho\u2019s sending off did not unduly affect Palace\u2019s performance. Nor did the departure of Patrick van Aanholt with what is hoped is only a hamstring strain. The old saw about 10 being harder to play against than 11 does not quite cover it. For not only are Palace temperamentally suited to digging in, but also being denied the option to play expansively in front of their home fans actually took a burden off their shoulders. Hodgson was full of praise for Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 and the way the midfielder deputised as a makeshift defender after Sakho\u2019s dismissal. He called the suggestion that Kouyat\u00e9 had done a good job \u201cone of the biggest understatements I\u2019ve ever heard in football\u201d. Just as impressive as Palace\u2019s defensive anticipation and physical bravery was the direct, brutal nature of their counterattacking. With nothing to do but run at a massed Bournemouth defence, Wilfried Zaha and Jordan Ayew almost pulled it off on a number of occasions. It was a hasty clearance from a Ayew run that set up Schlupp for his decisive opportunity. For Bournemouth this was a fourth defeat on the trot and they have won just once since September. To make things worse, their next two matches are Liverpool at home and Chelsea away, and that is before the hectic Christmas schedule begins in earnest. Eddie Howe has been in such troughs before and it would be foolish to back against his side recovering their poise but they were limp, despite (or perhaps because of) four changes to the starting lineup. Howe looked concerned, choosing to apologise to the away fans after the final whistle. \u201cWe weren\u2019t good.

      "bodyText": "And finally, the Dow has closed down 280 points at 27,501, a drop of almost 1%. The prospect of a long delay to the China trade deal (if it ever comes), and the threat of France retaliating to new US tariffs on its cheese and champagne both weighed on Wall Street. Traders, says Kyle Rodda of IG, have taken \u201ca cold, hard dose of reality\u201d today. He writes: Volatility has returned in a big way to financial markets. Stocks are down and safe-havens are finding a bid, after US President Donald Trump suggested there\u2019s \u201cno deadline for a trade-deal\u201d, and implied the trade-war could be prolonged into next year. Equity markets are returning to fundamentals now. Once again, fear has the upper hand over greed in the markets. After several weeks of what\u2019s been appropriately described as a sense of complacency, volatility has returned to global markets to begin December. Having been highly suppressed, as traders became giddy on the prospect of a US/China trade-deal, the VIX (the \u201cfear index\u201d) has spiked in the last 48 hours, climbing from a historically low 11 reading, to its current reading at 16. That\u2019s all for tonight! GW Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth, thinks Trump\u2019s threat to delay a China trade deal is a calculated move, to bounce Beijing into concessions. He says: \u201cThis is sort of a last-minute negotiation tactic. \u201cIf the December 15 tariffs go into effect, then I think people start thinking that this could have additional ramifications on a \u2018phase-one\u2019 ever getting done.\u201d Almost every stock on the Dow Jones industrial average is in the red in late trading. Basic materials, financial stocks and consumer-focused firms are dong worst, with tech companies and industrials close behind. Intel has lost 3%, with Apple down 2.3%, reflecting concerns that America could impose tariffs on Chinese-made tech products soon. That could kick in on the 15th, unless there\u2019s some movement with China. The Dow is attempting to recover from its earlier losses, but is still down 313 points today at 27,469. Still more than two hours of trading left, so there\u2019s time for a rebound - or deeper losses! Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that a China trade deal could be delayed by a year could just be a ploy. Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, explains (via CNBC): \u201cWe have seen this movie many times before ... where the president throws out remarks during trade talks that in retrospect have just been a negotiating tactic, especially when he starts off by saying China wants a deal more than he does. London\u2019s losses today are partly due to a stronger pound, which is trading over $1.30 again tonight. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The FTSE\u2019s day was made that bit worse by the pound\u2019s own gains. The latest Kantar poll put the Tories 12 points ahead of Labour, contrary to many other surveys showing a shrinking Conservative lead. Ouch! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed at its lowest level since mid-October. Renewed trade war anxiety sent the index down to 7,158, a loss of 127 points. That\u2019s a 1.75% slide, to a six-week low. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK companies also had a rotten day, ending 199 points down at 20,500. That\u2019s a 1% drop. Today\u2019s burst of trade war drama has been a wake-up call for investors who had hoped that the dispute was being ended peacefully. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: It\u2019s been another choppy day for markets in Europe after an initially positive start. Once again it\u2019s been an intervention by President Trump that\u2019s upset the applecart, when in an impromptu question and answer session with journalists he held open the prospect that there would be no US, China trade deal, until after the US elections next year. This insouciance about the prospect of putting off any deal has completely upended market expectations that we were potentially millimetres away from a deal, and also flies in the face of the optimism that has seen markets rally strongly over the last few weeks. It also raises the very real prospect that the tariffs that are due to kick in on December 15th will now not get waived, and will actually get implemented. With the US President also mulling swinging tariffs on French luxury goods, equity markets are starting to look increasingly vulnerable to further declines, especially if the 15th December tariffs do happen after all. For quite some time now investors have been assuming, somewhat naively perhaps that the new 15th December tariffs might well get waived, or delayed. That line of thinking is now seriously coming into question. Unsurprisingly markets haven\u2019t reacted well to this new wrinkle, and if investors were caught off guard by yesterday\u2019s belligerence, then this new revelation is unlikely to assuage them that the US is anywhere near to closing any sort of deal with China, or anyone else for that matter. CNBC\u2019s Michelle Caruso-Cabrera is losing faith that China and the US will ever reach a trade deal.... All these negative headlines on trade have knocked China\u2019s currency to its lowest level since October, as Bloomberg\u2019s Katherine Griefeld points out here: Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, has just dampened hopes of a trade breakthrough with China. Ross has told CNBC that delaying a trade deal with China until after the 2020 election could make sense, as it \u201ctakes leverage away\u201d from Beijing. That chimes with Donald Trump\u2019s comments in London earlier. Ross added that no high-level meetings are planned between the two sides, even though the US will impose new tariffs on 15 December unless there\u2019 s a deal.... Wall Street is having a seriously bad day now, with the Dow shedding 421 points or 1.5%. This takes the index down to a one-month low, wiping out all the gains made in November when the Dow hit a series of record highs. Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron\u2019s press conference in London is one of the most awkward such events we\u2019ve seen in a while. At one stage, Trump even patronised Macron for giving a classic \u201cnon-answer\u201d, when the French president talked about the importance of eradicating ISIS. That came after Trump challenged him to take back French Islamist fighters captured in the region. But on trade, Trump has also threatened France with \u201csubstantial taxes\u201d, unless it changes its plan to tax tech giants. \u201cWe\u2019ve taxed wine and we have other taxes scheduled. We\u2019d rather not do that, but that\u2019s the way it would work. So it\u2019s either going to work out, or we\u2019ll work out some mutually beneficial tax,. The tax will be substantial, and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to come to that but it might.\u201d The two leaders are also clashing over Turkey, with Macron furious that it plans to buy a Russian missile system, and over its invasion of Syria. Donald Trump has sent another shiver through the markets, as he tells reporters in London that Europe isn\u2019t trading fairly with the US. The US president says his country \u201ccannot continue to lose the money that it has lost\u201d since the EU was created. We have an unfair trade situation with the EU. This further hardens concerns that Trump is ratcheting up his threats to impose more tariffs if European countries don\u2019t address American concerns. Ouch! America\u2019s stock market has fallen 1% at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average: down 285 points at 27,497 S&amp;P 500: Down 32 points at 3,081.84 points Donald Trump\u2019s warning that a trade deal with China might not happen before next November\u2019s presidential election has alarmed traders, as has the prospect of a trade war with France. Trump then repeats his earlier argument that it\u2019s wrong for France to tax US companies, through its digital services tax. [America\u2019s complaint is that the French plan is based on the revenues of US tech firms, not simply the profits they make in France] Newsflash: Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron are holding a press conference at the NATO summit now. Trump seems to be trying to calm the tariff row, telling reporters that \u201cwe have a very good relationship with France\u201d. The US president also says that he believes the two sides can work out their clash over France\u2019s digital sales tax. Thins s will \u201cbe looking rose\u201d between us soon, he adds. But, Trump is also emphasising that all NATO members need to make a fair contribution to its budget, and suggests that he could use trade as a weapon to get them into line... France\u2019s wine and spirits industry is calling on Emmanuel Macron to help. Antoine Leccia, chairman of trade body FEVS says the threat of champagne tariffs at the US border must be pushed back: \u201cFor six weeks now, our companies have been strongly affected by the Airbus litigation. We must avoid creating new problems. \u201cWe therefore solemnly call on the President of the Republic to take, from today, all the necessary initiatives, at national, bi-lateral and international levels, so that our sector does not pay the price of the economic and political choices made by France\u201d. A EU delegation to the US says it will seek \u201cimmediate talks\u201d on how to resolve the dispute over France\u2019s digital service tax, Reuters reports. If you missed it earlier, here\u2019s a video clip of Donald Trump criticising France\u2019s new levy on the revenues of US technology giants: The Paris stock market is also suffering a dose of tariff blues. The CAC 40 index is down 1%, with consumer companies and factories suffering the biggest losses. Luxury goods firm Kering is down 2.3%, with LVMH (Mo\u00ebt Hennessy \u2013 Louis Vuitton) losing 2%. As explained earlier, they\u2019re in the firing line from higher tariffs on handbags and champagne. The US stock market is also heading for sharper losses in an hour\u2019s time: Just in: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of top shares has hit its lowest level since late October. The Footsie has now lost 108 points to 7,177, its weakest level in six weeks. Donald Trump\u2019s latest trade war escalation is causing alarm in the City, as traders fear that a deal with China could be a year away. The new tariffs being threatened on France have also raised worries that UK-EU relations could worsen. Separately, the the rise in the pound is hurting multinationals - whose overseas earnings become less valuable in sterling terms. Steelmaker Evraz is the top faller, down 6%, followed by NMC Health, the UAE-focused healthcare chain. US-focused plumbing and building materials provider Ferguson has lost 3%, while global advertising firm WPP is down 2.5%. Data firm Panjiva has calculated that America\u2019s new proposed tariffs cover 4.1% of all French exports to the US, worth just over $2.4bn. Cosmetics takes the biggest hit, followed by sparkling wine. It explains: The largest import lines were: beauty products worth $842 million; champagne where imports were worth $806 million; handbags worth $434 million and; dairy products worth $202 million. While shares slide, the pound is rising towards its highest level in six months. Sterling has just hit $1.30 for the first time in six weeks, and is close to levels not seen since May. The pound often rises when opinion polls suggest Boris Johnson will win a majority next week. The latest poll shows the Conservative Party still holds a lead over Labour. The pound is also benefitting from the weaker dollar, which took a hit from disappointing US manufacturing data yesterday. Agathe Demarais, Global Forecasting Director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, suspects that Donald Trump won\u2019t actually impose those new tariffs on French champagne, cheese, handbags and cosmetics. Why? Because it would drive up prices in the shops - not a good idea in an election year. Demarais says: The fact that the proposed US tariffs would target consumer goods will restrain Mr Trump from moving forward with these actions. Targeting French consumer goods, such as champagne and luxury items, would make these tariffs personal for US consumers; this is something that Mr Trump will want to avoid before the US 2020 presidential election as it could hurt his re-election chances. But even so, the threat shows that US-European relations are weakening: France has vowed to retaliate at the European level against the US proposed tariffs. Overall, this new row illustrates the ongoing deterioration of the relationship between the US and its traditional European allies, and France in particular. ITV\u2019s Joel Hills points out that the UK could soon have its own digital services tax -- it\u2019s in the Conservative manifesto! Labour has also promised to tax US tech giants more, to better reflect the profits they make in the UK. We flagged up earlier that the US is threatening to sanction Italy over its digital tax scheme, following last night\u2019s move against France. Could the UK be next?... This tweet shows the moment when Trump\u2019s comments on China hit the wires, and rattled the Wall Street futures market: Investors are very disappointed by the prospect of waiting another year for a US-China trade deal, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Markets simply aren\u2019t priced for this; for a trade deal to be that far in the future \u2013 if one can even be struck at all. After weeks of making generally positive noises on a deal being very close, there is a real sense now that a deal is not so very near at all and markets need to reprice. Combined with the barrage of tariff threats on the EU, the comments can be taken as a sign that the White House has no qualms about levying further tariffs and is happy about using trade as a economic, political and diplomatic weapon. Of course, Donald Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-hip comments in these kind of interviews need to be taken with a dose of salt \u2013 we could just as easily see him row back on this later, as has happened countless times already. We\u2019re only ever a tweet away from saying that a deal is very close to see a rebound. However, it\u2019s clear that hopes for even a skinny deal being done this year have diminished in the last two days and markets are reflecting this. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-size companies, has shed 0.8% today. That\u2019s a fall of 167 points today, to 20,531 - its lowest level in over a week. Investors are now worrying that America might impose another swathe of tariffs on China in two weeks time. President Trump has previously threatened to impose 15% levies on $160 billion of Chinese imports on December 15, if a trade deal hadn\u2019t been reached by then. Markets had been expecting America to hold fire, but Trump\u2019s comments on China today may prompt a rethink. And that could spook markets badly. As Bloomberg reported: \u201cIf tariffs scheduled for Dec. 15 are implemented it would be a huge shock to the market consensus,\u201d said Sue Trinh, managing director for global macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management in Hong Kong. \u201cTrump would be the Grinch that stole Christmas,\u201d she said. The US stock market is now expected to open lower, following Donald Trump\u2019s un-urgent comments about China. The Dow is tipped to drop by around 0.3%, according to the futures market. Yesterday it shed almost 1%, after the president slapped Brazil and Argentina with tariffs on their steel and aluminium exports to America. Donald Trump has alarmed investors by declaring that he\u2019s really in no rush to reach a trade deal with China. In London, the FTSE 100 has slumped by 81 points or over 1% to 7,203 points, its lowest level in almost two weeks. Mining stocks are leading the selloff, as a deeper trade war between Washington and Beijing is bad news for commodity prices. Boom! Donald Trump has suggested that a trade deal with China could be a year away. Asked if it could be agreed by the end of 2019, he replies that any deal is dependent on one thing - whether he wants to do it. The president claims that America is doing \u201cvery well\u201d from the trade war, citing the $28bn financial aid handed to US farmers. He claims this came from the tariffs paid by China -- even though tariffs are actually paid by American companies when they import goods from China. Trump then accuses China of \u201cripping off the US for many, many years\u201d, and now being desperate to end the trade war. He adds: In some ways I think it\u2019s better to wait until after the election for the China deal. But they want to make a deal now. That may alarm investors, who had been hoping for a Phase One trade deal for a while. The next US election is in November 2020..... Trump also said he is doing \u201cvery well\u201d with trade talks with China, even though a Phase One trade deal hasn\u2019t been reached yet. Just in: Donald Trump has launched a scathing attack on France\u2019s digital tax, and its president Emmanuel Macron. Speaking at the start of the NATO meeting in London, the US president says France is wrong to hit American tech companies with a 3% levy on their global revenues. Trump says he\u2019s \u201cnot in love\u201d with Facebook, Google and Twitter - although he does do well on Twitter. But they are \u201cour companies, American companies\u2019, so he wants to be the one taxing them. He tells reporters: I\u2019m not going to let anyone take advantage of American companies. If anyone is going to take advantage of American companies, it\u2019s going to be us..... I don\u2019t want France to be taxing American companies. If anyone\u2019s going to tax American companies, it\u2019s us. So we\u2019re putting a tax on their [France\u2019s] wines and everything else. Trump also criticises Macron, saying that sometimes the French president does things that are \u201ccounterproductive to his country\u201d. He also says it was \u201cvery insulting\u201d of Macron to label NATO as \u201cbrain-dead\u201d, adding that European history shows that \u201cno-one needs NATO more than France\u201d. The list of French products that could incur a 100% tariff runs to 63 entries, covering food, drink, fashion, cosmetics and accessories. It includes 22 different entries for cheese alone, including: Fresh cheese, Roquefort, Edam, blue-veined, Gruyere, Romano, Reggiano, Parmesan and Swiss varieties. Even cheddar is mentioned, even though that\u2019s more of a UK delicacy. The list also includes \u201cSparkling wine, made from grapes\u201d, which appears to covers France\u2019s champagne production as well as cr\u00e9mant - or fizz from other regions. On toiletries, the list includes Lip make-up, eye make-up, manicure or pedicure preparations, beauty or make-up powders, and various soaps. It also targets handbags, both with and without shoulder straps, whether they\u2019re made of \u2018reptile leather\u2019, patent leather, braid, silk, plastic or other manmade fibres. The US Trade Representative has also singled out 13 types of porcelain and china, including ranges for hotels and restaurants, and for households. It also singles out decanters, punch bowls, salt and pepper sets, mugs and steins. Finally, the list includes cast iron table and kitchen products, which could cover Le Creuset-style pots. You can read America\u2019s ruling against France here. In it, the US Trade Representative explains that the digital tax is unfair because it discriminates against U.S. digital companies, such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. In addition, the French DST is inconsistent with prevailing tax principles on account of its retroactivity, its application to revenue rather than income, its extraterritorial application, and its purpose of penalizing particular U.S. technology companies The US is also threatening to launch similar probes into Austria, Italy, and Turkey. Trade representative Robert Lighthizer said America wants to tackle \u201cgrowing protectionism\u201d..... \u201cIndeed, USTR is exploring whether to open Section 301 investigations into the digital services taxes of Austria, Italy, and Turkey. The USTR is focused on countering the growing protectionism of EU member states, which unfairly targets U.S. companies, whether through digital services taxes or other efforts that target leading U.S. digital services companies.\u201d Rome\u2019s government has proposed a similar digital tax, which would begin in January 2020, taxing large tech firms 3% of their revenue. Shares in French luxury goods makers are dropping, due to the threat of higher tariffs on their goods. LVMH, which produces Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon (yummy!) have fallen 1.5% on the Paris stock market. Kering, which owns Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, has shed 1.3%, while cosmetics company L\u2019Or\u00e9al has dipped by 0.3%. Critics of trade wars point out that tariffs are effectively a tax on consumers, as they make imports more expensive. And if America really does impose this 1o0% tariff, it could mean less French champagne and quality cheese is quaffed and scoffed in the States. Paul Donovan of UBS fears that Camembert will be off the menu, replaced with processed cheese (and you can\u2019t bake that in the oven with a little garlic and herbs!). He told clients: US President Trump tweeted plans to tax US consumers of French champagne and cheese (and other goods). The sentiment seems to be \u201clet them drink Coke.\u201d Taxing trade is one of the few things the US president can do alone. Trump is branding the Democrats as \u201cdo nothing\u201d \u2013 we may get more such tweets as a demonstration Trump is \u201cdoing something.\u201d Substituting Kraft Cheese Slices for Camembert may be a heavy burden. However, earlier tweets re-imposing taxes on US users of Brazilian and Argentinian steel seem even more serious. Companies have spent years believing that they can operate global supply chains. Trust in global supply chains is threatened when a Trump trade deal does not seem to last more than a few months. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has opened lower, as trade war jitters ripple through the City. Mining companies are among the top fallers, with Anglo American losing almost 2%. A trade war can mean lower demand for commodities such as iron ore and coal. Holiday firms TUI and Carnival, who are also vulnerable to a growth slowdown, are in the red too. Paris is also refusing to abandon its new digital tax plan, despite America\u2019s threats. Junior economy minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher has declared that France will be \u201cpugnacious\u201d over the issue. She told Sud Radio a little while ago that: \u201cIt is very clear that we do not need to go back on this, with regards to a topic that economically speaking makes sense. We need to be pugnacious on the subject. (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Back in July, France decided to impose a new 3% levy on digital companies with global revenues of more than \u20ac750m (\u00a3685m). It is meant to tackle the issue of major American companies paying little corporation tax in Europe, because they declare most of the profits back in the US. The French government is furieux about America\u2019s threat to impose a 100% tariff on some of its most cherished exports. Finance minister Brune Le Maire has told Radio Classique that the move is \u201cunacceptable\u201d, and not what you\u2019d expect from an ally. Le Maire also warned that Europe would retaliate, presumable with its own raft of tariffs on American imports. \u201cIn case of new American sanctions, the European Union would be ready to riposte\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. So much for the season of goodwill! Donald Trump has spooked the financial markets again, with a fresh flurry of tariffs that further escalate his trade war war. Overnight, the Trump administration on Monday proposed new tariffs up to $2.4bn of French goods. Prized exports, including champagne, cheese, handbags, porcelain, cheeses and yoghurt would incur a new levy of up to 100%. This swingeing move is a retaliation against France\u2019s new digital services tax, which Washington says unfairly discriminated against American technology companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer declared that the move: \u201csends a clear signal that the United States will take action against digital tax regimes that discriminate or otherwise impose undue burdens on US companies.\u201d The move casts a shadow over today\u2019s meeting of NATO leaders in London, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the military alliance. The attack on French exporters came just hours after Trump announced he was raising tariffs on steel and aluminium from Brazil and Argentina, in retaliation for their currencies falling to record lows. That knocked stocks across the globe, with European stock markets suffering their worst day in two months on Monday. Wall Street also suffered, with the Dow losing almost 1%. The selloff is now spreading to Asia, where Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 has slumped by over 2%. Hopes that Trump might secure a trade deal with China had driven markets higher in recent weeks; investors are now worrying that America could take a more belligerent approach. Tariffs restrict trade and drag on global growth, so any escalation is bad news for the global economy. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says Trump\u2019s latest barrage of tariffs has surprised the markets. The US placing steel and aluminium tariffs on Argentina and Brazil caught markets off guard. Traders have had US-China trade tunnel vision. As Americans would say, this came out of left field. The new tariffs in South America are a reminder that with Trump as US President, a phase one trade deal with China doesn\u2019t mean global trade just resets to the old status quo. As I type, France is vowing to hit back, so it could be a tense day.... The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI for November: Expected to rise to 44.5, from 44.5, showing another contraction",

I think there is going to be a knockout on Saturday and that is what people want to see, bloodshed and knockouts. And we\u2019ll definitely see each other the third time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joshua, 30, looked relaxed and lean but denied he was deliberately looking for more speed. \u201cI am quick anyway. I am not looking for anything except the win. That\u2019s the objective. It\u2019s not about speed. It\u2019s like night and day. I shed some skin last time. Rebuilt myself. The objective is just about to win, win, win.\u201d</p> \n<p>As he left the stage, Joshua posed for selfies with a delighted crowd of local supporters and also stopped briefly to speak to Dillian Whyte, his fellow heavyweight who is also on the bill against Mariusz Wach.</p> \n<p>\u201cBring it back, yeah?\u201d Whyte told him, to which Joshua replied: \u201cWe are going to go hard, trust me.\u201d</p> \n<p>As they spoke Ruiz was in the ring, looking fast and sharp as he went through three rounds on the pads. Meanwhile Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, told the Guardian that the British fighter will come in more than half a stone lighter than his first fight against Ruiz having spent much less time lifting weights.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like talking about weight because last time I said he would be at his lightest ever and he came in at his heaviest ever,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you will see something.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was 17st 10lb in the first fight but he\u2019s much, much lighter now. I think he\u2019ll weigh around 17st 2lb. He\u2019s not been pumping weights, he\u2019s been watching his diet, eating really clean. This camp has been 15 or 16 weeks not 10 or 11 as normal. He\u2019s been sparring, sparring, sparring.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hearn added: \u201cHe looks great, he feels great and he is lean, lean. He has cut out a lot of strength and conditioning work and this camp has been boxing related. He is boxing fit.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anthony Joshua gave little away about his new slimline physique or his tactics to defeat Andy Ruiz Jr in their rematch in the briefest of public workouts in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. He was, however, happy to advertise his powers of prophecy, predicting a trilogy with the Mexican-American whatever the result of the fight on Saturday. After barely a minute of shadowboxing in a ring in front of a huge government complex in Riyadh, Joshua said Ruiz had been on his mind since he stepped in as a late replacement to meet him in June \u2013 and would continue to be whatever the result of their WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight title fight in Diriyah. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the last time I will be seeing Andy Ruiz in the ring,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI think we make for good fights. I think there is going to be a knockout on Saturday and that is what people want to see, bloodshed and knockouts. And we\u2019ll definitely see each other the third time.\u201d Joshua, 30, looked relaxed and lean but denied he was deliberately looking for more speed. \u201cI am quick anyway. I am not looking for anything except the win. That\u2019s the objective. It\u2019s not about speed. It\u2019s like night and day. I shed some skin last time. Rebuilt myself. The objective is just about to win, win, win.\u201d As he left the stage, Joshua posed for selfies with a delighted crowd of local supporters and also stopped briefly to speak to Dillian Whyte, his fellow heavyweight who is also on the bill against Mariusz Wach. \u201cBring it back, yeah?\u201d Whyte told him, to which Joshua replied: \u201cWe are going to go hard, trust me.\u201d As they spoke Ruiz was in the ring, looking fast and sharp as he went through three rounds on the pads. Meanwhile Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, told the Guardian that the British fighter will come in more than half a stone lighter than his first fight against Ruiz having spent much less time lifting weights. \u201cI don\u2019t like talking about weight because last time I said he would be at his lightest ever and he came in at his heaviest ever,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you will see something. \u201cHe was 17st 10lb in the first fight but he\u2019s much, much lighter now. I think he\u2019ll weigh around 17st 2lb. He\u2019s not been pumping weights, he\u2019s been watching his diet, eating really clean. This camp has been 15 or 16 weeks not 10 or 11 as normal. He\u2019s been sparring, sparring, sparring.\u201d Hearn added: \u201cHe looks great, he feels great and he is lean, lean. He has cut out a lot of strength and conditioning work and this camp has been boxing related. He is boxing fit.\u201d",

Supporting awards were given to Brad Pitt for Once Upon A Time in Hollywood and Kathy Bates for Clint Eastwood\u2019s Richard Jewell. The announcement arrives the day after Netflix also triumphed at the Gotham awards, with Noah Baumbach\u2019s divorce drama Marriage Story taking top prizes for best feature and best actor.

Congress heard evidence that Trump attempted to bribe the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, by making a White House meeting and nearly $400m in military aid conditional on an investigation into Biden and the theory Ukraine meddled in 2016. Monday\u2019s Republican report directly contradicted the testimony of diplomats. It made little attempt to get to grips with the devastating evidence of Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the European Union, who spoke about the existence of a quid pro quo, or Fiona Hill, former top Russia expert at the White House, who warned against falling for Moscow\u2019s propaganda. Instead it presented the affair as a Democratic plot. Republicans also claimed evidence does not prove that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and a \u201cshadow\u201d group of US officials conspired to benefit the president politically. \u201cAt the heart of the matter,\u201d it said, \u201cthe impeachment inquiry involves the actions of only two people: President Trump and President Zelenskiy. The summary of their 25 July 2019 telephone conversation shows no quid pro quo or indication of conditionality, threats, or pressure \u2013 much less evidence of bribery or extortion.\u201d Trump has persistently told Democrats and other critics to read the transcript of that call. They have pointed to 10 words \u2013 \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though\u201d \u2013 as clear proof he expected a quid pro quo. The military aid was later released.",

According to Bennett, this has been a sticking point for Flotus: unlike her predecessors \u2013 Michelle Obama who was a Princeton grad and Hillary Clinton who was a lawyer \u2013 Melania often finds herself stuck without the tools to control the media narrative around her; to command the resources she needed in the White House for her initiatives. It might even explain why she had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-republican-convention-plagiarism-michelle-obama\">steal one of Michelle Obama\u2019s speeches</a>.</p> \n<p>But Melania has thrown herself into other projects instead.

Which is, of course, the century in which we should become more tolerant of all trees, no matter what color they are.</p> \n<h2><strong>2. Trump was his own real-life sock puppet</strong></h2> \n<p>People were bemused earlier this year upon learning that former presidential candidate Mitt Romney <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/10/mitt-romney-has-a-secret-twitter-account-and-it-sure-looks-like-its-this-one.html\">had a sock puppet account</a> \u2013 an account used to big oneself up, under the pretence of being someone else.</p> \n<p>The book revisits the story of Trump\u2019s own sock puppet: himself. He used to call reporters at outlets such as People and Forbes pretending to be Trump\u2019s PR guy \u201cJohn Barron\u201d, and would overinflate his wealth and importance.</p> \n<p>Forbes reporter Jonathan Greenberg realized he\u2019d been duped by Trump in 1984 when he played back a call he\u2019d had with \u201cBarron\u201d on tape, and realized it was just Trump speaking in a different tone. </p> \n<h2>3. Maybe Melania is just private</h2> \n<p>Looking at the evidence, an unforgiving audience might describe Melania as vapid. She created a grammatically incorrect public awareness program \u201cBe Best\u201d as her initiative, which took aim at online trolls, seemingly unaware of who she is married to. An explanation is yet to be given for why Melania once thought it was a good idea to create a <a href=\"https://www.racked.com/2016/8/22/12556786/melania-trump-caviar-skincare-lawsuit\">caviar-based skincare line</a> \u2013 probably because there are no words.</p> \n<p>But the book invites us to consider an alternative truth: perhaps Melania is simply a private person. She doesn\u2019t talk to the press, she barely talks to her security guards, and she even keeps her own quarters in the White House.</p> \n<p>\u201cImagine what those [polling] numbers could be if Melania actually said anything of major importance on a regular basis?\u201d Bennett opines, in reference to a poll that once put her as more popular than Michelle Obama.</p> \n<p>I wonder.</p> \n<h2>3.

Who will speak out for Tiffany?</h2> \n<p>At Melania and Trump\u2019s wedding, everyone had a role. Trump\u2019s sons, Don Jr and Eric, were his best men. Ivanka did a Bible reading.

      "body": "<p>It is a common dilemma for any hard-bitten politician faced with a hostile crowd: how best to make a sharp exit to avoid embarrassment?</p> <p>For one 63-year-old Tory councillor confronted with a less than receptive audience during a climate crisis debate the answer was to clamber over some bins and scale a fence.</p> <p>Nancy Bikson was a last-minute replacement for the Conservative prospective MP Maria Caulfield, who was too \u201cbusy\u201d to attend climate hustings for candidates in the key marginal seat of Lewes, East Sussex, at a school on Monday evening.</p> <p>Explaining that she was afforded little time to prepare for the event organised by local groups, including a branch of Extinction Rebellion, Bikson said she would not be sticking around for questions after making a short speech. She <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rebellewes/videos/1462064330617992/\">attracted groans from the crowd</a>, with one man heckling her before she even began speaking, asking: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go now?\u201d</p> <p>Bikson said she cared deeply about the environment and that she \u201cdid her bit\u201d but concluded, to further groans: \u201cIt\u2019s all about us, there is no such thing as government. Government is just people.\u201d</p> <p>Though she eventually gained polite applause, Bikson left the stage after other candidates made speeches and the event was opened to questions from the audience.</p> <p>However, when she left via the fire escape she found herself outside in a dead end as the school gates were locked. Rather than trudging back through the packed hall to get out, she pondered her predicament for up to 45 minutes before opting to climb over the fence.</p> <p>Bikson\u2019s great escape would have stayed secret were it not for a 13-year-old girl who saw the incident at Priory school.</p> <p>The teenager, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cI left about an hour early and about half an hour after she [Bikson] left the stage. I came outside and I was about to cycle off and she was behind the gate next to our school canteen which was locked and said, \u2018excuse me, can you help me?\u2019 She sounded quite desperate. I said the only way back out is through the auditorium and she said she didn\u2019t want to go back through the auditorium because of everyone. She said \u2018they all despise me \u2026 and they don\u2019t want me to go back in there\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Explaining that she felt sorry for the stranded politician, the teenager added: \u201cI went back into the canteen to try and open the door from the inside [allowing her a route of escape] but it was locked. Then I got a caretaker. I said a caretaker is coming but she said, \u2018don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll just climb over the gate\u2019. And she got up on the school bins and climbed over the gate. She\u2019d been out there for a while.\u201d</p> <p>After hearing the tale, the schoolgirl\u2019s mother, who runs a business managing composers, brought the councillor\u2019s ordeal to a wider audience, posting on Facebook: \u201cLewes Tory MP Maria Caulfield failed to show for tonight\u2019s climate hustings. Her last-minute replacement left the hall before the questions, having first explained that she knew nothing about climate or the environment.</p> <p>\u201cShe was spotted by my daughter 45 minutes later still trying to find her way off the premises without having to go back through the hall. She ended up climbing the fence via the bins. Ignominious.\u201d</p> <p>Bikson apparently admitted her actions later, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/the-londoner-ken-clarkes-crisis-of-political-faith-a4303141.html\">telling the Evening Standard on Tuesday</a> \u201cIt was only because there wasn\u2019t any other way and I didn\u2019t want to disrupt everybody.

      "bodyText": "It is a common dilemma for any hard-bitten politician faced with a hostile crowd: how best to make a sharp exit to avoid embarrassment? For one 63-year-old Tory councillor confronted with a less than receptive audience during a climate crisis debate the answer was to clamber over some bins and scale a fence. Nancy Bikson was a last-minute replacement for the Conservative prospective MP Maria Caulfield, who was too \u201cbusy\u201d to attend climate hustings for candidates in the key marginal seat of Lewes, East Sussex, at a school on Monday evening. Explaining that she was afforded little time to prepare for the event organised by local groups, including a branch of Extinction Rebellion, Bikson said she would not be sticking around for questions after making a short speech. She attracted groans from the crowd, with one man heckling her before she even began speaking, asking: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go now?\u201d Bikson said she cared deeply about the environment and that she \u201cdid her bit\u201d but concluded, to further groans: \u201cIt\u2019s all about us, there is no such thing as government. Government is just people.\u201d Though she eventually gained polite applause, Bikson left the stage after other candidates made speeches and the event was opened to questions from the audience. However, when she left via the fire escape she found herself outside in a dead end as the school gates were locked. Rather than trudging back through the packed hall to get out, she pondered her predicament for up to 45 minutes before opting to climb over the fence. Bikson\u2019s great escape would have stayed secret were it not for a 13-year-old girl who saw the incident at Priory school. The teenager, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cI left about an hour early and about half an hour after she [Bikson] left the stage. I came outside and I was about to cycle off and she was behind the gate next to our school canteen which was locked and said, \u2018excuse me, can you help me?\u2019 She sounded quite desperate. I said the only way back out is through the auditorium and she said she didn\u2019t want to go back through the auditorium because of everyone. She said \u2018they all despise me \u2026 and they don\u2019t want me to go back in there\u2019.\u201d Explaining that she felt sorry for the stranded politician, the teenager added: \u201cI went back into the canteen to try and open the door from the inside [allowing her a route of escape] but it was locked. Then I got a caretaker. I said a caretaker is coming but she said, \u2018don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll just climb over the gate\u2019. And she got up on the school bins and climbed over the gate. She\u2019d been out there for a while.\u201d After hearing the tale, the schoolgirl\u2019s mother, who runs a business managing composers, brought the councillor\u2019s ordeal to a wider audience, posting on Facebook: \u201cLewes Tory MP Maria Caulfield failed to show for tonight\u2019s climate hustings. Her last-minute replacement left the hall before the questions, having first explained that she knew nothing about climate or the environment. \u201cShe was spotted by my daughter 45 minutes later still trying to find her way off the premises without having to go back through the hall. She ended up climbing the fence via the bins. Ignominious.\u201d Bikson apparently admitted her actions later, telling the Evening Standard on Tuesday \u201cIt was only because there wasn\u2019t any other way and I didn\u2019t want to disrupt everybody. It was either that or sit outside for a couple of hours.\u201d But when the Guardian rang to get her version of events she was tight-lipped, replying: \u201cI can neither confirm nor deny, thank you.\u201d Lewes was previously held by the former Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker for nearly two decades before being won by Brexiter Caufield in 2015.

On the cost score, the IFS report merely offered a factual two-part answer, one of which was necessarily imprecise.</p> <p>First, companies\u2019 current liabilities would be brought onto the public balance sheet and honoured, which adds up to at least \u00a3150bn; that\u2019s Labour\u2019s policy. Second, compensation for shareholders would run \u201cto many tens of billions of pounds\u201d, which is all one can assume from a proposal to let parliament decide prices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/03/ifs-warns-labour-renationalisation-may-delay-low-carbon-economy\">IFS warns Labour renationalisation may delay low-carbon economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fine, about \u00a3200bn of assets would also arrive, but what happens next? What are the risks of radical change? The thinktank\u2019s conclusion is that \u201cat least in the short-run Labour\u2019s current plan would lead to significant disruption which could easily, for example, lead to a hiatus in progress towards decarbonisation in the energy sector\u201d.</p> <p>That worry sounds legitimate. In energy, a Labour government would simultaneously be trying to cut prices for consumers while boosting investment and changing the make-up of the electricity and gas grid. Those goals don\u2019t all pull in the same direction. To dismiss the IFS stance as \u201cnakedly ideological\u201d, as the shadow chancellor John McDonnell did, is unfair. The thinktank\u2019s point is pragmatic \u2013 it\u2019s about the most effective way to achieve an outcome.</p> <p>The risk of confusion via complexity is surely real. Even in the world of FTSE 100 takeovers, there are countless examples of managements baffling themselves because they didn\u2019t understand what they were taking on. Labour\u2019s plans involve changing control of 5% of total UK assets currently held by private companies, according to the IFS numbers. The programme is enormous \u2013 and it\u2019s supposed to happen within a single parliamentary term.</p> <p>It would also be generous to describe the planning as detailed. We don\u2019t know the batting order, as it were, and Openreach and the big six energy supply companies were 11th-hour entries in the manifesto.</p> <p>It would be easier to support a nationalisation programme that was confined to rail and water. In rail, the track is already under public ownership and even the current government\u2019s adviser says the franchise system is unfit for purpose; the argument for a state-backed shake-up is excellent. In water, dividend-extraction at the English companies has been obscene in many cases.</p> <p>Elsewhere, though, the IFS\u2019s challenge matters: \u201cIt is unclear which of Labour\u2019s stated objectives could not be achieved via changes to the current system of regulation.\u201d Quite. The UK\u2019s regulatory system is loose by international standards, and the great advantage of simply tightening the rules is that you can do so easily. Shareholders would squeal but they would be have to fall into line because regulations are never set in stone.</p> <p>By contrast, nationalising five entire industries, more or less, in rapid succession is to take a risk with an important chunk of the economy. Forget the ideology; on a pure risk/reward analysis, it\u2019s hard to see the case for being so ambitious. A smaller nationalisation proposal would have been more credible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Shameful blocking bid falls flat on Inmarsat</h2> <p>The sport for the lawyers was terrific, but the attempt to delay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/25/uk-satellite-operator-inmarsat-agrees-34bn-takeover-by-consortium\">the \u00a32.6bn takeover of Inmarsat</a>, the satellite communications provider, was abandoned on the steps of the high court on Tuesday. A crew of rebellious hedge funds, led by Oaktree Capital, dropped their attempt to get a higher price from the bidders.</p> <p>In one sense, that\u2019s a shame. Inmarsat is a rare example of a large UK tech firm and the takeover price looks too mean.</p> <p>On the other hand, the hedgies weren\u2019t trying to save the company for the nation. They just wantedmoney for shareholders, such as themselves, on the grounds that Inmarsat\u2019s value could soon be boosted if the US Federal Trade Commission allows the company\u2019s spectrum assets to be used for 5G services.</p> <p>Sorry, but that\u2019s a weak argument for blocking a deal that was backed by 80% of Inmarsat\u2019s shareholders in May. Investors knew what Inmarsat owns, even if they weren\u2019t focused on the spectrum possibilities.</p> <p>The hedgies folded after the bidders, private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Apax, said on Monday that they would cancel their offer if asked to pay more. It\u2019s the right outcome. It\u2019s a shame to see Inmarsat go, but the takeover code would be a nonsense if bids were replayed regularly in court.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Institute for Fiscal Studies is asking the right question about Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans. The key issue is how well the assets would be run under public ownership. What is the party hoping to achieve that could not be done via smarter regulation? This part of the debate has been obscured by endless quarrels over how much it would cost to nationalise rail, mail, water, energy and BT Openreach. On the cost score, the IFS report merely offered a factual two-part answer, one of which was necessarily imprecise. First, companies\u2019 current liabilities would be brought onto the public balance sheet and honoured, which adds up to at least \u00a3150bn; that\u2019s Labour\u2019s policy. Second, compensation for shareholders would run \u201cto many tens of billions of pounds\u201d, which is all one can assume from a proposal to let parliament decide prices. Fine, about \u00a3200bn of assets would also arrive, but what happens next? What are the risks of radical change? The thinktank\u2019s conclusion is that \u201cat least in the short-run Labour\u2019s current plan would lead to significant disruption which could easily, for example, lead to a hiatus in progress towards decarbonisation in the energy sector\u201d. That worry sounds legitimate. In energy, a Labour government would simultaneously be trying to cut prices for consumers while boosting investment and changing the make-up of the electricity and gas grid. Those goals don\u2019t all pull in the same direction. To dismiss the IFS stance as \u201cnakedly ideological\u201d, as the shadow chancellor John McDonnell did, is unfair. The thinktank\u2019s point is pragmatic \u2013 it\u2019s about the most effective way to achieve an outcome. The risk of confusion via complexity is surely real. Even in the world of FTSE 100 takeovers, there are countless examples of managements baffling themselves because they didn\u2019t understand what they were taking on. Labour\u2019s plans involve changing control of 5% of total UK assets currently held by private companies, according to the IFS numbers. The programme is enormous \u2013 and it\u2019s supposed to happen within a single parliamentary term. It would also be generous to describe the planning as detailed. We don\u2019t know the batting order, as it were, and Openreach and the big six energy supply companies were 11th-hour entries in the manifesto. It would be easier to support a nationalisation programme that was confined to rail and water. In rail, the track is already under public ownership and even the current government\u2019s adviser says the franchise system is unfit for purpose; the argument for a state-backed shake-up is excellent. In water, dividend-extraction at the English companies has been obscene in many cases. Elsewhere, though, the IFS\u2019s challenge matters: \u201cIt is unclear which of Labour\u2019s stated objectives could not be achieved via changes to the current system of regulation.\u201d Quite. The UK\u2019s regulatory system is loose by international standards, and the great advantage of simply tightening the rules is that you can do so easily. Shareholders would squeal but they would be have to fall into line because regulations are never set in stone. By contrast, nationalising five entire industries, more or less, in rapid succession is to take a risk with an important chunk of the economy. Forget the ideology; on a pure risk/reward analysis, it\u2019s hard to see the case for being so ambitious. A smaller nationalisation proposal would have been more credible. Shameful blocking bid falls flat on Inmarsat The sport for the lawyers was terrific, but the attempt to delay the \u00a32.6bn takeover of Inmarsat, the satellite communications provider, was abandoned on the steps of the high court on Tuesday. A crew of rebellious hedge funds, led by Oaktree Capital, dropped their attempt to get a higher price from the bidders. In one sense, that\u2019s a shame. Inmarsat is a rare example of a large UK tech firm and the takeover price looks too mean. On the other hand, the hedgies weren\u2019t trying to save the company for the nation. They just wantedmoney for shareholders, such as themselves, on the grounds that Inmarsat\u2019s value could soon be boosted if the US Federal Trade Commission allows the company\u2019s spectrum assets to be used for 5G services. Sorry, but that\u2019s a weak argument for blocking a deal that was backed by 80% of Inmarsat\u2019s shareholders in May. Investors knew what Inmarsat owns, even if they weren\u2019t focused on the spectrum possibilities. The hedgies folded after the bidders, private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Apax, said on Monday that they would cancel their offer if asked to pay more. It\u2019s the right outcome. It\u2019s a shame to see Inmarsat go, but the takeover code would be a nonsense if bids were replayed regularly in court.",

      "bodyText": "A former head of counter-terrorism has said cuts to police numbers, not the length of sentences, have played the greater role in jeopardising public safety. Robert Quick, who led Scotland Yard\u2019s counter-terrorism command from 2008-9, rejected claims made by Boris Johnson after last Friday\u2019s attack at London Bridge in which a terrorist killed two people before being shot dead by police. The prime minister had sought to blame the Labour government, which left power in 2010, for Usman Khan being free. He was jailed over a terrorist plot in 2012 and released in December last year, halfway through his sentence, under tough conditions but without checks as to his suitability. However, Quick said on Tuesday that the fight against terrorism had been damaged by large reductions made to police funding by the Conservative government since 2010. \u201cIn the 2000s the police worked hard to rebuild neighbourhood policing, with a clear local presence, with staff who were visible and accessible,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of that has been cut back heavily. \u201cThese are the eyes and ears of the counter-terrorism efforts. It is the foundation stone of security and counter-terrorism and has been broken up in the last 10 years.\u201d Dedicated counter-terrorism officers escaped the effects of austerity but Quick said this was only part of what was needed to minimise the dangers posed by terrorists to the UK\u2019s defences. \u201cThe counter-terrorism infrastructure has been very relatively left alone by austerity \u2013 it\u2019s had to be through necessity. \u201cThe investigative side is good, but once [attackers] are radicalised and cross the Rubicon, the ability to deal with that after arrest and prosecution is very much wanting. \u201cCounter-terrorism relies on the local intelligence feed from local police divisions. It has been undermined, without doubt, by the reduction of policing presence in communities. \u201cHow we are policing those communities and the connection with communities, seems to have been undermined by austerity.\u201d Speaking about the effect of sentencing laws on Khan\u2019s attack, Quick said: \u201cIt is one case and we do not have enough detail to make sweeping judgments about it. We certainly know a lot about the effects of police cuts.\u201d On Johnson, he said: \u201cI can\u2019t see much substance in what he says. They are rather tired, almost cliched, remarks that are made in the wake of these tragedies.\u201d Quick said the Khan case had \u201ccalled into question\u201d government policy on how to assess prisoners before release, as well as resources in jails. Khan was on a multi-agency public protection arrangement, which would have involved representatives from police, prison and probation sectors managing him in the community. The probation sector was separated in 2014 into a public sector organisation managing high-risk criminals and 21 private companies responsible for the supervision of 150,000 low- to medium-risk offenders under a widely derided overhaul spearheaded by the then justice secretary, Chris Grayling. After years of damning criticism from MPs, inspectorates and former probation officers, the government decided to bring all offender management under the publicly run National Probation Service (NPS) by spring 2021. The changes took place against a backdrop of 40% real-terms cuts to the Ministry of Justice budget. Meanwhile the general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers (Napo), Ian Lawrence, has said that while there was no evidence that the probation service failed to supervise the licence conditions to which Khan was subjected, the issue of community safety could not be divorced from the cuts made to the sector. \u201cFrom what we know, [Khan] was given the highest possible supervision plan for someone who has committed that offence,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond that he would have been given the highest level of supervision that would have involved two or three visits a week with a probation officer. \u201cOn the other hand you can\u2019t divorce the issue of community safety from the reality of what the probation service going through at the moment.

Maybe it was the good cheer provided by the twin peaks of the baubled Christmas trees in the background and the festive decorations on the glass table in front of him.</p> \n<p>The previous week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/corbyn-resists-calls-to-apologies-to-british-jews-after-rabbis-claims\">Jeremy Corbyn had resisted all attempts</a> by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil to apologise for antisemitism in the Labour party. Time and again the Grand Inquisitor had tried to get him to say sorry, but his SAS training in resisting interrogation techniques had proved invaluable.</p> \n<p>But the Labour leader was putty in the hands of Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. Well, maybe not quite putty but certainly more of a pushover. Initially Corbyn had several times avoided saying the \u2018S\u2019 word, preferring instead to talk about all the processes he had instituted within the party to deal with anti-semitism and how he wanted everyone to feel secure.</p> \n<p>\u201cJust say sorry,\u201d Bad Cop Phillip pleaded.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/corbyn-apologises-for-antisemitism-in-labour-party\">And eventually Corbyn cracked</a>, saying that obviously he was very sorry. Quite why it had taken him so long was something of a mystery; not least as he had already said sorry several times in the past. Most politicians have no problem with repeating themselves \u2013 often in the same sentence \u2013 but with apologies the Labour leader is happy to make an exception. Sorry is a word to be used sparingly, even when to say it would save himself a whole load of grief.</p> \n<p>Sensing the apology might have taken it out of him a bit, Good Cop Holly enquired if maybe Corbyn was exhausted by the election. God knows, the rest of the country is. It\u2019s hard to remember a more toxic and depressing campaign, one dominated by negativity and a refusal by the prime minister to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2019/dec/03/chuntering-and-untruths-why-andrew-marrs-interview-with-boris-johnson-was-so-controversial\">either engage with the public or the truth</a>. Corbyn insisted he was fresh as a daisy.</p> \n<p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not exhausted?\u201d Good Cop asked again.</p> \n<p>No he definitely wasn\u2019t. Corbyn was having the time of his life, even if everyone else was experiencing the nightmare of theirs. And he would happily be carrying on as Labour leader for the next five years regardless of what happened next week. As for the immediate future, he would be putting up his own Christmas tree on 12 December and keeping a record of what a wonderful time he had had on the This Morning sofa.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Good Cop Holly enquired if maybe Corbyn was exhausted by the election. God knows, the rest of the country is</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>To be fair, Corbyn did look as if he had enjoyed the interview, in as much as he ever appears to enjoy anything. Deep down, he\u2019s a bit of a miserablist. Something I quite understand and respect.

      "bodyText": "Maybe it was the warm embrace of the pale blue comfy sofa in ITV\u2019s This Morning studio. Maybe it was the good cheer provided by the twin peaks of the baubled Christmas trees in the background and the festive decorations on the glass table in front of him. The previous week, Jeremy Corbyn had resisted all attempts by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil to apologise for antisemitism in the Labour party. Time and again the Grand Inquisitor had tried to get him to say sorry, but his SAS training in resisting interrogation techniques had proved invaluable. But the Labour leader was putty in the hands of Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. Well, maybe not quite putty but certainly more of a pushover. Initially Corbyn had several times avoided saying the \u2018S\u2019 word, preferring instead to talk about all the processes he had instituted within the party to deal with anti-semitism and how he wanted everyone to feel secure. \u201cJust say sorry,\u201d Bad Cop Phillip pleaded. And eventually Corbyn cracked, saying that obviously he was very sorry. Quite why it had taken him so long was something of a mystery; not least as he had already said sorry several times in the past. Most politicians have no problem with repeating themselves \u2013 often in the same sentence \u2013 but with apologies the Labour leader is happy to make an exception. Sorry is a word to be used sparingly, even when to say it would save himself a whole load of grief. Sensing the apology might have taken it out of him a bit, Good Cop Holly enquired if maybe Corbyn was exhausted by the election. God knows, the rest of the country is. It\u2019s hard to remember a more toxic and depressing campaign, one dominated by negativity and a refusal by the prime minister to either engage with the public or the truth. Corbyn insisted he was fresh as a daisy. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not exhausted?\u201d Good Cop asked again. No he definitely wasn\u2019t. Corbyn was having the time of his life, even if everyone else was experiencing the nightmare of theirs. And he would happily be carrying on as Labour leader for the next five years regardless of what happened next week. As for the immediate future, he would be putting up his own Christmas tree on 12 December and keeping a record of what a wonderful time he had had on the This Morning sofa. To be fair, Corbyn did look as if he had enjoyed the interview, in as much as he ever appears to enjoy anything. Deep down, he\u2019s a bit of a miserablist. Something I quite understand and respect. It\u2019s generally good to start with the premise that there\u2019s no bad situation that can\u2019t be made worse. Though in this instance, the Labour leader must have been slightly disorientated because \u2013 along with the apology \u2013 he had come out of the exchanges well ahead. Bad Cop had opened by bringing up Johnson\u2019s rant in the Sun about Corbyn being a threat to national security, which Corbyn had politely rebutted by observing that it had been the Tories that had introduced wholesale cuts to the police, the courts, the probation service and countless rehabilitation programmes and that Labour was committed to remaining a member of Nato.

      "bodyText": "The 2019 Formula One Esports series will come to a climax at a shopping centre in west London on Wednesday. Inside the Vue cinema on Fulham Broadway a customised arena will host racers from 10 different teams, each associated with an official F1 team, as they complete the final three grands prix of a virtual season. Up for grabs is prize money of $500,000 (\u00a3385,000). But there is also the chance to shape the future of the sport, both online and off. Currently third in the standings is Renault Vitality\u2019s Jarno Opmeer \u2013 lying 43 points behind the leader, Ferrari\u2019s David Tonizza \u2013 and this year\u2019s title might be just out of reach for the 19-year-old Dutchman. A podium finish, however, would still be a welcome improvement for the team who finished bottom of the classification last year. Something significant is also happening on Thursday, when Opmeer will become the first esports athlete to test-drive Renault\u2019s F1 simulator. Housed in their base at Enstone in Oxfordshire, the simulator is a critical tool in helping the team to fine-tune their F1 cars, and for Daniel Ricciardo and Nico H\u00fclkenberg to get used to driving them. Costing by some estimates as much as \u00a320,000 an hour to run, it has not been a facility made available to gamers. Opmeer, it is true, came to esports through traditional racing. A member of the Renault Academy, he was encouraged to try out for virtual competition at Enstone this spring. He took part in the qualifying tests and was selected, alongside Germany\u2019s Cedric Thom\u00e9.

Almost three years ago we highlighted that loneliness and isolation among disabled people is a critical issue, with one in four feeling lonely every day. However, it seems not much has changed in terms of loneliness and life satisfaction \u2013 it is still a major issue.</p> <p>Many of the contributing barriers, such as the need for accessible transport and buildings, financial support and appropriate social care still exist, and in areas such as social care the situation has even worsened. A lack of understanding and awareness of disability is also a significant obstacle; nearly half of non-disabled people feel that they do not have anything in common with disabled people, and 26 % admit to avoiding engaging in conversation with a disabled person.</p> <p>It\u2019s time society was made truly accessible, and this includes providing the right social care to disabled people so they can be full and active members.<br><strong>Richard Kramer</strong><br><em>Chief executive, Sense</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Office for National Statistics findings show businesses are failing those with a disability. Business leaders have continued to underestimate the value of disabled people for too long \u2013 people should not be excluded for simply being different.

      "bodyText": "Most of the latest data released is shocking and once again shows the barriers disabled people face every single day (Disabled staff paid 12% less, \u2018damning\u2019 official figures show, 3 December). Almost three years ago we highlighted that loneliness and isolation among disabled people is a critical issue, with one in four feeling lonely every day. However, it seems not much has changed in terms of loneliness and life satisfaction \u2013 it is still a major issue. Many of the contributing barriers, such as the need for accessible transport and buildings, financial support and appropriate social care still exist, and in areas such as social care the situation has even worsened. A lack of understanding and awareness of disability is also a significant obstacle; nearly half of non-disabled people feel that they do not have anything in common with disabled people, and 26 % admit to avoiding engaging in conversation with a disabled person. It\u2019s time society was made truly accessible, and this includes providing the right social care to disabled people so they can be full and active members. Richard Kramer Chief executive, Sense \u2022 The Office for National Statistics findings show businesses are failing those with a disability. Business leaders have continued to underestimate the value of disabled people for too long \u2013 people should not be excluded for simply being different. It\u2019s disappointing to see that the area where this disparity is the greatest is London, where disabled people are being paid 15.3% less than non-disabled employees. It\u2019s time that businesses stand up and ensure disabled people are fully included.

The victim\u2019s family said in a statement: \u201cAndy Szaruta, loyal husband to wife Susan, and loving father to daughter Rachel, 28, and son Christian, 32. Andy was a sergeant major in the Royal Marine Commandos for 22 years, gaining medals for serving in the Falklands war, two tours in Northern Ireland, and a Nato medal during the Bosnian war.\u201d Agca was facing a charge of murder but the prosecution accepted his plea of manslaughter. DCI Darren Hannant, said: \u201cThis was an appalling crime where Mr Szaruta suffered ultimately fatal injuries in front of his horrified wife and daughter. \u201cAgca inflicted a cowardly assault on Mr Szaruta, with no justification whatsoever. Agca fled the scene with no regard or concern for how seriously injured his victim was and, until recently, had not accepted any responsibility for what happened.\u201d",

As we walked towards the burnt-out wreckage of The Cube in Bolton, it took me straight back to Grenfell Tower the morning after the fire that killed my niece and 71 others. Two and a half years since Grenfell, it is a silent scandal how little has changed. The images of the cladding crackling and dripping from the Bolton student block is a shameful reminder that thousands of homes are still not safe. There have been eight significant residential fires since Grenfell. And today tens of thousands of people are still living in buildings wrapped in dangerous combustible materials. It\u2019s on our homes, our hospitals, our care homes and our schools. It still keeps me awake at night worrying that what happened to my family could happen to another.

While Tory and Liberal Democrat MPs voted through the bill, outside, the police kettled protesters and charged at us with horses. Just after 6pm that evening, while detained in the kettle in Parliament Square, I suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain at the hands of the police. I had to undergo <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11967098\" title=\"\">life-saving brain surgery</a>.</p> <p>After almost a decade I am still fighting for justice. There has to date been no accountability for the dangerous and violent policing of the protest, nor for what happened to me. Tomorrow, a process begins that may change this: the officer who is accused of striking me is facing a gross misconduct hearing. I am due to give evidence on 9 December, nine years to the day after the protest.</p> <p>How did we get here and why did it take so long? Several weeks after nearly dying at the hands of the police, they arrested me and spent more than two years trying to send me to prison. I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/mar/08/student-tuition-fees-cleared-disorder\" title=\"\">unanimously acquitted</a> at the end of the third trial.</p> <p>The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC, formerly IPCC) finally finished its investigation into the incident in October 2015. The investigator\u2019s opinion was that the City police officer, PC Mark Alston, had a case to answer for gross misconduct on <a href=\"https://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/about-us/your-right-to-information/misconduct-hearings/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">two allegations</a>. Those allegations are that he used \u201chis baton in a violent, uncontrolled and dangerous manner when he used it to deliver a number of downward strikes at head height towards a group of demonstrators\u201d, and that \u201cwhilst using his baton to strike at demonstrators \u2026 hit [me] on the head, causing a serious head injury\u201d. Alston has always denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>Over the course of three years, the IOPC first asked, then eventually directed City police to bring these charges against their officer. Despite the IOPC ultimately having the power to compel police forces to bring misconduct charges against officers, City police legally challenged the IOPC\u2019s recommendation on the grounds that it was \u201cirrational\u201d and that my case had \u201cno merit\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyers for City police even went so far as to argue in court that allowing cases like mine to proceed to a gross misconduct hearing was damaging to the maintenance of \u201cpublic confidence in and the reputation of the police service\u201d. In 2018 the high court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/15/alfie-meadows-london-police-force-must-act-over-officer-accused-of-excessive-force-says-court\" title=\"\">dismissed their claim</a> and forced them to hold a gross misconduct hearing, which will finally take place more than a year later. </p> <p>Over the past decade the police\u2019s response to nearly killing me has been to attempt to blame and criminalise me, and to delay and deny accountability for their actions. This pattern is found in many cases of police violence and deaths in custody, where <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\" title=\"\">racism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/iopc-stats-2019\" title=\"\">maltreatment</a> of people with mental health problems are often significant factors.</p> <p>In many cases where people have died or been seriously injured in state custody, the grieving families have been forced to struggle for years and sometimes decades for justice for their loved ones \u2013 justice that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/sean-rigg-five-officers-cleared-of-misconduct-over-death-in-custody\" title=\"\">believe is often never delivered</a>.

In 2018 the high court dismissed their claim and forced them to hold a gross misconduct hearing, which will finally take place more than a year later. Over the past decade the police\u2019s response to nearly killing me has been to attempt to blame and criminalise me, and to delay and deny accountability for their actions. This pattern is found in many cases of police violence and deaths in custody, where racism and maltreatment of people with mental health problems are often significant factors. In many cases where people have died or been seriously injured in state custody, the grieving families have been forced to struggle for years and sometimes decades for justice for their loved ones \u2013 justice that they believe is often never delivered. Not only do families have to feel the immeasurable pain of having lost a loved one, they have to struggle against forces seeking to obstruct truth, justice and accountability. We should remember why we were in Parliament Square nine years ago. We were protesting in our thousands against the government\u2019s use of the 2008 financial crisis as a pretext to raise tuition fees and impose austerity. After almost a decade we can see that tuition fees have seriously damaged the higher education sector. Access to it has been impeded and students and staff are suffering the effects of funding cuts, tuition fee debt, increasingly precarious working conditions, pay freezes and pension cuts. Cuts to public services have deepened inequality and caused immense suffering and even death for the most vulnerable. Police violence and attacks on the right to protest, like those faced by Extinction Rebellion, must be understood in the context of these social and economic injustices. I was lucky to survive the state violence I faced, but many, often the most marginalised, do not. We must listen to these communities and stand in solidarity with them in calling for the police to be held accountable for their actions. \u2022 Alfie Meadows is a philosophy student at Kingston University, and campaigns for free education and against state injustice",

      "body": "<p>The last time a US president visited the UK at Christmas, it was in a Richard Curtis film and Hugh Grant was the prime minister. This week, real-life Hugh Grant has been knocking on doors with Lib Dem and Labour candidates urgently trying to stop Brexit, and the guy who demanded a cameo in the film Home Alone 2 has been the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d for three years.</p> <p>Back then, people called the Curtis film \u2013 Love, Actually \u2013 smug. But in retrospect, it had nothing on the west. </p> <p>Only a wildly misplaced sense of self-satisfaction could possibly have got us where we are today. Which is to say, watching a Wotsit wearing a four-foot red tie give a press conference in the US ambassador\u2019s London residence, during which he reduces Nato\u2019s complex geopolitics to the level of suburban real-estate rivalries. As a visitor, Trump has a strong Ghost of Christmas Future energy to him.</p> <p>Those who love clinical narcissists \u2013 and who doesn\u2019t? \u2013 will be disappointed that Trump and Boris Johnson will not be doing a joint press conference at this Nato summit. But it is believed the crossing of their two streams would have had the potential to rip the very fabric of reality, creating a reversal of Nato\u2019s original aims, and plunging the 70-year-old alliance into immediate land war with Russia.</p> <p>Also there\u2019s an election on, and the Tories sense even a handshake with Trump could piss their electoral bed.</p> <p>So there won\u2019t be the chance to press the PM on the time he turned his Quick-Quotes Quill on Donald, accusing him of \u201ca quite stupefying ignorance that makes him, frankly, unfit to hold the office of president of the United States\u201d. Trump is just clever enough to pretend this never happened, which is always a neat way of insulting an overpromoted journalist. (Orson Welles used to greet the critic who gave him his worst reviews effusively every time he saw him, \u201cso he would think that I\u2019d never read a word he wrote\u201d.)</p> <p>Indeed, Trump used his impromptu press conference to stress his blissful unfamiliarity with a great number of things. Appearance-wise, the US president\u2019s lips are a sort of pouting anus \u2013 a mouth sphincter which today emitted a roll-call of guys and stuff he didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>Take Prince Andrew. \u201cI don\u2019t know Prince Andrew,\u201d Trump sighed with a moue, despite there being significant photographic evidence to the contrary. \u201cBut it\u2019s a tough story. But I don\u2019t know him.\u201d</p> <p>Or take Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cI know nothing about the gentleman,\u201d Trump shrugged, having very recently described the Labour leader as \u201cso bad for your country\u201d, warning he\u2019d \u201ctake you in such a bad way\u201d. None of that today. \u201cReally. I know nothing about him,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Or take the notion that Trump thought the NHS was on the table in a future trade deal between the UK and US. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where that rumour started,\u201d mused the president, who used his state visit in June to tell the massed TV cameras, \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing in trade, everything is on the table.\u201d</p> <p>Today the president was pushing a line that sounded distinctly like it had been crayoned on to giant cue cards held aloft by the Conservative campaign team. \u201cWe have absolutely nothing to do with it,\u201d he insisted of the health service, \u201cand we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter.\u201d</p> <p>Alas, Trump delivered this with the same wooden conviction with which he addressed Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 2, when he was asked where the Plaza hotel lobby was. \u201cDown the hall and to the left,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXE3Ku-mGrk\">gurned Trump</a>, in a manner to make you think it was upstairs and to the right. And so with his NHS speechlet, during which he felt convincingly out-acted by the ambassador\u2019s furniture.</p> <p>Still, I hope Trump welcomed the chance to visit the originals of the faux-antique armchairs that litter his properties. His state visit in June featured a trip to Westminster, where his reaction to being shown a slab commemorating Lord Byron was to ask what type of marble it was, perhaps with a view to getting it as a shower tray or something.</p> <p>Even Trump\u2019s memories are ersatz reproductions of events. \u201cYou know that I was a fan of Brexit,\u201d he reminded journalists. \u201cI called it the day before. I was opening up Turnberry.\u201d In fact, he opened Turnberry the day after the Brexit result, when even that great seer David Cameron was beginning to get a bad feeling.</p> <p>As for the rest of the president\u2019s plans for the day, they seemed to have involved giving Emmanuel Macron a wedgie and preparing for tonight\u2019s Buckingham Palace reception with the Queen. The best way to do that was with some hardcore fundraising, and he was reported to be offering London-based US business people a chance to attend a reception with the president for $35,000, a photo and the reception for $50,000, and $125,00 to join a roundtable.</p> <p>Bigger spenders shouldn\u2019t fret \u2013 there\u2019s bound to be a secret price list for the guys who want to pay even more for something really special. Namely, the ambassador gig in a former breakaway Soviet republic, and the chance to hole up in one of the boutique Federal Correctional Institutions when you get out of your depth.</p> <p>So doubtless a good day was had by all. Well, all except one, perhaps. Over on a FiveLive phone in, a certain close friend was acting totally, totally, cool about not having a meeting lined up with the president.</p> <p>\u201cI have not, no,\u201d blustered Nigel Farage. How come? \u201cWell, this is a bit awkward, isn\u2019t it? Whilst he\u2019s a friend of mine, there\u2019s a general election going on, so I don\u2019t intend to \u2026\u201d How about a quick WhatsApp? \u201cIf there are some personal exchanges they would be purely personal. I wouldn\u2019t talk about them.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t shut up about them, dear. Commiserations today and for next week. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll remember you fondly.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The last time a US president visited the UK at Christmas, it was in a Richard Curtis film and Hugh Grant was the prime minister. This week, real-life Hugh Grant has been knocking on doors with Lib Dem and Labour candidates urgently trying to stop Brexit, and the guy who demanded a cameo in the film Home Alone 2 has been the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d for three years. Back then, people called the Curtis film \u2013 Love, Actually \u2013 smug. But in retrospect, it had nothing on the west. Only a wildly misplaced sense of self-satisfaction could possibly have got us where we are today. Which is to say, watching a Wotsit wearing a four-foot red tie give a press conference in the US ambassador\u2019s London residence, during which he reduces Nato\u2019s complex geopolitics to the level of suburban real-estate rivalries. As a visitor, Trump has a strong Ghost of Christmas Future energy to him. Those who love clinical narcissists \u2013 and who doesn\u2019t? \u2013 will be disappointed that Trump and Boris Johnson will not be doing a joint press conference at this Nato summit. But it is believed the crossing of their two streams would have had the potential to rip the very fabric of reality, creating a reversal of Nato\u2019s original aims, and plunging the 70-year-old alliance into immediate land war with Russia. Also there\u2019s an election on, and the Tories sense even a handshake with Trump could piss their electoral bed. So there won\u2019t be the chance to press the PM on the time he turned his Quick-Quotes Quill on Donald, accusing him of \u201ca quite stupefying ignorance that makes him, frankly, unfit to hold the office of president of the United States\u201d. Trump is just clever enough to pretend this never happened, which is always a neat way of insulting an overpromoted journalist. (Orson Welles used to greet the critic who gave him his worst reviews effusively every time he saw him, \u201cso he would think that I\u2019d never read a word he wrote\u201d.) Indeed, Trump used his impromptu press conference to stress his blissful unfamiliarity with a great number of things. Appearance-wise, the US president\u2019s lips are a sort of pouting anus \u2013 a mouth sphincter which today emitted a roll-call of guys and stuff he didn\u2019t know. Take Prince Andrew. \u201cI don\u2019t know Prince Andrew,\u201d Trump sighed with a moue, despite there being significant photographic evidence to the contrary. \u201cBut it\u2019s a tough story. But I don\u2019t know him.\u201d Or take Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cI know nothing about the gentleman,\u201d Trump shrugged, having very recently described the Labour leader as \u201cso bad for your country\u201d, warning he\u2019d \u201ctake you in such a bad way\u201d. None of that today. \u201cReally. I know nothing about him,\u201d he said. Or take the notion that Trump thought the NHS was on the table in a future trade deal between the UK and US. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where that rumour started,\u201d mused the president, who used his state visit in June to tell the massed TV cameras, \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing in trade, everything is on the table.\u201d Today the president was pushing a line that sounded distinctly like it had been crayoned on to giant cue cards held aloft by the Conservative campaign team. \u201cWe have absolutely nothing to do with it,\u201d he insisted of the health service, \u201cand we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter.\u201d Alas, Trump delivered this with the same wooden conviction with which he addressed Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 2, when he was asked where the Plaza hotel lobby was. \u201cDown the hall and to the left,\u201d gurned Trump, in a manner to make you think it was upstairs and to the right. And so with his NHS speechlet, during which he felt convincingly out-acted by the ambassador\u2019s furniture. Still, I hope Trump welcomed the chance to visit the originals of the faux-antique armchairs that litter his properties. His state visit in June featured a trip to Westminster, where his reaction to being shown a slab commemorating Lord Byron was to ask what type of marble it was, perhaps with a view to getting it as a shower tray or something. Even Trump\u2019s memories are ersatz reproductions of events. \u201cYou know that I was a fan of Brexit,\u201d he reminded journalists. \u201cI called it the day before. I was opening up Turnberry.\u201d In fact, he opened Turnberry the day after the Brexit result, when even that great seer David Cameron was beginning to get a bad feeling. As for the rest of the president\u2019s plans for the day, they seemed to have involved giving Emmanuel Macron a wedgie and preparing for tonight\u2019s Buckingham Palace reception with the Queen. The best way to do that was with some hardcore fundraising, and he was reported to be offering London-based US business people a chance to attend a reception with the president for $35,000, a photo and the reception for $50,000, and $125,00 to join a roundtable. Bigger spenders shouldn\u2019t fret \u2013 there\u2019s bound to be a secret price list for the guys who want to pay even more for something really special. Namely, the ambassador gig in a former breakaway Soviet republic, and the chance to hole up in one of the boutique Federal Correctional Institutions when you get out of your depth. So doubtless a good day was had by all. Well, all except one, perhaps. Over on a FiveLive phone in, a certain close friend was acting totally, totally, cool about not having a meeting lined up with the president. \u201cI have not, no,\u201d blustered Nigel Farage. How come? \u201cWell, this is a bit awkward, isn\u2019t it? Whilst he\u2019s a friend of mine, there\u2019s a general election going on, so I don\u2019t intend to \u2026\u201d How about a quick WhatsApp? \u201cIf there are some personal exchanges they would be purely personal. I wouldn\u2019t talk about them.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t shut up about them, dear. Commiserations today and for next week. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll remember you fondly.",

After he was fired, Duke said, the first response he heard from co-workers was, \u201cWe need a union.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe faith hasn\u2019t been broken with all of the workers, it\u2019s been broken with executives,\u201d said Berland. \u201cPeople are more geared up and ready to fight.

The company\u2019s code of conduct concludes with a statement that many Googlers take to heart, \u201cAnd remember \u2026 don\u2019t be evil, and if you see something that you think isn\u2019t right \u2013 speak up!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what we were doing,\u201d said Waldman, who was involved in a petition calling on Google not to provide services to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). \u201cWe used to be able to engage in these issues and give feedback,\u201d said Berland. \u201cAt some point that stopped,\u201d he said. Paul Duke, another of the fired employees who had been at Google for more than eight years, said he believes Google has become less willing to engage with employees\u2019 objections to company decisions. \u201cThe company at one time was willing to listen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understood that their employees were their best assets; they took feedback. Now, Google is no longer listening to its employees. It\u2019s consolidating power.\u201d Three of the fired workers \u2013 Berland, Waldman and Rebecca Rivers \u2013 identify as LGBT, and some of their activism involved organizing within employee resource groups (ERGs) for trans or gay Googlers to push the company on issues such as equal benefits for same-sex partnerships. \u201cFrom the beginning, queer and trans people at Google have banded together to make sure we have great benefits and a strong community,\u201d said Waldman. \u201cA lot of us feel very directly that it\u2019s us and people like us that are on the line\u201d when it comes to the company\u2019s ethical decisions. Berland recalled successful efforts organizing with other \u201cGayglers\u201d for equal health insurance benefits for same-sex partners before gay marriage was legalized across the US. \u201cBack then, the results of our workplace organizing were successes,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember a time when we got real wins from our employer.\u201d Now, much of the goodwill has been broken. \u201cGoogle is a lovely place to work if you are transgender and don\u2019t care about what is going on in the world,\u201d said Waldman. Rivers said that she first got involved in activism at Google when the company appointed Kay Coles James, the president of the Heritage Foundation who has a track record of fighting trans rights and LGBT protections, to its AI ethics council. At a public protest just days before her firing, Rivers told the 200 Googlers who rallied in opposition to her suspension that Google had wiped her personal phone when it suspended her, erasing many months of photographs documenting her gender transition. The fired workers said that they plan to continue their activism. After he was fired, Duke said, the first response he heard from co-workers was, \u201cWe need a union.\u201d \u201cThe faith hasn\u2019t been broken with all of the workers, it\u2019s been broken with executives,\u201d said Berland. \u201cPeople are more geared up and ready to fight. We\u2019re all going to continue to fight and we\u2019re going to win.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The high court of Australia will this week examine a complicated question: can Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders be deported as aliens if they don\u2019t hold Australian citizenship? The federal government says yes. But lawyers for two Indigenous men facing removal from the country, backed up by the Victorian state government, say there is another option: non-citizen non-alien. The special case hearing on Thursday before the full bench will examine a series of propositions, which were unusually put forward by the high court itself, and which go beyond the contentious issue of deportations. The Australian government contends it is an issue of binary definitions and that, because the men are not citizens, they are therefore aliens and the minister has the power to cancel their visas. Parties have already invoked significant precedents, including the Mabo ruling and the original act of colonisation, in arguing their cases. The plaintiffs, Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms, have accused the commonwealth of alarmism and say if the high court rules in their favour it would not open borders to anyone claiming Indigenous heritage, but simply prevent the government detaining and deporting bona fide First Nations people. Love and Thoms face deportation after the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, cancelled their Australian visas over criminal convictions. Both are Indigenous, but they were born overseas and did not apply for citizenship after moving to Australia. Love is a Kamileroi man born in PNG to an Aboriginal father and Papua New Guinean mother. He moved to Australia at the age of five. Thoms, who arrived in Australia in 1994, is a Gunggari man and native title holder, born in New Zealand to an Aboriginal mother and New Zealand father. They are among thousands of people whose visas have been cancelled under the controversial character test provisions of the migration act, and among a subset whose cases have attracted attention because they have spent the vast majority of their lives in Australia. The case was last heard on 8 May, with the high court reserving its decision. Last month it was revealed the court had asked parties to submit arguments \u201cas to whether members of an Aboriginal society have such a strong claim to the protection of the Crown, that they may be said to owe permanent allegiance to the crown\u201d. The court put forward a series of propositions setting out the legal logic that could lead to the conclusion that people recognised as Aboriginal could not also be classed as aliens. The government argues that the propositions would create a class of persons outside both the Citizenship Act and the Migration Act, impairing the administration of both. \u201cTheir right to enter would depend not on their status (as citizens or non-citizens holding visas), but on the answers to factual questions involving an unspecified degree of biological connection and self and group identification,\u201d it says. It says the 1992 Mabo ruling recognised that \u201cthe acquisition of sovereignty\u201d by the British gave every person born in Australia between settlement and the mid-1980s the status of a British subject or \u2013 later \u2013 an Australian citizen, regardless of whether they were Indigenous or not. That meant there was no reason for any \u201cunique obligation\u201d to Indigenous people to develop. It says if the high court found that Indigenous people owed permanent allegiance to the crown and so could never be considered \u201calien\u201d, it would go against the purpose of the 1967 amendments, and could be perceived as placing Indigenous people in an \u201cunequal position\u201d by denying them the autonomy to pledge allegiance to a foreign power. The commonwealth argues that Indigenous people born in Australia would \u201cwith few, if any, exceptions\u201d, be citizens under the law. Lawyers for Love and Thoms say a ruling in the plaintiffs\u2019 favour would simply prevent the commonwealth from deporting or expelling Aboriginal people who pass the current \u201cthree part test\u201d which is used in native title cases. \u201cThe high court has to determine the answer to one question \u2013 whether an Aboriginal person can meet the definition of an alien for the purposes of section 51,\u201d says their lawyer, Claire Gibbs. \u201cIn our view it means Aboriginal Australians cannot be aliens because they have a unique position in this country as the original inhabitants. \u201cJust as they\u2019re entitled to native title rights, that also should give rise to protection from deportation and to not be included in the definition of an alien.\u201d In its submission as an intervening party, the Victorian government wrote in support of Love and Thoms, saying that because they were Aboriginal members of an Aboriginal society, and \u201cbecause of the recognised mutual and unique relationship\u201d between those members and Australian land and waters, the two men were not aliens as defined by the constitution. The Victorian government submitted it was \u201cirrelevant\u201d that they were born outside of Australia and held citizenship of other countries. The submission accuses the commonwealth of addressing \u201cirrelevant topics and concepts\u201d in its argument. \u201cIt suffices to note that then equivalence expressed between lacking the statutory status of citizenship and, as a result, carrying the constitutional status of an alien is unprincipled and wrong.\u201d It also pushes back against the commonwealth\u2019s arguments about settlement, saying they appear to assert that Indigenous Australians\u2019 role of caring for the country for up to 80,000 years \u201cwas subsumed into the new status and the common law regarded Indigenous Australians as the same as every other person born in Australia\u201d, when Mabo 2 showed this not to be the case. It says Indigenous people who inhabited Australia before settlement became British subjects \u201cbecause they were the Indigenous inhabitants\u201d. It followed that Aboriginality was \u201cthe crucial and central characteristic\u201d that made them British subjects and therefore non-aliens. The case is the first time Aboriginality has been considered in testing the definition of an alien under Australia\u2019s constitution, and Gibbs says the men\u2019s case is challenging the commonwealth\u2019s binary interpretation. \u201cTheir position is that because our clients were born outside this country and do not hold citizenship they are aliens. So they haven\u2019t really engaged about the outer limits of that test and ... the unique characteristics of Aboriginality,\u201d she says. \u201cThe ordinary definition of alien is someone belonging to another. We think on any commonsense measure, on any correct interpretation of the common law, that an Aboriginal person cannot meet that definition.\u201d The high court will hear the case on Thursday.",

The married father of three trained \u201cmany thousands of soldiers and police elements to stand against the threat of Isis at that time\u201d, he said. \u201cMe and my fellow interpreters now have to face the threat of militias because we helped the coalition forces and the Australian army members.\u201d Almohammedawi said he had seen photos of militia leaders set as wallpaper on officers\u2019 phones, and corroborated claims that he and colleagues had been photographed and filmed by ISF. \u201cOur faces are well known by all these thousands of soldiers and police elements that we helped to get trained, [and] which were also affiliated to different dangerous militias.\u201d Interpeters want \u2018a fair go\u2019 In April 2008, the Rudd government announced 600 places within its humanitarian visa quota would be reserved for \u201clocally engaged employees\u201d from its Iraq operations, including interpreters, acknowledging that they had been \u201ctargeted\u201d by insurgents for their connection to western forces. The legislation remains current. However, Al-Sudny said interpreters attempting to apply for skilled or humanitarian visas at the Australian embassy in Baghdad were told \u201cthe Australian embassy in Amman [in Jordan] manages visa and citizenship services for clients in Iraq\u201d. Al-Sudny said it was not practical for interpreters to travel, often with families. \u201cWe will be required to move to Jordan \u2026 to ensure we can attend personal interviews and screenings. This places a personal and financial burden upon us which we cannot carry.\u201d He said the latest direction was that the embassy in Jordan was not accepting certain types of visa applications either, and the interpreters would have to apply through Australia\u2019s embassy in Beirut. \u201cWe have served alongside the ADF for many years, have learned and understand much of Australian culture, including \u2026 mateship and \u2018a fair go\u2019. \u201cApplying for a visa to Australia is a dream for my wife and I \u2013 to get to Australia for a better future for our kids, because there is no future in Iraq for anyone.\u201d The interpreters have signed a petition requesting their visa applications be accepted in Baghdad, which has been received by Australia\u2019s Senate standing committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade. The petition has been forwarded to the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, the immigration minister, David Coleman, and the defence minister, Linda Reynolds. Reynolds announced last month that Australia\u2019s commitment to Task Force Taji would be roughly halved \u2013 from about 250 ADF personnel to 120 \u2013 because of Australia\u2019s significant progress in \u201cenhancing the capabilities of the ISF to defeat Daesh\u201d. As a result, many interpreters have lost their jobs. Iraq has descended into roiling and deadly protests since October and is effectively without a government. The country\u2019s entire polity \u2013 constructed by the US after 2003 \u2013 risks unravelling completely, observers have said. Cities across the country, and in particular the capital, Baghdad, have been seized by violent protests, ostensibly over government corruption but also a growing anti-Iran sentiment. Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, announced his resignation last week, bowing to the country\u2019s top cleric and pressure from protesters demanding the fall of his government and an end to rampant official corruption. Security forces killed at least 45 civilians who were protesting around the southern city of Nasiriyah, and protestors firebombed the Iranian consulate in Najaf. The defence department spokesman said existing legislation allowed for visa applications from Iraqi \u201clocally engaged employees\u201d who had assisted the ADF. \u201cAn applicant must first be certified by the relevant minister [minister for defence, minister for foreign affairs or attorney general] as being at significant risk of harm as a result of their employment or support to Australia\u2019s mission,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce eligibility is established, they may apply for a humanitarian visa.\u201d The spokesman said the government could not comment on individual cases. \u201cEach application is considered on its individual merit using current and comprehensive information on circumstances in the relevant country.\u201d",

The report, led by the health economist Stephen Duckett, recommended partially deregulating premiums to allow insurers to charge younger people less than older people for the same level of coverage, but said premiums should remain regulated and should not vary by age for people 55 and over. \u201cThe system faces a death spiral \u2013 younger and healthier consumers get a bad deal so they\u2019re dropping their insurance, which means premiums need to rise, so even more young and healthy people drop out, and the cycle continues,\u201d the report, published on Tuesday night, said. \u201cThis youth exodus means the recent moderation of premium increases is likely to end, and premiums will probably return to increasing at 5% or more each year. Young people\u2019s premiums have to get cheaper.\u201d The report proposed a number of other reforms, including redirecting the private hospital insurance rebate towards older patients. The report also recommended that the rebate not be increased, it be withdrawn from low-coverage policies, and the \u201cextras\u201d insurance rebate be withdrawn. \u201cPart of the proceeds should fund dental care and part should keep hospital insurance premiums for older people at acceptable levels,\u201d it said. The chair of the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance, Jennifer Doggett, said the proposed reforms were not substantial and would merely \u201ctweak the numbers\u201d to make insurance slightly more attractive to young people. \u201cMy biggest criticism is that the paper assumes that the current system of private health insurance is a system worth saving which, in my opinion, is not the case,\u201d Doggett, a health policy analyst, said. \u201cThey don\u2019t address many of the fundamental problems with private health insurance: that it is overly complex, cost-inflationary, has high administrative costs, leads to over-servicing, is inequitable, doesn\u2019t help those most in need, and disadvantages people in rural areas \u2013 although some of these issues are addressed in other Grattan papers.\u201d For the reforms to succeed, enough young people would have to join to effectively cross-subsidise the cost of older people. Consumer behaviour in this area was difficult to predict accurately as people\u2019s decisions about private health insurance and healthcare were not often economically rational. \u201cThe paper relies on some significant assumptions about how young people will respond to the reforms. If these are wrong, the changes are not going to have the effect they predict,\u201d Doggett said. \u201cHowever, redirecting the dental component of the rebate into public dental services is a positive as this would deliver much better value \u2013 although overall the removal of the rebate from ancillary services means that the out-of-pocket costs for allied health and dental services are likely to rise.\u201d Catholic Health Australia\u2019s chief executive, Pat Garcia, said deregulating premiums for those under 55 would mean \u201cjunking a fundamental tenet of Australia\u2019s health system\u201d. This risked increasing premiums for young people with chronic disease and mental health issues, leading to those with chronic disease dropping their private health insurance and moving into the public system. \u201cThis is the last thing public hospitals need right now.\u201d The chief executive of Private Healthcare Australia, Dr Rachel David, said health funds were prevented from discriminating against members based on health status or claims history. \u201cThe latest report from the Grattan Institute highlighted issues of concern in the private health sector previously identified by government and stakeholders, however it failed to offer any workable solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile maintaining a system of community rating \u2013 [which means the same service is available to everyone for the same price] \u2013 posed challenges for Australia\u2019s health system, it was also one of the features which helped Australia maintain its international reputation for fairness in healthcare. \u201cCommunity rating underpins Australia\u2019s private health insurance regulations, and changes to a risk-rated system would severely destabilise premiums for older Australians and threaten the future of fair and equitable healthcare. \u201cGenerational transfer of risk would mean a lot of Australians would have a very uncertain future.\u201d",

I\u2019ve grown the passion to help Brad [Scott, current Pararoo] to broaden it to females, and then also to regional communities. We want to bring the next generation in, and I don\u2019t think any of us will give up until that happens.\u201d</p> <p>Christodoulou agreed: \u201cI feel like maybe I\u2019m the chosen one, so that I can inspire people.

How did you do your homework?\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the case that the sports have given me the opportunity to start conversations with people I never would have met in any other way. It\u2019s important that the kids see it, because on [bad] days, those are the ones where it\u2019s easiest to feel like you\u2019re the one that\u2019s different. Suddenly they think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m having a bad day, but I\u2019m still going to run out, I\u2019m still going to kick that ball, I\u2019m still going to go and jump in the pool\u2019, and all of a sudden, that is something that brings them joy.\u201d</p> <p>Football Federation Australia has taken up the call for better support and exposure of cerebral palsy football, providing increased funding through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/06/gender-pay-gap-closed-as-parity-confirmed-in-new-matildas-deal\">national teams\u2019 new CBA</a> and organising for the Pararoos to play their first international game on home soil since the 2000 Paralympics last Saturday, which was also live-streamed on Kayo.</p> <p>Christodoulou and Blanshard were there, cheering on their friends from the stands, wishing it could be them representing the Paratildas.

The rescue of that animal, saved from the Long Flat blaze by a woman using her shirt as a shield, went viral. But the bushfires have injured and displaced vast numbers of other creatures, many of which no longer have homes. Who rescues them \u2013 and what does that involve? Kristie Newton works as campaign manager for the NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service (Wires), an organisation that, in normal times, says it cares for tens of thousands of hurt or distressed animals each year. But these are not normal times. \u201cWe are completely inundated at the moment,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is the biggest event we have ever dealt with.\u201d Australia\u2019s flora and fauna have evolved to coexist with fire \u2013 but not with fires of such intensity.

She\u2019s dedicated her property in Lightning Creek near Grafton to caring for wild creatures, so much so that she takes an instant to recall just how many she\u2019s currently sheltering. \u201cI\u2019ve got three flying foxes, one koala, three \u2013 no, four! \u2013 redneck wallabies (one of which is burned), and one wallaroo.

As artistic director of France\u2019s biggest dramatic arts centre, <a href=\"https://nanterre-amandiers.com/en/\">Nanterre-Amandiers</a>, since 2014, he has drawn ever-larger, ever-younger audiences for shows by artists such as Claude R\u00e9gy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/16/joel-pommerat-spellbinding-theatre-pinocchio-odeon-paris-france\">Jo\u00ebl Pommerat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jeromebel.fr/\">J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/08/sex-sheep-and-terror-theatre-milo-rau-lam-gods\">Milo Rau</a>, all eked from a tiny 1.4m euro (\u00a31.19m) annual production budget. His own work is feted around the world, except \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 in Britain. This autumn he pulled off the tour de force of <a href=\"https://nanterre-amandiers.com/en/evenement/nanterre-amandiers-ouvre-le-livre-dimage-jean-luc-godard-2019/\">hosting Jean-Luc Godard</a>, who invested every nook and cranny of the dank, rickety Nanterre theatre building with myriad screenings of his major and minor works since the 1980s. You could see Woody Allen as the fool in King Lear in the theatre\u2019s costume workshop, or outtakes of Patti Smith \u2013 on board the doomed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/15/costa-concordia-jean-luc-godard\">Costa Concordia</a> \u2013 in one of its corridors. Godard preferred this environment over the Pompidou Centre, which had offered him carte blanche.</p> <p>However, Quesne (pronounced \u201ckehn\u201d), announced in July that Nanterre\u2019s highly prized directorship was no longer tenable for him and he will step down next year. Quesne\u2019s attempts to overhaul his crumbling building (never renovated since it was built in the 1970s) have revealed fault lines between a central government in retreat, and local powers overplaying their hands in the ensuing power vacuum. Nanterre \u2013 adjoining Europe\u2019s biggest business district, La D\u00e9fense \u2013 is Communist-run, and gives only 13% of the theatre\u2019s budget, while owning the building. Local mayor (and development president of La D\u00e9fense) Patrick Jarry has sniped constantly (despite the theatre\u2019s palpable success, with 50% of its audience under 30) and \u2013 according to Quesne \u2013 compromised future programming by throwing spanners in the works, failing to support the transitional period during rebuilding.

      "bodyText": "Philippe Quesne should be brimming with satisfaction. As artistic director of France\u2019s biggest dramatic arts centre, Nanterre-Amandiers, since 2014, he has drawn ever-larger, ever-younger audiences for shows by artists such as Claude R\u00e9gy, Jo\u00ebl Pommerat, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bel and Milo Rau, all eked from a tiny 1.4m euro (\u00a31.19m) annual production budget. His own work is feted around the world, except \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 in Britain. This autumn he pulled off the tour de force of hosting Jean-Luc Godard, who invested every nook and cranny of the dank, rickety Nanterre theatre building with myriad screenings of his major and minor works since the 1980s. You could see Woody Allen as the fool in King Lear in the theatre\u2019s costume workshop, or outtakes of Patti Smith \u2013 on board the doomed Costa Concordia \u2013 in one of its corridors. Godard preferred this environment over the Pompidou Centre, which had offered him carte blanche. However, Quesne (pronounced \u201ckehn\u201d), announced in July that Nanterre\u2019s highly prized directorship was no longer tenable for him and he will step down next year. Quesne\u2019s attempts to overhaul his crumbling building (never renovated since it was built in the 1970s) have revealed fault lines between a central government in retreat, and local powers overplaying their hands in the ensuing power vacuum. Nanterre \u2013 adjoining Europe\u2019s biggest business district, La D\u00e9fense \u2013 is Communist-run, and gives only 13% of the theatre\u2019s budget, while owning the building. Local mayor (and development president of La D\u00e9fense) Patrick Jarry has sniped constantly (despite the theatre\u2019s palpable success, with 50% of its audience under 30) and \u2013 according to Quesne \u2013 compromised future programming by throwing spanners in the works, failing to support the transitional period during rebuilding. (Jarry has riposted that locally drawn audiences have decreased under Quesne\u2019s tenure.) Hence \u2013 ultimately \u2013 the director\u2019s bitter decision to move on. Nanterre is not an isolated case: another Greater Paris mayor recently had the respected and buzzing Mains d\u2019Oeuvres arts centre in Saint Ouen evacuated by the police. This followed the withdrawal of the town\u2019s 90,000-euro annual subsidy in 2014, a move which fatally unbalanced the already fire-damaged centre. Greater Paris \u2013 attempting to construct a true metropolitan identity from 130 municipalities \u2013 seems destined to falter if its existing bright spots are allowed to be dimmed in this way. The central government has reacted late or not at all in these cases, and is in retreat in general in the arts, formerly a bastion of French identity and politics. Theatre-loving Emmanuel Macron risks appearing withdrawn and Hamlet-like as things decline around him. Irina Brook threw in the towel at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National de Nice at about the same time as Quesne, after valiant efforts to make the live arts more inclusive and engaged. For Brook, it became clear that her desire for a responsible creative agenda \u2013 especially regarding the climate crisis \u2013 was incompatible with the constraints imposed by multiple funding bodies.

      "body": "<p>How is it possible that the BBC has had so many complaints about a single interview that it has decided to direct viewers about what their complaints should be?</p> <p>To recap: on Sunday morning, the PM was interviewed by Andrew Marr. The story began, of course, when Johnson declined to be interviewed by Andrew Neil, having \u2013 well, promised is a strong word, especially from Johnson \u2013 but it was the BBC\u2019s understanding that he would, when they secured and aired an interview with Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Not intending to run any more interviews with Johnson until the situation was resolved, the BBC then decided that, following the awful deaths in London Bridge, a Sunday interview was necessary. The 28-minute conversation was, at least, democratically and impartially, horrible for everyone to watch \u2013 staccato, overenunciated, hostile, hard to follow. A large number of complaints split between those who felt Johnson\u2019s untruths were insufficiently challenged and those who felt that Marr challenged him too much. It is unclear which camp most fall into, but the BBC had better hope the majority are anti-Marr, because the line they added to the complaints form \u2013 \u201cSome viewers have complained Boris Johnson was interrupted too much and the interview was biased against him\u201d \u2013 is unaccountable otherwise.</p> <p>In fact, it is perfectly possible to hold both views: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/01/how-accurate-were-boris-johnsons-assertions-on-andrew-marr\" title=\"\">Johnson did deliver numerous untruths</a>, and they were allowed to lie there like fish out of their bowl, flapping on the floor until they died. Also, Marr was pretty rude; \u201cYou\u2019re chuntering,\u201d he said at one point, which he never would have said to Theresa May, who chuntered constantly. I suspect a bit of professional pride, Marr smarting that he is seen as softer than Neil (he is). I also think Marr did well \u2013 and maybe it is right to be rude to a prime minister who has done so much to corrode civility and trust in such a short time.</p> <p>The interesting thing is the urgent partisanship. Viewers have surmised, probably correctly, that a complaint about bias is only as strong as its numbers, and so are supporting their team in droves. It doesn\u2019t matter how good a case you make, so long as you are in the majority. This is, I suppose, the lesson of the referendum.</p>",

The story began, of course, when Johnson declined to be interviewed by Andrew Neil, having \u2013 well, promised is a strong word, especially from Johnson \u2013 but it was the BBC\u2019s understanding that he would, when they secured and aired an interview with Jeremy Corbyn. Not intending to run any more interviews with Johnson until the situation was resolved, the BBC then decided that, following the awful deaths in London Bridge, a Sunday interview was necessary. The 28-minute conversation was, at least, democratically and impartially, horrible for everyone to watch \u2013 staccato, overenunciated, hostile, hard to follow. A large number of complaints split between those who felt Johnson\u2019s untruths were insufficiently challenged and those who felt that Marr challenged him too much. It is unclear which camp most fall into, but the BBC had better hope the majority are anti-Marr, because the line they added to the complaints form \u2013 \u201cSome viewers have complained Boris Johnson was interrupted too much and the interview was biased against him\u201d \u2013 is unaccountable otherwise. In fact, it is perfectly possible to hold both views: Johnson did deliver numerous untruths, and they were allowed to lie there like fish out of their bowl, flapping on the floor until they died. Also, Marr was pretty rude; \u201cYou\u2019re chuntering,\u201d he said at one point, which he never would have said to Theresa May, who chuntered constantly. I suspect a bit of professional pride, Marr smarting that he is seen as softer than Neil (he is). I also think Marr did well \u2013 and maybe it is right to be rude to a prime minister who has done so much to corrode civility and trust in such a short time. The interesting thing is the urgent partisanship. Viewers have surmised, probably correctly, that a complaint about bias is only as strong as its numbers, and so are supporting their team in droves. It doesn\u2019t matter how good a case you make, so long as you are in the majority. This is, I suppose, the lesson of the referendum.",

      "bodyText": "Freddie Ljungberg plans to consult Ars\u00e8ne Wenger before taking charge of his first home match as Arsenal\u2019s interim manager against Brighton on Thursday. Ljungberg watched Arsenal\u2019s winless run extend to eight matches with a 2-2 draw at Norwich on Sunday in his first game since taking over from Unai Emery. The Swede acknowledged that he would have preferred more time to implement tactical changes before the Brighton match, although his desire to seek out Wenger for advice appeared more urgent. \u201cI would really like to speak to him,\u201d the former midfielder said of the manager who brought him to Arsenal from the Swedish side Halmstad for \u00a33m in 1998. \u201cI\u2019m in contact with him but I haven\u2019t spoken to him because it\u2019s been a bit hectic but it\u2019s on my list to do so \u2026 He was here for 22 years as the manager, so he has a lot of experience. And he probably has some things he thinks are important that he can share with me and make me a better coach. That\u2019s what I wanted to ask.\u201d Wenger swiftly made it clear he would be happy to help Ljungberg. \u201cIf he has that need then of course I\u2019ll be available,\u201d he told Sky Sports. \u201cMy heart is with the club and I want them to do well.

The timing also leads directly into the release of the third and final instalment of the franchise\u2019s theatrical saga, ensuring that Star Wars will reign supreme as we close out this decade and usher in the next.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/12/the-mandalorian-review-star-wars-jon-favreau\">The Mandalorian review \u2013 splashy Star Wars show is a dusty disappointment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Suffice to say, Disney\u2019s gamble \u2013 The Mandalorian cost about $15m per episode \u2013 will end up paying off.

Indeed, this marks the third time Star Wars has gone to that particular well: The Phantom Menace gave us a precocious, towheaded Anakin Skywalker, while the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars introduced Rotta the Hutt, the pint-sized offspring of Jabba the Hutt. Neither of those examples set the world on fire (well, Anakin did, but not in the way Lucas intended), so credit for the Baby Yoda phenomenon lies squarely with the designers and technicians responsible for bringing him to life.</p> <p>Like his older namesake, Baby Yoda is an animatronic creation operated by a team of puppeteers. It\u2019s the tactile \u2013 and at times uncanny \u2013 nature of the thing that is responsible for people\u2019s visceral reaction to it, and it doesn\u2019t seem too early to place it in the same pantheon of beloved practical creature creations as ET, Mogwai or the original Yoda. Even the most cynical observer has to admit: the puppet is objectively beautiful. If it can move as stoic and fatalistic a figure as Werner Herzog to tears, what chance did the rest of us ever stand?</p> <h2><strong>Fan </strong><strong>theories</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2a42be9788c99e606d23a3463c42b23ade929d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2a42be9788c99e606d23a3463c42b23ade929d9/0_44_1806_1083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As no doubt many a casual observer has learned firsthand after being corrected by a Star Wars-obsessed family member, friend, co-worker or checkout line eavesdropper, Baby Yoda is not, in fact, a young version of the Yoda we all know. Or, then again, maybe he is?</p> <p>As soon as his big bat-ears and tiny little head popped out of his floating crib, fans immediately began speculating about his identity and import. The Mandalorian has thus far doled out precious few clues as to the true nature of The Child, as he is referred to within the show. He\u2019s first introduced during the closing moments of the pilot, revealed to be the bounty that our eponymous bounty hunter hero, the equally mysterious Mandalorian (or Mando, as he\u2019s known to friends), was hired to collect, dead or alive. Aside from its gender, we know only that The Child is 50 years old (his species has an exceptionally long lifespan, as first noted in Return of the Jedi when Yoda reveals he\u2019s been alive for 900 years), and that, like the other members of his species we\u2019ve been introduced to in past films, he is Force sensitive.</p> <p>You\u2019d be forgiven for not remembering when or where we were introduced to other <em>members</em> of his species: in The Phantom Menace, a female Yoda lookalike can be glimpsed in the background of several key scenes taking place inside the chamber of the Jedi Council. Although her name is never spoken in the film, it was later revealed to be Yaddle. She doesn\u2019t appear in any of the other prequels or sequels, so as far as the official canon goes, her fate remains a mystery. The Mandalorian is set five years after Return of the Jedi, which means that The Child was \u201cconceived\u201d sometime during the events depicted in the prequel saga or immediately prior. It is therefore entirely possible that Baby Yoda is the offspring of Yoda and Yaddle. Off-putting as the thought of Yoda getting it on is to most of us (I wish I could say all of us, but a cursory Google search would quickly disabuse me of any such notion), the timeline is too specific to dismiss the possibility outright.</p> <p>(That said, the prequels also hinted that Anakin Skywalker was the product of a virgin birth by way of midi-chlorian manipulation, so it\u2019s possible that Baby Yoda had similarly miraculous \u2013 and similarly bogus \u2013 origins.)</p> <p>There\u2019s also the strong possibility that Baby Yoda is <em>actually</em> Baby Yoda, albeit a copy of the original. Cloning has been a central part of the Star Wars mythology from the very beginning, with Obi-Wan Kenobi mentioning \u201cthe Clone Wars\u201d early in the first film. The depiction of that war in Episode 2: Attack of the Clones introduced viewers to the Kaminoans, a secretive and scientific race of master cloners. Their insignia reappears in The Mandalorian, as seen on the uniform of one Dr Pershing, a scientist in league with the show\u2019s central villain, but who seems to have ulterior \u2013 and possibly benevolent \u2013 motives for wanting to possess the tiny Jedi foundling.</p> <p>Both theories seem to hold water at the moment, and since Star Wars has always put great emphasis on familial bloodlines and royal lineage, it would be surprising if Baby Yoda turned out simply to be some random orphan caught up in the fallout of the original saga. Doubly surprising, in fact, when you take into consideration the angry fit thrown by a vocal contingent of Star Wars fans after writer-director Rian Johnson pulled that exact reveal regarding the character of Rey in The Last Jedi. Speaking of controversy \u2026</p> <h2><strong>The Baby Yoda Show, featuring The Mandalorian</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cea0a76c155969d3f14d9e5fa9256c315f1f6811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cea0a76c155969d3f14d9e5fa9256c315f1f6811/0_55_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedro Pascal at the premiere of The Mandalorian\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedro Pascal at the premiere of The Mandalorian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Grant/Getty Images for Disney</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fan reaction for The Mandalorian has been almost unanimously positive, which comes as something of a surprising considering how controversial most new Star Wars entries end up. The same can be said of the overwhelmingly welcoming reception to Baby Yoda even from diehard fans, who tend to reject the franchise when it dips into cuteness and/or broad comedy (see: Ewoks, young Anakin, Jar Jar Binks, Porgs). Here though, it seems their hard nerd hearts are just as susceptible to Baby Yoda\u2019s charms as everyone else\u2019s.</p> <p>Before the introduction of Baby Yoda (whose existence was kept impressively under wraps prior to the series premiere), anticipation for The Mandalorian was somewhat muted, owing possibly to confusion over the premise, with many casual fans assuming it was a Boba Fett origin story. Even without the character\u2019s inclusion, the show would probably have proven popular with Star Wars devotees, but there\u2019s nothing to suggest that it would have been more than a blip on the radar of the larger culture. For as much as people like to compare the show to classic westerns and samurai films, it\u2019s most reminiscent of syndicated adventure series from the 90s, such as Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, albeit with a much larger budget and far superior production design. Combined with its literally faceless cipher of a hero, the show required an additional element for a mass audience to latch on to. Enter Baby Yoda, whose popularity in both the long and short run will end up seeing a return on Disney\u2019s mega-expensive investment. Which brings us to our next subject \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Memes and </strong><strong>merch</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cndwrites/status/1200576973556387840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">me looking over the new baby yoda memes every week despite not having seen the show and having no idea what\u2019s going on <a href=\"https://t.co/7TQzwGJIXz\">pic.twitter.com/7TQzwGJIXz</a></p>&mdash; charlotte nicole davis (@cndwrites) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cndwrites/status/1200576973556387840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overly cynical to suggest that The Mandalorian\u2019s creative team intentionally fashioned several of Baby Yoda\u2019s scenes with the express purpose of having them go viral. Initial reports that Disney was actively scrubbing the web of Baby Yoda gifs proved unfounded, and it\u2019s now practically impossible to scroll through any social media platform without being inundated with pics, videos, memes and gifs of the bug-eyed, big-eared tot. Obviously, anything as eye-catchingly adorable as that puppet was always destined to take social media by storm, but still \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to look at the shot from Episode 4 of him sipping broth from an oversized mug and not immediately think of the Kermit Sipping Tea meme. (For what it\u2019s worth, that episode\u2019s director, Bryce Dallas Howard, has claimed the response took her by surprise, but you\u2019ll forgive me if I don\u2019t buy that.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the merchandising front, Disney surprised everyone by holding back, at the request of Favreau, the announcement of tie-in toys, apparel and accessories so as to avoid spoiling the character\u2019s surprise reveal, although they have since announced the first round of products just in time for Christmas shopping (much of it having already sold out on Cyber Monday).</p> <h2><strong>What Baby Yoda </strong><strong>means for the </strong><strong>future of a </strong><strong>galaxy </strong><strong>far, </strong><strong>far </strong><strong>away</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"347c8b384c36eed4bde534211bedddde301475a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/347c8b384c36eed4bde534211bedddde301475a7/565_0_2677_1607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As to what Baby Yoda entails for Star Wars in and of itself, that remains to be seen. We know that The Mandalorian will have a second season, and, per a recent revelation from Last Jedi director Rian Johnson, we know that Baby Yoda will be in it. While it\u2019s highly unlikely he\u2019ll show up in December\u2019s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, it\u2019s very possible that he, or other characters from the show, will appear in future movies. After all, Disney has let it be known that their slate of upcoming Marvel Universe shows will tie directly into future films, so there\u2019s ample reason to expect the same will be true of Star Wars. Good news for devotees of those franchises, bad news for anyone who thinks standalone movies ought not require homework to follow along.</p> <p>Speaking of movies: while it\u2019s inevitable that The Rise of Skywalker will do massive box office (the presale numbers having already eclipsed previous franchise records), any worries stemming from the divisive fan response to The Last Jedi or the overall disappointment of Solo can probably be discarded now that Baby Yoda and The Mandalorian have got audiences clamoring for all things Star Wars once more. There\u2019s no telling if the film can best Avengers: Endgame or Avatar (the previous all-time box office record holders, not adjusting for inflation \u2013 neither superheroes, Skywalkers nor Na\u2019vi have proved any match for Scarlett O\u2019Hara on that score), although considering all three properties belong to Disney, what could it possibly matter?</p> <p>The Baby Yoda craze probably means we can expect the Star Wars universe will remain mired in pre-existing iconography, and that it will continue emphasizing the familiar over the new. But this has been the case since the conclusion of the original trilogy, and for as much as people like to malign the prequels, George Lucas was on point in recognizing that the fanbase\u2019s hunger for explication far outweighs their taste for mystery or ambiguity. Lucas himself had previously forbidden any creators working within the Star Wars Extended Universe (offshoot novels, comics, games, etc) from divulging the origins, whereabouts or even the name of Yoda\u2019s species, and although the mere existence of Baby Yoda would seem to contradict this mandate (no longer valid now that the property is out of his hands), it can\u2019t do any worse damage to the character\u2019s legacy than Lucas himself did by turning him into a kung fu fighting CGI monstrosity 17 years ago.</p> <p>As noted earlier, the true impact of Baby Yoda speaks first and foremost to the hard work and creativity of The Mandalorian\u2019s ace design and effects team. Very few purely digital creations have inspired such widespread and immediate visceral reaction and emotional attachment. Hopefully, the character\u2019s popularity will lead to a greater investment in, and emphasis on, practical effects in large budget studio productions. If that ends up being the real legacy of Baby Yoda, it\u2019s a fair trade-off for oversaturation.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 December 2019 to correct a toe-headed/towheaded homophone.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Three weeks and four episodes into its run, Disney+\u2019s The Mandalorian \u2013 the brand-new streaming service\u2019s flagship series and the first live-action Star Wars show \u2013 has already cemented its legacy thanks to the sensation that is Baby Yoda. The mysterious green tyke has been dominating pop culture and social media ever since episode one, while the deployment of The Mandalorian at the start of the holiday shopping season guarantees that related merchandise will be flying off the shelves. The timing also leads directly into the release of the third and final instalment of the franchise\u2019s theatrical saga, ensuring that Star Wars will reign supreme as we close out this decade and usher in the next. Suffice to say, Disney\u2019s gamble \u2013 The Mandalorian cost about $15m per episode \u2013 will end up paying off. Even taking into consideration how ephemeral most pop culture phenomena turn out to be in our oversaturated media landscape, Baby Yoda fever is likely to prove a chronic condition. Mastery of puppets Not to take any credit away from The Mandalorian creator and showrunner Jon Favreau, but the idea of an infant-sized Yoda is brilliant only in its obviousness. Indeed, this marks the third time Star Wars has gone to that particular well: The Phantom Menace gave us a precocious, towheaded Anakin Skywalker, while the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars introduced Rotta the Hutt, the pint-sized offspring of Jabba the Hutt. Neither of those examples set the world on fire (well, Anakin did, but not in the way Lucas intended), so credit for the Baby Yoda phenomenon lies squarely with the designers and technicians responsible for bringing him to life. Like his older namesake, Baby Yoda is an animatronic creation operated by a team of puppeteers. It\u2019s the tactile \u2013 and at times uncanny \u2013 nature of the thing that is responsible for people\u2019s visceral reaction to it, and it doesn\u2019t seem too early to place it in the same pantheon of beloved practical creature creations as ET, Mogwai or the original Yoda. Even the most cynical observer has to admit: the puppet is objectively beautiful. If it can move as stoic and fatalistic a figure as Werner Herzog to tears, what chance did the rest of us ever stand? Fan theories As no doubt many a casual observer has learned firsthand after being corrected by a Star Wars-obsessed family member, friend, co-worker or checkout line eavesdropper, Baby Yoda is not, in fact, a young version of the Yoda we all know. Or, then again, maybe he is? As soon as his big bat-ears and tiny little head popped out of his floating crib, fans immediately began speculating about his identity and import. The Mandalorian has thus far doled out precious few clues as to the true nature of The Child, as he is referred to within the show. He\u2019s first introduced during the closing moments of the pilot, revealed to be the bounty that our eponymous bounty hunter hero, the equally mysterious Mandalorian (or Mando, as he\u2019s known to friends), was hired to collect, dead or alive. Aside from its gender, we know only that The Child is 50 years old (his species has an exceptionally long lifespan, as first noted in Return of the Jedi when Yoda reveals he\u2019s been alive for 900 years), and that, like the other members of his species we\u2019ve been introduced to in past films, he is Force sensitive. You\u2019d be forgiven for not remembering when or where we were introduced to other members of his species: in The Phantom Menace, a female Yoda lookalike can be glimpsed in the background of several key scenes taking place inside the chamber of the Jedi Council. Although her name is never spoken in the film, it was later revealed to be Yaddle. She doesn\u2019t appear in any of the other prequels or sequels, so as far as the official canon goes, her fate remains a mystery. The Mandalorian is set five years after Return of the Jedi, which means that The Child was \u201cconceived\u201d sometime during the events depicted in the prequel saga or immediately prior. It is therefore entirely possible that Baby Yoda is the offspring of Yoda and Yaddle. Off-putting as the thought of Yoda getting it on is to most of us (I wish I could say all of us, but a cursory Google search would quickly disabuse me of any such notion), the timeline is too specific to dismiss the possibility outright. (That said, the prequels also hinted that Anakin Skywalker was the product of a virgin birth by way of midi-chlorian manipulation, so it\u2019s possible that Baby Yoda had similarly miraculous \u2013 and similarly bogus \u2013 origins.) There\u2019s also the strong possibility that Baby Yoda is actually Baby Yoda, albeit a copy of the original. Cloning has been a central part of the Star Wars mythology from the very beginning, with Obi-Wan Kenobi mentioning \u201cthe Clone Wars\u201d early in the first film. The depiction of that war in Episode 2: Attack of the Clones introduced viewers to the Kaminoans, a secretive and scientific race of master cloners. Their insignia reappears in The Mandalorian, as seen on the uniform of one Dr Pershing, a scientist in league with the show\u2019s central villain, but who seems to have ulterior \u2013 and possibly benevolent \u2013 motives for wanting to possess the tiny Jedi foundling. Both theories seem to hold water at the moment, and since Star Wars has always put great emphasis on familial bloodlines and royal lineage, it would be surprising if Baby Yoda turned out simply to be some random orphan caught up in the fallout of the original saga.

      "body": "<p>Three years on, I still find myself thinking about the strange story of Diego Jokas. It came back to me just the week before last, when that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/22/straight-from-the-horses-mouth-england-prop-joe-marler-delights-with-interview\" title=\"\">video clip of Joe Marler</a> talking about Harlequins\u2019 defeat to Clermont Auvergne went viral. You must know the one. Marler starts off talking about how his team have to \u201cget back on the horse\u201d, and ends up following his train of thought so deep into the woods of his imagination that he ends up whinnying an apology to Harlequins fans and promising they\u2019ll play better against Bath in their next game. The minute-long clip has been seen by hundreds of thousands of people.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/03/virgil-van-dijk-lionel-messi-ballon-dor-jurgen-klopp-liverpool\">Virgil van Dijk deserved Ballon d\u2019Or over Lionel Messi, claims J\u00fcrgen Klopp</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Three different friends shared it with me. The only other time I\u2019ve ever heard two of them talk about rugby was when they were telling me how little they like it. For people like me, who follow the game, the most surprising thing about all this was that everyone else seemed so startled by it. Marler\u2019s an irrepressible eccentric, and he talks that way most weeks. During the World Cup England would often put him up to brighten up rainy day press conferences when his less creative teammates were explaining they were going to take each game as it came.</p> \n<p>The question, then, is why everyone else seemed so taken with Marler\u2019s interview, why people who had absolutely no interest in rugby were so amused and enchanted by it. It was picked up by news outlets in Australia, New Zealand and the US, where it was covered by Sports Illustrated, the Washington Post, USA Today, and the Daily News, among others. Why, over on the feminist blog Jezebel, Megan Reynolds, explained that after watching the clip she now wanted to \u201c<a href=\"https://jezebel.com/looks-like-i-have-to-ride-this-rugby-man-1840002325\" title=\"\">ride this rugby man like a motherfucking Clydesdale</a>\u201d (a compliment meant, she said, with \u201cno disrespect to Marler\u2019s wife, Daisy, who seems lovely\u201d).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f5a4da09-f365-4010-8a11-51789154af24\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CGqjzU-JQuc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And the \u201cwhy\u201d is where Diego Jokas comes in.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s important to stress, right here at the start, that this isn\u2019t <em>the</em> Diego Jokas you will find online, the one who works as a sports journalist in Uruguay. This was <em>the other</em> Diego Jokas, one who, for a stretch of time, had a successful career selling celebrity interviews to newspapers and magazines. Like his exclusive with Lionel Messi that was published in the January 2017 edition of Coach magazine. In it, Messi, offered up some polite platitudes about himself (\u201cWhat motivates me is to win titles for my club and my country\u201d) and his club (\u201cWe work very hard in training so that then what happens in the matches happens\u201d).</p> \n<p>Messi spoke, too, about Cristiano Ronaldo: \u201cI see him as a great player who has achieved great things,\u201d and Wayne Rooney: \u201cI have always had great respect for Rooney, he has played at the highest level for many years and is one of the special players of the generation.\u201d He praised two of his old coaches \u2013 Frank Rijkaard: \u201cHe gave me my first opportunity. It started with him for me,\u201d and Pep Guardiola, who had started at Manchester City that season: \u201cHe is a very good coach and will adapt to the league, I\u2019m sure he will succeed.\u201d So far, so familiar. But there was a wrinkle.</p> \n<p>And the wrinkle was this. Messi was in the midst of contract negotiations with Barcelona at the time, and there were a lot of hot rumours flying around that he might be about to join a club in England, or even Real Madrid. Bar\u00e7a\u2019s president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, had recently said he was unconcerned about the negotiations, and, with all that in the background, every word Messi said mattered. Even this: \u201cI have always said that Barcelona has given me everything,\u201d Jokas quoted him as saying, \u201cand I am here for as long as they want me to be.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/02/once-again-atletico-madrid-get-on-the-wrong-side-of-lionel-messis-genius\">Atl\u00e9tico Madrid get on the wrong side of Lionel Messi's genius once again</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the circumstances, that phrase \u2013 \u201cas long as they want me to be\u201d \u2013 took on undue significance.

      "bodyText": "Three years on, I still find myself thinking about the strange story of Diego Jokas. It came back to me just the week before last, when that video clip of Joe Marler talking about Harlequins\u2019 defeat to Clermont Auvergne went viral. You must know the one. Marler starts off talking about how his team have to \u201cget back on the horse\u201d, and ends up following his train of thought so deep into the woods of his imagination that he ends up whinnying an apology to Harlequins fans and promising they\u2019ll play better against Bath in their next game. The minute-long clip has been seen by hundreds of thousands of people. Three different friends shared it with me. The only other time I\u2019ve ever heard two of them talk about rugby was when they were telling me how little they like it. For people like me, who follow the game, the most surprising thing about all this was that everyone else seemed so startled by it. Marler\u2019s an irrepressible eccentric, and he talks that way most weeks. During the World Cup England would often put him up to brighten up rainy day press conferences when his less creative teammates were explaining they were going to take each game as it came. The question, then, is why everyone else seemed so taken with Marler\u2019s interview, why people who had absolutely no interest in rugby were so amused and enchanted by it. It was picked up by news outlets in Australia, New Zealand and the US, where it was covered by Sports Illustrated, the Washington Post, USA Today, and the Daily News, among others. Why, over on the feminist blog Jezebel, Megan Reynolds, explained that after watching the clip she now wanted to \u201cride this rugby man like a motherfucking Clydesdale\u201d (a compliment meant, she said, with \u201cno disrespect to Marler\u2019s wife, Daisy, who seems lovely\u201d). And the \u201cwhy\u201d is where Diego Jokas comes in. It\u2019s important to stress, right here at the start, that this isn\u2019t the Diego Jokas you will find online, the one who works as a sports journalist in Uruguay. This was the other Diego Jokas, one who, for a stretch of time, had a successful career selling celebrity interviews to newspapers and magazines. Like his exclusive with Lionel Messi that was published in the January 2017 edition of Coach magazine. In it, Messi, offered up some polite platitudes about himself (\u201cWhat motivates me is to win titles for my club and my country\u201d) and his club (\u201cWe work very hard in training so that then what happens in the matches happens\u201d). Messi spoke, too, about Cristiano Ronaldo: \u201cI see him as a great player who has achieved great things,\u201d and Wayne Rooney: \u201cI have always had great respect for Rooney, he has played at the highest level for many years and is one of the special players of the generation.\u201d He praised two of his old coaches \u2013 Frank Rijkaard: \u201cHe gave me my first opportunity. It started with him for me,\u201d and Pep Guardiola, who had started at Manchester City that season: \u201cHe is a very good coach and will adapt to the league, I\u2019m sure he will succeed.\u201d So far, so familiar. But there was a wrinkle. And the wrinkle was this. Messi was in the midst of contract negotiations with Barcelona at the time, and there were a lot of hot rumours flying around that he might be about to join a club in England, or even Real Madrid. Bar\u00e7a\u2019s president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, had recently said he was unconcerned about the negotiations, and, with all that in the background, every word Messi said mattered. Even this: \u201cI have always said that Barcelona has given me everything,\u201d Jokas quoted him as saying, \u201cand I am here for as long as they want me to be.\u201d In the circumstances, that phrase \u2013 \u201cas long as they want me to be\u201d \u2013 took on undue significance. The Spanish press picked up on it. And it was then that the whole thing began to unravel. Messi\u2019s management put out a statement explaining that he\u2019d never given the interview. And on Twitter, the other Diego Jokas, the real Diego Jokas, put out another: \u201cI want to clarify that I don\u2019t work nor have I worked for Coach Magazine and I did not participate in this interview with Messi which has been attributed to me.\u201d Coach magazine immediately yanked the interview offline. And Diego Jokas \u2013 the other Diego Jokas, who had, presumably, always been quite happy to be mistaken for his namesake \u2013 disappeared. Behind him he left an email address and a back catalogue of innocuous interviews with assorted superstars, Ronaldo and Usain Bolt for one magazine, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Rafa Nadal for another, Gianluigi Buffon for a third, which were all subsequently taken offline. The strangest thing about all this isn\u2019t that Jokas was able to fake the interview; anyone with a pile of clippings might be able to do that. As Nicholas Tomalin once said, the three essential qualities for real success in journalism are rat-like cunning, a plausible manner, and a little literary ability.

No, the surreal part is that, but for that one little slip, he might well have got away with it \u2026 we\u2019ve all become so habituated to the cliches a lot of sports stars use in interviews that even they can\u2019t really tell which ones they actually came out with.

The circumstances surrounding Hoffa\u2019s sudden vanishing from public life have long been fodder for rumor and conjecture, and some on social media have pointed out that we\u2019ve got no reason to believe Sheeran\u2019s outrageous confession. But in le cinema du Marty, an unreliable narrator prone to making grandiose statements about their own feats \u2013 that\u2019s the film-maker\u2019s bread and butter. He prefers to depict his flawed protagonists on their own terms and let the audience read between the lines.</p> <p>More to the point, buying into Sheeran\u2019s narrative occasions one of the most heartrending passages in the Scorsese oeuvre. It is through his betrayal that the untouchable Hoffa can fall, a classic \u201cJudas in the garden of Gethsemane\u201d moment not unfamiliar to the devout Christian\u2019s filmography. We see the trust scrawled across Hoffa\u2019s face as he gets into the car that will take him to his death, entering the vehicle only because Sheeran tells him everything\u2019s square. The truly poignant, tragic part is that Hoffa\u2019s absolute faith in Sheeran never wavers for a moment. When Sheeran brings Hoffa to an empty house, the target assumes that there\u2019s been a mix-up. His final words are \u201cLet\u2019s get outta here, c\u2019mon,\u201d to Sheeran, steadfast to the very last in his belief that they\u2019ve got one another\u2019s backs. The whacking, tastefully obscured by a doorframe, takes us off guard in part because it presents Hoffa in the one light we\u2019ve never seen him: vulnerability.</p> <h2><strong>Peggy Sheeran: a woman of few words</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e4396b6ee01bd4281da837edefe0c8fdcea5011b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4396b6ee01bd4281da837edefe0c8fdcea5011b/0_0_3901_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Paquin as Peggy Sheeran, a significant yet largely silent presence in the film.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"538\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Paquin as Peggy Sheeran, a significant yet largely silent presence in the film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much has also been said about a woman who doesn\u2019t say much. Sheeran\u2019s daughter Peggy, first introduced as a little girl and then portrayed as an adult by Oscar-winner Anna Paquin, is a significant yet largely silent presence in the film. She watches, she knows, and she judges, as in an early sequence that sees Peggy watching in horror while her father brutalizes a grocery clerk who had given her lip moments earlier. Sheeran thinks he\u2019s being a protective head of the family, but all that Peggy sees is a violent man with whom she\u2019s expected to share a home. Both actors playing Peggy convey this much with withering, meaningful glances rather than histrionic speechifying, which has been a touch subtle for some of the internet\u2019s simpler cultural critics.</p> <p>While detractors have levied the charge of sexism against the script for seemingly stripping one of its few female characters of her ability to speak, cooler heads have posited that this must surely be the point. The domineering men in her world \u2013 not just dear old dad, but also his associate Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), a fellow murderer to whom Peggy never warms \u2013 barely give her an opening to express her own thoughts. She\u2019s expected to be quiet and complicit in the mafia lifestyle, exchanging a blind eye for the fabulous privileges attached to wealth and power, a dark bargain common to gangster fiction. But Peggy remains dedicated to her principles, eventually cutting off all contact with her father after a muted confrontation in which she accuses him with the simple \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a far more affecting moment for everything she can\u2019t bring herself to say, and Paquin sells it with such expertise that the importance of her character and her taciturn stares cannot be denied. Just as John Steinbeck referred to Curly\u2019s wife as such in Of Mice and Men, so too does Scorsese restrict Peggy\u2019s sense of self for dramatic effect, showing her to us as the world around her would like to see her.</p> <h2><strong>For Frank, an elegiac coda</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d328d0b56cb653ec090661473fe5a1d100b30983\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d328d0b56cb653ec090661473fe5a1d100b30983/0_0_3504_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"541\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nobody ends movies like Martin Scorsese.

A similar fate befalls Frank Sheeran, who lives into old age, unlike the many characters introduced with a chyron announcing their oft-untimely cause of death.

We see Frank choosing a coffin for himself, much to the unease of the sales representative (Queens-bred rapper Action Bronson, in an unlikely cameo) helping him out, and perusing the space in a mausoleum where his body will one day rest. All the while, there\u2019s a faint tinge of denial; Sheeran repeatedly says that being interred in a mausoleum \u201cisn\u2019t final\u201d, because the body\u2019s still there, as opposed to the decisive finality of cremation. The last shot peers in on Frank through a crack in the door, left ajar at his request. It\u2019s a nod to the time Sheeran spent with Hoffa, who liked to sleep the same way, a sad grasp at the past.

      "bodyText": "Robert Mugabe left $10m (\u00a37.7m) in the bank, some small plots of land and a handful of modest properties, a list of his estate published by a state-owned newspaper in Zimbabwe has shown. The report of the relatively limited fortune of the late dictator, published on Tuesday, was greeted with scepticism by many in the poverty-hit southern African country. Mugabe, who died in August aged 95, was thought to have amassed a portfolio of investments worth hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, over his near four-decade rule. The most recent list was revealed when Mugabe\u2019s daughter Bona Chikowore wrote to legal officials seeking to register her father\u2019s estate, which she said included $10m held in a local bank, four houses in the capital, Harare, 10 cars, a farm, his rural home and an orchard, the Herald newspaper reported. No will has yet been found and there has been no other declaration of Mugabe\u2019s wealth, or that of his second wife, Grace, nor of his sons and other relatives. The former guerrilla leader, who took power in 1980 and ruled for decades, was buried in September in his rural home town of Kutama. The final burial place caused tension between the government, which wanted him to be interred at the National Heroes Acre, a hilltop shrine in Harare, and his family. When he was ousted from power in November 2017, Mugabe was given a generous state pension and a retirement package that included a pension, housing, holiday and transport allowance, health insurance, limited air travel and security. Some of the Mugabe family wealth has been exposed by a series of legal quarrels. One, between Grace Mugabe and a Belgian-based businessman over a $1.3m diamond ring, lifted a veil on the lifestyle of his widow, nicknamed \u201cGucci Grace\u201d for her reputed dedication to shopping. The family is believed to have an extensive portfolio of luxury homes overseas. In 2015, a dispute revealed their ownership of a $7.6m home in Hong Kong. The ruling Zanu-PF party said in October it planned to transfer ownership of the sprawling mansion in Harare where Mugabe lived until shortly before his death to the family. The house is worth several million dollars. The Mugabes are also thought to own more than a dozen farms. Several are in Mazowe, about 40km (25 miles) north of Harare.

The news of the Mugabes\u2019 wealth comes as Zimbabwe plunges further into a humanitarian crisis. The UN food agency said on Tuesday it was procuring 240,000 tonnes of food assistance to deliver to 4.1 million people in the former British colony where food shortages are being exacerbated by runaway inflation and drought induced by climate change. \u201cWe are very much concerned as the situation continues to deteriorate,\u201d Eddie Rowe, World Food Programme country director, speaking from Harare, told a news briefing in Geneva.

      "body": "<p>\u2018I\u2019m here today because I love you.\u201d That\u2019s how Floella Benjamin, the children\u2019s TV presenter turned advocate for children of all ages, usually begins. Sometimes she says those exact words. Sometimes, like today, she doesn\u2019t have to. Thirty years in children\u2019s TV, first as a presenter on Play School and later as head of her own production company, has made Benjamin adept at communicating not only with children but with the inner children of adults. It\u2019s a skill that can make encounters unexpectedly emotional.</p> <p>\u201cCaring,\u201d she says, that\u2019s the secret. \u201cAnd meaning it. On Play School, I said, \u2018Hello, are you all right?\u2019\u201d She pauses, but maintains eye contact, and suddenly I\u2019m four again, sitting cross-legged and too close to the TV, as her benevolent face smiles out at me. \u201cI\u2019m giving the child a moment to answer back,\u201d she explains. \u201cBecause many of the children watching were living in children\u2019s homes, or weren\u2019t loved, or were being abused, and they needed somebody. I made them understand that I loved them.\u201d</p> <p>The feeling is plainly mutual. This Friday, Benjamin will receive the lifetime achievement prize at the Women in Film and Television awards. It is only the latest in a long list of honours that includes an OBE (2001), a special lifetime achievement Bafta (2004) and Freedom of the City of London (2018). Tom Hanks is starring in a film telling the semi-mystical story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/09/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-review-tom-hanks-charms-as-mister-rogers\">Mister Rogers</a>, Benjamin\u2019s US equivalent, so perhaps her own Hollywood biopic is next?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9cff812ce5150f91d26df154252f4e8ff7ea2db7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cff812ce5150f91d26df154252f4e8ff7ea2db7/0_0_2336_1592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giving back the love \u2026 Benjamin on TV in 1983.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giving back the love \u2026 Benjamin on TV in 1983.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barry Boxall/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to embellish it a bit,\u201d says Keith, her husband of 40 years, who occasionally chips in with supportive words and specific dates. \u201cWe always say our life is boring.\u201d Well, it isn\u2019t boring, but certain scenarios do seem to recur. These days, when Benjamin isn\u2019t on stage accepting an award at some fancy gala, she\u2019s hidden in a quiet corner afterwards counselling and embracing a stranger, who may be sobbing. Except they\u2019re never<em> really</em> strangers \u2013 they\u2019re her \u201cPlay School babies\u201d, all grown up now, with responsible, high-flying careers, yet still hungry for Benjamin\u2019s approval. \u201cMost of the ministers in parliament are my Play School babies,\u201d she says with satisfaction.</p> <p>This is a matter of both pride and practical use in Benjamin\u2019s position as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats\">Lib Dem</a> peer in the House of Lords, Baroness Benjamin of Beckenham. The Beckenham part has special significance. It was in this London suburb that her parents, whom she calls Marmie and Dardie, eventually settled, after arriving from Trinidad and sending for 10-year-old Benjamin and her siblings. The racism began before they\u2019d even moved in: \u201cThey sent the police to arrest us \u2013 to say black people don\u2019t live here. My mum said, \u201cYou know something, we\u2019re going to live in this house!\u201d And we lived there for 40 years.\u201d After her peerage was announced in 2010, Benjamin visited her parents\u2019 graves in Beckenham cemetery. \u201cI said, \u2018Marmie, Dardie, I\u2019m going to claim Beckenham for you!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Benjamin turned 70 this year, but her parents still come up regularly in conversation, because her upbringing is so central to who she is. It\u2019s what gave her purpose: \u201cI always say, \u2018Childhood lasts a lifetime. [My parents] gave me so much love, poured it into me all my life. So what better thing to do than to hand it back out?\u201d</p> <p>She hasn\u2019t always felt that love returned, however. Growing up, she was subjected to racist bullying and, on one memorable occasion, ridiculed by a teacher because of her Caribbean accent. \u201cShe said, \u2018If you want to remain in my class, you have to learn to speak the Queen\u2019s English.\u2019\u201d Benjamin was upset but, on the advice of her mother, complied. Some years later, she called upon the episode to escape an attempted sexual assault. \u201cI turned and said to him, \u2018How dare you! You guttersnipe!\u2019 I morphed myself into my teacher, because I knew how she\u2019d made me feel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90c41153e003671a855e54e0dbae29dabd9cc35e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90c41153e003671a855e54e0dbae29dabd9cc35e/0_76_5200_3121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They couldn\u2019t see the importance of it\u2019 \u2026 Benjamin\u2019s contribution to the Chelsea Flower Show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They couldn\u2019t see the importance of it\u2019 \u2026 Benjamin\u2019s contribution to the Chelsea Flower Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malcolm Park editorial/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Benjamin\u2019s anecdotes about her schooldays are typical of a nuanced-yet-practical approach to tackling racism, one that is sometimes misconstrued. Adapting is not about feeling ashamed of her roots \u2013 it\u2019s the opposite. \u201cI\u2019m never afraid of expressing my true me,\u201d she explains, \u201cand people take it or leave it. But I also learned from that teacher what I needed to do if I wanted to engage with people. Anywhere I go in the world, I can <em>become.\u201d</em></p> <p>As chancellor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofexeter\">Exeter University</a> during the 2012 Diamond Jubilee, she was charged with giving the Queen a guided tour. \u201cWe had a great time together. She told me stories about her family and shared ideas about life, children, food, everything. And I thought I\u2019d share my story with her. I said, \u2018You know, ma\u2019am, when I was in Trinidad, I used to stand and sing God Save the Queen. I was told I was part of the Motherland. When I came to Britain, it wasn\u2019t like that. I had to face so much adversity in Britain and so many barriers. But do you know? I don\u2019t hate anybody, I don\u2019t have any resentment in my heart.\u2019\u201d Her Majesty was moved, apparently. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018When I\u2019m speaking to you like this, it reminds me of when I was speaking to Nelson Mandela. He had the same philosophy.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So the woman who was reprimanded for not speaking \u201cthe Queen\u2019s English\u201d went on to speak English with the actual Queen. Such is the trajectory of Benjamin\u2019s life. \u201cEvery day I say, \u2018Take me, show me, lead me, I\u2019m yours,\u2019\u201d she says, turning her face upwards and closing her eyes, as if to bathe in the sunlight of another blessed day. Does she never feel defeated? \u201cNothing gets me.\u201d</p> <p>Even the Windrush scandal couldn\u2019t shake her faith in happy resolutions. Perhaps because, for a Caribbean-born British woman who lived through the 1960s, evidence of government hostility to immigrants is not \u201cnews\u201d. When the first stories of deportations broke, Benjamin was already struggling to get funding for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/25/the-guardian-view-on-gardening-digging-ones-way-to-humanity\">a Windrush-themed garden at the Chelsea Flower Show</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"624576d54f8d1a4d8980ab099177b0be14b67671\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/624576d54f8d1a4d8980ab099177b0be14b67671/0_0_2864_1833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Starting out \u2026 Benjamin at the start of her career.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starting out \u2026 Benjamin at the start of her career.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Capstick/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t see the importance of it. Why should they? It wasn\u2019t part of their schooling. So when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a> happened, suddenly everybody knew! Everything happens for a reason. People were falling over themselves to be our sponsor and we won a gold medal. We had white, middle-class people coming up saying,\u201d \u2014 she adopts her teacher\u2019s voice again \u2014 \u201c\u2018Oh, here\u2019s the Windrush garden! I know all about Windrush!\u2019 If people had understood the history, we wouldn\u2019t have got to where we are.\u201d</p> <p>On other issues, too, Benjamin is a reformer, not a revolutionary. Beginning with a polite enquiry as to why Play School\u2019s story illustrations only featured white children, she has had several big successes. Most recently, she secured an amendment to encourage broadcasters to commission more quality children\u2019s programming and she\u2019s even sanguine about the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2014/jul/21/unboxing-youtube-phenomenon-videos-unpackaging-toys\">unboxing videos</a> (people opening packaged products while describing what they find).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every moment matters to a child under seven. So if you're giving them rubbish, they're going to accept rubbish in life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf children want to go and watch things on YouTube, fair enough. But I think if they\u2019ve got quality programmes on the main channels, they\u2019ll be watching those. Every moment matters to the child under seven. So if you\u2019re giving them rubbish, they\u2019re going to accept rubbish in life.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Benjamin understands that not everyone was blessed with a Marmie and Dardie like hers. Which is why, even after four decades of passionate campaigning, there is still much work to be done on the causes closest to her heart: media diversity and children\u2019s welfare. \u201cOf course I find it frustrating,\u201d she says. \u201cI weep sometimes when I\u2019m at home, but I\u2019ve got a wonderful husband who knows just what I\u2019m going through and how I\u2019ve been trying to point out the lack of diversity. I\u2019ve been told, \u2018Shut up, you\u2019ll never work again\u2019, \u2018Back off, who do you think you are?\u2019 I\u2019ve been told all of that \u2013 but I know eventually it will turn.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Floella Benjamin will receive the EON Productions lifetime achievement award at the <a href=\"https://wftv.org.uk/awards/\">Women in Film and Television awards 2019</a> on 6 December.</p></li> </ul>",

On Play School, I said, \u2018Hello, are you all right?\u2019\u201d She pauses, but maintains eye contact, and suddenly I\u2019m four again, sitting cross-legged and too close to the TV, as her benevolent face smiles out at me. \u201cI\u2019m giving the child a moment to answer back,\u201d she explains. \u201cBecause many of the children watching were living in children\u2019s homes, or weren\u2019t loved, or were being abused, and they needed somebody. I made them understand that I loved them.\u201d The feeling is plainly mutual. This Friday, Benjamin will receive the lifetime achievement prize at the Women in Film and Television awards. It is only the latest in a long list of honours that includes an OBE (2001), a special lifetime achievement Bafta (2004) and Freedom of the City of London (2018). Tom Hanks is starring in a film telling the semi-mystical story of Mister Rogers, Benjamin\u2019s US equivalent, so perhaps her own Hollywood biopic is next? \u201cYou\u2019d have to embellish it a bit,\u201d says Keith, her husband of 40 years, who occasionally chips in with supportive words and specific dates. \u201cWe always say our life is boring.\u201d Well, it isn\u2019t boring, but certain scenarios do seem to recur. These days, when Benjamin isn\u2019t on stage accepting an award at some fancy gala, she\u2019s hidden in a quiet corner afterwards counselling and embracing a stranger, who may be sobbing. Except they\u2019re never really strangers \u2013 they\u2019re her \u201cPlay School babies\u201d, all grown up now, with responsible, high-flying careers, yet still hungry for Benjamin\u2019s approval. \u201cMost of the ministers in parliament are my Play School babies,\u201d she says with satisfaction. This is a matter of both pride and practical use in Benjamin\u2019s position as a Lib Dem peer in the House of Lords, Baroness Benjamin of Beckenham. The Beckenham part has special significance. It was in this London suburb that her parents, whom she calls Marmie and Dardie, eventually settled, after arriving from Trinidad and sending for 10-year-old Benjamin and her siblings. The racism began before they\u2019d even moved in: \u201cThey sent the police to arrest us \u2013 to say black people don\u2019t live here. My mum said, \u201cYou know something, we\u2019re going to live in this house!\u201d And we lived there for 40 years.\u201d After her peerage was announced in 2010, Benjamin visited her parents\u2019 graves in Beckenham cemetery. \u201cI said, \u2018Marmie, Dardie, I\u2019m going to claim Beckenham for you!\u2019\u201d Benjamin turned 70 this year, but her parents still come up regularly in conversation, because her upbringing is so central to who she is. It\u2019s what gave her purpose: \u201cI always say, \u2018Childhood lasts a lifetime. [My parents] gave me so much love, poured it into me all my life. So what better thing to do than to hand it back out?\u201d She hasn\u2019t always felt that love returned, however. Growing up, she was subjected to racist bullying and, on one memorable occasion, ridiculed by a teacher because of her Caribbean accent. \u201cShe said, \u2018If you want to remain in my class, you have to learn to speak the Queen\u2019s English.\u2019\u201d Benjamin was upset but, on the advice of her mother, complied. Some years later, she called upon the episode to escape an attempted sexual assault. \u201cI turned and said to him, \u2018How dare you! You guttersnipe!\u2019 I morphed myself into my teacher, because I knew how she\u2019d made me feel.\u201d Benjamin\u2019s anecdotes about her schooldays are typical of a nuanced-yet-practical approach to tackling racism, one that is sometimes misconstrued. Adapting is not about feeling ashamed of her roots \u2013 it\u2019s the opposite. \u201cI\u2019m never afraid of expressing my true me,\u201d she explains, \u201cand people take it or leave it. But I also learned from that teacher what I needed to do if I wanted to engage with people. Anywhere I go in the world, I can become.\u201d As chancellor of Exeter University during the 2012 Diamond Jubilee, she was charged with giving the Queen a guided tour. \u201cWe had a great time together. She told me stories about her family and shared ideas about life, children, food, everything. And I thought I\u2019d share my story with her. I said, \u2018You know, ma\u2019am, when I was in Trinidad, I used to stand and sing God Save the Queen. I was told I was part of the Motherland. When I came to Britain, it wasn\u2019t like that. I had to face so much adversity in Britain and so many barriers. But do you know? I don\u2019t hate anybody, I don\u2019t have any resentment in my heart.\u2019\u201d Her Majesty was moved, apparently. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018When I\u2019m speaking to you like this, it reminds me of when I was speaking to Nelson Mandela. He had the same philosophy.\u2019\u201d So the woman who was reprimanded for not speaking \u201cthe Queen\u2019s English\u201d went on to speak English with the actual Queen. Such is the trajectory of Benjamin\u2019s life. \u201cEvery day I say, \u2018Take me, show me, lead me, I\u2019m yours,\u2019\u201d she says, turning her face upwards and closing her eyes, as if to bathe in the sunlight of another blessed day. Does she never feel defeated? \u201cNothing gets me.\u201d Even the Windrush scandal couldn\u2019t shake her faith in happy resolutions. Perhaps because, for a Caribbean-born British woman who lived through the 1960s, evidence of government hostility to immigrants is not \u201cnews\u201d. When the first stories of deportations broke, Benjamin was already struggling to get funding for a Windrush-themed garden at the Chelsea Flower Show. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t see the importance of it. Why should they? It wasn\u2019t part of their schooling. So when the Windrush scandal happened, suddenly everybody knew! Everything happens for a reason. People were falling over themselves to be our sponsor and we won a gold medal. We had white, middle-class people coming up saying,\u201d \u2014 she adopts her teacher\u2019s voice again \u2014 \u201c\u2018Oh, here\u2019s the Windrush garden! I know all about Windrush!\u2019 If people had understood the history, we wouldn\u2019t have got to where we are.\u201d On other issues, too, Benjamin is a reformer, not a revolutionary. Beginning with a polite enquiry as to why Play School\u2019s story illustrations only featured white children, she has had several big successes. Most recently, she secured an amendment to encourage broadcasters to commission more quality children\u2019s programming and she\u2019s even sanguine about the rise of unboxing videos (people opening packaged products while describing what they find). \u201cIf children want to go and watch things on YouTube, fair enough. But I think if they\u2019ve got quality programmes on the main channels, they\u2019ll be watching those. Every moment matters to the child under seven. So if you\u2019re giving them rubbish, they\u2019re going to accept rubbish in life.\u201d Still, Benjamin understands that not everyone was blessed with a Marmie and Dardie like hers. Which is why, even after four decades of passionate campaigning, there is still much work to be done on the causes closest to her heart: media diversity and children\u2019s welfare. \u201cOf course I find it frustrating,\u201d she says. \u201cI weep sometimes when I\u2019m at home, but I\u2019ve got a wonderful husband who knows just what I\u2019m going through and how I\u2019ve been trying to point out the lack of diversity. I\u2019ve been told, \u2018Shut up, you\u2019ll never work again\u2019, \u2018Back off, who do you think you are?\u2019 I\u2019ve been told all of that \u2013 but I know eventually it will turn.\u201d Floella Benjamin will receive the EON Productions lifetime achievement award at the Women in Film and Television awards 2019 on 6 December.",

      "bodyText": "Tightly crushed together in an area about the size of a football field fenced with barbed wire, more than 2,000 buffalo stand waiting for their death. Deprived of adequate water and food, they snort and snuffle in pain. The animals are just some of the thousands prepared for sacrifice as part of this year\u2019s Gadhimai festival in Nepal, which takes place once every five years and holds the dubious honour of being known as the world\u2019s bloodiest festival. For more than two centuries, the festival has drawn millions of Hindu devotees to the Gadhimai temple of Bariyarpur in early December, out of the belief that animal sacrifices to the Hindu goddess Gadhimai will end evil and bring prosperity. According to legend, the first sacrifices in Bariyarpur were conducted several centuries ago when the goddess Gadhimai appeared to a prisoner in a dream and told him to offer blood and establish her temple. When he awoke, his shackles had fallen open and he was able to leave the prison and build the temple, where he sacrificed animals to give thanks. However, in recent years, it has also become one of the most polarising traditions in Nepal, dividing those who see it as a touchstone traditional Hindu ceremony and those who believe it is an outdated monument to animal cruelty. In 2009, it is estimated around a quarter of a million animals were slaughtered. The figure for 2014 was about 200,000. This year\u2019s event is the first since a supreme court ruling in 2015 that directed the government to discourage bloodshed, but thousands of creatures are still set to be killed over the two days. Even if they could not prevent the slaughter, activists were tending to the animals in their final hours in an attempt to minimise suffering. Her hands and face smeared with blood and mud, Sneha Shrestha, president of the Federation of Animal Welfare Nepal, spent Monday treating wounded buffalo calves with saline water and medicine, checking their temperatures and trying to bring them food and water. \u201cWe are not against traditions and culture but if such practices hurt animals then we must step forward to end them,\u201d said Shrestha. At the crack of dawn on Tuesday morning the festival began with the Pancha Bali, the sacrifices of a rat, a goat, a rooster, a pig and a pigeon. By 9am, about 200 butchers began to take their khukuris \u2013 a type of Nepalese blade \u2013 to the necks of the buffaloes. The air was filled with the cries of the animals. By the end of the day, between 3,000 to 6,500 buffalo had been beheaded. Worshippers who came to the temple defended the festival\u2019s traditions. \u201cThose who are against the festival will continue to protest and those who wish to worship the goddess will do so,\u201d said a woman from Kolhabi. \u201cNo one can stop it.Our faith is important and sacrifices validate it.\u201d \u201cLook at these hundreds of people,\u201d she added, pointing to a sea of attendees. \u201cThey are here because of their faith.\u201d Some of those who have voiced opposition to Gadhimai have faced severe backlash and even threats of violence. Manoj Gautam, an animal rights activist who has been campaigning against the festival for 11 years, was attacked a few months ago. He said he felt \u201csaddened and enraged\u201d. Gautam accused local and state institutions of \u201cforsaking their duty by hiding behind an institutional veil\u201d. On Monday, Gautam filed a contempt case in Kathmandu\u2019s supreme court against the Nepalese government and Gadhimai temple committee for disregarding the 2015 supreme court ruling. Bara\u2019s chief district officer, Phanindra Mani Pokharel, said that ending the mass slaughter of animals was not simple, as it was likely to lead to social unrest. He also pointed to the economic significance of the festival to Chamar\u2019s community. Motilal Kushwaha, general secretary of Gadhimai Mela Organizing Committee, said: \u201cWe have done our best to make this festival a good one in terms of security, health and water sanitation. Also, we are on the side of discouraging sacrifices according to the 2015 supreme court verdict. \u201cThere\u2019s no definite answer as to when this festival will end but it will one day.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The head of an EU mission to Malta has called on the country\u2019s embattled prime minister to quit immediately amid anger over his handling of the investigation into the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. The Dutch liberal MEP Sophie in \u2019t Veld, who is leading the European parliament\u2019s emergency fact-finding mission to Malta, said she was \u201cnot reassured\u201d after meeting Joseph Muscat and his justice minister, Owen Bonnici. \u201cI think everybody recognises, including the prime minister himself, that he has made some serious errors of judgment and I would say that staying on longer than necessary is another error of judgment,\u201d she told reporters in Valleta. She said trust between the EU and Malta had been seriously damaged, and that Muscat had done little to allay concerns. The main opposition party said on Monday it would boycott parliament until Muscat left office. A small crowd of protesters threw eggs and insults at both Muscat and Bonnici as they arrived at government headquarters for Tuesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cThe EU must put pressure on him to go,\u201d said Caruana Galizia\u2019s sister, Mandy Mallia, who took part in the demonstration. \u201c[Yorgen] Fenech wasn\u2019t acting alone.\u201d Separately, Matthew Caruana Galizia, one of the journalist\u2019s three sons, described the EU\u2019s response to the scandal as \u201ca huge letdown\u201d, although he focused his criticism at the European commission, which is responsible for upholding European law, rather than MEPs. \u201cThere has been pressure from the European parliament, but the response from the European Union has been hopeless, it has just been a huge let down,\u201d he told the Guardian. At a valedictory press conference on his last day in office as European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker declined to comment on the situation in Malta, claiming he didn\u2019t have the details. Juncker said he was \u201chighly concerned\u201d about the rule of law in more than one EU country without going into specifics. Matthew Caruana Galizia cited this as an example of the commission\u2019s \u201cabysmal\u201d approach to Malta, adding he expected more from Juncker\u2019s successor, Ursula von der Leyen, who took office on Sunday. \u201cI expect them to come down like a tonne of bricks, especially after Juncker\u2019s failures. He was abysmal.\u201d The Maltese political crisis is an early test for Von der Leyen, who is under pressure to show that she will not allow EU member states to undermine the rule of law. The commission has called on Malta to establish an independent public prosecutor, after experts at the Council of Europe raised a red flag about the separation of powers. That issue was discussed in a phone call between European commission vice president V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Bonnici on Monday, while Jourov\u00e1 told an FT conference that failure to implement judicial reforms could trigger an EU sanctions procedure, known as article 7. During the call Jourov\u00e1 also said that the Caruana Galizia murder investigation had \u201cto be brought to a conclusion without any political interference\u201d a commission spokesman said on Tuesday. Muscat has promised to stand down in mid-January to allow the Labour party time to pick a new leader. The Caruana Galizia family have called for an investigation into Muscat\u2019s role after investigators alleged there were links between his chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and the man accused of organising the murder. Schembri resigned last week and was then arrested and later released from police custody without charge. He is alleged to have links with Fenech, Malta\u2019s richest man, who has been charged with complicity in the murder. Konrad Mizzi, who had been accused by Caruana Galizia of corruption, also quit his post as Malta\u2019s tourism minister last week. Muscat, Schembri, Fenech and Mizzi all deny wrongdoing.",

Forever hovering just out of reach, rather as she does in that now notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/06/jeffrey-epstein-virginia-roberts-giuffre-prince-andrew-photo\" title=\"\">photograph</a> of the prince with his arm around the bare midriff of a girl little older than his daughter. There have been a few sightings, one supposedly in a Los Angeles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/16/ghislaine-maxwell-seen-in-public-for-first-time-since-epstein-death\" title=\"\">fast-food restaurant</a>. Yet for now she remains in hiding, and with her lies the truth.</p> <p>The former girlfriend of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein may be the only other living person who knows what happened, not just on the night that photograph was taken, when Virginia Giuffre (nee Roberts) says she was compelled to have sex with the Queen\u2019s second son, but on so many other nights when, as she said on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/02/prince-andrew-accuser-virginia-giuffre-asks-uk-public-to-stand-by-her-in-bbc-interview\" title=\"\">Monday night\u2019s Panorama</a>, she was \u201cpassed around like a platter of fruit\u201d between Epstein\u2019s friends.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Until there is a trial we are stuck in the unsatisfactory land of the perennially unproven</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There has rightly been outrage at Prince Andrew\u2019s failure to drop Epstein once he was convicted of sex offences. But given Maxwell also stands accused, by a number of women in civil actions, of being complicit with her boyfriend in sex trafficking and abuse, it is just as astonishing that the prince was in touch with her as recently as this year. If, as he insists, they didn\u2019t discuss Epstein then it is frankly hard to know why not. Are we to believe he was simply too polite to mention the allegation that his friends had been running a sex-trafficking ring right under his nose?</p> <p>Maxwell has been a curiously underexamined part of the story. Panorama included old footage from a photoshoot, in which she was seen laughing and asking how her hair looked. This was Maxwell the socialite, the billionaire\u2019s daughter, the magazine cover girl. But in their affidavits and in front of cameras, Epstein\u2019s victims describe someone else entirely. They recall a bully \u201cwith a viciousness to her\u201d, in Giuffre\u2019s words, who made sure Epstein got what he wanted; a woman they feared, and have accused not merely of turning a blind eye to his predation but in some cases of being an active participant.</p> <p>By now, we are almost numb to stories of powerful old men doing terrible things to much younger women. But there is something viscerally dreadful about the idea of a woman \u2013 someone a younger girl might look to for rescue and protection \u2013 being in any way complicit in abuse. Giuffre told Panorama she felt sick when told to sleep with the prince because she hadn\u2019t expected such behaviour from royalty, but what made her cry was describing Maxwell praising her later for doing a good job.</p> <p>Allegedy, allegedly, allegedly. For Maxwell denies all this, and Prince Andrew categorically denies the allegations against him. Unless and until there is a trial we are stuck in the unsatisfactory land of the perennially unproven. This case has made jurors of us all, given the only real point of a Panorama with little substantively new to say was to let audiences compare the respective credibility of Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre as witnesses. He testified in his defence to Newsnight, and now Panorama has put the case for the prosecution. All that can be said with any certainty is that the prince\u2019s toe-curling claim to have been if anything \u201ctoo honourable\u201d in his dealings with Epstein looks worse with every passing day.</p> <p>Where the prince blundered clumsily through his story, Giuffre was fluent and surprisingly composed. But then she must have told this story so many times, to lawyers and journalists and FBI agents: how she was abused from the age of seven, ran away from home, and was just getting her life together with a job at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago beach club when she encountered Maxwell, who suggested she train as a masseuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/03/prince-andrew-cant-slink-away-from-this-now-the-tv-triumph-of-virginia-giuffre\">'Prince Andrew can't slink away from this now' \u2013 the TV triumph of Virginia Giuffre</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her big mistake, she said bleakly, was to tell Epstein and his girlfriend the story of her damaged childhood: \u201cNow they knew how vulnerable I was.\u201d Panorama spliced her description of dancing with the sweaty prince together with the prince\u2019s wide-eyed claim that it was medically \u201cimpossible for him to sweat\u201d, followed by archive footage of him emerging from nightclubs damp-shirted. Five women have testified in the US that he was present when they gave massages to Epstein, despite the prince\u2019s insistence that he never saw anything untoward. The prosecution rests, your honour.</p> <p>But the whole thing made uncomfortable watching. Why is this happening on TV, not in court? Where is the anonymity granted to victims of alleged sex offences during a British trial, the admittedly meagre dignity afforded by a legal process, the requirement for all sides to testify on oath? Without the media these claims wouldn\u2019t have come to light at all, yet justice should not rely on trafficking victims\u2019 willingness to speak out this publicly to remind us how catastrophically the system has failed.</p> <p>And it is on the courts that the focus must fall. Now that Jeffrey Epstein is dead, there can be no peace for the damaged women he left behind until Ghislaine Maxwell faces their allegations in a court and Prince Andrew testifies under oath. Only then can all those who have suffered in various ways at Epstein\u2019s hands possibly stand a chance of finally breaking free.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Where is Ghislaine Maxwell? In the scandal engulfing her good friend the Duke of York, she is both everywhere and nowhere. Forever hovering just out of reach, rather as she does in that now notorious photograph of the prince with his arm around the bare midriff of a girl little older than his daughter. There have been a few sightings, one supposedly in a Los Angeles fast-food restaurant. Yet for now she remains in hiding, and with her lies the truth. The former girlfriend of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein may be the only other living person who knows what happened, not just on the night that photograph was taken, when Virginia Giuffre (nee Roberts) says she was compelled to have sex with the Queen\u2019s second son, but on so many other nights when, as she said on Monday night\u2019s Panorama, she was \u201cpassed around like a platter of fruit\u201d between Epstein\u2019s friends. There has rightly been outrage at Prince Andrew\u2019s failure to drop Epstein once he was convicted of sex offences. But given Maxwell also stands accused, by a number of women in civil actions, of being complicit with her boyfriend in sex trafficking and abuse, it is just as astonishing that the prince was in touch with her as recently as this year. If, as he insists, they didn\u2019t discuss Epstein then it is frankly hard to know why not. Are we to believe he was simply too polite to mention the allegation that his friends had been running a sex-trafficking ring right under his nose? Maxwell has been a curiously underexamined part of the story. Panorama included old footage from a photoshoot, in which she was seen laughing and asking how her hair looked. This was Maxwell the socialite, the billionaire\u2019s daughter, the magazine cover girl. But in their affidavits and in front of cameras, Epstein\u2019s victims describe someone else entirely. They recall a bully \u201cwith a viciousness to her\u201d, in Giuffre\u2019s words, who made sure Epstein got what he wanted; a woman they feared, and have accused not merely of turning a blind eye to his predation but in some cases of being an active participant. By now, we are almost numb to stories of powerful old men doing terrible things to much younger women. But there is something viscerally dreadful about the idea of a woman \u2013 someone a younger girl might look to for rescue and protection \u2013 being in any way complicit in abuse. Giuffre told Panorama she felt sick when told to sleep with the prince because she hadn\u2019t expected such behaviour from royalty, but what made her cry was describing Maxwell praising her later for doing a good job. Allegedy, allegedly, allegedly. For Maxwell denies all this, and Prince Andrew categorically denies the allegations against him. Unless and until there is a trial we are stuck in the unsatisfactory land of the perennially unproven. This case has made jurors of us all, given the only real point of a Panorama with little substantively new to say was to let audiences compare the respective credibility of Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre as witnesses. He testified in his defence to Newsnight, and now Panorama has put the case for the prosecution. All that can be said with any certainty is that the prince\u2019s toe-curling claim to have been if anything \u201ctoo honourable\u201d in his dealings with Epstein looks worse with every passing day. Where the prince blundered clumsily through his story, Giuffre was fluent and surprisingly composed. But then she must have told this story so many times, to lawyers and journalists and FBI agents: how she was abused from the age of seven, ran away from home, and was just getting her life together with a job at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago beach club when she encountered Maxwell, who suggested she train as a masseuse. Her big mistake, she said bleakly, was to tell Epstein and his girlfriend the story of her damaged childhood: \u201cNow they knew how vulnerable I was.\u201d Panorama spliced her description of dancing with the sweaty prince together with the prince\u2019s wide-eyed claim that it was medically \u201cimpossible for him to sweat\u201d, followed by archive footage of him emerging from nightclubs damp-shirted. Five women have testified in the US that he was present when they gave massages to Epstein, despite the prince\u2019s insistence that he never saw anything untoward. The prosecution rests, your honour. But the whole thing made uncomfortable watching. Why is this happening on TV, not in court? Where is the anonymity granted to victims of alleged sex offences during a British trial, the admittedly meagre dignity afforded by a legal process, the requirement for all sides to testify on oath? Without the media these claims wouldn\u2019t have come to light at all, yet justice should not rely on trafficking victims\u2019 willingness to speak out this publicly to remind us how catastrophically the system has failed. And it is on the courts that the focus must fall. Now that Jeffrey Epstein is dead, there can be no peace for the damaged women he left behind until Ghislaine Maxwell faces their allegations in a court and Prince Andrew testifies under oath. Only then can all those who have suffered in various ways at Epstein\u2019s hands possibly stand a chance of finally breaking free. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

We are going to fill this thing with projects of all kinds. It means a huge number of new jobs and new investment.\u201d</p> <p>The company has made the move to develop its own production base as the UK increasingly faces a squeeze on studio space as TV companies, film studios and the streaming giants pour billions into making content.</p> <p>More than 200 films and 120 high-end TV shows were made in the UK last year, with a total production spend of more than \u00a33bn.</p> <p>Sky spends about \u00a37bn annually on programming, from Premier League rights to buying shows such as Game of Thrones and original productions such as Chernobyl and Fortitude. Sky has said it intends to double the amount it spends on making its own shows to about \u00a31bn a year over the next five years.</p> <p>Sky Studios Elstree will have 14 stages, the smallest of which will be 1,800 sq metres, with enough space to shoot several films and TV shows at the same time. It will be about a third bigger than the plans to build a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/20/and-action-ditched-dagenham-studio-plan-back-on-says-developer\">Hollywood-style studio complex in Dagenham East</a>, which have been delayed after the developer put its plans on hold.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Netflix struck a deal to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/03/netflix-strikes-production-deal-with-shepperton-studios\">set up a permanent production base at Shepperton</a>, home to films including Alien and Mary Poppins Returns. Netflix is spending about $500m (\u00a3385m) on making shows and films in the UK this year.

      "bodyText": "Sky has unveiled plans to build a Hollywood-style film studio in north London, creating more than 2,000 jobs, as the pay-TV company steps up its fight against streaming giants Netflix and Amazon. The 13-hectare (32-acre) studio complex will be built in Elstree, just down the road from Elstree Studios where rival Netflix shoots flagship series The Crown, and will open in early 2022, subject to planning permission. Sky Studios Elstree will become the European production base for Sky and NBCUniversal, which owns The Fast and the Furious maker Universal Studios, as both are owned by the US pay-TV giant Comcast. Sky said the studio complex, which it hopes will also become a base for other companies\u2019 projects, will result in \u00a33bn being spent on TV and film productions in its first five years. \u201cThis was an opportunity to build something brand new, state of the art and at scale,\u201d said the Sky Studios chief executive, Gary Davey. \u201cIt is a big enough site to attract very high-end production in both TV and film from all over the world. We are going to fill this thing with projects of all kinds. It means a huge number of new jobs and new investment.\u201d The company has made the move to develop its own production base as the UK increasingly faces a squeeze on studio space as TV companies, film studios and the streaming giants pour billions into making content. More than 200 films and 120 high-end TV shows were made in the UK last year, with a total production spend of more than \u00a33bn. Sky spends about \u00a37bn annually on programming, from Premier League rights to buying shows such as Game of Thrones and original productions such as Chernobyl and Fortitude. Sky has said it intends to double the amount it spends on making its own shows to about \u00a31bn a year over the next five years. Sky Studios Elstree will have 14 stages, the smallest of which will be 1,800 sq metres, with enough space to shoot several films and TV shows at the same time. It will be about a third bigger than the plans to build a Hollywood-style studio complex in Dagenham East, which have been delayed after the developer put its plans on hold. Earlier this year, Netflix struck a deal to set up a permanent production base at Shepperton, home to films including Alien and Mary Poppins Returns. Netflix is spending about $500m (\u00a3385m) on making shows and films in the UK this year. Disney, which recently launched its Disney+ streaming service in a number of international markets, has secured space at Pinewood Studios, home to Star Wars and James Bond. A report last year from Lambert Smith Hampton, a property firm that specialises in film and TV space, estimates that new production space equivalent to four new Pinewood Studios will be needed in the UK to meet the demand from the film and high-end TV industry over the next 15 years. \u201cThe new studio is a reflection of both the problem and the opportunity in the UK at the moment,\u201d said Jim Reeve, the chief executive of media investment firm Great Point Media. \u201cWe are creatively packed. We don\u2019t have remotely enough quality studio space here to service what the film studios, TV companies and other platforms like the streamers want to make here.\u201d The race to create space is leading to a string of new developments.

The PLP discovered via a series of freedom of information requests that 89.5% of initial EU settlement scheme (EUSS) decisions subject to an \u201cadministrative review\u201d by an EU citizen unhappy with their conclusions were overturned. In just under 60% of total reviews, the Home Office refunded the \u00a380 administration fee. The FoI shows that 451 administrative reviews had been requested up to 12 September this year, less than six months after the scheme was launched. Of the total 325 administrative reviews that had been decided by that date, 291 resulted in a decision of \u201cpre-settled status\u201d being overturned and \u201csettled status\u201d granted.

      "body": "<p>Uh-oh \u2013 Stanley Johnson said the quiet part out loud. During a recent appearance on the BBC, the prime minister\u2019s dad stated explicitly what has always been obvious: the Tory party thinks the British public are a bunch of idiots. Responding to the fact that a viewer had called his son \u201cPinocchio\u201d, Johnson harrumphed: \u201cPinocchio? Pinocchio? That requires a degree of literacy which I think the Great British public doesn\u2019t necessarily have \u2026 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/29/pinocchio-row-stanley-johnson-suggests-uk-public-is-illiterate\" title=\"\">They couldn\u2019t spell Pinocchio if they tried</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson made a massive mistake with those comments. He strayed from the populist playbook. The one that says you must pretend it is the \u201cliberal elite\u201d who look down on ordinary people. The one that says you must pretend entitled toffs and morally bankrupt billionaires champion working people. The one that says you should try to conceal your disgust for the great unwashed if you want to get their vote.</p> <p>But perhaps it was not a big mistake after all. It has been several days since Johnson made those remarks and I am amazed by how little anger there has been about his open contempt for the British people. There has been some outrage, sure, but you could hardly call the episode a national scandal. It is already on its way to being forgotten, written off as the latest example of a Johnson being a bumbling, blue-blooded buffoon. </p> <p>Here is a quick thought experiment: imagine if Donald Trump\u2019s dad (he is still alive in this hypothetical scenario) had gone on a US network and described the US electorate as illiterate idiots. How do you think that would have gone down? I have a feeling that Americans would not have been quite so blase about the whole thing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/trump-mexico-caravan-voter-claims-speech-west-virginia\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s base is fine with Mexicans being called rapists</a>. They are fine with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/12/unkind-divisive-elitist-international-outcry-over-trumps-shithole-countries-remark\" title=\"\">racist comments about \u201cshithole countries\u201d</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/05/donald-trump-pussygate-bully-women\" title=\"\">They</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/05/donald-trump-pussygate-bully-women\" title=\"\"> are fine with gross misogyny</a>. They are fine with demonising certain sections of society. But I reckon this sort of unadulterated derision towards the broader US public may have been a bridge too far. Trump\u2019s popularity is built on the idea that he is the anti-elite, that he is a foil to the sort of politician who sneers at the working class and calls them \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\" title=\"\">deplorables</a>\u201d. If he were to let that mask slip and talk about how stupid he thinks Americans are, how beneath him they are, I have a feeling he would not be quite so popular. He might have a much harder time winning re-election.</p> <p>What is it with the British? Johnson could call the \u201cGreat British public\u201d all manner of names and it would not affect his son\u2019s chance of being re-elected. We are not a nation of shopkeepers; we are a nation of butlers, footmen and lady\u2019s maids. We still show ridiculous reverence towards the monarchy. We still show an embarrassing deference to the aristocrats and Old Etonians who rule over us. That deference is even more embarrassing when you consider how little effort the party of privilege puts into showing respect towards ordinary people. The Conservatives have let the mask slip many times. Remember when Boris Johnson mocked the 16% <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/28/boris-johnson-iq-comments\" title=\"\">\u201cof our species\u201d with an IQ below 85</a>?

      "bodyText": "Uh-oh \u2013 Stanley Johnson said the quiet part out loud. During a recent appearance on the BBC, the prime minister\u2019s dad stated explicitly what has always been obvious: the Tory party thinks the British public are a bunch of idiots. Responding to the fact that a viewer had called his son \u201cPinocchio\u201d, Johnson harrumphed: \u201cPinocchio? Pinocchio? That requires a degree of literacy which I think the Great British public doesn\u2019t necessarily have \u2026 They couldn\u2019t spell Pinocchio if they tried.\u201d Johnson made a massive mistake with those comments. He strayed from the populist playbook. The one that says you must pretend it is the \u201cliberal elite\u201d who look down on ordinary people. The one that says you must pretend entitled toffs and morally bankrupt billionaires champion working people. The one that says you should try to conceal your disgust for the great unwashed if you want to get their vote. But perhaps it was not a big mistake after all. It has been several days since Johnson made those remarks and I am amazed by how little anger there has been about his open contempt for the British people. There has been some outrage, sure, but you could hardly call the episode a national scandal. It is already on its way to being forgotten, written off as the latest example of a Johnson being a bumbling, blue-blooded buffoon. Here is a quick thought experiment: imagine if Donald Trump\u2019s dad (he is still alive in this hypothetical scenario) had gone on a US network and described the US electorate as illiterate idiots. How do you think that would have gone down? I have a feeling that Americans would not have been quite so blase about the whole thing. Trump\u2019s base is fine with Mexicans being called rapists. They are fine with racist comments about \u201cshithole countries\u201d. They are fine with gross misogyny. They are fine with demonising certain sections of society. But I reckon this sort of unadulterated derision towards the broader US public may have been a bridge too far. Trump\u2019s popularity is built on the idea that he is the anti-elite, that he is a foil to the sort of politician who sneers at the working class and calls them \u201cdeplorables\u201d. If he were to let that mask slip and talk about how stupid he thinks Americans are, how beneath him they are, I have a feeling he would not be quite so popular. He might have a much harder time winning re-election. What is it with the British? Johnson could call the \u201cGreat British public\u201d all manner of names and it would not affect his son\u2019s chance of being re-elected. We are not a nation of shopkeepers; we are a nation of butlers, footmen and lady\u2019s maids. We still show ridiculous reverence towards the monarchy. We still show an embarrassing deference to the aristocrats and Old Etonians who rule over us. That deference is even more embarrassing when you consider how little effort the party of privilege puts into showing respect towards ordinary people. The Conservatives have let the mask slip many times. Remember when Boris Johnson mocked the 16% \u201cof our species\u201d with an IQ below 85? When Jacob Rees-Mogg said Grenfell victims lacked \u201ccommon sense\u201d? When the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen backed him up and suggested Rees-Mogg was cleverer than the people who had died in the fire? When Michael Gove said that people who were forced to go to food banks had brought it on themselves because they were not \u201cbest able to manage their finances\u201d? The Conservatives have made it abundantly clear how little respect they have for the British people. On 12 December, let\u2019s make it clear how little respect we have for them. \u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The death of 19-year-old Harry Dunn following a collision involving Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence official who claimed diplomatic immunity and promptly returned to her home country, has placed a renewed focus on the laws protecting foreign diplomats. On Tuesday, the chief constable of Northamptonshire police force where the fatal incident occurred, gave a press conference to provide greater clarity on the circumstances surrounding the teenager\u2019s death. A fuller picture of the timeline of events has become clear. 27 August Sacoolas is believed to have been driving on the wrong side of the road when she hit the teenager riding on his motorbike outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. She cooperates with police at the scene and is breathalysed. However, this first account is not treated as an interview under caution. Officers decide not to arrest her in what the chief constable of Northamptonshire police, Nick Adderley, later says was the right decision. 28 August Officers visit Sacoolas\u2019s address, where she provides an account of events and says she had diplomatic immunity. Northamptonshire police apply for a waiver to render this void. US embassy notifies the FCO that the spouse of a member of staff at RAF Croughton has been involved in an accident. 29 August Specially trained liaison officers are embedded with the Dunn family, including parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, and Northamptonshire police\u2019s investigation continues in the belief they cannot detain Sacoolas. 30 August The US asserts that Sacoolas is covered by diplomatic immunity. 5 September The Foreign Office formally asks the US embassy to waive immunity. 13 September The FCO is informed by the US embassy that it will not waive immunity and she will be leaving the country , unless the UK has strong objections. However, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, immediately objects in \u201cstrong and clear terms\u201d. 15 September Sacoolas leaves the UK on a US Air Force plane. 16 September The FCO approaches the US embassy and is informed Sacoolas has departed. It immediately notifies Northamptonshire police that the waiver has been declined and Sacoolas has left the UK. Officials ask police to delay telling the family by up to two days so it can decide next steps. 18 September Harry Dunn\u2019s funeral takes place at an Oxfordshire crematorium. 23 September The Dunn family inform the liaison officer they have been made aware of a suggestion that Sacoolas has left the UK. Police confirm this is true. 24 September Police had wanted to meet the Dunn family, but the parents were unable to. 26 September Police meet the Dunn family to officially confirm Sacoolas\u2019s departure, and officers go through what they know. 7 October Raab expresses his disappointment at the decision with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. Boris Johnson says: \u201cI do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\u201d 8 October No 10 confirms the prime minister will personally appeal to Donald Trump if the Pompeo does not act to ensure justice is served. US government says Sacoolas\u2019s immunity is \u201cno longer pertinent\u201d, given she has returned to the country. 9 October Johnson raises the case with Trump. 13 October The Dunn family\u2019s lawyer, Mark Stephens, protests that \u201c[Sacoolas] wasn\u2019t entitled to diplomatic immunity in the first place.\u201d 15 October Dunn\u2019s parents visit the White House following an invitation by Trump, and the former reality TV host tells them Sacoolas is waiting for them in an adjoining room and wishes to meet them. 19 October Dunn\u2019s parents say they are \u201cnot impressed\u201d with the US president\u2019s offer, which he delivered unannounced and which they refused to comply with. 21 October Raab tells the Commons he has commissioned a review into immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at RAF Croughton in light of the case. He tells the house: \u201cThe UK government had been notified of the American family\u2019s arrival in the UK in July 2019, and this diplomatic immunity was the result of the arrangements agreed between the UK government and the US government back in 1995. Under those arrangements, US staff at RAF Croughton and their families were accepted as part of the US embassy in the UK. Pursuant to these arrangements, staff and their families were entitled to immunity under the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. Under the exchange of notes in relation to the Croughton annexe, these arrangements waived immunity for employees, but the waiver did not cover spouses.\u201d 22 October In a press conference, Adderley reveals that Sacoolas, without naming her, has requested for officers from the force to personally interview her under caution in the US. Adderley confirms the Crown Prosecution Service will decide whether it will seek to bring charges, potentially death by dangerous driving, which could trigger an extradition request. However, they can do so only after they have received the suspect\u2019s account. 25 November Harry Dunn\u2019s father confronts the foreign secretary in his constituency, where he encourages people to vote Raab out. Video footage of the encounter emerges showing Dunn politely approaching Raab as he arrives for the hustings. The politician claimed he was happy to meet but then dismissed Dunn, adding: \u201cNot right in front of the cameras, it\u2019s not on.\u201d 28 November Dunn\u2019s family launch legal action against the Foreign Office which they said could cost them \u201cupwards of \u00a350,000\u201d. The judicial review is actioned against Raab, following a long-running dispute over the extension of diplomatic immunity to intelligence staff and their families at RAF Croughton. 3 December Tim Dunn issues a stinging attack on Raab, accusing the foreign secretary of \u201cempty words\u201d and only meeting the family as a publicity stunt. \u201cWe think politicians should be honest and decent, and we feel Mr Raab is neither of those,\u201d he writes.",

It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve been booed off stage \u2026 I consider it, the life of being a comedian \u2013 they have a right to boo me.\u201d He added that he was doing fine; he had not been hit with bread. \u201cTo clarify, one bread roll was thrown. I want to put that on the record. Definitively, I was not pelted with bread.\u201d A spokesperson for Lord\u2019s Taverners said the charity is not a political organisation and does not endorse the views of its guest speakers. They added: \u201cHowever, nor do we endorse the reaction of a minority of audience members at yesterday\u2019s event. Nish Kumar\u2019s attendance was arranged in good faith and he gave his time for free to support the charity and our work. He follows a long tradition of comedic special guests at the event.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Germany\u2019s chief public prosecutor suspects Russian intelligence agencies to be behind the killing of a former Chechen insurgent in Berlin and plans to take over investigations into the case, various German media outlets have reported. Coming three months after Georgian citizen Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot in broad daylight in a Berlin park, such a move would amount to the German state officially accusing the Kremlin of carrying out a political assassination on German soil and likely lead to a similar diplomatic fall-out as over the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the UK in March 2018. According to a report by Der Spiegel on Tuesday, Germany\u2019s highest general prosecutor in Karlsruhe decided to take on the case after forensics experts identified the assassin as the same person, Vadim Krasikov, who was sought over the murder of a Russian businessman in 2013. The Kremlin has until now categorically denied its involvement in the murder, and some German officials initially mooted the Moscow link could be a red herring planted to sow discord between Russia and Europe. But the Russian government\u2019s unwillingness to illuminate the case raised suspicions. The assassin who shot 40-year-old Khangoshvili in the Kleiner Tiergarten park on 23 August was arrested by police while trying to dispose of the presumptive murder weapon into a canal, but has refused to cooperate during questionings. The hitman had travelled to Germany on a Russian passport issued in the name of Vadim Sokolov, but experts have questioned the authenticity of the document. As with the murder of Khangoshvili, the 2013 victim was shot by a man who approached him on a bicycle. Moscow issued an international arrest warrant for Krasikov in 2014 only to silently withdraw it a year later. According to research by investigative outfit Bellingcat, Krasikov\u2019s records were also later purged from Russian state databases. Khangoshvili, an ethnic Chechen from Georgia\u2019s Pankisi Gorge, was part of the separatist insurgency against Russian forces in Chechnya, and the killing fits a pattern of hits on former Chechen insurgents in several cities which have often had signs of Russian state involvement.",

And you want to stay there with them, with their memory. Grief is the process of reluctantly making your way back.\u201d In the years following, my own experiences of loss proved her words to be true. When all you want to do is sit quietly with someone\u2019s memory, even other people\u2019s voices are the most jarring intrusion.</p> <p>But what the families of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/01/second-london-bridge-victim-cambridge-university-student\" title=\"\">Saskia Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/01/london-bridge-attack-victim-jack-merritt-tributes\" title=\"\">Jack Merritt</a>, the two named victims of Friday\u2019s terror attack in London Bridge, are going through is almost beyond comprehension. Compounding the terrible experience of bereavement is the horror of loss being turned into a public commodity. While it was always somewhat inevitable that a terrorist attack during a general election campaign would be wielded for grubby political gain, it doesn\u2019t make it any less nauseating. Perhaps most tasteless of all is the Times reducing the theft of two young lives to a set of <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/london-bridge-attack-may-swing-election-cnb635gcm\" title=\"\">polling projections</a>: as though such fathomless loss can or should be understood through the lens of a 3% swing in key marginal seats. Looking at some of the coverage, I can\u2019t help but wonder if years of covering the grotesque chicanery of Westminster politics has desensitised journalists in the same way as watching nothing but horror films might.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In-prison rehabilitation activities, of the kind Merritt and Jones dedicated their lives to, have been cut to the bone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But it is striking that Dave Merritt\u2019s condemnations of those using his son\u2019s death as a means to further their own \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/02/jack-merritt-london-bridge-attack-dave-merritt?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\" title=\"\">agenda of hate</a>\u201d has been reported by journalists as a generalised plea <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1201393318258708481\" title=\"\">not to \u201cpoliticise\u201d the tragedy</a>. Saskia Jones was a champion for victims of the criminal justice system. Jack Merritt was a staunch advocate of human rights and prisoner rehabilitation. His Twitter feed reveals an extraordinarily compassionate young man, dedicated to the principle of transformative justice. He was a long-time critic of toughening up prison stretches as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackmerrittJack/status/981151669479202816\" title=\"\">means of retribution</a>. The \u201chang \u2018em flog \u2018em\u201d brigade would do well to remember that Merritt and Jones\u2019s work with the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50623646\" title=\"\">Learning Together scheme</a> treated prisoners like humans.</p> <p>Now, the Conservatives and their favoured newspapers oscillate between blaming Labour for terrorist attacks which have taken place under Tory rule, and putting the wheels in motion to impose harsher sentencing for <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/andrew-castle/london-bridge-security-minister-review-sentences/\" title=\"\">violent offenders</a>.

      "bodyText": "A while after her father died, my best friend said something that has stuck with me ever since. \u201cWhen you lose someone you love, you leave the land of the living. And you want to stay there with them, with their memory. Grief is the process of reluctantly making your way back.\u201d In the years following, my own experiences of loss proved her words to be true. When all you want to do is sit quietly with someone\u2019s memory, even other people\u2019s voices are the most jarring intrusion. But what the families of Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt, the two named victims of Friday\u2019s terror attack in London Bridge, are going through is almost beyond comprehension. Compounding the terrible experience of bereavement is the horror of loss being turned into a public commodity. While it was always somewhat inevitable that a terrorist attack during a general election campaign would be wielded for grubby political gain, it doesn\u2019t make it any less nauseating. Perhaps most tasteless of all is the Times reducing the theft of two young lives to a set of polling projections: as though such fathomless loss can or should be understood through the lens of a 3% swing in key marginal seats. Looking at some of the coverage, I can\u2019t help but wonder if years of covering the grotesque chicanery of Westminster politics has desensitised journalists in the same way as watching nothing but horror films might. But it is striking that Dave Merritt\u2019s condemnations of those using his son\u2019s death as a means to further their own \u201cagenda of hate\u201d has been reported by journalists as a generalised plea not to \u201cpoliticise\u201d the tragedy. Saskia Jones was a champion for victims of the criminal justice system. Jack Merritt was a staunch advocate of human rights and prisoner rehabilitation. His Twitter feed reveals an extraordinarily compassionate young man, dedicated to the principle of transformative justice. He was a long-time critic of toughening up prison stretches as a means of retribution. The \u201chang \u2018em flog \u2018em\u201d brigade would do well to remember that Merritt and Jones\u2019s work with the Learning Together scheme treated prisoners like humans. Now, the Conservatives and their favoured newspapers oscillate between blaming Labour for terrorist attacks which have taken place under Tory rule, and putting the wheels in motion to impose harsher sentencing for violent offenders. To insist that this tragedy not be \u201cpoliticised\u201d by anyone is to rob those closest to Friday\u2019s victims of the right to defend their loved one\u2019s most deeply held values and beliefs. There is a difference between saying that it is disgusting to use the memory of a criminal justice reformer as a wedge for draconian legislation, and Boris Johnson\u2019s slippery evasion of accountability on Sunday\u2019s edition of The Andrew Marr Show. The Ministry of Justice has endured the deepest cuts of any Whitehall department. After nine years of Conservative rule, funding has been slashed by 27%, and 300 magistrates and crown courts have closed in the last decade. The catastrophic part-privatisation of probation services (led by Chris Grayling, and reversed by Rory Stewart) included an attempt by Sodexo to replace 700 probation officers with check-in machines to monitor ex-inmates. Cuts to the prisons budget in England and Wales have led to dangerous rates of overcrowding, increased prisoner suicides and a record number of prisoner assaults. In-prison rehabilitation activities, of the kind Merritt and Jones dedicated their lives to, have been cut to the bone. With little focus on how to fund and support prisoner\u2019s reintegration into society, it should come as no surprise that the UK has a reoffending rate of 46% after one year among adult prisoners.

      "bodyText": "Channel 4 has been cleared of bias by the media regulator after replacing Boris Johnson with a melting block of ice during last week\u2019s leadership debate on the climate crisis. The Conservatives had complained to Ofcom that last week\u2019s broadcast broke strict broadcasting impartiality rules after Channel 4 News refused to accept the former environment secretary Michael Gove as a stand-in for the prime minister in the seven-way debate. Gove then attempted to argue his way on to the programme, in a move that largely overshadowed the actual substance of the debate about the future of the planet. Johnson\u2019s head of communications complained to Ofcom about the decision to exclude Gove and alleged a widespread pattern of anti-Tory bias at the channel, referencing the head of news Dorothy Byrne\u2019s criticisms of the prime minister. Conservative party sources also threatened a review of Channel 4\u2019s public service remit in the next parliament as retaliation. Ofcom ruled that it was perfectly fair to insist only Johnson could represent the Conservatives given \u201cother participants had only agreed to attend on the basis that they would be debating against other leaders\u201d. They also concluded the decision to replace Johnson \u2013 and the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage \u2013 with an ice sculpture did not breach due impartiality rules. Ofcom concluded this was a \u201crelatively low-key\u201d way of empty-chairing the politicians \u2013 hinting it could have taken a different view if, as had been suggested in advance, the ice sculptures had been carved in the shape of the politicians. Ofcom \u201ctook into account that the globe ice sculpture was not a representation of the prime minister personally, and little editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants\u201d. The regulator made clear there was no obligation for any of the political parties or politicians to participate in any particular programme \u2013 and broadcasters could empty-chair politicians as long as they found other ways to ensure standards of due impartiality were met. The regulator concluded that Channel 4 had fulfilled its obligation to represent Conservative viewpoints during the programme itself, and through a subsequent report on the following evening\u2019s Channel 4 News. Ofcom\u2019s rules on due impartiality require coverage of alternative views that is \u201cadequate or appropriate to the subject and nature of the programme\u201d, rather than providing equal airtime to all sides of a debate. Documents provided to Ofcom by Channel 4 show that the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, also tried to send a deputy because of her commitment to appearing at first minister\u2019s questions in Edinburgh on the same day, but was told that this would not be possible. Instead she dashed to the train from Holyrood and made it to the London studio just in time for the 7pm broadcast.",

      "body": "<p>In January 2017 a meeting took place in a deserted building in Foggy Bottom. It was conspiratorial. The office in downtown Washington belonged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/22/donald-trump-links-to-russia-steele-dossier-uk-book-claims\" title=\"\">David Kramer</a>, long time aide to the Republican senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/18/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-iowa-republicans\" title=\"\">John McCain</a>. His furtive guest was Ken Bensinger, a reporter for BuzzFeed. Kramer had brought with him a series of confidential memos. They concerned Donald Trump, the man who was about to be sworn in as US president, and his murky ties with Russia. Kramer laid them out on the table. In delicate fashion, he then excused himself and said he had to make a phone call and pay a visit to the bathroom.</p> <p>Bensinger whipped out his iPhone. He photographed the papers, one by one. Kramer came back half an hour later. Kramer had served as a US assistant secretary of state under George W Bush and was deeply appalled at the prospect of a Trump presidency. For good measure, he shared the memos with other news organisations and Obama officials.</p> <p>Kramer\u2019s thinly deniable leak ignited a scandal that would consume Washington life for three long years. The memos didn\u2019t quite ease Trump from power. But they did shed light on one of the biggest and longest-running mysteries in 21st-century politics: why is Trump so fulsome and such a suck up when it comes to Vladimir Putin, a KGB guy not over-blessed with charm? The author of the Foggy Bottom dossier was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/01/trump-russia-dossier-author-gave-evidence-to-uk-intrusion-inquiry\" title=\"\">Christopher Steele</a>, a former MI6 officer who spent a career digging up Russia\u2019s dark secrets. His memos alleged that the Kremlin had been sup-porting and cultivating Trump for at least five years. And that in best KGB tradition it had acquired a sizeable amount of Trump <em>kompromat</em>, which could be deployed for blackmail purposes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f881ee67150f40a81cb533d893b9c5501ac578d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f881ee67150f40a81cb533d893b9c5501ac578d0/0_132_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The lobby of the Ritz Carlton hotel in Moscow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lobby of the Ritz Carlton hotel in Moscow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steele knew Russia well.

Still, Simpson and Fritsch were stunned. After reading the report, Fritsch exclaimed: \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Simpson said: \u201cI know.\u201d Steele assured them the memo was credible.

Report offers blueprint to Trump\u2019s congressional defenders Republicans have released a 123-page draft report on last month\u2019s impeachment hearings. Defending the president over his dealings with Ukraine, it describes his actions as \u201centirely prudent\u201d and involving \u201cno quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, or abuse of power\u201d. The document is designed to act as both a pre-emptive strike against a Democratic report and as a blueprint for Trump\u2019s GOP defenders at future impeachment hearings and prospective Senate trial. Giuliani associates. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the two Ukraine-linked associates of Rudy Giuliani accused of using foreign money to make illegal campaign contributions, are very likely to face upgraded indictments at their trial, a prosecutor has said. Bloomberg news. The Trump 2020 campaign plans to deny press credentials to the outlet owned by the Trump critic and Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg. Trump\u2019s re-election could doom Nato alliance, members fear Trump has arrived in London with other Nato leaders for a summit to mark the 70th anniversary of the transatlantic military alliance, of which he remains a noted skeptic. He has already lashed out at his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, and denied he wanted the UK\u2019s health service to be part of a trade deal. Other Nato members reportedly fear his re-election in 2020 would cast serious doubt on the future of the organisation. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is trying to play down his ties to Trump during the president\u2019s British sojourn, apparently fearful that their closeness could damage his standing during an increasingly tight UK general election campaign. Harry Dunn. The family of the young motorcyclist killed in a traffic collision with a US diplomat\u2019s wife, who later claimed immunity and left the country, say they plan to \u201cmake our feelings known\u201d to Trump during his visit to the UK. Climate commitment. Appearing at the UN\u2019s COP25 summit in Madrid, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has said Congress intends to honour its climate commitments, even if the White House does not. Prince Andrew accuser pleads for support from UK public Virginia Giuffre, the woman who claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions when she was 17, has asked for the support of the British public in her first UK television interview. Giuffre told the BBC she was instructed to have sex with Andrew by the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a close friend of Epstein\u2019s, who had introduced the late financier and sex offender to the prince. Royal retreat. Prince Andrew has stepped back from all public duties over the controversy around his friendship with Epstein, though he continues to categorically deny all the allegations against him.

He said: \u201cI think the chief rabbi\u2019s comments really ought to be taken for what they are. He hasn\u2019t contacted me. I\u2019m very happy to meet him. Very happy to talk to him.\u201d Asked if \u201csorry was the hardest word for him to say\u201d by presenter Holly Willoughby, he replied: \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Corbyn has previously apologised for the hurt caused to the Jewish community in a social media video released in the summer of 2018.",

Analysts fear that Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia could be drawn into conflict if the dispute is not resolved before the $5bn dam begins operating next year. Officials from the US and the World Bank have joined ministers from the three countries for the two-day meeting amid escalating tensions over the dam \u2013 most notably the timetable for filling up a reservoir bigger than greater London. Egypt and Sudan have been concerned about the risks to their own water supplies since 2011, when Ethiopia began construction on the Blue Nile, one of two major Nile tributaries that rise in the Ethiopian Highlands. The Blue Nile joins the White Nile just north of Sudan\u2019s capital Khartoum, contributing about 85% of water to the main river that flows to Egypt and out into the Mediterranean. Nearly 90% of Egypt\u2019s fresh water comes from the Nile and the country\u2019s own mega-dam, the Aswan, is also on the river.

      "bodyText": "Blue Story, the debut film by Rapman that became embroiled in a race row, has made one of the best box-office starts of any British film this year, despite being banned from more than 100 cinemas after a mass brawl in Birmingham. The London-set gang drama recorded the sixth best opening of any British film during 2019, with box-office takings of \u00a32.9m across two weekends, according to figures from ComScore, despite being pulled from more than 100 cinemas after Vue and Showcase said there had been several \u201csignificant incidents\u201d at screenings. The film debuted on 22 November, accumulating \u00a31.3m on its opening weekend, which Screen Daily called an excellent result for a debut feature director with a largely unknown cast. it played in 310 locations, grossing \u00a34,194 per location. The impressive box-office performance comes after it was removed from Showcase and Vue cinemas on 25 November. Vue is the third biggest cinema chain in the UK with 855 screens \u2013 only Odeon (890) and Cineworld (1,038) are bigger \u2013 while Showcase\u2019s sites have 268 screens, according to figures from the UK Cinema Association. Vue withdrew the film from 91 cinemas nationwide, while Showcase removed it from its 21 locations, with both chains reinstating the film less than a week later after sustained criticism, including that the decision was rooted in racism. Dr Clive Nwonka, LSE Fellow in film studies and author of the forthcoming book Black Boys: the Aesthetics of British Urban Cinema, told the Guardian the decision to pull the film was a \u201cknee-jerk\u201d reaction and would help it gain a far bigger audience. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic moral panic,\u201d he said. \u201cStuart Hall predicted it with mugging in the 70s \u2013 there\u2019s hysteria around young black people and that eventually provokes an overreaction like this.\u201d Vue initially pulled Blue Story from its locations after a mass brawl in the foyer area of the Star City cinema in Birmingham, in which seven police officers were injured amid reports of people brandishing machetes. Showcase refused to show the film in the UK before performing a U-turn 24 hours later, saying it would show Blue Story \u201csupported with increased security protocols\u201d. Vue said it would reinstate the film on Wednesday 27 November, after days of sustained criticism, including an interview with Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, who told BBC Breakfast he believed there were \u201chidden reasons\u201d behind the decision to remove it from screens. Onwubolu also said Vue\u2019s claims there were 25 \u201csignificant incidents\u201d at 16 cinemas lacked credibility because no video evidence had been provided.

      "body": "<p>In 1980, women artists represented Austria at the Venice Biennale for the first time. One was the 60-year-old painter Maria Lassnig; the other was 39-year-old firebrand Valie Export, notorious for plastering Vienna with provocative posters in which her exposed crotch played a central role.</p> <p>Export was a controversial choice for Austria, to say the least. As the organisers stated in the catalogue, back home she was \u201cexposed to continuous obstruction and defamation\u201d. Fearing uproar at the opening, they scheduled two press conferences on consecutive days in the hope of mitigating full-scale outrage. The first was a small gathering of sympathetic press. The second was everyone else and, as expected, they kicked up a storm. Export became a lightning rod of outrage, accused of everything from killing animals to being \u2013 God forbid \u2013 a feminist.</p> <p>Dressed all in white, her hair the copper of exposed wiring,Valie Export (or VALIE EXPORT as it\u2019s often styled) is now, at 79, a revered figure. Why did her work stir up such fury back then?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccc1b272198bd98e6d173564abee01a0b3144285\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccc1b272198bd98e6d173564abee01a0b3144285/0_231_5254_3153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everyday oppression \u2026 Gerburtenbett (Birth bed), the centrepiece of Export\u2019s Biennale exhibition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everyday oppression \u2026 Gerburtenbett (Birth Bed), the centrepiece of Export\u2019s Biennale exhibition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Austrian scene was very traditional, and they didn\u2019t know about conceptual art,\u201d she says. \u201cThe second thing was that I am a woman.\u201d</p> <p>The Viennese underground scene of the 60s and 70s was dominated by the actionists: transgressive and, at times, violent performance artists. They may have been artistically avant garde, but their attitudes toward women and the female body remained old-fashioned.</p> <p>Export took the energy, aggression and provocation harnesses by the actionists and turned them to very different ends, raising questions about how women were portrayed in film, how their bodies were sexualised, and the everyday oppression they faced at the hands of the state, society and the Catholic church. As a result, even within the avant garde, Export was regarded with suspicion. The attitude was: \u201cShe\u2019s a woman, and she\u2019s against us, fighting for feminism.\u201d</p> <p>At the Thaddaeus Ropac gallery in London, Export\u2019s 1980 Biennale exhibition has just been restaged in its entirety. The centrepiece is Geburtenbett<em> </em>(Birth bed, 1980) a raised resin platform set with mattress springs from which an outsized female abdomen erupts, legs crooked, with red neon strip lights springing from her vagina like fresh blood. Perched where her head might be, a black and white TV transmits a Catholic mass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"acc5476a36207b4c5f6308d70d63d987f26d88ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acc5476a36207b4c5f6308d70d63d987f26d88ea/0_0_1679_2394/701.jpg\" alt=\"Devout \u2026 Export\u2019s version of a Michelangelo Pi\u00e8ta.\" width=\"701\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Devout \u2026 Export\u2019s version of a Michelangelo Pi\u00e8ta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Galerie Thaddeus Ropac</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lining the walls are photographs, among them religious tableaux restaged with domestic appliances, which were portrayed in advertising of the time as women\u2019s salvation. One is a version of a Michelangelo Pi\u00e8ta in which a young woman appears devoutly perched on a washing machine as it belches out a blood-stained towel.</p> <p>Born Waltraud Lehner in Linz in 1940, she rebranded herself Valie Export \u2013 a name inspired by Export brand cigarettes \u2013 in 1967. In a self-portrait a year later, she appears hand on jaunty hip, cigarette between pursed lips, holding out a soft pack carrying her face and logo. It\u2019s irresistibly cool, delivered with a knowing smile \u2013 two qualities that are Export\u2019s stock in trade. Both were crucial elements in the two works that made her name. TAP and TOUCH Cinema and Action Pants: Genital Panic (both 1968-69) are both forms of what Export terms \u201cexpanded cinema\u201d. In the first, the \u201ccinema\u201d is a small box strapped to her naked chest, which in turn becomes the screen. The cinema is so small that only one pair of hands may enter and encounter the screen. In Genital Panic, the action enters the space of the audience in a real cinema.

Her father died during the war, and she was sent with her two sisters to board at a convent while their mother worked as a primary school teacher.

They were nuns, my mother was a war widow bringing up her children alone, so of course they were obliged to take me back.\u201d The pattern repeated itself many times.</p> <p>Despite this, Export is philosophical about convent life. \u201cI learned a lot. I learned that I needed my own territory, my own space, and I had to defend it if I wanted to become strong,\u201d she recalls. \u201cOtherwise, it was like any convent \u2013 strict discipline.\u201d She left at 14 to study at the School of Arts and Crafts in Linz, and, at the age of 18, she got married.

      "bodyText": "In 1980, women artists represented Austria at the Venice Biennale for the first time. One was the 60-year-old painter Maria Lassnig; the other was 39-year-old firebrand Valie Export, notorious for plastering Vienna with provocative posters in which her exposed crotch played a central role. Export was a controversial choice for Austria, to say the least. As the organisers stated in the catalogue, back home she was \u201cexposed to continuous obstruction and defamation\u201d. Fearing uproar at the opening, they scheduled two press conferences on consecutive days in the hope of mitigating full-scale outrage. The first was a small gathering of sympathetic press. The second was everyone else and, as expected, they kicked up a storm. Export became a lightning rod of outrage, accused of everything from killing animals to being \u2013 God forbid \u2013 a feminist. Dressed all in white, her hair the copper of exposed wiring,Valie Export (or VALIE EXPORT as it\u2019s often styled) is now, at 79, a revered figure. Why did her work stir up such fury back then? \u201cThe Austrian scene was very traditional, and they didn\u2019t know about conceptual art,\u201d she says. \u201cThe second thing was that I am a woman.\u201d The Viennese underground scene of the 60s and 70s was dominated by the actionists: transgressive and, at times, violent performance artists. They may have been artistically avant garde, but their attitudes toward women and the female body remained old-fashioned. Export took the energy, aggression and provocation harnesses by the actionists and turned them to very different ends, raising questions about how women were portrayed in film, how their bodies were sexualised, and the everyday oppression they faced at the hands of the state, society and the Catholic church. As a result, even within the avant garde, Export was regarded with suspicion. The attitude was: \u201cShe\u2019s a woman, and she\u2019s against us, fighting for feminism.\u201d At the Thaddaeus Ropac gallery in London, Export\u2019s 1980 Biennale exhibition has just been restaged in its entirety. The centrepiece is Geburtenbett (Birth bed, 1980) a raised resin platform set with mattress springs from which an outsized female abdomen erupts, legs crooked, with red neon strip lights springing from her vagina like fresh blood. Perched where her head might be, a black and white TV transmits a Catholic mass. Lining the walls are photographs, among them religious tableaux restaged with domestic appliances, which were portrayed in advertising of the time as women\u2019s salvation. One is a version of a Michelangelo Pi\u00e8ta in which a young woman appears devoutly perched on a washing machine as it belches out a blood-stained towel. Born Waltraud Lehner in Linz in 1940, she rebranded herself Valie Export \u2013 a name inspired by Export brand cigarettes \u2013 in 1967. In a self-portrait a year later, she appears hand on jaunty hip, cigarette between pursed lips, holding out a soft pack carrying her face and logo. It\u2019s irresistibly cool, delivered with a knowing smile \u2013 two qualities that are Export\u2019s stock in trade. Both were crucial elements in the two works that made her name. TAP and TOUCH Cinema and Action Pants: Genital Panic (both 1968-69) are both forms of what Export terms \u201cexpanded cinema\u201d. In the first, the \u201ccinema\u201d is a small box strapped to her naked chest, which in turn becomes the screen. The cinema is so small that only one pair of hands may enter and encounter the screen. In Genital Panic, the action enters the space of the audience in a real cinema. Export arrived at a screening in trousers with a triangle cut out of the crotch and started perambulating the rows with her exposed pubis at face level, causing a \u201cgenital panic\u201d within the audience, who scuttled for the exit as she approached. Even as a child, Export had no regard for prim niceties. Her father died during the war, and she was sent with her two sisters to board at a convent while their mother worked as a primary school teacher. The nuns\u2019 private world fascinated Export, and her first expulsion came when, aged 10, she snuck into their living quarters. \u201cI had to tell my mother that they\u2019d thrown me out. She slapped my face then took me back to the school. They were nuns, my mother was a war widow bringing up her children alone, so of course they were obliged to take me back.\u201d The pattern repeated itself many times. Despite this, Export is philosophical about convent life. \u201cI learned a lot. I learned that I needed my own territory, my own space, and I had to defend it if I wanted to become strong,\u201d she recalls. \u201cOtherwise, it was like any convent \u2013 strict discipline.\u201d She left at 14 to study at the School of Arts and Crafts in Linz, and, at the age of 18, she got married. Within a year she had a daughter, but the vision of adult independence offered by matrimony turned out to be another trap. \u201cI thought: this is not my life, being married and a mother.\u201d So she divorced, placed her daughter temporarily in her sister\u2019s care and moved to Vienna to study.

Her evident sexual experience \u2013 and by extension, availability \u2013 marked her out as a threat. The legend surrounding Exports Genital Panic had it that the performance took place in a porn cinema, with an audience of men; in fact, it was at an arthouse screening. Export\u2019s intended audience was male and female: her target, conservative Viennese society as a whole. \u201cMarriage, the Christian church, religious themes and the traditional side of Vienna at the time \u2013 this fossilised Nazi realm, really \u2013 all this influenced the work I wanted to do,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to draw, I didn\u2019t want to paint.\u201d Instead, she wanted to determine a space for herself, just as she had at the convent.

      "body": "<p>The bat looks at you with bright black eyes, shining with intelligence. The artist has turned this natural study into a portrait, giving what was surely a dead specimen a personality and inner life that would be captivating in a human subject, let alone a fruit bat. It is an artistic masterpiece that raises scientific illustration to strange heights of poetry.</p> <p>The picture was painted by either the Hindu painter Bhawani Das, or one of his close circle, somewhere between 1777 and 1782. Yet for centuries images like this have been simply styled \u201ccompany art\u201d and credited not to their Indian creators, but the East India Company officials who commissioned them. The Wallace Collection\u2019s exhibition of these images of wonder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/04/east-india-company-original-corporate-raiders\">co-curated by historian William Dalrymple</a>, rights an injustice and restores the true authorship of some of the greatest natural history artworks of all time.</p> <p>As recently as 2013, the Natural History Museum published an illustrated volume called The Art of India, whose depictions of monkeys and snakes are captioned just according to the collections they come from \u2013 with the artist, the individual creator, rarely named. How did this bizarre disdain for some of the finest observers of nature who ever lived become normal? The answer lies in the long and snaky history of the British empire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f02d20de6f44d7b1070bcf5965274ba3cfd688de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f02d20de6f44d7b1070bcf5965274ba3cfd688de/0_0_4239_3005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malabar Squirrel, by  Shaikh Zain Ud-Din\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malabar Squirrel, by Shaikh Zain ud-Din.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Out of the undergrowth scuttles a pangolin covered with hard scaly armour, painted with such soft, subtle colours that its white claws look like vegetable roots. It was portrayed in 1779 by Shaikh Zain ud-Din. He and Bhawani Das made their entrancing pictures for an album of natural history illustrations commissioned by Lady Mary Impey. British power over India was growing not through direct state control, but the commercial ambitions of the East India Company. For all their corruption, greed and arrogance, some East India Company officials were genuinely interested in the place they were milking. This was the Enlightenment, when James Cook was bringing a kangaroo specimen (or what was left after it was eaten) back to Britain for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/10/george-stubbs-review-mk-gallery-milton-keynes\">the animal artist George Stubbs</a> to paint. In that same spirit of scientific curiosity Lady Impey and her husband, Chief Justice Sir Elijah Impey, commissioned local artists to create their ravishing nature album. They were typical of a generation of early imperialists who had not yet learned total contempt for the people around them.</p> <p>At the start of the show we see one of the artists the East India Company employed as he saw himself. Yellapah of Vellore portrays himself sitting on the floor at a low desk, looking up from his work on a finely detailed illustration, with his thin, delicate brush in his right hand. It\u2019s not so very different from a portrait of a scribe at the Ottoman court that was painted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2010/dec/16/giovanni-bellini-leonardo-da-vinci\">Gentile Bellini</a> in the 15th century. For the artists the company elite hired to depict fruit bats and cobra lilies were heirs to an artistic tradition of precise, almost microscopic observation that ultimately went back to medieval Iraq and Iran. This miniaturist art was brought to India by the Mughal empire, and it was their training that enabled these artists to adapt brilliantly to the requirements of science-obsessed English aristocrats. Even the idea of assembling watercolour pictures in albums is a Mughal convention \u2013 although it got a new look from the modern paper the British insisted on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43e1a5677e7aa9ba5a0ca9bcf04d291e3ae2ca6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43e1a5677e7aa9ba5a0ca9bcf04d291e3ae2ca6d/0_0_9852_7152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brahminy Starling with Two Anteraea Moths, Caterpillar and Cocoon in Indian Jujube Tree, by Shaikh Zain ud-Din, 1780\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brahminy Starling with Two Anteraea Moths, Caterpillar and Cocoon in Indian Jujube Tree, by Shaikh Zain ud-Din, 1780, from the Impey album.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Walbridge/Minneapolis Institute of Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The results are sensational. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t really matter, more than 200 years on, if we remembered or didn\u2019t remember artists whose works were ordinary or minor. But genius deserves a name. Shaikh Zain ud-Din is at least the equal of his English contemporary Stubbs. His depiction of a cheetah for the Impey album is a tender gold cloud of fur with spots that seem to float in its lithe mist. You can almost see its heart beat. This intimate encounter with a swift ghost of the forest makes Stubbs\u2019s painting of the first cheetah brought to <a href=\"https://www.artfund.org/supporting-museums/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/3911/cheetah-and-stag-with-two-indians\">Britain look cold and hard</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s that insight into the being of nature that makes these artists so arresting. They go beyond all anthropomorphism in their appetite for wondrous life. A painter whose name has not yet been found portrays a river fish from Bengal as a pewter-coloured, leaf-shaped ovoid with its eyes and mouth twisted around its flattened form. It\u2019s not like us, but it is as interesting as us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2b49d64b4b095e690651b8c0d90c18d65e61909\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2b49d64b4b095e690651b8c0d90c18d65e61909/0_0_5146_5826/883.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of John Wombwell smoking a hookah.\" width=\"883\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portrait of John Wombwell smoking a hookah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fondation Custodia, Collection Frits Lugt, Paris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The East India Company also commissioned India\u2019s artists to depict soldiers and beggars, markets and rituals. In these social records, the tensions of history are hard to ignore \u2013 are they sympathetic studies or imperial objectifications of \u201cIndia\u201d? But Yellapah of Vellore turns his brush on the people who hired him, portraying a pasty-faced red-jacketed British officer lazing, a bit glumly, in the comfy box of a palanquin as he\u2019s carried by six \u201cnatives\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/04/east-india-company-original-corporate-raiders\">The East India Company: The original corporate raiders | William Dalrymple</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are dazzling depictions of architecture, including a sublime portrait of the Taj Mahal. Here you see two artistic cultures collide as European perspective mixes with an Indian appetite for all-over surface detail that creates almost surreal effects. Strangest of all is a painting by a still-nameless artist of a village called Rania. The villagers vividly populate a scene of rounded, organic buildings and knobbly, serpentine trees. Nothing is straight, nothing is rigid. It could be an early painting by Mir\u00f3, a desert scene by O\u2019Keeffe.</p> <p>This exhibition unveils an entire new artistic world that\u2019s been forgotten and misunderstood for centuries. It promises great things for the Wallace Collection\u2019s new approach as a gallery that, in a reverse of its former rules, can now lend, and therefore borrow, masterpieces. How great to start by rescuing India\u2019s neglected artists from being forgotten.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The bat looks at you with bright black eyes, shining with intelligence. The artist has turned this natural study into a portrait, giving what was surely a dead specimen a personality and inner life that would be captivating in a human subject, let alone a fruit bat. It is an artistic masterpiece that raises scientific illustration to strange heights of poetry. The picture was painted by either the Hindu painter Bhawani Das, or one of his close circle, somewhere between 1777 and 1782. Yet for centuries images like this have been simply styled \u201ccompany art\u201d and credited not to their Indian creators, but the East India Company officials who commissioned them. The Wallace Collection\u2019s exhibition of these images of wonder, co-curated by historian William Dalrymple, rights an injustice and restores the true authorship of some of the greatest natural history artworks of all time. As recently as 2013, the Natural History Museum published an illustrated volume called The Art of India, whose depictions of monkeys and snakes are captioned just according to the collections they come from \u2013 with the artist, the individual creator, rarely named. How did this bizarre disdain for some of the finest observers of nature who ever lived become normal? The answer lies in the long and snaky history of the British empire. Out of the undergrowth scuttles a pangolin covered with hard scaly armour, painted with such soft, subtle colours that its white claws look like vegetable roots. It was portrayed in 1779 by Shaikh Zain ud-Din. He and Bhawani Das made their entrancing pictures for an album of natural history illustrations commissioned by Lady Mary Impey. British power over India was growing not through direct state control, but the commercial ambitions of the East India Company. For all their corruption, greed and arrogance, some East India Company officials were genuinely interested in the place they were milking. This was the Enlightenment, when James Cook was bringing a kangaroo specimen (or what was left after it was eaten) back to Britain for the animal artist George Stubbs to paint. In that same spirit of scientific curiosity Lady Impey and her husband, Chief Justice Sir Elijah Impey, commissioned local artists to create their ravishing nature album. They were typical of a generation of early imperialists who had not yet learned total contempt for the people around them. At the start of the show we see one of the artists the East India Company employed as he saw himself. Yellapah of Vellore portrays himself sitting on the floor at a low desk, looking up from his work on a finely detailed illustration, with his thin, delicate brush in his right hand. It\u2019s not so very different from a portrait of a scribe at the Ottoman court that was painted by Gentile Bellini in the 15th century. For the artists the company elite hired to depict fruit bats and cobra lilies were heirs to an artistic tradition of precise, almost microscopic observation that ultimately went back to medieval Iraq and Iran. This miniaturist art was brought to India by the Mughal empire, and it was their training that enabled these artists to adapt brilliantly to the requirements of science-obsessed English aristocrats. Even the idea of assembling watercolour pictures in albums is a Mughal convention \u2013 although it got a new look from the modern paper the British insisted on. The results are sensational. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t really matter, more than 200 years on, if we remembered or didn\u2019t remember artists whose works were ordinary or minor. But genius deserves a name. Shaikh Zain ud-Din is at least the equal of his English contemporary Stubbs. His depiction of a cheetah for the Impey album is a tender gold cloud of fur with spots that seem to float in its lithe mist. You can almost see its heart beat. This intimate encounter with a swift ghost of the forest makes Stubbs\u2019s painting of the first cheetah brought to Britain look cold and hard. It\u2019s that insight into the being of nature that makes these artists so arresting. They go beyond all anthropomorphism in their appetite for wondrous life. A painter whose name has not yet been found portrays a river fish from Bengal as a pewter-coloured, leaf-shaped ovoid with its eyes and mouth twisted around its flattened form. It\u2019s not like us, but it is as interesting as us. The East India Company also commissioned India\u2019s artists to depict soldiers and beggars, markets and rituals. In these social records, the tensions of history are hard to ignore \u2013 are they sympathetic studies or imperial objectifications of \u201cIndia\u201d? But Yellapah of Vellore turns his brush on the people who hired him, portraying a pasty-faced red-jacketed British officer lazing, a bit glumly, in the comfy box of a palanquin as he\u2019s carried by six \u201cnatives\u201d. There are dazzling depictions of architecture, including a sublime portrait of the Taj Mahal. Here you see two artistic cultures collide as European perspective mixes with an Indian appetite for all-over surface detail that creates almost surreal effects. Strangest of all is a painting by a still-nameless artist of a village called Rania. The villagers vividly populate a scene of rounded, organic buildings and knobbly, serpentine trees. Nothing is straight, nothing is rigid. It could be an early painting by Mir\u00f3, a desert scene by O\u2019Keeffe. This exhibition unveils an entire new artistic world that\u2019s been forgotten and misunderstood for centuries. It promises great things for the Wallace Collection\u2019s new approach as a gallery that, in a reverse of its former rules, can now lend, and therefore borrow, masterpieces. How great to start by rescuing India\u2019s neglected artists from being forgotten.",

As Pilch said: \u201cMr Felix on his own day was my man. When he got to work and the ground and light suited him, it was a wonderful sight to see him bat. He knew the whole science of the game, and he had a hand and eye such as no one e\u2019er beat him at.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, cricket was only a small fraction of what made Felix interesting. His mother died at 43, having had 21 children. Nicholas was one of only seven who reached adulthood, and as the oldest male heir took over the school his family ran, Alfred House, when he was 19. Both his parents died in quick succession. He was an excellent musician: according to legend he once attended a ball at a country house in Hampshire and, when the band went to supper, proved himself able to play with distinction every one of their instruments.</p> <p>He favoured the violin, but he also recalled of Mynn that \u201cmany a time I have drawn a tear from his beautiful blue eyes when he has requested me to play him some favourite air on my flute\u201d. His drawings of fellow players were excellent, and he harboured a desire \u201cto take my rank with some of the leading portrait painters of the day\u201d which was scuppered only when \u201cthe introduction of photography put an end to any hopes of success\u201d. He once painted a portrait of an ox so accurate a butcher who had seen it once at market was able to recognise the individual animal.</p> <p>He was also a serial innovator. When he wanted alternative headgear to the then fashionable but in practice ludicrous top hat, he designed his very own cap. Though he was not the first player to wear pads, he came up with the idea of sewing linen sheaths into the inside of his trouser legs so as to make them invisible. \u201cLong slips of Indian rubber, half an inch thick, can be inserted therein, and taken out as they go or come from the wash,\u201d he enthused. He created the first protective gloves and decided not to patent them (so someone else did), and then there was his bowling machine, the Catapulta. The user placed a ball at the top of the machine, and an arm would swing up and thump it downfield, making contact much like a cue on a snooker ball. It could be set to deliver the ball \u201cso fast that it would split your bat in two, or so slow it would scarcely reach the wicket\u201d, and was so versatile one early report said the machine was \u201cby means of a screw made to imitate the fast bowling of Sam Redgate\u201d.</p> <p>Harrow school bought one to train their young players, as did Surrey. Some were sent over to India. Felix used his Catapulta to hone his defensive game, which at the start of his career had been a noted weakness but towards the end truly set him apart. \u201cHe is,\u201d Arthur Haygarth wrote, \u201cwhat is called a late player, that is to say, he did not begin to distinguish himself much in the great matches till he was about 30 years of age, he then however ran a most brilliant career\u201d. He demonstrated his improved technique in June 1846, when he played a single-wicket match against Mynn, attracting \u201cthe most brilliant assemblage of spectators ever gathered\u201d to Lord\u2019s. Mynn scored five runs in his one innings; Felix was dismissed without scoring in his first, but in his second he settled in for the long haul, facing 247 deliveries and scoring only three. It was, the Sporting Life later wrote, \u201cone of the most brilliant specimens of batting ever remembered\u201d.</p> <p>His first-class career ended in 1853, and four years later he suffered a stroke that severely limited his movement for the last 19 years of his life \u2013 if not his ability to write and paint. \u201cFortunately for me, I always possessed something of the nature of that soubriquet,\u201d he wrote of his pseudonym, though he reverted to Wanostrocht in retirement. \u201cBuoyant in spirit, full of careless \u2018hope for the best\u2019, I never would allow any calamity to weigh me down. Many a strong-minded man would have shrivelled into nothing if he had had to bear but half the anxieties which I could here unfold, but to which it would be tedious now to refer.

Dutch farmers in the south of the country, which has a high density of livestock, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-25/dutch-pig-farmers-face-smell-test-to-qualify-for-government-aid\">are now reportedly</a> being offered as much as \u20ac150 (\u00a3130) per pig to reduce their herd size. <br><br><strong>More than 14,000 sheep are believed to have died</strong> when cargo ship, The Queen Hind, capsized in the Black Sea on a journey from Romania to Saudi Arabia. While crew members were rescued, <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20191130-romania-halts-sheep-rescue-from-capsized-ship\">just 254 sheep</a> were saved.

European live animal export trade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/28/campaigners-call-for-sheep-saved-from-capsized-ship-to-be-put-out-to-pasture\">rose in value</a> from $1bn (\u00a3800m) in 2000 to $3.3bn in 2018.

      "bodyText": "News from around the world The Dutch government has begun a two-month scheme paying pig farmers to quit the industry. The country has been under pressure to come up with a more radical plan for reducing nitrogen emissions in the sector, sparking protests from farmers. Dutch farmers in the south of the country, which has a high density of livestock, are now reportedly being offered as much as \u20ac150 (\u00a3130) per pig to reduce their herd size. More than 14,000 sheep are believed to have died when cargo ship, The Queen Hind, capsized in the Black Sea on a journey from Romania to Saudi Arabia. While crew members were rescued, just 254 sheep were saved. The recovering sheep are currently being kept in quarantine and animal rights activists are concerned that they could soon be re-exported. European live animal export trade rose in value from $1bn (\u00a3800m) in 2000 to $3.3bn in 2018. It is not yet known what caused the ship to capsize, but an animal rights group has claimed it was overloaded. The UK is considering a ban on the export of live farm animals for slaughter if it leaves the EU. The grass is always green and the sun constantly shining for a herd of cows in Russia, thanks to the VR headsets strapped to their heads. The sets are part of a trial running at the RusMoloko farm, near Moscow, to see if gazing at virtual green fields makes cows produce more milk. An increasing number of cows around the world are housed indoors for most or even all of the year. In an effort to counter this loss of outdoor access, a variety of objects and activities are being provided to animals, including rotating brushes, toys and classical music. Researchers claim such enrichment can address the physical and behavioural needs that are not being met in restrictive indoor farms. A harmful algae bloom known as the \u201cred tide\u201d has returned to the Florida coastline, with fears of a surge in wildlife deaths. A 14-month-long algae bloom in Florida ended earlier this year, after killing more than 200 manatees, 127 dolphins and 589 sea turtles. Hundreds of tons of dead fish also washed ashore. The causes of blooms vary, but they are being increasingly linked to the climate crisis and industrialised agriculture. News from the UK Upland farmers could boost their profitability by reducing livestock numbers to a level that could be supported by natural grass growth and without the use of costly fertiliser and bought-in feed, says a new report. Many upland livestock farms are profitable only because of government subsidies, which are due to be phased out from 2021. If a viable future cannot be found for upland farmers, says the report , then the land may have to be given over for other uses such as building, afforestation or rewilding. Twenty large crates of chicken carcasses have been dumped at multiple locations near Darlington over a 10-day period, according to reports. The incidents are being investigated by Trading Standards officials. The pig industry is celebrating after the Conservative manifesto failed to include a pledge to ban farrowing crates. Boris Johnson had said in October in parliament that Brexit would allow the UK government to ban sow farrowing crates. Labour has previously pledged to introduce a phased ban on the crates but, along with the Liberal Democrats, did not mention a ban in its manifesto. Sweden is the only EU member state so far to have banned farrowing crates. The UK was one of the first countries in Europe to ban gestation crates in 1999. Meanwhile, UK pig exports rose to a monthly record of \u00a336m in September, up 50% year-on-year, with the continued spread of African Swine Fever (ASF) across Asia and into eastern Europe leading to shortfalls in global pig meat supplies. Cases of ASF were found in wild boar in Poland last month. Elsewhere in the Guardian Half the world\u2019s donkey population could be wiped out in the next five years, with 4.8m hides required to meet rising demand for traditional Chinese medicine. The donkeys are reportedly slaughtered and the hides used to make gelatine, a key ingredient of a traditional medicine called ejiao. Donkey numbers in China have fallen by 76% since 1992, with the country turning to global imports to fill the gap. A large mottled pig has been hogging the limelight on Greek national television after chasing a broadcast journalist trying to report on recent mudslides and flooding in the country. Quote of the month They survived all this, they deserve a nice old age.

Standards for machine-readable passports set by the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) allow for individual states to enter M, F or X in the category indicating an individual\u2019s sex, with X standing for unspecified. More than 80 MPs signed the most recent Commons early day motion calling on the HM Passport Office and the government to make available X passports \u201cto people who do not identify with a particular gender\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn is among those who have signed earlier motions of parliamentary support. Elan-Cane, 62, who was born female but began transitioning after surgery, believes individuals should be given more than the binary choice of being a man or a woman. Human Rights Watch is intervening in support of the claim. The high court rejected the claim last year but permission to appeal was granted. Critics say denying X passports to individuals whose identities are neither male nor female subjects them to a discriminatory policy, which forces them to declare an inappropriate gender. Lawyers for Elan-Cane will also argue the policy is inconsistent, as border control officers allow holders of foreign X passports to enter the country at airports and ports. Solicitors from law firm Clifford Chance as well as Kate Gallafent QC and Tom Mountford of Blackstone Chambers are working pro bono on the claim. They will argue that Elan-Cane\u2019s human rights under articles 8 and 14 of the European convention on human rights \u2013 the right to private and family life and absence of discrimination \u2013 are being breached by the Home Office\u2019s passport policy. The court will be told that the Passport Office\u2019s policy is \u201dforcing a [group] already marginalised within gendered society to collude in their own oppression/invisibility through a forced and unwilling self-denial of their identity in return for issuance of a UK passport\u201d. Speaking before the hearing, Elan-Cane said: \u201cLegitimate identity is a fundamental human right but non-gendered people are treated as though we have no rights. It is unacceptable that someone who defines as neither male nor female is forced to declare an inappropriate gender in order to obtain a passport. \u201cThe UK government has consistently and consciously shown a determined unwillingness to accommodate non-gendered people\u2019s legitimate needs. We are socially invisible and we are \u2018inconvenient\u2019 in a society where so much \u2013 even the legislative system \u2013 is bound and classified in accordance to gender. The government prefers to respond to our situation as though we do not exist rather than work towards enabling our assimilation into gendered society.\u201d The Home Office has argued that issuing passports with an X marker would have widespread implications and lead to additional costs across the whole of government. It would be a disproportionate burden, it maintains, since only a few people would benefit from the change.",

      "body": "<p>Senator John Kennedy is not an idiot. He may be a useful one, from the Kremlin\u2019s perspective. But objectively, the Louisiana Republican has nothing in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that suggests a large cavity inside his cranium.</p> <p>Kennedy earned the highest honors at Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes scholar, and he was executive editor of the Virginia Law Review at the not-too-shabby University of Virginia law school.</p> <p>So how does a certified nerd \u2013 one of the elites of the elite \u2013 end up peddling Russian-backed disinformation on national television not once, but twice? And more importantly, what can the sane population of democracy-loving citizens do about it? (Apart from voting him out of office, which may be tricky in a state that Donald Trump won by a margin of 20 points in 2016.)</p> <p>First, the facts about this fact-free member of the self-styled world\u2019s greatest deliberative body. Kennedy popped up on Fox News last week and was asked a simple question by Chris Wallace. Who was responsible for the hacking of Democratic emails in the 2016 election: Russia or Ukraine?</p> <p>This is not a difficult question. As they say in legal circles, it is settled law: the conclusion of the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/intelligence-director-says-agencies-agree-russian-meddling-n785481\">entire</a> US intelligence community is that the guilty party is in Moscow, not Kyiv.</p> <p>But what do the intelligence agencies, with their annual budget of more than $50bn, actually know? As Senator Kennedy saw it, not much.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/25/politics/john-kennedy-russia-ukraine-chris-wallace/index.html\">told</a> Fox News. \u201cNor do you. Nor do any of us.\u201d</p> <p>This was obviously something of an embarrassment to the senator, or his staff, so a day later he appeared on CNN to say he was wrong. \u201cI\u2019ve seen no indication that Ukraine tried to do it,\u201d he <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/republican-senator-kennedy-fox-news-interview-wallace-ukraine-dnc-hack-russia.html\">admitted</a>.</p> <p>But that was so last week. Kennedy reappeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday to <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/12/01/gop-sen-kennedy-reiterates-view-that-ukraine-meddled-in-2016-election/\">reconsider</a> his reconsidered remarks.</p> <p>\u201cI think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,\u201d he said, in flat contradiction of well, everyone with a brain. Among those brain-driven people is Fiona Hill, the former Russia hand in the Trump White House, who warned Congress just last week that this Republican line of attack was entirely what Vladimir Putin wanted.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/21/trump-impeachment-inquiry-fiona-hill-david-holmes-testimony\">said</a>.</p> <p>This is sadly not just a tale about a moronic senator on a couple of Sunday talkshows.

      "bodyText": "Senator John Kennedy is not an idiot. He may be a useful one, from the Kremlin\u2019s perspective. But objectively, the Louisiana Republican has nothing in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that suggests a large cavity inside his cranium. Kennedy earned the highest honors at Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes scholar, and he was executive editor of the Virginia Law Review at the not-too-shabby University of Virginia law school. So how does a certified nerd \u2013 one of the elites of the elite \u2013 end up peddling Russian-backed disinformation on national television not once, but twice? And more importantly, what can the sane population of democracy-loving citizens do about it? (Apart from voting him out of office, which may be tricky in a state that Donald Trump won by a margin of 20 points in 2016.) First, the facts about this fact-free member of the self-styled world\u2019s greatest deliberative body. Kennedy popped up on Fox News last week and was asked a simple question by Chris Wallace. Who was responsible for the hacking of Democratic emails in the 2016 election: Russia or Ukraine? This is not a difficult question. As they say in legal circles, it is settled law: the conclusion of the entire US intelligence community is that the guilty party is in Moscow, not Kyiv. But what do the intelligence agencies, with their annual budget of more than $50bn, actually know? As Senator Kennedy saw it, not much. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cNor do you. Nor do any of us.\u201d This was obviously something of an embarrassment to the senator, or his staff, so a day later he appeared on CNN to say he was wrong. \u201cI\u2019ve seen no indication that Ukraine tried to do it,\u201d he admitted. But that was so last week. Kennedy reappeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday to reconsider his reconsidered remarks. \u201cI think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,\u201d he said, in flat contradiction of well, everyone with a brain. Among those brain-driven people is Fiona Hill, the former Russia hand in the Trump White House, who warned Congress just last week that this Republican line of attack was entirely what Vladimir Putin wanted. \u201cThis is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,\u201d she said. This is sadly not just a tale about a moronic senator on a couple of Sunday talkshows. It cuts to the heart of our democratic process, as new tools of technology are combined with good old-fashioned propaganda, disinformation and corruption. Kennedy\u2019s lies did not appear out of thin air. They were concocted by a Russian government that has trashed Ukraine to justify its invasion and annexation of Crimea, as well as its everyday corruption and general commercial pillaging. They were propagated by the consistently pro-Russian stooge who sits in the Oval Office, who tweeted his encouragement at Kennedy on Monday. \u201cThank you Great Republican @SenJohnKennedy for the job he did in representing both the Republican Party and myself,\u201d said Donald Trump, as he helpfully confused his own interests with his party and Putin\u2019s crypto-criminal state. So what can you do about this plague of disinformation as we lurch towards elections on both sides of the Atlantic that feature politicians who mimic or partake in Putin\u2019s propaganda? The only antidote to a campaign of lies is a campaign of truth. And there are many organizations dedicated to propagating truth: they are called the news media. You can share truth the way a Louisiana senator shares lies: with your friends and your pseudo-friends on social media. You can seek out truth-telling media \u2013 the kind that has no problem calling out the liars as liars. And if you really feel like fighting for your own democracy, you can even pay for the truth that journalists deliver on a daily and hourly basis. It\u2019s cheap, to be honest. Not least because the alternative is so very costly to the values we all hold dear. Another senator, in another era, liked to say: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d Daniel Patrick Moynihan may have served as a New York senator, but he worked for both Republican and Democratic presidents. The truth is neither a partisan choice nor a product of a certain time and place. It is as priceless as it is timeless.",

I realised I had autopsied his body at the request of the Southwark coroner.</p> \n<p>I was not at the inquest. Pathologists are called to give evidence in person only if there is uncertainty about the cause of death or if the relatives wish it; but here, neither condition applied. My written cause of death (alcohol toxicity) was the conclusion, but my original full version did not appear, for I had added \u201chomelessness \u2013 to be considered at inquest\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was considered, but it could not appear on the final death certificate because \u201chomelessness\u201d is not listed as a disease in the International Classification of Diseases (although it does feature in an annex entitled \u201cFactors influencing health status or contact with health services\u201d). I wrote it only to remind the coroner of what I thought was a fundamental reason why Remes died.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/15/gyula-remes-died-on-parliaments-doorstep-was-the-outcry-of-mps-just-for-show\">Gyula Remes died on parliament's doorstep. Was the outcry of MPs just for show?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) bulletin tells us that last year deaths among homeless people in England and Wales rose to 726, a fifth of them in London. Drug poisoning (for instance through illicit drugs such as opiates) rose as the cause of death in the homeless, while deaths from alcohol toxicity and suicide were proportionally similar to previous years. I have worked as a pathologist examining deaths for more than 40 years, and although I am part-time now I cannot help noticing that homeless rough sleeping features more often as the scenario of death than previously.</p> \n<p>My personal observation is borne out by the statistics, which for the past year alone show a rise in homeless death of 22%. But shocking as the ONS numbers undoubtedly are, there is reason to believe that the true total could be higher. Accurate causes of death are essential for monitoring what goes on in society, and they advise governments where to put the money to improve matters in future by critical changes in policy and funding. Britain has a proud record in death certification, but for many reasons a substantial proportion overall, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/dec/02/causes-of-death-inaccurate-study\">20% or more, are known to be incorrect</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f19c6dbd-a8c5-44ad-a2f7-cde781d9ee47\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures. Over the next few months, G2 and Guardian Cities&nbsp;will look behind this statistic to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/the-empty-doorway\">tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain\u2019s streets</a>. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life \u2013 what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>It is time to stop just passing by.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>How the ONS arrives at these numbers \u2013 by no means a straightforward matter \u2013 is detailed in another document, the Quality and Methodology Information (QMI). These are based on death registration records (basic causes of death), linked with records of people sleeping rough or using emergency accommodation (homeless shelters, direct access hostels) at or around the time of death. A further proportion will have died not on the streets but later in hospitals.</p> \n<p>The QMI acknowledges that the numbers are estimates, and that the real number may be higher. For one thing, the number of deaths registered in 2018 will not be the same as the number of deaths actually occurring in that year; the process of death investigation, including inquest, can take months and sometimes years to complete to registration.</p> \n<p>The QMI states that \u201c12% of deaths of homeless people are certified by a coroner\u201d.

      "bodyText": "I got a jolt reading Simon Hattenstone and Daniel Lavelle\u2019s Empty Doorway article on the death of Gyula Remes, who was found by Westminster tube station last December. I realised I had autopsied his body at the request of the Southwark coroner. I was not at the inquest. Pathologists are called to give evidence in person only if there is uncertainty about the cause of death or if the relatives wish it; but here, neither condition applied. My written cause of death (alcohol toxicity) was the conclusion, but my original full version did not appear, for I had added \u201chomelessness \u2013 to be considered at inquest\u201d. It was considered, but it could not appear on the final death certificate because \u201chomelessness\u201d is not listed as a disease in the International Classification of Diseases (although it does feature in an annex entitled \u201cFactors influencing health status or contact with health services\u201d). I wrote it only to remind the coroner of what I thought was a fundamental reason why Remes died. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) bulletin tells us that last year deaths among homeless people in England and Wales rose to 726, a fifth of them in London. Drug poisoning (for instance through illicit drugs such as opiates) rose as the cause of death in the homeless, while deaths from alcohol toxicity and suicide were proportionally similar to previous years. I have worked as a pathologist examining deaths for more than 40 years, and although I am part-time now I cannot help noticing that homeless rough sleeping features more often as the scenario of death than previously. My personal observation is borne out by the statistics, which for the past year alone show a rise in homeless death of 22%. But shocking as the ONS numbers undoubtedly are, there is reason to believe that the true total could be higher. Accurate causes of death are essential for monitoring what goes on in society, and they advise governments where to put the money to improve matters in future by critical changes in policy and funding. Britain has a proud record in death certification, but for many reasons a substantial proportion overall, 20% or more, are known to be incorrect. How the ONS arrives at these numbers \u2013 by no means a straightforward matter \u2013 is detailed in another document, the Quality and Methodology Information (QMI). These are based on death registration records (basic causes of death), linked with records of people sleeping rough or using emergency accommodation (homeless shelters, direct access hostels) at or around the time of death. A further proportion will have died not on the streets but later in hospitals. The QMI acknowledges that the numbers are estimates, and that the real number may be higher. For one thing, the number of deaths registered in 2018 will not be the same as the number of deaths actually occurring in that year; the process of death investigation, including inquest, can take months and sometimes years to complete to registration. The QMI states that \u201c12% of deaths of homeless people are certified by a coroner\u201d. Does this mean that the other 88% did not pass through the coronial system? The 12% must include, at the least, the rough sleepers. Anyone found dead on the streets is, by law, going to be reported to a coroner, who will be duty bound to investigate what happened by an autopsy. These unfortunate people will not have a note in their pocket indicating their GP, who would be able to produce a natural cause of death over the telephone to the coroner, thus avoiding an autopsy. The ONS statistical bulletin also states that \u201clooking at deaths identified as homeless in 2018 registrations, 90% were investigated by a coroner\u201d. Lots of deaths are reported to coroners, but not all are accepted for full investigation, and only about 40% of reported deaths proceed to a coronial autopsy examination. Here, then, is another confusion: is it the majority of homeless deaths that get the full investigation by a coroner, or a small minority? The next uncertainty is where the deaths are taking place. The ONS does not (perhaps cannot) give us the breakdown of homeless deaths into more precise categories of homelessness, including often/ever/never a rough sleeper.

The majority of homeless deaths probably happen not on the streets but in shelters and hostels for the homeless, or on NHS premises. Their death certificates are usually written by an attending doctor. Only if the circumstances of death appear unnatural (a term with no comprehensive agreed definition), or if the final cause of death is not evident clinically, is the death referred to a coroner. From long experience, I am sceptical about the accuracy of such death certificates, compared with definite information from an autopsy. From my experience, where the coroners do become involved there may be no consistency in how they depict these deaths in their conclusions. In non-rough-sleeper homeless deaths, they may not be informed that a contributory factor was homelessness. Going back to the death of Gyula Remes, the Record of Inquest said that in addition to the influence of alcohol he was \u201crough sleeping\u201d: so this one was definitely counted \u2013 although not for 2018, the year of the death, since the inquest happened the following year. Ultimately, registration delays, uncertainties over place of death and how thoroughly the deaths are being investigated should make us cautious about the accuracy of the statistics: the homeless mortality problem may be even more serious than we think.

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin has signed a law that will allow Russia to declare journalists and bloggers as \u201cforeign agents\u201d in a move critics say will allow the Kremlin to target government critics. Under the vaguely worded law, Russians and foreigners who work with media or distribute their content and receive money from abroad would be declared foreign agents, potentially exposing journalists, their sources, or even those who share material on social networks to foreign agent status. The move has been described by journalists and human rights activists as a scare tactic to further stem criticism of Putin\u2019s government. In an open letter published last week, more than 60 prominent journalists, writers and activists urged the president not to sign the law. \u201c\u2018Foreign agent\u2019 is a persistent phrase with a sharply negative character,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThe label of foreign agent discredits a person in the eyes of his fellow citizens and disparages his dignity despite the fact that he has done nothing wrong or illegal and did not carry out the will of any foreign employers.\u201d Alexei Venediktov, the editor of the popular Echo of Moscow radio station, said the law was in part prompted by this summer\u2019s protests, the largest in years, sparked by the state\u2019s heavy-handed control over municipal elections. \u201cThis is the story of a selective attack for total fear and to create obstacles for protesters, above all the media, which report on protests, using all available information,\u201d he said in an interview with Znak.com. \u201cThis is yet another tool, it is clear, understood, demonstrated and brazen.\u201d Russia\u2019s register of foreign agent media has 10 entries, all of them outlets tied to either Radio Free Europe or Voice of America, which receive funding from the US. But Russia\u2019s government has also harshly criticised other foreign media for reporting on the demonstrations, including suggesting it could revoke German broadcaster Deutsche Welle\u2019s accreditation for sharing a map of the planned route for an unsanctioned protest in August. Russia\u2019s foreign agent law was developed after large anti-Putin protests in 2012 and has largely targeted NGOs. In November, the country\u2019s supreme court ordered the liquidation of the veteran human rights activist Lev Ponomarev\u2019s For Human Rights NGO, resulting in the organisation being shut down in Russia and removed from the country\u2019s register of legal entities.

      "bodyText": "Iranian state television has acknowledged that security forces killed \u201crioters\u201d in several cities during the protests that convulsed the country last month, in the fullest admission authorities have given so far of the violence used to put down the demonstrations. Amnesty International says the government\u2019s response to the nationwide unrest that followed a surprise rise in the price of petrol on 14 November resulted in the deaths of 208 protesters, a figure that would almost certainly increase, making it the deadliest crackdown on demonstrations in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic. On Tuesday, Iranian television said those killed included rioters who had attacked sensitive or military centres with firearms or knives or who had taken hostages in some areas. The report said passersby, security forces and peaceful protesters were also killed, without assigning blame for their deaths. The government had previously acknowledged the deaths of only a handful of people and continues to decline to give an official estimate of the total number killed, but officials in the country have talked publicly in recent days of ordering security forces to fire on demonstrators trying to storm government buildings. An internet blackout, still in place in parts of the country, has slowed the release of information about the protests and the subsequent crackdown but media and NGO reports in recent days have given a glimpse of the situation. The state TV report said security forces had confronted rioters in the south-central city of Shiraz, where videos and interviews with activists have revealed mass demonstrations that were met with a violent response and led to the burning of several official buildings and the confirmed deaths of 16 people. It also acknowledged killings in Tehran and in its suburb Shahriar, where Amnesty said it had recently learned of \u201cdozens\u201d of deaths. In another case, the report said security forces confronted a separatist group in the city of Mahshahr armed with \u201csemi-heavy\u201d weapons. It claimed the armed rioters, from an oil-rich area whose mainly Arab population frequently complain of discrimination by the central government, fought with security personnel for hours. Philip Luther, Amnesty\u2019s Middle East research and advocacy director, said the death toll so far was \u201cfurther evidence that Iran\u2019s security forces went on a horrific killing spree\u201d. \u201cThose responsible for this bloody clampdown on demonstrations must be held accountable for their actions,\u201d he said. The rights group said it had gathered information showing the families of victims had been warned not to speak to the media or hold funerals for their loved ones. Some families were also being forced to make extortionate payments to have the bodies of victims returned to them. Authorities have also been visiting hospitals, looking for patients with gunshot wounds or other injuries from the unrest, the group said, with people showing suspicious wounds immediately detained. The Iranian UN mission in New York has said Amnesty\u2019s findings were unsubstantiated. Iran\u2019s fuel prices are among the cheapest in the world, but the price rise comes amid an ailing economy and an increasing cost of living, partly as a result of US sanctions imposed on the country after Donald Trump pulled out of a global agreement to curb Iranian nuclear ambitions in exchange for economic relief. Tehran had been in compliance with the deal, but Trump argued its scope was too narrow and needed to include measures against the country\u2019s missile development, sponsorship of militias and human rights abuses. Iranian officials have said about 7,000 people have been arrested since the protests started, though the figure is disputed. Associated Press contributed to this report",

In a fresh sign of the chaos being caused by the invasion, nine civilians \u2013 most of them children \u2013 lost their lives, and 10 others were wounded on Monday in an attack by Turkish artillery against the town of Tel Rifaat, south of the Turkish border. As many as 230,000 people were displaced by the initial Turkish invasion, but many have now returned to their homes. Turkey plans to establish a 20-mile-deep safe zone along a 75-mile stretch of the border, while on the east and west of the safe zone Turkish and Russian forces will conduct joint patrols. Turkey is holding back from expanding its safe zone partly due to agreements struck with Russia and the US.",

It\u2019s impossible to put down until you reach the denouement, nails bitten to the quick and eyes wide in horror. Denise Mina is always brilliant, but Conviction (Harvill Secker) is, I think, her best yet \u2013 joyously dark, comic, loads of fun. The main character, Anna, is devastated when her husband announces one morning that he is leaving her for her best friend, and taking the kids too. Anna\u2019s reaction? She gets stuck into a true crime podcast \u2013 wouldn\u2019t we all? \u2013 and becomes obsessed with the fact that she used to know one of the victims. So begins a wild and wonderful journey to the truth at the heart of the podcast, and at the heart of the lies on which Anna has built her family life. Months after reading it, I remain obsessed with Michelle Paver\u2019s Wakenhyrst (Head of Zeus), set in Suffolk in the early 1900s and featuring a historian, Edmund Stearne, who slaughtered \u201cthe first person he came across in the most bizarre and horrible way\u201d. There are many layers to this thriller: did Stearne really awaken an ancient evil when he found a painted devil in the local churchyard? What is the medieval mystic Margery Kempe\u2019s role in the affair? And what will Stearne\u2019s daughter, Maud, a lonely child growing up between superstition and religion amid the glorious fens, that \u201clast stretch of the ancient marshes that once drowned the whole of East Anglia\u201d, discover about her father? Spooky, twisted and unforgettable. \u2022 To order any of these books for a special price, click on the titles or go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315",

But Netflix and Marvel are not destroying cinema due to a reduction in theatrical screenings or a lack of artistry or anything like that. They are destroying cinema because they both really, really want to be television.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-irishman-review-martin-scorseses-finest-film-for-30-years\">The Irishman</a>, for example, is three-and-a-half hours long. That\u2019s far longer than any sensible person is willing to endure in a cinema, with the cramped legroom and the peripheral texters and the inevitable mid-point toilet shuffle. But watch it in the comfort of your own home and it immediately becomes much more desirable. Not least because, for those of us who only have a limited time each day when their living rooms aren\u2019t being dominated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/16/paw-patrol-mighty-pups-review-nickelodeon-animation\">Paw Patrol</a>, its epic decades-spanning story of a truck driver-turned-hitman-turned-shady union rep is episodic enough to be watched in chunks.

With its dozens of characters, method of storytelling that explicitly relies on the viewer having seen all the previous instalments and franchise plan that intends to keep rolling out in perpetuity until everyone gets bored, the MCU is Hollyoaks with more money and marginally less silly hair.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing. They aren\u2019t alone. Everything wants to be television at the moment.

      "bodyText": "The last decade has been one of \u201cexceptional\u201d heat around the world, and was almost certainly the hottest on record, while the oceans have also warmed to record levels and grown markedly more acidic, the World Meteorological Organization has said. Temperatures for the years from 2010 to 2019 were about 1.1C above the average for the pre-industrial period, showing how close the world is coming to the 1.5C of warming that scientists say will cause dramatic impacts, extreme weather and the loss of vital ecosystems. The preliminary findings of the State of the Global Climate, an annual publication by the WMO, show that this year is on course to be the second or third warmest since records began. Over land, the impacts from January to October have included severe droughts, heatwaves and floods across all inhabited continents, and over the seas there have also been heatwaves. During the past year, the upper levels of the oceans, measured since the 1950s, have exceeded previous records so far this year, and the ocean experienced about 1.5 months of unusually warm temperatures, with large areas of the north-east Pacific showing severe heatwaves. The Arctic sea ice minimum in September was the third smallest on record. The final version of the report will be published in March. Petteri Taalas, the WMO secretary general, said the impacts of rising concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere were becoming ever more harmful, as demonstrated in this year\u2019s extreme weather events. \u201cHeatwaves and floods which used to be once-in-a-century events are becoming more regular occurrences. Countries from the Bahamas to Japan to Mozambique suffered devastating tropical cyclones. Wildfires swept through the Arctic and Australia,\u201d he said. He warned that more erratic rainfall patterns posed a threat to crop yields, which, combined with population increases, would mean \u201cconsiderable food security challenges for vulnerable countries in the future\u201d. The findings came as the world\u2019s governments gathered in Madrid for a critical UN conference on the climate. On Monday, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned that though the technology and economic means to fight climate chaos were available, political will was lacking. He called on world leaders and governments to pay heed to young people, who were \u201cshowing remarkable leadership and mobilisation\u201d.

On a more positive note, the OECD found the UK had a benign record in educating families of immigrants, with 20% of all students reported to have an immigrant background, compared with 9% in 2009. While one in three of immigrant children were classed as disadvantaged, the OECD found the attainment gap between immigrant and non-immigrant students was one of the smallest among industrialised countries. Overall, the academic results were dominated by the east Asian powerhouses, with mainland China\u2019s entry \u2013 comprising pupils from the regions of Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang \u2013 outperforming by a large margin the other 78 countries in maths and science. China\u2019s rise relegated Singapore, which topped the rankings in 2015, to second place in all three subjects, although in reading alone Singapore\u2019s scores were indistinguishable from those of China. Macao followed close behind, while Estonia was Europe\u2019s standout performer, supplanting Finland as the highest-performing OECD member. In Pisa\u2019s core tests, Wales was the only UK nation to improve in each of its scores in reading, maths and science compared with the previous tests in 2015, while England had better results in reading and maths countered by a fall in science. Scotland\u2019s decline in science continued, although both it and Northern Ireland had improved scores in reading. Kirsty Williams, Wales\u2019s minister for education, said the results showing students in Wales achieving close to the OECD averages in all three subjects were \u201cpositive but not perfect\u201d. \u201cFor the first time ever, Wales is in the international mainstream, thanks to the efforts of our teachers and students. We have caught up, we are continuing to improve in all areas and as a nation we must be determined to keep up this momentum,\u201d Williams said. But experts warned that the results for individual UK countries showed few differences from previous years, despite England\u2019s improvement in mathsthat helped its ranking improve from 20th to 13th, putting it alongside Germany, Finland and Ireland. John Jerrim, a UCL professor of education who studies the Pisa process, said: \u201cThe big story in England will be that scores have gone up about 10 points higher in maths and that is not seen across the rest of the UK. I would say it\u2019s far too early to call it a trend, and we can\u2019t read too much into it yet.\u201d The 2018 Pisa tests concentrated on reading, with the NFER\u2019s analysis noting that there were no significant differences between reading scores in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Wales\u2019s reading score was \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than the rest of the UK but not significantly different from the OECD average. Pisa\u2019s survey of staff found headteachers in Scotland reporting more problems with pupil absence and teacher absenteeism than those in the rest of the UK. School leaders in Wales reported greater shortages of educational materials, and those in Northern Ireland were more likely to complain about inadequate buildings and infrastructure.",

      "bodyText": "Australian students\u2019 performance in mathematics has fallen to the OECD average, the first time results in one of the three core competencies has done so since international comparisons began in 2000. The Programme for International Student Assessment results, released on Tuesday evening, confirm a continuing long-term decline in Australian students\u2019 reading, mathematics and science skills. There are now 10 countries with \u201csignificantly higher\u201d results in reading than Australia, 23 in maths and 12 in science. The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, said the results were \u201cvery disappointing\u201d and \u201cshould have alarm bells ringing\u201d but pushed responsibility on to the states rather than revisiting the issue of federal funding to improve results. Tehan said that the education council meeting of ministers next week \u201cprovides the opportunity to reset\u201d the agenda, calling on states to be \u201cbold\u201d and sign up to reforms proposed in the second Gonski report including to implement a curriculum broken up into smaller \u201clearning progressions\u201d. But Australian Education Union federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said \u201cextra teaching resources that would become available by ensuring that all schools are funded at the [schools resourcing standard] benchmark is key in closing this performance gap\u201d. The Pisa test makes international comparisons between 15-year-old students, who are nearing the end of compulsory schooling. In 2018, some 600,000 students in 79 countries were tested, including an Australian sample of 14,273 students in 740 schools. Compared with students in the highest performing country, Singapore, Australian students are one and a third years behind in reading, around three years behind in mathematics and one and three quarter years behind in science. The Australian Council for Educational Research deputy chief executive, Sue Thomson, said Australia was \u201ca developed, wealthy western country with justifiably high aspirations for our students so we must take notice of these results\u201d. Australian students have been left behind due to a \u201cpattern of improvement in maths performance in comparable countries that just isn\u2019t replicated in Australia\u201d, she said. Since testing began in 2000, five countries which were on par in mathematics overtook Australia, while of the 16 countries with lower maths scores, nine now outperform Australia and seven are on par with Australia. In maths a \u201csignificant gender gap\u201d which had closed in 2015 opened back up in the 2018 tests in favour of male students. Maths results were down in all states and territories with South Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory recording the biggest declines. In reading and science, Australia\u2019s average scores (503) were still ahead of the OECD averages of 487 and 489 respectively. Average performance in reading was down in all states and territories except Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory, and in science everywhere except Victoria and the NT. Labor\u2019s shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the results were \u201ca huge wake-up call for Scott Morrison and the Liberals, who\u2019ve seen school test scores plummet on their watch\u201d. \u201cIf our kids can\u2019t read, write, and do maths and science, then we\u2019ve failed.\u201d Haythorpe said the results showed a gap in the performance of students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds compared with those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. \u201cFederal Coalition budget cuts have had a deep impact on public schools. We need to invest in our schools to close the education gaps between high SES and low SES students.\u201d Tehan flagged federal pressure on the states to advance a raft of reforms including implementing the Gonski report, embed phonics as part of teacher training, and decluttering curriculums to \u201cget back to basics\u201d. \u201cAustralia should be a leader in school education,\u201d he said. \u201cOur students should be ranked among the best in the world. We should not accept anything less. \u201cMy message to the state and territory education ministers is this: leave the teachers\u2019 union talking points at home and be ambitious. \u201cMoney is not the issue because Estonia was the top-performing country in reading and science and they spend half as much money per student as Australia.\u201d But Thomson told Guardian Australia that although the commonwealth does not control education, funding is a joint responsibility of both federal and state governments and \u201cresourcing is obviously a part of the whole equation\u201d. While addressing \u201ccrowded\u201d curriculums may help, Thomson warned against a \u201cback to basics\u201d approach, which can lead teachers to \u201cteach to the middle\u201d and fail to help weaker students. Thomson also called for more specialist maths teachers and more training for people teaching maths although it is not their main field.",

      "bodyText": "A beleaguered Prince Andrew faced fresh embarrassment after his accuser Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked as a teenager to have sex with him, appeared on television to implore the British public to \u201cnot accept this as being OK\u201d. In her first UK broadcast interview, Giuffre repeated allegations she had sex with the prince when she was aged 17 on the instructions of Ghislaine Maxwell, a socialite and close friend of the US financier and sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in August. The prince, 59, whose relationship with Epstein has led to him standing down from public duties, has consistently and categorically denied the allegations, which Buckingham Palace said were \u201cfalse and without foundation\u201d. BBC Panorama said it had uncovered a 2015 email from Andrew to Maxwell asking for help dealing with the allegations by Giuffre, previously Virginia Roberts. He wrote: \u201cLet me know when we can talk. Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts,\u201d to which Maxwell replied: \u201cHave some info. Call me when you have a moment.\u201d In the interview that was broadcast on Monday, Giuffre said: \u201cI implore the people in the UK to stand up beside me, to help me fight this fight, to not accept this as being OK. \u201cThis is not some sordid sex story. This is a story of being trafficked. This is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guy\u2019s royalty.\u201d Panorama\u2019s The Prince and the Epstein Scandal claimed five of Epstein\u2019s victims, who are suing the financier\u2019s estate, want Andrew to give witness evidence in their court cases, and that he could have important evidence about Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking operation. Subpoenas could be served if he visits the US. Lawyers for the victims have twice written to the royal requesting an interview, but have yet to receive a response, it said. Giuffre, now 35, says she was recruited to train as a masseuse by Maxwell while working as a locker-room attendant at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. She alleges she had sex with Andrew on three occasions between 2001 and 2002. She repeated her claims that she was instructed to have sex with Andrew after he bought her a drink and asked her to dance at Tramp nightclub in London in 2001. Of that alleged encounter, she said Andrew was \u201cthe most hideous dancer I\u2019ve ever seen in my life\u201d and that she was \u201cgrossed out\u201d because \u201cthis guy was sweating all over me \u2026 his sweat was like it was raining basically\u201d. After they left the club, she claimed, Maxwell told her \u201cthat I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey, and that just made me sick\u201d. She alleges that later that evening, she had sex with Andrew at Maxwell\u2019s house in Belgravia. She said the alleged sexual encounter started in a bath, but \u201cit didn\u2019t last very long, the whole entire procedure. It was disgusting. He wasn\u2019t mean or anything. But he got up and he said \u2018thanks\u2019 and walked out, and I sat there in bed just horrified and ashamed and felt dirty.\u201d The next day, she claimed, Maxwell told her she had done \u201ca really good job\u201d. Giuffre said it was a \u201cwicked\u201d and \u201cscary\u201d time in her life. \u201cI had just been abused by a member of the royal family.\u201d She said: \u201cI just didn\u2019t expect it from royalty. I didn\u2019t expect it from someone that people look up to and admire in the royal family \u2026 I couldn\u2019t comprehend how the highest levels of the government, powerful people, were allowing this to happen, not only allowing it to happen but participating in it.\u201d She was interviewed by Panorama last month. Before the footage was ready to air, the prince agreed to an interview with BBC\u2019s Newsnight. The fallout from that disastrous interview led to him being forced to withdraw from public life. Though Giuffre does not directly address Andrew\u2019s account in her interview, which had already been filmed, Panorama said she stood by every word. Asked about alleged \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in her account, Giuffre said she might have a \u201cfoggy memory\u201d about dates or places, but not about someone\u2019s face. In his Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, Andrew said: \u201cI can categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady \u2013 none whatsoever.\u201d He claimed he had a medical condition that meant he did not sweat, and argued sex could not have taken place, insisting he had been at a Pizza Express in Woking on the same day. Asked about a 2001 photograph that appears to show him with his arm around Giuffre\u2019s waist, the prince said he did not recall it being taken, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s me, but whether that\u2019s my hand.\u201d He added that it was difficult to prove if it was fake or not because \u201cit\u2019s a photograph of a photograph of a photograph\u201d. Giuffre said the now infamous photograph, first published in 2011 by the Mail on Sunday, which paid her $160,000 (\u00a3120,000) for her story, was genuine. She said she gave the original to the FBI in 2011. The programme claimed a redacted court document shows she gave 20 photos to the FBI, which were scanned front and back. But only 19 photos were shown in the publicly available documents. Panorama had been told two missing reference numbers related to the Andrew photo, and that it was removed from the public document to protect his privacy. Freelance photographer Michael Thomas, who first copied the 2001 photograph, claimed it was genuine, and told Panorama he found the original in 2011 in a bundle of 20 photos Giuffre handed to him from her travels with Epstein and Maxwell. Another of Epstein\u2019s victims, Sarah Ransome, alleged in Panorama that Maxwell \u201ccontrolled the girls. She was like the madam. She was like the nuts and bolts of the sex trafficking operation.\u201d Maxwell has denied the allegations made against her. She has not been seen in public for months, amid speculation over her continued contact with the prince. Andrew has said he did not see, witness or suspect any suspicious behaviour during his visits to Epstein\u2019s homes in Florida, New York and the Caribbean. Buckingham Palace has said the prince \u201cunequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein\u201d, and that he \u201cdeeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure\u201d. It added: \u201cIt is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.\u201d Giuffre\u2019s interview was broadcast as the prince faces calls for a parliamentary inquiry into his business dealings, after the Mail on Sunday claimed he had been enabling a friend\u2019s business interests while working as a British trade envoy. The newspaper said it had seen a cache of documents, including leaked emails, about Andrew\u2019s links with David Rowland, and claimed the prince had been helping his business interests, including promoting his private bank, while a trade envoy for Britain.",

Thanks again for following along with the day\u2019s events. It\u2019s been another frantic day, so let\u2019s recap: </p> <ul> <li>The government has <strong>met with former fire chiefs</strong>, including Greg Mullins, about the climate and bushfires. Mullins says he hopes the Coalition can look past politics and act seriously on climate change. The prime minister was not in the meeting, leaving it up to <strong>Angus Taylor and David Littleproud</strong>.</li> <li>Labor called for a <strong>royal commission into veterans\u2019 suicides</strong>. The government said it was open to the idea, but would need more time to consider it. The <strong>RSL national president, Greg Melick,</strong> said there had been enough inquiries, and that the problems and solutions were known and needed to be acted upon. </li> <li>The day began with reports that <strong>Ken Wyatt</strong>, the minister for Indigenous Australians, had handed a contract to a company linked to a Liberal donor and former candidate without an open tender. <br></li> <li>Labor used <strong>question time to attack Angus Taylor</strong> again on multiple fronts, accusing him of misleading parliament in his first ever speech, and attempting to draw Scott Morrison and Christian Porter further into the<strong> C</strong><strong>ity of Sydney forged documents scandal</strong>. Taylor revealed he had not yet been interviewed by police. </li> <li>The government failed to produce a transcript of the phone call between Mick Fuller and Scott Morrison about the police investigation into Taylor, despite a Senate order, which prompted criticism from Labor and the Greens. </li> <li>Question time got fiery when <strong>Michael McCormack</strong> and <strong>Joel Fitzgibbon</strong> clashed. Fitzgibbon was ejected. McCormack became<strong> animated about his interactions with farmer protesters</strong> out the front of parliament. Those protesters had told McCormack he lacked passion and that the Nationals would not exist unless it took a bolder stand on water and the <strong>Murray-Darling Basin plan</strong>. </li> <li>Speaking of the <strong>Murray-Darling Basin plan</strong>, the government announced a <strong>review of its water management policies</strong> to ensure they are not inhibiting access. </li> <li><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> addressed the Labor caucus, rallying the troops and promising more pressure on what he called <strong>Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201cAngus Horribilis\u201d</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>See you tomorrow for another round. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T07:11:34.182Z\">at 7.11am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de5fd038f08bf648cb22c18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T06:14:14.011Z\">6.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The emergency services minister, <strong>David Littleproud</strong>,<strong> </strong>addressed his meeting with the former chief of NSW Fire and Rescue <strong>Greg Mullins </strong>a little earlier at a press conference:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I said to Mr Mullins and the other former fire chiefs ... [was] that they can take great comfort and great pride in the new breed of fire commissioners. They have planned meticulously for this fire season. I\u2019ve only been emergency services minister since June and the first advice I got is we would expect to see the fire season start in August and be severe.</p> </blockquote> <p>Littleproud said the peak council of fire commissioners had advised that Australia has \u201csufficient assets\u201d in the form of 100 firefighting aircraft. If the season is extended and is more severe the federal government will \u201ccontinue to be agile with the states\u201d which have primary funding responsibility to provide firefighting services.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has always been the responsibility of states to look after emergency management but we support them and the federal government has proven that \u2013 we topped up last year\u2019s [funding].</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T07:13:34.863Z\">at 7.13am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de5fa588f08bf648cb22c12\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T06:07:18.177Z\">6.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Zali Steggall</strong>, the independent MP, has been on the ABC talking about the <strong>federal government\u2019s proposal for its commonwealth integrity commission</strong>. She\u2019s had a briefing from the <strong>attorney general, Christian Porter,</strong> on the design. We\u2019re still waiting to see draft legislation. It was promised by the end of the year, initially, but is now not likely until next year. Steggall still has some concerns about the proposal. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From my point of view, what is still extremely important from me but also for other members of the crossbench is the issues around the referral pathway, and the ability to have open hearings. The national integrity commission needs to be seen to be holding MPs and their staff to account. There needs to be that integrity process, but also the public needs to have confidence that it is being seen to happen as well.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T07:14:33.874Z\">at 7.14am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de5f5bb8f08f78465b49de9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T05:56:39.980Z\">5.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still on bushfires, the crossbench MP <strong>Andrew Wilkie</strong> has reiterated his calls for the <strong>defence force to develop a firefighting capability</strong>. Wilkie asked a question on the issue during question time, warning the deteriorating climate and prolonged fire seasons were making it difficult to access foreign firefighting resources. </p> <p><strong>David Littleproud</strong> said he was advised there was no issue with access to resources. </p> <p>Wilkie has issued a statement saying he met with representatives of <strong>emergency leaders for climate action</strong> after question time. They advised him much greater investment in aerial firefighting was needed. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fact is that the national fire threat will continue to trend badly and any sensible government would see the importance of thinking strategically and planning for the future. </p> <p>Regardless of whether or not there are adequate firefighting resources currently, and that is arguable, there is no doubt that in years to come the country will need much greater capability and that must include a much enhanced heavy aerial firefighting capability. There is a strong argument that this will require an expanded role for the RAAF, a capability which could take years to work up, which means capability decisions need to be made by the government now.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T07:16:47.977Z\">at 7.16am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de5f7528f08bf648cb22bf7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T05:53:30.310Z\">5.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Former fire chiefs meet with ministers on climate, bushfires</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Former fire chiefs, including <strong>Greg</strong> <strong>Mullins</strong>, have met with the energy minister, <strong>Angus Taylor,</strong> and the drought minister, <strong>David Littleproud</strong> \u2013 but not <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> \u2013 to discuss their concerns about climate change. </p> <p>Mullins says he is hopeful the government can \u201creach out across the boundaries of politics and do more\u201d. He says the extremes being seen due to climate change are not mere \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is different. The science is very clear. This is driven by the burning of coal, ore and gas. I hope that the government can reach out across the boundaries of politics and say we need to do more, we need to do our bit internationally.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked whether the government can do more than its current commitments to the Paris agreement, Mullins says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hope so because it\u2019s simply not enough.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mullins also asked for national investment in heavy firefighting aircraft.

are calling on the Morrison government to do the right thing by our ex-service men and women, and establish a royal commission into veteran suicide as soon as possible.</p> <p>This will help to shine a light on the issue, investigate why so many of our veterans are taking their own lives, and determine what measures are needed to stop these tragic deaths.</p> <p>The terms of reference should include serving men and women, their transition from active service back to civilian life, and their ongoing circumstances.</p> <p>The men and women who serve our country deserve our gratitude and respect, and we owe it to them to have a comprehensive examination of how we can reduce, and hopefully eliminate, these tragic numbers.</p> <p>Their deaths are heartbreaking and cause immeasurable loss and grief for their loved ones left behind, their local communities, and indeed the nation.</p> <p>We know many veterans and veterans\u2019 families have been calling for this for some time now \u2013 they want to prevent future suicides and other families from suffering in the way they have.</p> <p>And we have listened to courageous advocates like Julie-Ann Finney, whose son David took his own life in February this year after a battle with PTSD. </p> <p>Labor Members of Parliament have met with Ms Finney and she has made a strong case for a Royal Commission.</p> <p>We want this to be a bipartisan effort \u2013 we want to work with the Government, the Parliament and the veteran community and do all we can to address the scourge of veteran suicide.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p

One was sprung by Labor in question time. It says Taylor <strong>failed to declare an interest in a company named GFA F1 Pty Ltd</strong>. Taylor has a partnership interest in the company through a separate venture, Farm Partnerships Australia, which he has declared appropriately. But he hasn\u2019t named an interest in GFA F1 on his pecuniary interests register. Labor isn\u2019t alleging there is any conflict of interest. </p> <p>The second issue to pop up was on the stranger side. In Taylor\u2019s <strong>first speech to parliament</strong>, he spoke of his memories of Christmas while studying at Oxford. He remembered \u201ca young Naomi Wolf\u201d, now a well-known US author and journalist, wanting to remove a Christmas tree from the common room \u201cbecause some people might be offended\u201d. Taylor described his outrage at this form of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d.</p> <p>Wolf <strong>subsequently raised the small issue of her not actually being in Oxford at the time</strong> of Taylor\u2019s memory, and accused him of an \u201canti-semitic dogwhistle\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was a Rhodes scholar in Oxford 1985-88,\u201d Wolf said on Twitter. \u201cAngus Taylor recalls me in a fever dream at Oxford in 1991 among those warring on Xmas. I was in NYC. Plus I love Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa. Flattered to be on this mythological hate list.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Butler has just been on Sky News, talking about these various controversies. <br></p> <p>On Taylor\u2019s defence of failing to declare an interest in GFA F1: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The corollary of what he said is that a resources minister would only be obliged to disclose the fact they had BHP shares if they have a sufficient number of those shares to control the company. That is utterly ridiculous.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>On the Oxford student story:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So again Angus Taylor has misled the parliament. It just gives you the sense that this guy makes stuff up.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, the issue continuing to pose the most trouble for Taylor is that he relied on a <strong>falsified document</strong> to attack <strong>Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore</strong>, for her travel-related emissions. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T22:42:59.792Z\">at 10.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de58a548f08bf648cb22961\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T22:19:14.947Z\">10.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>WikiLeaks\u2019 editor-in-chief, <strong>Kristinn Hrafnsson,</strong> is also in Canberra this morning.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave the day for now. Thanks again for following along with the day\u2019s events. It\u2019s been another frantic day, so let\u2019s recap: The government has met with former fire chiefs, including Greg Mullins, about the climate and bushfires. Mullins says he hopes the Coalition can look past politics and act seriously on climate change. The prime minister was not in the meeting, leaving it up to Angus Taylor and David Littleproud. Labor called for a royal commission into veterans\u2019 suicides. The government said it was open to the idea, but would need more time to consider it. The RSL national president, Greg Melick, said there had been enough inquiries, and that the problems and solutions were known and needed to be acted upon. The day began with reports that Ken Wyatt, the minister for Indigenous Australians, had handed a contract to a company linked to a Liberal donor and former candidate without an open tender. Labor used question time to attack Angus Taylor again on multiple fronts, accusing him of misleading parliament in his first ever speech, and attempting to draw Scott Morrison and Christian Porter further into the City of Sydney forged documents scandal. Taylor revealed he had not yet been interviewed by police. The government failed to produce a transcript of the phone call between Mick Fuller and Scott Morrison about the police investigation into Taylor, despite a Senate order, which prompted criticism from Labor and the Greens. Question time got fiery when Michael McCormack and Joel Fitzgibbon clashed. Fitzgibbon was ejected. McCormack became animated about his interactions with farmer protesters out the front of parliament. Those protesters had told McCormack he lacked passion and that the Nationals would not exist unless it took a bolder stand on water and the Murray-Darling Basin plan. Speaking of the Murray-Darling Basin plan, the government announced a review of its water management policies to ensure they are not inhibiting access. Anthony Albanese addressed the Labor caucus, rallying the troops and promising more pressure on what he called Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201cAngus Horribilis\u201d. See you tomorrow for another round. The emergency services minister, David Littleproud, addressed his meeting with the former chief of NSW Fire and Rescue Greg Mullins a little earlier at a press conference: What I said to Mr Mullins and the other former fire chiefs ... [was] that they can take great comfort and great pride in the new breed of fire commissioners. They have planned meticulously for this fire season. I\u2019ve only been emergency services minister since June and the first advice I got is we would expect to see the fire season start in August and be severe. Littleproud said the peak council of fire commissioners had advised that Australia has \u201csufficient assets\u201d in the form of 100 firefighting aircraft. If the season is extended and is more severe the federal government will \u201ccontinue to be agile with the states\u201d which have primary funding responsibility to provide firefighting services. It has always been the responsibility of states to look after emergency management but we support them and the federal government has proven that \u2013 we topped up last year\u2019s [funding]. Zali Steggall, the independent MP, has been on the ABC talking about the federal government\u2019s proposal for its commonwealth integrity commission. She\u2019s had a briefing from the attorney general, Christian Porter, on the design. We\u2019re still waiting to see draft legislation. It was promised by the end of the year, initially, but is now not likely until next year. Steggall still has some concerns about the proposal. From my point of view, what is still extremely important from me but also for other members of the crossbench is the issues around the referral pathway, and the ability to have open hearings. The national integrity commission needs to be seen to be holding MPs and their staff to account. There needs to be that integrity process, but also the public needs to have confidence that it is being seen to happen as well. Still on bushfires, the crossbench MP Andrew Wilkie has reiterated his calls for the defence force to develop a firefighting capability. Wilkie asked a question on the issue during question time, warning the deteriorating climate and prolonged fire seasons were making it difficult to access foreign firefighting resources. David Littleproud said he was advised there was no issue with access to resources. Wilkie has issued a statement saying he met with representatives of emergency leaders for climate action after question time. They advised him much greater investment in aerial firefighting was needed. The fact is that the national fire threat will continue to trend badly and any sensible government would see the importance of thinking strategically and planning for the future. Regardless of whether or not there are adequate firefighting resources currently, and that is arguable, there is no doubt that in years to come the country will need much greater capability and that must include a much enhanced heavy aerial firefighting capability. There is a strong argument that this will require an expanded role for the RAAF, a capability which could take years to work up, which means capability decisions need to be made by the government now. Former fire chiefs, including Greg Mullins, have met with the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and the drought minister, David Littleproud \u2013 but not Scott Morrison \u2013 to discuss their concerns about climate change. Mullins says he is hopeful the government can \u201creach out across the boundaries of politics and do more\u201d. He says the extremes being seen due to climate change are not mere \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. This is different. The science is very clear. This is driven by the burning of coal, ore and gas. I hope that the government can reach out across the boundaries of politics and say we need to do more, we need to do our bit internationally. Asked whether the government can do more than its current commitments to the Paris agreement, Mullins says: I hope so because it\u2019s simply not enough. Mullins also asked for national investment in heavy firefighting aircraft. He said they are used across states and territories and are truly a \u201cnational resource\u201d. When we\u2019ve only got seven of those nationally. When we have every state and territory burning at the same time, there\u2019s going to be a big call on their use. Labor has seized on comments from the RBA governor on subdued wage growth, made during the central bank\u2019s decision to leave rates on hold. Down in the Senate, a motion has been passed that calls on the government to include changes in the robodebt processes in the government\u2019s midyear economic update. You\u2019ll remember the government recently announced changes that would stop over-reliance on income averaging, a fundamentally flawed and frequently erroneous way of calculating welfare debts. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said including the changes in Myefo would help Australians understand what was truly changing with the robodebt system. \u201cThere are so many unanswered questions and it\u2019s absolutely outrageous that the government is once again leaving people worried and in the dark about what is happening,\u201d Siewert said. \u201cAfter all that people have been through the government owes them an explanation at the very least.\u201d Melick says there is no evidence that a royal commission would find anything different from inquiries by the productivity commission, joint standing committees or the national mental health commission. All have considered the problems with veterans\u2019 support services. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous distraction. If there\u2019d been no inquiry and we didn\u2019t know what the problem was, that\u2019d be different,\u201d he tells Sky News. The head of the Returned and Services League, Greg Melick, said he has reservations about calls for a royal commission into veterans\u2019 suicides. Melick said there have been a large number of inquiries into the issue. The recommendations were all consistent. They should be acted upon, he said. I still have reservations. I think it\u2019s counter-productive. We\u2019ve had seven inquiries in recent years.\u201d Just back on water, we\u2019ve just heard the government will review its water policies to understand whether they are unfairly inhibiting access to water. The drought minister, David Littleproud, and Mick Keelty, the inspector-general of the Murray-Darling Basin plan water resources, have just made the announcement. \u201cGovernments can\u2019t make rain, can\u2019t make water, but they can make policy,\u201d Keelty said. You can chalk that up as a win, of sorts, for the protesters who have converged on Canberra to protest the basin plan, though many of them have been calling for it to be completely scrapped. Labor used question time to pick up on where it left off yesterday: attacking the Coalition\u2019s economic management and Angus Taylor. Labor began question time by calling on the government to support a royal commission into veteran suicides. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he remains open to the idea, and will consider it further over the Christmas break. Labor moved its attack to economic management. It said the government must wake up to the \u201cfloundering\u201d economy. Morrison said debt had not grown under the Coalition. Labor later said that was misleading because debt had doubled. Anthony Albanese said Morrison had misled parliament four times in the last four sitting days. Things got rather heated when Michael McCormack got up to answer a dixer on the drought. Someone made a quip about fiery criticism of him by farmers outside parliament this morning. McCormack flung himself into a rage when Labor\u2019s Joel Fitzgibbon got up on a point of order. \u201cWhat are you standing up for? You don\u2019t stand up for anything.\u201d The ensuing high drama ended with Fitzgibbon being booted from the chamber. Labor continued the attack over the Angus Taylor controversy. It asked why the government had not complied with Senate orders to produce the transcript of the Morrison-Fuller phone call. Morrison said it was \u201cquestion time, not smear time\u201d. Taylor then confirmed he had not been interviewed by detectives. In the Senate, Simon Birmingham said the government would fully cooperate with police. Labor also attacked Taylor on the two fresh controversies. Firstly that he misled parliament in his first speech over an experience with Naomi Wolf, well-known US author. Secondly, that he failed to disclose financial interests in a company. The last question is to the veterans affairs minister, Darren Chester, who is asked on the level of support being provided to veterans. This has become an issue of importance amid growing calls for a royal commission into veteran suicides. Chester says $11bn is spent each year supporting veterans, but acknowledges more must be done. The government is listening. We do understand the concerns that are being expressed by our veteran community and the families that support them when it comes to matters of suicide prevention. And just like the prime minister, I have met with family members directly impacted by mental illness. I know some members opposite have also met with members of the defence community that have been impacted by suicide and mental wellbeing concerns. As a minister, as a government, and I\u2019m sure as a parliament, we all agree the only acceptable number for us all when it comes to veterans\u2019 suicide in Australian defence force personnel, the only acceptable number for us all is zero.\u201d Senate question time ends with a very fiery exchange about whether Simon Birmingham can guarantee that government staff will be available for interview by the police on NSW strike force Garrad investigating the use of a falsified document by Angus Taylor to attack Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore. Birmingham said that the government will \u201ccooperate with the police\u201d. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt notes that that is what Michaelia Cash had said about the AWU raid leak matter, but then she provided a written statement and refused to be interviewed. Penny Wong shouts: \u201cYou\u2019re hiding staff! What\u2019s so hard about making staff available?\u201d Mathias Cormann labelled the referral to the NSW police \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. Birmingham noted that the record of the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, on police referrals is \u201ceight zero \u2013 zero findings\u201d (of criminal guilt). The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, asks Christian Porter: Malcolm Turnbull, former judge David Ipp, and Icac counsel assisting Geoffrey Watson have all labelled Scott Morrison\u2019s phone call to NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller inappropriate. Why was it made? Christian Porter responds that Dreyfus\u2019s judgment hasn\u2019t been so flash hot. Porter is referring to the eight police referrals Labor have made without any charges. Your judgment is just simply awful. Absolutely awful. And I know that you\u2019re very interested in the next time that you might be able to exercise your judgement, perhaps as a judge on a court of appeal.\u201d Labor\u2019s Tony Burke asks a cheeky question about Angus Taylor\u2019s first speech to parliament, in which he recalled living as a student alongside Naomi Wolf, a famed US author. In Taylor\u2019s version, she wanted to remove a Christmas tree in case people were offended, something he described as \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. Wolf, you may have heard, was not at Oxford at the time. In fact, she was on the other side of the world touring her new book. Burke asks: Given that the minister has been misleading the parliament since the day he arrived, is he proud of his consistency, that he has continued his career as he began it?\u201d Needless to say the question is not allowed. In the Senate, Labor\u2019s Catryna Bilyk is asking about this report by Sarah Martin about a bullying complaint against National Llew O\u2019Brien. The agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, confirms only that the Nationals have a process for investigating bullying complaints, but she first dodges then rejects the part of the question about whether her handling of the dairy code of conduct is the cause of tensions in the Nationals. McKenzie: \u201cI reject the second part of that long-winded question.\u201d Labor\u2019s Mark Butler picks up the attack on Angus Taylor. He asks further questions about an alleged failure to declare interests in a company GFA F1 Pty Ltd. The interest is held through another entity, Farm Partnerships Australia. Taylor\u2019s office has issued a statement saying he needs to declare only \u201cdirect and controlling interests\u201d. Taylor is asked whether he supports that interpretation of the rules. The attorney general, Christian Porter, jumps up to answer the question. He says that\u2019s always the way interests have been declared. The way in which that disclosure has always occurred is where there is a trust or where there is a company with interests in subsidiaries, the trust is declared, the company is declared, but those things inside the trust or the subsidiaries are declared by virtue of declaring the head company or the trust.\u201d Scott Morrison is asked another question on the Angus Taylor scandal. This time it\u2019s about why the government has not released a transcript of the Morrison-Fuller call, despite a Senate order to do so. He responds: I advise the members opposite, this is question time, not smear time.\u201d Burn. He then goes on to explain. Mr Speaker, it is the practice of governments of either persuasion to claim exemption from Senate orders for various reasons where disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. In the case of the former government, they claimed those on numerous occasions on matters of freedom of information, Australian road rules, Australian vehicle standards rules. They claimed it in relation to carbon permits, the Australia network on communications policies, on any number of occasions, Mr Speaker.\u201d Morrison says he will respond to the police investigation when it concludes. He then challenges Anthony Albanese to hold his side to the same standards it is demanding of the government. That is, that ministers would resign if they come under investigation before an investigation concludes. And if he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s just the hypocrite people know him to be.\u201d Morrison withdraws that last bit. Angus Taylor is asked whether he has been interviewed by detectives attached to strike force Garrad, which is investigating allegations Taylor relied on a forged document to attack Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore. Taylor answers simply: \u201cNo.\u201d Over in the upper house, Labor has asked the agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, when she became aware Nationals senator Perin Davey had arranged a meeting between irrigators concerned with the Murray-Darling Basin plan and the water resources minister, David Littleproud. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt heckles \u201cYou\u2019ve been bypassed\u201d, and McKenzie replies that she heard earlier in the week. Glenn Sterle follows up by asking if McKenzie was invited. McKenzie says \u201cI\u2019m not invited to a lot\u201d of stakeholder meetings, in the same way that defence and skills ministers are not invited to every meeting. She says it is entirely appropriate that the meeting was organised with the water resources minister. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is attacking Labor for talking down Australia\u2019s economy. Economic management has been the focus of Labor\u2019s early attention in question time this week. Frydenberg: Now it\u2019s probably the first time and the last time I\u2019ll say it in this place but the leader of the opposition should listen to Wayne Swan when he says: \u2018It\u2019s important our political leaders not be out there talking down the economy. Relentless negativity from the doomsayers insults the hard work so many Australians put in to make our economy strong.\u2019 \u201c Scott Morrison is then again pressed on misleading the parliament. Anthony Albanese accuses him of misleading parliament in each of the last four sitting days. Morrison responds that Albanese is treating parliament like a \u201csecond-rate high school debating chamber\u201d with his \u201cstunts and his clever little lines\u201d. Labor accuses the prime minister of misleading parliament by claiming the government has not increased debt. Labor\u2019s Jim Chalmers says the government has doubled Australia\u2019s debt. Scott Morrison describes Chalmers as \u201cObi Swan\u2019s padawan\u201d in his response. it is a complex sort of thing for him to understand. Because in the Labor party they haven\u2019t had a surplus since 1989.\u201d Andrew Wilkie has a question on problems with access to firefighting assets and equipment during the elongated bushfire season. He asks: Prime minister, access to foreign heavy firefighting aircraft is now problematic as the northern and southern hemisphere fire seasons overlap due to climate change, while domestic resources are stretched to fight simultaneous fires across Australia. Despite this, my repeated calls for a specialised RAAF capability have been dismissed by the government every time. The reality is that aid to the civil community is an accepted use of ADF assets, and existing RAAF aircraft, like the C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Hercules and C-120 Spartan could water-bomb. Would you now direct defence to develop a heavy firefighting aircraft capability?\u201d David Littleproud responds to the crux of the question. He says he\u2019s been assured by the Australasian fire and emergency service authorities council that the current access to equipment is suitable. They also, in that letter, outlined the fact that they are comfortable with the arrangements we currently have with the Australian defence force and the support they provide, logistic support they provide our firefighters.\u201d Just away from question time temporarily, Paul Karp filed this from the Coalition party room earlier: At the Coalition joint party room, Scott Morrison suggested that all options are on the table on the issue of veterans\u2019 mental health. While he didn\u2019t explicitly say the Coalition is considering a royal commission, he said it is \u201cgiving active consideration to what further action we can take\u201d over the Christmas period. Morrison addressed the government\u2019s decision to delay the religious discrimination bill, thanking the attorney general, Christian Porter, for his work to date and acknowledging that \u201cwithin the party room there are different views \u2013 even more so across the community\u201d. Morrison said the government was \u201cseeking the time to get this right\u201d and credited the fact that \u201ca listening and respect has been shown in the drafting process to date\u201d. Morrison wants the bill to bring people together on matters of faith and belief, and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want a partisan element to this process\u201d to ensure smooth passage of the bill through parliament \u2013 an interesting hint that perhaps the Coalition needs Labor support to legislate it. Morrison said the government was not backing down on the ensuring integrity bill \u2013 which will now be reintroduced to parliament. Morrison also made some comparisons between his government and that of John Howard: In the term from 2001 and 2004, the Howard government was able to deliver based on the groundwork they had laid in the previous six years of government \u2013 as we seek to do in this term. One backbencher asked the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, about penalties for banking executives - suggesting that fines hit shareholders so perhaps personal penalties for executives was the way to go. Frydenberg responded that penalties had been increased but it was important to get the balance right so banks keep lending. The prime minister said there are provisions which allow for removal of individuals from the banking sector. Labor continues to press its attack on the Coalition\u2019s economic management. It results in the predictable response: Labor\u2019s all about taxing and spending. Things have gotten slightly out of control in the House. People seem upset. There\u2019s some yelling. Some name-calling. It\u2019s been a long year, I suppose. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, gets up to answer a question. Evidently someone makes a quip about his, er, less-than-friendly interaction with farmers outside parliament this morning. McCormack thunders in response: Didn\u2019t see you out there ... And I didn\u2019t see any of the members for Labor out the front this morning. I always come up and talk to farmers, because farmers are the lifeblood of this nation.\u201d Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon stands to raise a point of order. McCormack: Oh! We\u2019ve got a bit of reaction. What are you standing up for? You don\u2019t stand up for anything.\u201d McCormack continues on. Fitzgibbon gets up again. McCormack: What a soft touch you are.\u201d The Speaker is telling everyone to sit down. Morrison is asked a dixer on the economy. He says the government is bringing the budget into surplus, not increasing taxes, and not growing debt. Jim Chalmers, the shadow treasurer, asks a question on the same topic: what will it take to wake the government up to the \u201cfloundering economy\u201d? Frydenberg responds: When it comes to real wages, they have been growing at 0. 6%, and when we came to government, they were 0. 5%, Mr Speaker. I\u2019m pleased to tell the House that employment growth is at 2%, and when we came to government it was around a third, Mr Speaker, of that. And at 2%, it\u2019s more than double the OECD average, Mr Speaker. And I\u2019m pleased to tell the House that since we\u2019ve come to government, more than 1.4m new jobs have been created, Mr Speaker. And I\u2019m pleased to tell the House that today the ABS have announced the current account surplus is the highest on record.\u201d Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese begins question time with a call for the government to support a royal commission into veteran suicide. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the suicide rate is far too high among veterans. This has been a matter that has been made a national priority by my government.\u201d Morrison says the government will continue to reflect on the issue of a royal commission over the Christmas break. I have remained open to this question and I remain open to this question.\u201d He says every time a veteran suicides, there \u201cmust be justice\u201d. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org. Bill Shorten is making a 90-second speech in the lower house on disability. Today is the international day of disabled persons, he says. Not everything is positive for Australians with a disability. They finish school less; they have lower home ownership; they\u2019re poorer; they experience higher unemployment. Carers retire with less income themselves and they experience discrimination on the daily basis. But this is not the natural order of things.\u201d Malcolm Roberts is on Sky News about One Nation\u2019s shock decision to deny the government passage of its union busting legislation on Friday. Roberts reckons it was all about the merits of the bill, and not about a certain Queensland election and a possible union campaign against the party. We voted on the merits at the end of it. We fired a shot across the union\u2019s bow.\u201d A little earlier, a group of civil society organisations gathered at Parliament House to demand the government rule out any changes to secondary boycott laws. Secondary boycotts have become an important tool in driving social change. But they have drawn the ire of government. Scott Morrison recently told the Queensland Resources Council they were \u201ca potentially more insidious threat to the Queensland economy and jobs and living standards than a street protest\u201d. Morrison at the time pledged to introduce mechanisms to outlaw what he said were \u201cindulgent and selfish practices\u201d. Oxfam, 350 Australia, Market Forces, the Australia Institute, the Australian Conservation Foundation and Uniting Church in Australia gathered to call for the government to rule out new laws outlawing secondary boycotts. They were backed by Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who said such a move would impinge on democratic rights. \u201cAustralians of all political persuasions value their rights and freedoms to support products, services and companies that align with their values,\u201d she said. \u201cMore and more Australians are using their consumer power to make good environmental choices and their right to do so should be protected.\u201d Labor senator Catryna Bilyk is continuing. She asks the government senators: \u201cIs this really why you entered politics? Was it really to deny healthcare to vulnerable people?\u201d The Senate is back debating the medevac repeal bill. Liberal senator Sam McMahon is warning of doom and death if the medevac law is allowed to stand. She says medevac is a weakening of Australia\u2019s sovereign borders. Labor senator Catryna Bilyk says the government believes \u201cwe can\u2019t protect our borders and be compassionate at the same time\u201d. This debate is likely to stretch on for some time. We still haven\u2019t heard from Jacqui Lambie. Katy Gallagher, Labor senator, is on the warpath over the government\u2019s refusal to provide the Morrison-Fuller transcript. She tells the Senate the government\u2019s explanation that it\u2019s not in the public interest to release the documents is \u201cridiculous\u201d, when \u201cwe\u2019ve got the prime minister calling his friend ... who\u2019s just announced they\u2019re investigating one of his ministers\u201d. What are they hiding? Through this whole scandal with minister Taylor, the question I keep coming back to is: why aren\u2019t they just informing the public? Who is minister Taylor protecting?\u201d Cormann\u2019s response to the order to produce the Morrison-Fuller transcript has been tabled. The full text of the letter is below. Dear president, I refer to the motion moved by the leader of the opposition in the Senate, senator the hon Penny Wong, and agreed by the Senate on 2 December 2019, requesting documents associated with a phone call between the prime minister and the commissioner of the New South Wales police force that took place on Tuesday 26 November 2019. To assist the Senate, I refer first to the answers and statements that the prime minister has made and tabled in the House of Representatives. This includes an outline of the substance of the call and confirmation that the nature of the call was appropriate. As the NSW police commissioner has said: \u2018The prime minister didn\u2019t ask me any questions that were inappropriate. He didn\u2019t ask for anything that was inappropriate and I\u2019m comfortable with the discussion we had over a few minutes.\u2019 Plainly any documents of the kinds requested, if they existed, would not be able to be produced as they would properly be the subject of public interest immunity. That immunity would arise because the matter concerns police inquiries by state authorities. Kind regards, Mathias Cormann Labor is furious at the government\u2019s response to an order to produce the transcript of the Morrison-Fuller phone call about the Angus Taylor police investigation. The Labor leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, read the government\u2019s response to the Senate after it was provided to her at the outset of Senate proceedings by the finance minister, Mathias Cormann. The letter simply referred the Senate to previous answers and said the documents would be subject to a public interest immunity claim because they relate to a police investigation. Wong: This is transparency from the Morrison government. This is the transparency and integrity, or lack thereof from the Morrison government.\u201d Greens senator Nick McKim says it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that the government has not provided notes or a transcript of the Morrison-Fuller phone call about Angus Taylor. We are left with only two conclusions that can be drawn here. One is that there are notes or a transcript and senator Cormann has refused to comply with an order of the Senate. Or secondly the prime minister and the attorney general are running such shambolic offices and such a shambolic government that they would struggle to organise a beer in a brewery. Now, it\u2019s one or the other.\u201d The Senate ordered the government to produce a transcript and associated documents for the call between Scott Morrison and Mick Fuller about the Angus Taylor investigation. Some news out of Queensland. The ABC is reporting that the LNP is taking disciplinary action against young LNP members over an online video showing one of its branch leaders laughing at comments about Indigenous Australians. The video was published on the Gold Coast Young LNP Facebook page. A teenager in the video said: \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve got to stop celebrating a culture that couldn\u2019t even invent the bloody wheel for God\u2019s sake. We\u2019ve got to start enjoying and living in western culture.\u201d Gold Coast Young LNP\u2019s chairman, Barclay McGain, was conducting the interviews. The ABC reports that those involved in the video would face \u201cinternal disciplinary\u201d action. The video has been removed. The Senate is sitting and Labor\u2019s Penny Wong is straight on the attack. Her target? Angus Taylor, of course. She\u2019s criticising Taylor for providing no evidence to support his claim that the falsified document he relied on when attacking the Sydney lord mayor Clover Mooore came from the City of Sydney\u2019s website. I\u2019ve got to say, I wonder whether his colleagues are sitting there as they have to defend yet another Angus stuff up... \u2018what does he reckon he\u2019s doing, what does he reckon his job is. and why is the energy minister picking a fight with the lord mayor of Sydney?\u2019. NSW police are investigating the matter and Scott Morrison stoked controversy by calling the police chief Mick Fuller for an update on the status of the investigation. Labor used the Senate to order the production of documents relating to the call, including a transcript. They received a one-page letter and no transcript. It is a scandal that demonstrates yet again that this government under Scott Morrison they don\u2019t like scrutiny, they don\u2019t like transparency, and they certainly don\u2019t like accountability. Labor MPs have resolved to move an amendment to a government push to change the Customs Act, which will change the way the product-specific rules of origin of six of Australia\u2019s free trade agreements are given effect domestically. As Katharine Murphy has previously explained, the change would limit scrutiny, making some regulations (including provisions covering dumping, where countries \u201cdump\u201d goods in other markets at super cheap prices to try to expand market share) unable to be disallowed by the parliament. Amid concern from some Labor MPs about the proposal, MPs have agreed to put forward an amendment to protect the parliamentary oversight of the use disallowable instruments. Disallowable instruments are rules that must be tabled and are open to parliamentary veto or disallowance for a set period, usually 15 sitting days. If the party\u2019s amendments are not supported, Labor will vote against the bill. It was an otherwise uneventful caucus meeting after Albanese\u2019s earlier colourful comments, with the party agreeing to support a raft of non-controversial legislation. After Labor agreed to call a royal commission into veterans\u2019 suicide, one MP also raised the issue of Indigenous suicide. Albanese said that he was \u201cvery conscious\u201d of the importance of the issue and hoped to continue to work with the government on a bipartisan basis to address it. The press gallery took on the pollies in basketball this morning. Looks from the photos like the journos employed a fairly deliberate strategy: bashing Ed Husic out of the game (Husic in headlock, Husic at bottom of pile-on). Seems a sound tactic to me. But, alas, the journos went down. Mike Bowers was down there for all the colour. Ged Kearney, Labor MP, is speaking on the medevac repeal bill which is before the Senate. The critical vote rests with Jacqui Lambie, who is reportedly ready to give her support if the government agrees to the New Zealand resettlement deal, which would take the current cohort off Manus and Nauru. The government has shown little appetite for that proposal. Kearney is asked whether securing the New Zealand deal would be a better outcome than salvaging medevac. She tells Sky News the Australian government can do the New Zealand deal and keep medevac. That deal can be done anyway. We can have our cake and eat it too.\u201d She said the laws have nothing to do with national security. The minister can still refuse medical transfers on the grounds of national security. We have to remember that it\u2019s about people getting care when they are ill. And these people are seriously ill.\u201d John Barilaro, the deputy NSW premier, has been speaking on the Murray-Darling Basin plan. He is threatening to walk away from it (again) if changes are not made to better suit NSW. Barliaro has a list of demands to be met by the federal government. He wants more water written out of the plan and for water management plans to be deferred until the end of the drought. \u201cIf this plan does not work for NSW, we will have to walk away,\u201d he said. Barilaro is asked whether Gladys Berejiklian, the premier, knows of his announcement. He doesn\u2019t directly answer the question. But he says the opportunity for the federal government to negotiate with NSW is now. He says the commonwealth gave some indication last night that it was ready to talk. We\u2019ll have more on this story shortly. One new fact out of Labor caucus this morning: the opposition will introduce a private senators\u2019 bill to make amendments to the encryption legislation to try to force the government to make improvements agreed by a bipartisan committee report last year. Labor passed the encryption legislation in the final week of parliament in 2018, later accusing the Coalition of reneging on a deal to make amendments including improving protections against the creation of \u201csystemic weaknesses\u201d. In a joint statement Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally, Mark Dreyfus, Michelle Rowland, Claire O\u2019Neil and Tim Watts said it was one year since the government broke its promise to Australia\u2019s tech sector \u201cputting a handbrake on the digital economy, and hindering the creation of jobs, productivity and growth of the economy\u201d. They said: Some customers are less likely to seek out contracts with Australian technology companies due to a widespread perception that Australia\u2019s encryption laws may require them to introduce systemic weaknesses into their systems ... This is why Labor is repairing the Morrison government\u2019s encryption laws by introducing legislation based on bipartisan recommendations of the [parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security], those agreed to by Liberal committee members and promised by Mathias Cormann a year ago.\u201d Another amendment would require judicial authorisation before law enforcement authorities can use their new powers to compel tech companies to provide assistance or create capabilities to enable spying on customers. This is designed to address concerns that the encryption legislation is not compliant with the US CLOUD Act, which Labor says will imperil cooperation between US and Australian law enforcement. The bill will be introduced tomorrow and debated in the new year. The Murray-Darling Basin plan protesters have made their way to the headquarters of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation. The protest places the NFF in a tricky position. The organisation agrees the basin plan needs to be improved but it has split with protesters on their demand that it be scrapped altogether. Tony Mahar, chief executive of the NFF, spoke to the protesters outside his office. \u201cWe want to see change, I can assure you of that,\u201d he said. He says the NFF will lobby for Mick Keelty, the inspector general of Murray\u2013Darling Basin water resources, to have the proper powers to take action where needed. \u201cWe want to see change. We want to see the basin plan fixed.\u201d Labor has issued a full statement on its decision to call for a royal commission into veteran suicide. It reads: Labor has announced today it will support a royal commission into veteran suicide. Official figures released last week showed a disturbingly high rate of suicide among current and ex-service men and women, with more than 400 deaths since 2001. This Australian Institute of Health and Welfare research indicated that suicide rates for current and former defence personnel compared to the rest of the Australian population are higher than ever. Australia can no longer tolerate this senseless loss of life. This is nothing less than a crisis and as a nation we need to do all we can to tackle this. Labor believes the best way to do this is through a thorough and comprehensive royal commission. We are calling on the Morrison government to do the right thing by our ex-service men and women, and establish a royal commission into veteran suicide as soon as possible. This will help to shine a light on the issue, investigate why so many of our veterans are taking their own lives, and determine what measures are needed to stop these tragic deaths. The terms of reference should include serving men and women, their transition from active service back to civilian life, and their ongoing circumstances. The men and women who serve our country deserve our gratitude and respect, and we owe it to them to have a comprehensive examination of how we can reduce, and hopefully eliminate, these tragic numbers. Their deaths are heartbreaking and cause immeasurable loss and grief for their loved ones left behind, their local communities, and indeed the nation. We know many veterans and veterans\u2019 families have been calling for this for some time now \u2013 they want to prevent future suicides and other families from suffering in the way they have. And we have listened to courageous advocates like Julie-Ann Finney, whose son David took his own life in February this year after a battle with PTSD. Labor Members of Parliament have met with Ms Finney and she has made a strong case for a Royal Commission. We want this to be a bipartisan effort \u2013 we want to work with the Government, the Parliament and the veteran community and do all we can to address the scourge of veteran suicide. Just a reminder that parliament will not sit until midday to allow for caucus and party room meetings. Mike Bowers was down in Labor\u2019s caucus where eader Anthony Albanese was given a standing ovation. Albanese says Labor will continue to pursue Scott Morrison over his \u201cAngus horribilis\u201d, a line that gets a decent guffaw from the Labor faithful. The test for this bloke isn\u2019t whether a crime has been committed, although that\u2019s being investigated by the strike force Garrad \u2013 someone has a sense of humour. The test is has he misled parliament? That\u2019s the test to be a minister.\u201d If you don\u2019t understand that strike force Garrad gag, look up Garrad on urban dictionary. He looks forward to Labor\u2019s strategy for the end of the year. He says the party will examine media reforms and measures to strengthen democracy. Labor will have the first meeting of its national policy committee on Friday. It\u2019s all about confidence, he says. We will go into 2020 with confidence. Confidence that we can hold this government to account. Confidence that we can defeat legislation. Confidence that we can present an alternative vision for this nation and an alternative vision that\u2019s based on fairness, that\u2019s based on creating wealth but also is concerned about its distribution. Confidence that we can deal with climate change with a plan which creates jobs, lowers emissions and lowers emergency prices.Confidence that we can stand up for Australia\u2019s view in international forums.\u201d Albanese says when Scott Morrison says \u201cquiet Australians\u201d he really means \u201cshut up and listen to me\u201d. This prompts some applause. We won\u2019t be quiet. Australians won\u2019t be quiet. It\u2019s not our nature as a people. We\u2019re upfront. We\u2019re bold. We talk about things. We put forward our view.\u201d Albanese is now paying tribute to Labor\u2019s Senate team for their work opposing the union-busting laws which were defeated on Friday. He tells caucus that the people in this room \u201cmade a difference\u201d. Every single senator spoke and last Friday I went to Australia\u2019s largest union \u2013 the nurses and midwives \u2013 and there we celebrated what was a great victory for working people. But also I want to say that it says something about this movement. We don\u2019t shy away from our connection with the trade union movement. I\u2019m a proud trade unionist. Without trade unions, we wouldn\u2019t have the working conditions that enable us to enjoy the Australian way of life that we all enjoy today.\u201d Albanese is now talking about Labor\u2019s calls for a royal commission into veteran suicides. He speaks of meeting Julie-Ann Finney, the mother of a former sailor who killed himself after suffering PTSD. I spoke to Julie-Ann Finney this morning. It was a difficult conversation with her. She is a remarkable woman and an incredible advocate and there is no one who could sit in a room with her and have a discussion and not come to the view that I came to. She said today that for her, \u2018a royal commission \u2013 I quote her and I asked for her permission to do that \u2013 ... is an act of love, compassion and gratitude for her son.\u2019 That\u2019s the way that these people feel.\u201d Albanese pays tribute to Bill Shorten and Linda Burney for the work they did to oppose the robodebt system. He then turns to aged care. The fact that 16,000 older Australians who were entitled \u2013 had been ticked off \u2013 to get home care died while waiting for that care. And of course we know the bloke who ripped the money out of aged care was Scott Morrison, as treasurer.\u201d Albanese describes Scott Morrison as \u201can ad man with no plan\u201d. An ad man who dismisses any form of accountability. Who regards democracy as an inconvenience. This mob shut down debate, shut down questions from the media ... dismissing them as just gossip or just in the bubble, don\u2019t want to be accountable. And the fact is that we have a job to hold them to account, hold them account on behalf of working people.\u201d Albanese continues: We have a circumstance whereby the Reserve Bank is saying that low wages is the new norm, the new norm. How is it the case that in 2019, at a time when there is no global financial crisis ... how is it that low wages are the new norm? We know, because Mathias Cormann told us that it\u2019s a deliberate design feature of government policy. Low wages. He has said it from his own mouth.\u201d The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, is addressing caucus. He says Labor is moving forward. \u201cThat\u2019s more than you can say for this economy,\u201d he quips. Albanese says working people are struggling. What\u2019s the government\u2019s response? They\u2019ve never had it so good. That\u2019s the approach we see, the arrogance, the hubris, that we see every day in question time.\u201d I\u2019ve lost count of the Angus Taylor controversies, but at least two new ones emerged yesterday. One was sprung by Labor in question time. It says Taylor failed to declare an interest in a company named GFA F1 Pty Ltd. Taylor has a partnership interest in the company through a separate venture, Farm Partnerships Australia, which he has declared appropriately. But he hasn\u2019t named an interest in GFA F1 on his pecuniary interests register. Labor isn\u2019t alleging there is any conflict of interest. The second issue to pop up was on the stranger side. In Taylor\u2019s first speech to parliament, he spoke of his memories of Christmas while studying at Oxford. He remembered \u201ca young Naomi Wolf\u201d, now a well-known US author and journalist, wanting to remove a Christmas tree from the common room \u201cbecause some people might be offended\u201d. Taylor described his outrage at this form of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. Wolf subsequently raised the small issue of her not actually being in Oxford at the time of Taylor\u2019s memory, and accused him of an \u201canti-semitic dogwhistle\u201d. \u201cI was a Rhodes scholar in Oxford 1985-88,\u201d Wolf said on Twitter. \u201cAngus Taylor recalls me in a fever dream at Oxford in 1991 among those warring on Xmas. I was in NYC. Plus I love Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa. Flattered to be on this mythological hate list.\u201d Mark Butler has just been on Sky News, talking about these various controversies. On Taylor\u2019s defence of failing to declare an interest in GFA F1: The corollary of what he said is that a resources minister would only be obliged to disclose the fact they had BHP shares if they have a sufficient number of those shares to control the company. That is utterly ridiculous.\u201d On the Oxford student story: So again Angus Taylor has misled the parliament. It just gives you the sense that this guy makes stuff up.\u201d Of course, the issue continuing to pose the most trouble for Taylor is that he relied on a falsified document to attack Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore, for her travel-related emissions. WikiLeaks\u2019 editor-in-chief, Kristinn Hrafnsson, is also in Canberra this morning. He\u2019s trying to raise Australian support for the imprisoned Julian Assange. He\u2019ll be speaking at the National Press Club a little later. Assange is on remand in London\u2019s maximum security Belmarsh prison while the US seeks to extradite him for soliciting, obtaining and publishing secret documents. The trial is set down for February. Hrafnsson says the case should concern all journalists. He told the ABC earlier: It sets a very serious precedent. It means that no journalist anywhere in the world is safe if the empire decides that some publication is an embarrassment, they can go after that journalist. and they will do, that is absolutely a certainty.\u201d Assange has already won support from unlikely quarters. Barnaby Joyce has voiced his support for Assange, as has the former prime minister Kevin Rudd. We hope that many more will come on board as well. It is helping. It is very important to hear these voices and to get their input and to show that this goes noticed. We see this as not a partisan issue. This is a cross-party fight where we hope that everyone comes on board despite their differences, because it\u2019s of upmost importance.\u201d Nationals Damian Drum and Michael McCormack have been down to see the Murray-Darling Basin protesters out the front of parliament. And boy, did they cop it. The farmers\u2019 frustrations were there for all to see. Mike Bowers was there and reports that the anger was palpable. Sky News had to apologise to viewers for all the swears, so you know it was bad. Drum was trying to calm everyone down. He says the public is now on the side of the farmers, after apparently abandoning them following reports about the Menindee fish kills earlier in the year. Now they\u2019re saying no, we want to put the farmers first, so right now is the opportunity. We can take the sentiment that exists in Melbourne, the sentiment in Sydney, in Brisbane.\u201d A protester, John Russell, is berating McCormack for not crossing the floor against the Liberals to stand up for farmers. The Nationals won\u2019t exist after the next election if they don\u2019t show some spine, he says: Where\u2019s the passion? I haven\u2019t seen any passion from you. You\u2019re like a poker player.\u201d Also in that interview, Mark Dreyfus denied any suggestion that Labor\u2019s referral of Angus Taylor to police was a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d. Absolutely not. The referral to the NSW police is because, on the face of it, it looks like a criminal offence may have been committed. It wouldn\u2019t be necessary to make this referral ... if Angus Taylor and Scott Morrison properly disclosed just what happened in Angus Taylor\u2019s office. On the face of it, Angus Taylor has misled the parliament. It\u2019s an obviously forged document and we don\u2019t know where it came from. It\u2019s scandalous that neither Angus Taylor nor Scott Morrison has launched an investigation.\u201d The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has called for a royal commission into the shocking rates of veteran suicides in Australia. Albanese says: The fact is we\u2019re not doing enough in this area and that\u2019s why the call for a royal commission is reasonable. This is one that\u2019s been led, not by politicians; this has been led by the families of veterans.\u201d The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has been on Sky News also discussing the urgent need for a royal commission. He says the situation cannot be allowed to stand. There\u2019s a shocking rate of suicides among our veterans. These are men and women who have served our country overseas and we can\u2019t continue with the situation where we have a much higher suicide rate than the general population. The right way to investigate this is with a royal commission ... That\u2019s what we need to get some answers.\u201d Just a quick summary of what we\u2019re expecting from today. Labor will continue its pressure on Angus Taylor over the controversy now engulfing him, the prime minister and the attorney general. Taylor relied on a falsified document to attack Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore. The revelations prompted a police referral from Labor, and NSW police have set up a taskforce to investigate. The scandal was moved along further by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, who called the NSW police chief, Mick Fuller, a personal acquaintance, to check up on the investigation. We now know Christian Porter, the attorney general, was also on that call. The Coalition has accused Labor of \u201cvexatious\u201d and frivolous referrals to police. The medevac repeal legislation will be debated again by the Senate today. The independent senator Jacqui Lambie still holds the critical vote, and faces lobbying from both sides. Lambie is yet to make her position clear. New figures were conveniently leaked to the Australian this morning suggesting more than one-third of asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea and Nauru have applied for transfer under the laws. As we mentioned, Ken Wyatt, minister for Indigenous Australians, is under pressure over reports that he handed a contract to the company of a Liberal donor and former candidate without tender. The report in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age suggested the contract was awarded contrary to internal advice. The Murray-Darling Basin plan protesters are still camped out the front of Parliament House. The protests are placing pressure on the Nationals. Many of their traditional constituents are furious with the government\u2019s treatment of the basin, and want the basin plan scrapped or paused. Labor is also calling again for a royal commission into veteran suicides, saying it is unacceptable that those who served Australia face a higher suicide rate than the general population. Stay with us. We\u2019ll keep across all the developments as they happen. Hello dear readers. Welcome to another day in the mad house. It\u2019s Christopher Knaus here again, filling in for Amy Remeikis. I\u2019ll be here with you all week. There\u2019s plenty on. The Murray Darling Basin protestors are still in Canberra in relative force. We\u2019re expecting another day of debate on the medevac repeal bill. And there\u2019s likely to be follow-up to the revelation that Christian Porter was in the room for Scott Morrison\u2019s controversial call to NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller but did not seek advice about what he said was a \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cbasic\u201d call. The call related to an active investigation into cabinet minister Angus Taylor following revelations in the Guardian that he relied on falsified documents to attack the Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore. But the major story of the morning concerns Ken Wyatt, the minister for Indigenous Australians. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age have reported that he awarded a $2.2m contract to a Liberal donor-linked company. The contract did not go to tender, and had the company conduct Indigenous eye surgeries at double the market rate. It was awarded despite internal objections, the papers reported.",

The demonstrators will seek to highlight one of the most contentious legislative moves made by Alec: 2010 Arizona law SB1070, which heralded the most extreme crackdown on undocumented migrants then seen in the US under a model bill <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/10/28/130833741/prison-economics-help-drive-ariz-immigration-law\">drafted at an Alec conference</a> the previous year.</p> <p>The report, produced by CCR with Dream Defenders, Palestine Legal, the Red Nation and the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, calls Alec a \u201chighly effective incubator and platform for spreading a broad swath of corporate and conservative policies\u201d.</p> <p>The network, it says, amounts to a \u201cshadow state apparatus\u201d in which \u201cprivate industry seizes control of the authority of the state, writing legislation and public policy for the general public behind the closed doors of a CEO suite\u201d.</p> <p>To support its contention that Alec is responsible for strengthening white supremacy, the joint report cites four of the network\u2019s most hotly disputed policy interventions.</p> <p>The first are the \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d laws that became notorious after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/13/trayvon-martin-parents-racism-alive-and-well-in-america\">the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin</a>, an unarmed black teenager who was shot by George Zimmerman in a gated community in Florida.</p> <p>In 2005, Florida had passed a \u201cCastle Doctrine\u201d law, SB 436, that extended the right to \u201cstand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force\u201d to anyone in any public place who \u201creasonably believes\u201d it is necessary to do so \u201cto prevent death or great bodily harm\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.prwatch.org/files/NRA_2005.png\">law was picked up by Alec</a> and turned into a model bill that, as the report points out, has now been adopted in some form in 27 states.</p> <p>Alec <a href=\"https://www.alec.org/press-release/alec-statement-on-stand-your-ground-legislation-32612/\">insists it has never backed legislation</a> allowing gun owners to attack people who pose no imminent threat and that it no longer lends its name to any \u201cstand your ground\u201d law.</p> <p>The joint report argues the damage has already been done.</p> <p>It cites studies that show that states that have adopted such laws are much more likely to rule homicides justifiable in cases of white-on-black killings than states that have not adopted such laws.</p> <p>The second example used in the report is voter ID bills that require proof of identity in order to vote. CCR and its co-authors locate these efforts as part of the long history in the US of attempts to disenfranchise people of colour.</p> <p>In 2009 Alec approved a \u201cvoter ID act\u201d produced by one of its \u201ctask forces\u201d that devise new model legislation.

      "bodyText": "Alec, the rightwing network that brings conservative lawmakers together with corporate lobbyists to create model legislation that is cloned across the US, has been accused of spreading racist and white supremacist policies targeted at minority communities. A report published on Tuesday by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and other advocacy groups charges Alec with propagating white supremacy. In one of the sharpest criticisms yet levelled at the controversial \u201cbill mill\u201d, the authors warn that \u201cconservative and corporate interests have captured our political process to harness profit, further entrench white supremacy in the law, and target the safety, human rights and self-governance of marginalised communities\u201d. The publication comes on the eve of the latest gathering of Alec, officially known as the American Legislative Exchange Council, which will be attended by hundreds of largely Republican state-level legislators and their big business allies. The four-day States &amp; Nation Policy Summit will open at a resort in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Wednesday with an agenda touching on several of Alec\u2019s core principles including \u201celection integrity\u201d, privatisation of education and support for homeschooling, and protection for pharmaceutical companies. Watchdogs have also learned of a dinner to be held on Wednesday and jointly hosted by Alec and the Alliance Defending Freedom, an anti-LGBT coalition devoted to re-criminalising homosexuality in the US in the name of Christianity. The Alec summit will be picketed by protesters convened by organisations at the forefront of the race equality movement such as Black Lives Matter and Puente Arizona. The demonstrators will seek to highlight one of the most contentious legislative moves made by Alec: 2010 Arizona law SB1070, which heralded the most extreme crackdown on undocumented migrants then seen in the US under a model bill drafted at an Alec conference the previous year. The report, produced by CCR with Dream Defenders, Palestine Legal, the Red Nation and the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, calls Alec a \u201chighly effective incubator and platform for spreading a broad swath of corporate and conservative policies\u201d. The network, it says, amounts to a \u201cshadow state apparatus\u201d in which \u201cprivate industry seizes control of the authority of the state, writing legislation and public policy for the general public behind the closed doors of a CEO suite\u201d. To support its contention that Alec is responsible for strengthening white supremacy, the joint report cites four of the network\u2019s most hotly disputed policy interventions. The first are the \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d laws that became notorious after the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was shot by George Zimmerman in a gated community in Florida. In 2005, Florida had passed a \u201cCastle Doctrine\u201d law, SB 436, that extended the right to \u201cstand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force\u201d to anyone in any public place who \u201creasonably believes\u201d it is necessary to do so \u201cto prevent death or great bodily harm\u201d. The law was picked up by Alec and turned into a model bill that, as the report points out, has now been adopted in some form in 27 states. Alec insists it has never backed legislation allowing gun owners to attack people who pose no imminent threat and that it no longer lends its name to any \u201cstand your ground\u201d law. The joint report argues the damage has already been done. It cites studies that show that states that have adopted such laws are much more likely to rule homicides justifiable in cases of white-on-black killings than states that have not adopted such laws. The second example used in the report is voter ID bills that require proof of identity in order to vote. CCR and its co-authors locate these efforts as part of the long history in the US of attempts to disenfranchise people of colour. In 2009 Alec approved a \u201cvoter ID act\u201d produced by one of its \u201ctask forces\u201d that devise new model legislation. The provision required voters to show certain forms of personal identification before being allowed to cast their ballot. Some 35 states now have voter ID laws. Numerous studies have found that non-white voters are much more likely than whites to lack photographic identification, and therefore face discrimination where ID is made a condition of voting. Alec has distanced itself publicly from voter suppression efforts and says it now has no policy on voter ID. Bill Meierling, Alec\u2019s head of external relations, told the Guardian: \u201cAlec members advance individual liberty and free enterprise across the states, creating opportunity for a better life for all Americans.\u201d He added: \u201cAlec is routinely targeted because its member legislators are nearly 300% as effective as any other group of elected officials. In fact, this year, USA Today reported that of 10,000 bills analyzed in state legislatures from 2010-2018, 2,900 were based on Alec model policy and more than 600 became law.\u201d The other examples of measures allegedly supporting white supremacy cited in the joint report are \u201ccritical infrastructure bills\u201d that originated with a 2017 law introduced in Oklahoma to clamp down on indigenous and other protesters against the Dakota Access pipeline. Alec turned the Oklahoma template into a model bill that has spread through the US, threatening indigenous protesters with fines and jail time. The final Alec intervention cited by the authors concerns moves to combat the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement that seeks to pressure Israel to abide by international human rights laws. As the Guardian reported last month, Alec has hosted discussions on banning criticism of Israel on US campuses.",

Actually, to be exact, she was only referring to the frontline before a morning attack, \u201cbecause the men are going to the bathroom (in agony of spirit) in all the trenches up and down the countryside and supposedly it would embarrass the woman\u201d. Other than that, \u201cif there is a war anywhere I want to be at it\u201d, the pioneering Gellhorn wrote in a letter to friends, fizzing with her signature passion, to be \u201cplaces where trouble is\u201d.

Mostly that it\u2019s getting worse. A record number of homeless people died in 2018, the biggest increase in deaths since reporting began. In total, 726 homeless people died in the UK. There were 19 deaths in Manchester, making it the local authority with the third highest number of deaths behind Birmingham and Newcastle upon Tyne.</p> \n<p>Ameera Ramzan, the co-founder of Feeding Manchester\u2019s Forgotten Homeless, has worked with the city\u2019s rough sleepers for more than a decade, and supported Clive for two years before he died. She brought him clothes, fed him and helped him with his artwork by supplying canvases as well as paints and an easel. She came to think of him as a brother. \u201cClive was one in a million,\u201d she says. \u201cWe looked forward to going out every night and feeding Clive. His manners were beautiful. He would let no one disrespect you.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a58a91a3e4d8b00ac7bd58486a987c92277558cf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a58a91a3e4d8b00ac7bd58486a987c92277558cf/155_295_4685_2238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Front and back views of the painting by Clive Dalrymple purchased by Katy Cavanagh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"478\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Front and back views of the painting by Clive Dalrymple purchased by Katy Cavanagh.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: @KatyCavaz</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Front and back views of a painting by Clive Dalrymple purchased by Katy Cavanagh.

Ramzan believes his paintings provided an escape. \u201cIt was like a fantasy world in his head. He loved to jump into the picture \u2013 that was his paradise.\u201d His paintings attracted many admirers, including art students who would seek him out for painting lessons at his spot in Chinatown. \u201cThey would sit and drink with Clive, and learn from him,\u201d Ramzan says.</p> \n<p>After Clive\u2019s death, Ramzan read that none of his family could be reached, and was concerned that he would be given a \u201cpauper\u2019s burial\u201d by the council. \u201cI thought: \u2018No, no, no, his story is not going to end like this,\u2019\u201d she says. She tracked down his relatives on social media. After helping to arrange his funeral, she drove to Liverpool with Clive\u2019s coffin to meet his brother Ray and the rest of his family, who had come from all over the UK and from as far as Memphis in the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f19c6dbd-a8c5-44ad-a2f7-cde781d9ee47\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures.

Clive grew up in Glasgow with his mother and stepfather, while Ray was raised in the Toxteth area of Liverpool by his mother. Ray saw Clive on TV before he met him in person. \u201cI was at my dad\u2019s one time, and he turned round and went: \u2018Look, there\u2019s Clive on the news running around naked,\u2019\u201d Ray recalls.</p> \n<p>Clive had run away from home aged 13 to join a group of new age travellers who were involved in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Ray thinks the news report was broadcast from Greenham Common, where the women\u2019s peace camp was protesting against nuclear weapons being stored at the RAF base. He later learned that Clive had stripped naked in the hope of luring TV cameras to where soldiers were changing into police uniforms. He didn\u2019t succeed.</p> \n<p>Ray first met Clive in the mid-1980s, during a trip to Glasgow to see his half-sister Aloma Owens. \u201cI went to this bar and I\u2019m watching this fella dancing, and I was like: \u2018God, he doesn\u2019t half dance like me,\u2019 and then he walked away, and I was like: \u2018Fucking hell, he\u2019s got my walk as well.\u2019\u201d Ray was at the bar when he felt a hand on his shoulder. \u201c\u2018Is your name Ray?\u2019\u201d the stranger asked. \u201cI said: \u2018Yeah,\u2019 and he went: \u2018I\u2019m your brother Clive.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/dec/03/the-homeless-death-statistics-are-shocking-but-the-true-total-may-be-even-higher\">The homeless death statistics are shocking \u2013 but the true total may be even higher</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ray was 25 at the time; Clive was 19 and was visiting his mother and stepfather. Ray says Clive appeared healthy, his accent was a Bristol-Glasgow hybrid, and he was friendly, but reserved. They made small talk, mostly about the madness of meeting up after all this time. They didn\u2019t see each other again until Ray received a call from his father a few years later informing him that Clive was being prosecuted in London for \u201cstealing water\u201d.</p> \n<p>Ray, who was working as a security guard in London at the time, turned up at court just as his brother was addressing the judge. \u201cApparently he broke into a derelict house, and the police came in while he was having a bath,\u201d Ray says. Clive was using more than one surname at the time, which confused things at the court.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>He could talk the birds out of the trees.

If there was one thing Clive Dalrymple could not make a living from, he thought, it was dancing. The judge asked the court if Clive could be bailed anywhere. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here, your honour. I\u2019m his brother,\u201d Ray announced. Clive looked up at the public gallery, saw Ray, and clasped his hands together in gratitude.</p> \n<p>Ray apologises, and says he\u2019s not good with dates, but he thinks this was 1989. He arranged for Clive to stay at their father\u2019s house in Liverpool, but Clive was kicked out after the two clashed. His life spiralled downwards from there. By the mid-1990s, he was in prison for what Ray believes was a drug-related crime. When Clive got out of jail, he was released back to his father\u2019s house. Ray shows us a picture of Clive from this period. He looks beefy after pumping iron throughout his prison sentence.</p> \n<p>The brothers would go on nights out in Liverpool, and Clive turned out to be popular with women. \u201cHe could talk the birds out of the trees,\u201d Ray says. \u201cWhen he cleaned up, everyone was coming up to me going: \u2018Isn\u2019t your brother dead charming?\u2019 His chat-up lines were terrible, but he just had the gift of the gab.\u201d Such as? \u201cHow\u2019s your bum for cracking nuts?\u201d Ray laughs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"060cb996c957679e0dd22db9535ebd90ac91312b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/060cb996c957679e0dd22db9535ebd90ac91312b/0_444_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ray Dalrymple, Clive\u2019s half-brother.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ray Dalrymple, Clive\u2019s half-brother.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Ray Dalrymple, Clive\u2019s half-brother.

Ray says Clive didn\u2019t have much contact with either of them, but both are now happy adults.</p> \n<p>Ray didn\u2019t see Clive for prolonged periods while the two were in Liverpool. On one of the last occasions, they bumped into each other by chance outside a nightclub. Ray\u2019s attention was drawn to the pavement when an irritable club bouncer barked: \u201cMove away you dirty smackhead!\u201d to an emaciated man on the ground. \u201cI looked down and went: \u2018Clive!\u2019 The last time I had seen him he was really muscular because any time he went to prison he wouldn\u2019t use [drugs], he\u2019d just work out. But he looked like death. He was trying to hide his face \u2013 he\u2019d lost his teeth. I asked him: \u2018Clive, what\u2019s going on?\u2019 He said: \u2018Ray, I feel ashamed.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>A couple of Clive\u2019s homeless friends travelled with Ameera Ramzan from Manchester to Liverpool for his funeral. They told Ray about his brother\u2019s kindness \u2013 the time he opened up his tent to other rough sleepers in Manchester city centre during a heavy downpour. But they also told him how tough it has become for struggling people to survive in Manchester. The Labour party has linked the high level of homeless deaths to local government spending cuts, which in Manchester have amounted to a reduction of \u00a3926 for each household \u2013 three times the national average. The government\u2019s 2018 single-night rough sleeping snapshot recorded a 31% rise in the number of rough sleepers in the city compared with 2017. In 2010, there were seven rough sleepers counted; in 2018, 123 were counted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>[Some people] become so caught up in that lifestyle that they become phobic about going back into the world of responsibilities, bills and four walls</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Hendrix Lancaster</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It seems that everyone involved with homelessness in the city knows somebody who has died on the streets. Under Manchester Arndale\u2019s food court, a group of rough sleepers and beggars are sipping lager and cider, and smoking roll-ups while chatting loudly among themselves. Each person in the group points in a different direction to a doorway where someone has died. The loss of loved ones has led to the founding of a number of homeless charities and grassroots initiatives in Manchester. Coffee4Craig, a local outreach charity, began handing out coffee in the city after Risha Lancaster lost her brother to a heroin overdose in a Cardiff car park. Now the charity operates a drop-in centre offering showers, hot meals and access to computers.</p> \n<p>Hendrix Lancaster, Risha\u2019s husband, and a co-founder of the charity, tells us he came into contact with Clive on several occasions. \u201cI did see his artwork when I was walking up Portland Street,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was a fantastic artist.\u201d He thinks Clive was offered accommodation on three occasions, but understands that he turned them all down. Clive had been living on the street for almost all his life, and Lancaster believes he was one of those people who couldn\u2019t see a way back. \u201cThey become so caught up in that lifestyle that they become phobic about going back into the world of responsibilities, bills and four walls.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=229&amp;title=rough%20sleepers%20were%20counted%20in%20Greater%20Manchester%20in%20the%202018%20census\" data-alt=\"229 rough sleepers were counted in Greater Manchester in the 2018 census\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=229&amp;title=rough%20sleepers%20were%20counted%20in%20Greater%20Manchester%20in%20the%202018%20census\">229 rough sleepers were counted in Greater Manchester in the 2018 census</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Another local homelessness charity, the Wellspring, has lost so many of its service users that it has created a memorial at the entrance to its drop-in centre in Stockport. Its chief executive, Jonathan Billings, gives us a potted history of many of the 40 or so people commemorated on the wall. There\u2019s Richard the guitar player who died of hypothermia a couple of years ago in a bush outside his hostel. Daniel, another young face on the wall, died when he was 22. He was a talented footballer who won a place at Manchester City\u2019s academy, but struggled with alcoholism.</p> \n<p>Billings is 1.95 metres (6ft 5in) tall and an ex-Grenadier guardsman. He has been working for the charity, which initially operated out of a nearby scout hut, for 17 years. \u201cFor a year, it was a war zone,\u201d he says. Billings thinks his size earned him the job before he even sat down at his interview. Back then, stolen goods were being sold, drugs were being dealt and assaults occurred every day. \u201cI phoned the police three or four times a day for about a year.\u201d The charity has changed a lot since then. The Wellspring claims to have helped more than 1,500 homeless people into accommodation, and offers a range of activities and educational classes to members of the local community.</p> \n<p>The Wellspring is part of the mayor\u2019s Homeless Action Network, an umbrella scheme uniting local services, charities and others working with the homeless in Greater Manchester. Just as everyone in this city has a view about homelessness, everyone has a view about Greater Manchester\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham. In January 2017, the former Labour health secretary vowed \u201cto eradicate rough sleeping by 2020\u201d if he won the mayoral election. It was a big promise. Sure enough, in May 2017 he won with 63% of the vote and immediately pledged 15% of his \u00a3110,000 salary to the Greater Manchester Mayor\u2019s charity, set up to tackle social issues, with homelessness as a priority. \u201cRising homelessness is the issue that has defined this campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact it is barely getting a mention in the [2017] general election campaign tells you something about our dysfunctional political and media culture. But walk out of this building tonight and you will see the reality behind the election slogans.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ab9b916f4221cecc0be052f8ca81eac5c3d69b7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ab9b916f4221cecc0be052f8ca81eac5c3d69b7/131_248_6428_3857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Billings, chief executive officer at the Wellspring which provides support for homeless people living in Stockport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Billings, chief executive officer at the Wellspring which provides support for homeless people living in Stockport.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Jonathan Billings, chief executive officer at the Wellspring which provides support for homeless people living in Stockport.

Burnham was present at Kompany\u2019s testimonial match in September when all the profits went to Tackle4MCR, and announced that Kompany had already raised \u00a3300,000 for the mayor\u2019s A Bed Every Night scheme, which aims to guarantee all rough sleepers a bed every night, with additional support to get into secure housing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=19%20&amp;title=rough%20sleepers%20died%20in%20Manchester%20in%202018\" data-alt=\"19 homeless people died in Manchester in 2018\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=19%20&amp;title=rough%20sleepers%20died%20in%20Manchester%20in%202018\">19 homeless people died in Manchester in 2018</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Billings is generally supportive of Burnham and A Bed Every Night, but he has his quibbles. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to end rough sleeping permanently,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to refer people, for one thing. And in Stockport it\u2019s quite misleading because it\u2019s a sleeping bag on the floor in a shared area. That\u2019s not a bed every night, is it?\u201d He welcomes the number of people helped by A Bed Every Night, but says it isn\u2019t suitable for the sharpest end of homelessness \u2013 entrenched rough sleepers with multiple issues, people such as Clive Dalrymple. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible to have to say it, but A Bed Every Night works for the easy ones \u2013 the kids who have had a row with their mum and it\u2019s just \u2018Get on the phone to Mum, get them together in a room and let\u2019s sort this out.\u2019 That kind of thing. We deal with people with complex needs, including drugs and alcohol. A Bed Every Night hasn\u2019t got any of them sorted out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Billings also worries that the city is resorting to punitive policies as Burnham\u2019s deadline for clearing Manchester of rough sleepers gets ever nearer. In February, Manchester city council announced a plan to introduce a \u201cpublic space protection order\u201d to ban antisocial behaviour, including \u201caggressive and intimidating begging\u201d, drinking in public, discarding syringes, urinating or defecating in public, and blocking building entrances and exits. The human rights group Liberty described the policy as \u201ccruel and perverse\u201d. Billings suggests the policy has unfairly targeted the homeless and achieved nothing except to shift the burden to communities outside the city centre.</p> \n<p>We tell him we\u2019re going to see Burnham the following day, and ask if he\u2019s got any message to pass on. Yes, he says \u2013 all of this. \u201cAnd one more thing, he promised to bring Vincent Kompany to the Wellspring. Well, we\u2019re still waiting.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>While Jonathan Billings runs a regular homelessness charity, one man in Manchester has resorted to vigilante-style activism. On a sweltering June day on Deansgate in central Manchester, Stuart Potts is in shorts and shirtless, with an electronic tag attached to his ankle. Potts runs the Saving People Shelter Project, which is essentially a mobile hostel occupying abandoned buildings to house homeless people. Potts is a one-off: tough, funny, intense and off the wall. Combine Shaun Ryder with Mother Teresa and you might come close. Like many working with homeless people in the city, Potts knew Clive, but not well. He says he was quiet and kept himself to himself. \u201cI saw his work,\u201d he says. \u201cBrilliant artist.\u201d</p> \n<p>Potts has had his own struggles with mental health and addiction. He became homeless after being evicted from his flat, and was inspired to take the law into his own hands after losing a homeless friend he had helped get off the streets. \u201cI took a lad in from Rochdale,\u201d Potts says. He explains that Rochdale council had evicted his friend from a three-bedroom house after his mother died. Potts took him off the streets, weaned him off heroin with beer, then weaned him off beer and got him back on his feet. Potts says they were turfed out by their landlord after a neighbour told him he had taken in a lodger, and the young man from Rochdale died of a drugs overdose a couple weeks after returning to the streets.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1e06c974798c5e237ffffba738d086302c69d71\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1e06c974798c5e237ffffba738d086302c69d71/0_0_720_960/375.jpg\" alt=\"Stuart Potts, who runs the Saving People Shelter Project.\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stuart Potts, who runs the Saving People Shelter Project.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Potts/Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Potts went to live by the canal. \u201cI was sitting on the canal, homeless. Police came down and gave me a 48-hour dispersal notice not to camp anywhere within the Salford area within the next 48 hours. I asked: \u2018Where can I go? I\u2019ve got no roof over my head?\u2019 They said: \u2018Go to Manchester.\u2019 I said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to go to Manchester. I slept with my phone down my bollocks in Manchester and another homeless guy tried to take it off me while I was asleep.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Instead, Potts began to research squatting. As a former locksmith, he knew a bit about getting into locked buildings. After occupying a decaying mansion in Eccles, an area of Salford, he has moved into \u2013 and out of \u2013 several abandoned buildings in the area, including a former vet\u2019s and a disused chemist\u2019s shop. At any given time, he has about 14 adults with him in these makeshift hostels. Potts has to stay one step ahead of the police, who have evicted him on several occasions. Although, oddly, the police are now referring people to his squats.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe got a phone call from the police the other day,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018Hi, is that Mr Potts?\u2019 I say: \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve got a young vulnerable lady here. She has just come out of Meadowbrook mental health unit, and she\u2019s got nowhere to go. I was just wondering if there was any room at your shelters?\u2019 I say: \u2018Are you mad? You are the ones who are kicking us out, mate.\u2019\u201d He cackles at the craziness of it.</p> \n<p>Potts points out another oddity: the first time they were evicted by the police, Burnham was announcing his A Bed Every Night policy. Potts prides himself on telling it as it is to everybody, and Burnham is no exception. When he met Burnham earlier this year, Potts claims he told the mayor that within 48 hours he had housed 18 people in a functioning safe space. \u201cWe had on-site support, we had food in the cupboards, it was staffed. We\u2019ve got no money. \u2018You\u2019ve got all the money in the world and all the resources in the world and you can\u2019t even do it,\u2019\u201d Potts claims he told Burnham. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019ve got red tape, you haven\u2019t.\u2019 I\u2019ve got red tape! Well fuck that shit. Solve the problem!\u201d</p> \n<p>It is early September, and Potts has been evicted from two squats since we last met. He is now occupying the Unicorn hotel, a pub that recently closed in Eccles. The bar area has been transformed into an ad-hoc storage facility for donated clothes and other items. The living quarters are upstairs, and we\u2019re greeted in the lounge by residents, as well as by Tara the dog, a big, soppy white staffy-akita cross. The atmosphere is relaxed, with people watching Sky TV on a big screen and chatting. Potts says the residents share responsibilities \u2013 cooking, cleaning, DIY. He says it has not always been so harmonious. When one resident attacked him a few months ago, he hit him on the head with a frying pan in self-defence.</p> \n<p>Paul Doyle from Bolton, who is living in the Unicorn, has been homeless for several years, and says he has never been happier in that time. He has first-hand experience of A Bed Every Night and its emergency Narrowgate shelter project. \u201cYou don\u2019t get proper food,\u201d says Doyle. \u201cNow and again Greggs donated. But sometimes we\u2019d just have a bowl of soup at night.\u201d Potts says he \u201cwouldn\u2019t put a rat\u201d in Narrowgate, and likens it to a \u201crefugee camp\u201d in which \u201c30 to 35 people are bunked up\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>The mayor of Greater Manchester\u2019s office in Manchester city centre, is smart, minimalist and corporate. It could not be more different from the Unicorn hotel. Andy Burnham stands up and points to a painting above his desk of a rough sleeper wrapped in a sleeping bag. The artwork also features on A Bed Every Night\u2019s website and literature.</p> \n<p>It was painted by another homeless man, but Burnham is aware of Clive. \u201cClive was well known locally \u2013 his paintings were loved, and people tried their best to help him,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a tragedy that this talented artist was living out the last years of his life on the streets of Manchester.\u201d Burnham says eradicating street homelessness remains his \u201cNo 1 priority\u201d and that he is staking his political legacy on it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16cc70497999dd3bacc360cab0feabb6765830b6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16cc70497999dd3bacc360cab0feabb6765830b6/0_408_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester.

Others would rather turn the key, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d He admits that there needs to be at least the option of single-room provision for women. Are women separated from men? \u201cYes \u2026 I think nearly in all of our locations. I wouldn\u2019t like to say in all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Burnham cites Greater Manchester\u2019s first decline in rough sleeping numbers for eight years \u2013 229 rough sleepers were recorded in the 2018 snapshot, compared with 278 the previous year \u2013 as a measure of his success. He credits the falling figures to A Bed Every Night: \u201cThat was the thing that was most responsible for that change. Because London carried on seeing an increase; Birmingham carried on seeing an increase. Now I won\u2019t overclaim for it, but I think that was a significant thing.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=2%2C600%20&amp;title=people%20have%20accessed%20temporary%20accommodation%20through%20Andy%20Burnham%E2%80%99s%20A%20Bed%20Every%20Night%20scheme\" data-alt=\"2,600 people have accessed temporary accommodation through Andy Burnham\u2019s A Bed Every Night scheme\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=2%2C600%20&amp;title=people%20have%20accessed%20temporary%20accommodation%20through%20Andy%20Burnham%E2%80%99s%20A%20Bed%20Every%20Night%20scheme\">2,600 people have accessed temporary accommodation through Andy Burnham\u2019s A Bed Every Night scheme</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The statistics, however, tell a more complex story than Burnham suggests. Rough sleeping figures in Greater Manchester have declined, but the figures in central Manchester have increased by 31%, which suggests that the problem is merely migrating to the centre. Moreover, A Bed Every Night was launched in November 2018, and the decline Burnham refers to was measured on a single night snapshot during autumn 2018.</p> \n<p>We tell him activists have complained about the begging ban in the city centre, saying it is penalising genuinely homeless people. \u201cThere\u2019s not a ban on begging,\u201d Burnham says with a hint of frustration in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a more considered approach, and actually what we\u2019ve agreed with Greater Manchester police is that it\u2019s a supportive approach. We will not penalise people in Greater Manchester for want of a home. We will just not do that. A lot of people claim that this is done, and there may be individual officers who have done things that do equate to that, but it\u2019s not the policy of the force.\u201d</p> \n<p>Does he regret saying he would end rough sleeping by 2020? \u201cI wasn\u2019t making what you would call a traditional target,\u201d Burnham says. \u201cI issued my commitment to make it more of a wake-up call to the system. And I think it has had that effect.\u201d But the bottom line is that it was a pledge, and many people, including the Wellspring\u2019s Jonathan Billings, argue it was an unrealistic one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2e83b1094703f73e133a7dd7617b752b041184ec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e83b1094703f73e133a7dd7617b752b041184ec/0_288_5099_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aloma Owens, sister of Clive Dalrymple, photographed in Memphis, TN\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aloma Owens, sister of Clive Dalrymple, photographed in Memphis, TN</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phillip Parker/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Aloma Owens, sister of Clive Dalrymple, photographed in Memphis, Tennessee, where she now lives.

In retrospect, if I had said \u2018end the need for\u2019, that probably would have been a wiser thing to have done. But I wasn\u2019t in the space of wanting to play semantics with it. Honestly, I don\u2019t regret it.

She is a year older and grew up with him in the same household in Glasgow. Owens juggles two jobs: one as a material handler for Federal Express at Memphis international airport; the other as a table games dealer at the MGM Goldstrike casino on the Mississippi river. She has just finished a shift at the airport when she speaks to us on the phone. Owens says people thought she and Clive were twins because they looked so alike. \u201cI was always with him. It was me and him together pretty much when we were young,\u201d Owens says. She says the family weren\u2019t poor growing up, but weren\u2019t rich either. \u201cWe had a nice house, food on the table, a garden. We never had any problems.\u201d</p> \n<p>She remembers how adventurous he was as a child. \u201cHe would climb the rooftops, jump on the backs of garbage trucks, getting a little ride. I was a little tomboy. Anything my brothers did, I was like: \u2018I\u2019m coming, too.\u2019\u201d Owens was just as surprised as Ray when she discovered Clive\u2019s paintings, as he wasn\u2019t at all arty when they were young. But she disagrees strongly with Ray about one thing \u2013 the dancing. \u201cWe were in a break-dancing group, and we used to dance in the streets \u2013 street busking \u2013 in Scotland.\u201d Ray says he was a stiff dancer? \u201cHe was an excellent dancer,\u201d she insists. \u201cWe were in a group called Street Damage and got a lot of gigs out of that, so he was real good.\u201d</p> \n<p>Owens says Clive\u2019s charm got him out of sticky situations in his childhood. One night, when he and Owens were 10 and 11, they were out with two friends and decided to pick some apples from a tree in a private garden. \u201cA man started shouting: \u2018Get out of here!\u2019 So, everybody started running, but poor Clive was so slow. He got caught. The man took him in the house and the other two guys took off and I\u2019m waiting on my brother. Do you know, Clive came out with some food, some money and some apples. A big bag of apples! So, I said: \u2018What did you tell him?\u2019 He said: \u2018I told him the boys were threatening us and making us come and pick the apples.\u2019 So he knew how to talk to people and get himself out of things the right way.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although Owens describes a happy childhood, the pair had to endure racist abuse. \u201cWe used to get called \u2018nignogs\u2019, and the \u2018twin Twix pack\u2019, and \u2018there\u2019s the two Guinnesses coming\u2019. Crazy stuff,\u201d she says. Owens took the abuse in her stride, but she says Clive took it to heart. After Clive died, Owen was shown a letter that one of her siblings had received from Clive. Owens gets emotional when reading it out loud, as Clive talks about missing their mum, who followed her to the US in 1991.</p> \n<p>Clive ran away from home with his older brother Vernon when he was 13. Owens never fully discovered what happened to Clive during that period. When she asks Vernon about it, she says, he just cries. Ray is equally in the dark, but learned from Clive, during a rare moment of openness, that he sought out their father at around this time. According to Ray, he was a selfish, violent man with a callous attitude towards his many children. \u201cWho\u2019s for me, I\u2019m for them,\u201d was his motto, Ray says.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I was coming out of the hospital and I\u2019ve got a clear bag with his name on it.

According to Ramzan, he had two bleeds on the brain and had heart surgery twice in the space of a year before he died. \u201cNobody should be left on the street like that,\u201d she says. When we ask Manchester University NHS foundation trust, which runs Manchester Royal Infirmary, if Clive had a mental health assessment and whether he was in a fit state to leave hospital, the trust says it is unable to comment on individual cases.</p> \n<p>Five weeks after leaving hospital, Clive died from pulmonary heart failure. Ramzan is still haunted by his death. \u201cI was coming out of the hospital and I\u2019ve got a clear bag with his name on it with just a few belongings. And I\u2019m hugging this bag with his clothes in it, thinking: \u2018What is this?\u2019 This is all this man\u2019s got for 52 years in this world \u2013 one bag.\u201d</p> \n<p>Aloma Owens is also trying to come to terms with his death. She is grieving for a brother who couldn\u2019t have been closer as a child, but was a stranger as an adult. After he left home at 13, she only saw him on a handful of occasions before she went to live in the US at the age of 21. How does she remember him? \u201cBreak-dancing, happy thoughts, y\u2019know.\u201d Her voice quivers. \u201cI get really emotional. I look at the pictures of his childhood and this is how I remember Clive. This is how I remember his face. I don\u2019t know the other part of him. I don\u2019t know the adult pictures that my brother sends me. I know that\u2019s Clive, but I don\u2019t know that Clive.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>On 9 October, the homeless squatters were evicted from the Unicorn hotel. Stuart Potts livestreamed the eviction, and then occupied the Albert Edward pub in Eccles. For all his good deeds, Potts has a knack for getting himself in trouble, and was arrested after letting off fireworks during the two-minute silence on Remembrance Sunday. He told Manchester magistrates court they were a tribute intended to mirror the cannons fired during the televised service in London.

Burnham is rapidly running out of time to meet his impossible deadline, but he says that he feels he has kept his promise in spirit: a year on from its launch, more than 2,600 people have accessed temporary accommodation through A Bed Every Night and 817 rough sleepers across Greater Manchester have moved off the streets into longer-term accommodation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf people think I haven\u2019t done enough, it\u2019s up to them,\u201d Burnham says. \u201cAnd if they want to vote me out on that basis, they should do that. I\u2019m perfectly happy for people to say at the election: \u2018Well, sorry, you said \u2026\u2019 But, no, I don\u2019t consider it a failure to have looked after so many people through A Bed Every Night.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Ray is still struggling to come to terms with Clive\u2019s death. Ray tries to tell himself that his brother was his own man, a loner who couldn\u2019t be helped. But he doesn\u2019t quite believe it. \u201cI feel as if I have failed him. I do feel I should have gone to Manchester looking for him, to try to bring him home. But I can\u2019t put that right.\u201d One comfort is discovering after his death that Clive was such a talented artist. The painting that Katy Cavanagh bought from Clive tells the story of his life so well, he says \u2013 storm clouds and choppy waters on the high seas. But there is one feature Ray missed on first viewing: a tiny ship among the giant waves. \u201cI reckon that\u2019s him,\u201d Ray says. \u201cA little ship in the storm.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Eric Allison</em></p> \n<p><em>If you are worried about becoming homeless, contact the housing department of your local authority to fill in a homeless application.

      "bodyText": "When Clive Dalrymple sold his painting of a vivid blue seascape to Katy Cavanagh, he signed the back of the canvas: \u201cManchester homeless, 12/12/2016.\u201d Clive had been living on the streets of Chinatown, Manchester, and he could often be found perched in front of an easel painting pictures. Cavanagh lived round the corner, and the seascape caught her eye. \u201cIt was so beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cHe came across as quite positive, and was trying to make an honest living rather than just asking for money.\u201d Clive died on 13 August this year. His death was reported in the Manchester Evening News, but there were only scant details about his life \u2013 that he was 52, had just left Manchester Royal Infirmary after an operation, had a room in supported accommodation and was known to outreach charities working in the city centre. No next of kin had been located Homelessness has consumed Manchester since the coalition government introduced its austerity policy after 2010. Rough sleeping is visible everywhere in the city. You can see it in almost every doorway, bus shelter and subway. It\u2019s at the centre of the city\u2019s politics, leads the front pages of the local papers and everyone from shop workers to volunteers at the cathedral have an opinion about it. Mostly that it\u2019s getting worse. A record number of homeless people died in 2018, the biggest increase in deaths since reporting began. In total, 726 homeless people died in the UK. There were 19 deaths in Manchester, making it the local authority with the third highest number of deaths behind Birmingham and Newcastle upon Tyne. Ameera Ramzan, the co-founder of Feeding Manchester\u2019s Forgotten Homeless, has worked with the city\u2019s rough sleepers for more than a decade, and supported Clive for two years before he died. She brought him clothes, fed him and helped him with his artwork by supplying canvases as well as paints and an easel. She came to think of him as a brother. \u201cClive was one in a million,\u201d she says. \u201cWe looked forward to going out every night and feeding Clive. His manners were beautiful. He would let no one disrespect you.\u201d Front and back views of a painting by Clive Dalrymple purchased by Katy Cavanagh. Photograph: @KatyCavaz Clive told people he could not \u201cdo four walls\u201d, and spent much of his life on the streets. Ramzan believes his paintings provided an escape. \u201cIt was like a fantasy world in his head. He loved to jump into the picture \u2013 that was his paradise.\u201d His paintings attracted many admirers, including art students who would seek him out for painting lessons at his spot in Chinatown. \u201cThey would sit and drink with Clive, and learn from him,\u201d Ramzan says. After Clive\u2019s death, Ramzan read that none of his family could be reached, and was concerned that he would be given a \u201cpauper\u2019s burial\u201d by the council. \u201cI thought: \u2018No, no, no, his story is not going to end like this,\u2019\u201d she says. She tracked down his relatives on social media. After helping to arrange his funeral, she drove to Liverpool with Clive\u2019s coffin to meet his brother Ray and the rest of his family, who had come from all over the UK and from as far as Memphis in the US. In a pub next to Lime Street station in central Liverpool, Ray Dalrymple arrives dressed in a homemade cycling T-shirt and flat cap. He is a fit man who cycles 28 miles every day, and speaks softly in a broad Liverpudlian accent. Ray is black; Clive was mixed race. They have different mothers, but shared the same Trinidadian father with 12 other siblings. \u201cWe all look out for each other,\u201d Ray says. Ray and Clive were born in Liverpool, but they didn\u2019t meet until they were adults. Clive grew up in Glasgow with his mother and stepfather, while Ray was raised in the Toxteth area of Liverpool by his mother. Ray saw Clive on TV before he met him in person. \u201cI was at my dad\u2019s one time, and he turned round and went: \u2018Look, there\u2019s Clive on the news running around naked,\u2019\u201d Ray recalls. Clive had run away from home aged 13 to join a group of new age travellers who were involved in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Ray thinks the news report was broadcast from Greenham Common, where the women\u2019s peace camp was protesting against nuclear weapons being stored at the RAF base. He later learned that Clive had stripped naked in the hope of luring TV cameras to where soldiers were changing into police uniforms. He didn\u2019t succeed. Ray first met Clive in the mid-1980s, during a trip to Glasgow to see his half-sister Aloma Owens. \u201cI went to this bar and I\u2019m watching this fella dancing, and I was like: \u2018God, he doesn\u2019t half dance like me,\u2019 and then he walked away, and I was like: \u2018Fucking hell, he\u2019s got my walk as well.\u2019\u201d Ray was at the bar when he felt a hand on his shoulder. \u201c\u2018Is your name Ray?\u2019\u201d the stranger asked. \u201cI said: \u2018Yeah,\u2019 and he went: \u2018I\u2019m your brother Clive.\u2019\u201d Ray was 25 at the time; Clive was 19 and was visiting his mother and stepfather. Ray says Clive appeared healthy, his accent was a Bristol-Glasgow hybrid, and he was friendly, but reserved. They made small talk, mostly about the madness of meeting up after all this time. They didn\u2019t see each other again until Ray received a call from his father a few years later informing him that Clive was being prosecuted in London for \u201cstealing water\u201d. Ray, who was working as a security guard in London at the time, turned up at court just as his brother was addressing the judge. \u201cApparently he broke into a derelict house, and the police came in while he was having a bath,\u201d Ray says. Clive was using more than one surname at the time, which confused things at the court. Ray creases up as he recalls his brother explaining to the judge that he had many aliases because he was a street dancer. If there was one thing Clive Dalrymple could not make a living from, he thought, it was dancing. The judge asked the court if Clive could be bailed anywhere. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here, your honour. I\u2019m his brother,\u201d Ray announced. Clive looked up at the public gallery, saw Ray, and clasped his hands together in gratitude. Ray apologises, and says he\u2019s not good with dates, but he thinks this was 1989. He arranged for Clive to stay at their father\u2019s house in Liverpool, but Clive was kicked out after the two clashed. His life spiralled downwards from there. By the mid-1990s, he was in prison for what Ray believes was a drug-related crime. When Clive got out of jail, he was released back to his father\u2019s house. Ray shows us a picture of Clive from this period. He looks beefy after pumping iron throughout his prison sentence. The brothers would go on nights out in Liverpool, and Clive turned out to be popular with women. \u201cHe could talk the birds out of the trees,\u201d Ray says. \u201cWhen he cleaned up, everyone was coming up to me going: \u2018Isn\u2019t your brother dead charming?\u2019 His chat-up lines were terrible, but he just had the gift of the gab.\u201d Such as? \u201cHow\u2019s your bum for cracking nuts?\u201d Ray laughs. Ray Dalrymple, Clive\u2019s half-brother. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian There was still much that was mysterious about his brother\u2019s life. But he did know that Clive had two children. Ray says Clive didn\u2019t have much contact with either of them, but both are now happy adults. Ray didn\u2019t see Clive for prolonged periods while the two were in Liverpool. On one of the last occasions, they bumped into each other by chance outside a nightclub. Ray\u2019s attention was drawn to the pavement when an irritable club bouncer barked: \u201cMove away you dirty smackhead!\u201d to an emaciated man on the ground. \u201cI looked down and went: \u2018Clive!\u2019 The last time I had seen him he was really muscular because any time he went to prison he wouldn\u2019t use [drugs], he\u2019d just work out. But he looked like death. He was trying to hide his face \u2013 he\u2019d lost his teeth. I asked him: \u2018Clive, what\u2019s going on?\u2019 He said: \u2018Ray, I feel ashamed.\u2019\u201d * * * A couple of Clive\u2019s homeless friends travelled with Ameera Ramzan from Manchester to Liverpool for his funeral. They told Ray about his brother\u2019s kindness \u2013 the time he opened up his tent to other rough sleepers in Manchester city centre during a heavy downpour. But they also told him how tough it has become for struggling people to survive in Manchester. The Labour party has linked the high level of homeless deaths to local government spending cuts, which in Manchester have amounted to a reduction of \u00a3926 for each household \u2013 three times the national average. The government\u2019s 2018 single-night rough sleeping snapshot recorded a 31% rise in the number of rough sleepers in the city compared with 2017. In 2010, there were seven rough sleepers counted; in 2018, 123 were counted. It seems that everyone involved with homelessness in the city knows somebody who has died on the streets. Under Manchester Arndale\u2019s food court, a group of rough sleepers and beggars are sipping lager and cider, and smoking roll-ups while chatting loudly among themselves. Each person in the group points in a different direction to a doorway where someone has died. The loss of loved ones has led to the founding of a number of homeless charities and grassroots initiatives in Manchester. Coffee4Craig, a local outreach charity, began handing out coffee in the city after Risha Lancaster lost her brother to a heroin overdose in a Cardiff car park. Now the charity operates a drop-in centre offering showers, hot meals and access to computers. Hendrix Lancaster, Risha\u2019s husband, and a co-founder of the charity, tells us he came into contact with Clive on several occasions. \u201cI did see his artwork when I was walking up Portland Street,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was a fantastic artist.\u201d He thinks Clive was offered accommodation on three occasions, but understands that he turned them all down. Clive had been living on the street for almost all his life, and Lancaster believes he was one of those people who couldn\u2019t see a way back. \u201cThey become so caught up in that lifestyle that they become phobic about going back into the world of responsibilities, bills and four walls.\u201d Another local homelessness charity, the Wellspring, has lost so many of its service users that it has created a memorial at the entrance to its drop-in centre in Stockport. Its chief executive, Jonathan Billings, gives us a potted history of many of the 40 or so people commemorated on the wall. There\u2019s Richard the guitar player who died of hypothermia a couple of years ago in a bush outside his hostel. Daniel, another young face on the wall, died when he was 22. He was a talented footballer who won a place at Manchester City\u2019s academy, but struggled with alcoholism. Billings is 1.95 metres (6ft 5in) tall and an ex-Grenadier guardsman. He has been working for the charity, which initially operated out of a nearby scout hut, for 17 years. \u201cFor a year, it was a war zone,\u201d he says. Billings thinks his size earned him the job before he even sat down at his interview. Back then, stolen goods were being sold, drugs were being dealt and assaults occurred every day. \u201cI phoned the police three or four times a day for about a year.\u201d The charity has changed a lot since then. The Wellspring claims to have helped more than 1,500 homeless people into accommodation, and offers a range of activities and educational classes to members of the local community. The Wellspring is part of the mayor\u2019s Homeless Action Network, an umbrella scheme uniting local services, charities and others working with the homeless in Greater Manchester. Just as everyone in this city has a view about homelessness, everyone has a view about Greater Manchester\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham. In January 2017, the former Labour health secretary vowed \u201cto eradicate rough sleeping by 2020\u201d if he won the mayoral election. It was a big promise. Sure enough, in May 2017 he won with 63% of the vote and immediately pledged 15% of his \u00a3110,000 salary to the Greater Manchester Mayor\u2019s charity, set up to tackle social issues, with homelessness as a priority. \u201cRising homelessness is the issue that has defined this campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact it is barely getting a mention in the [2017] general election campaign tells you something about our dysfunctional political and media culture. But walk out of this building tonight and you will see the reality behind the election slogans.\u201d Jonathan Billings, chief executive officer at the Wellspring which provides support for homeless people living in Stockport. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian Burnham even managed to make fighting homelessness sexy, teaming up with the then Manchester City captain, Vincent Kompany, to launch Tackle4MCR, a charity set up by the pair to combat rough sleeping across Greater Manchester. Burnham was present at Kompany\u2019s testimonial match in September when all the profits went to Tackle4MCR, and announced that Kompany had already raised \u00a3300,000 for the mayor\u2019s A Bed Every Night scheme, which aims to guarantee all rough sleepers a bed every night, with additional support to get into secure housing. Billings is generally supportive of Burnham and A Bed Every Night, but he has his quibbles. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to end rough sleeping permanently,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to refer people, for one thing. And in Stockport it\u2019s quite misleading because it\u2019s a sleeping bag on the floor in a shared area. That\u2019s not a bed every night, is it?\u201d He welcomes the number of people helped by A Bed Every Night, but says it isn\u2019t suitable for the sharpest end of homelessness \u2013 entrenched rough sleepers with multiple issues, people such as Clive Dalrymple. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible to have to say it, but A Bed Every Night works for the easy ones \u2013 the kids who have had a row with their mum and it\u2019s just \u2018Get on the phone to Mum, get them together in a room and let\u2019s sort this out.\u2019 That kind of thing. We deal with people with complex needs, including drugs and alcohol. A Bed Every Night hasn\u2019t got any of them sorted out.\u201d Billings also worries that the city is resorting to punitive policies as Burnham\u2019s deadline for clearing Manchester of rough sleepers gets ever nearer. In February, Manchester city council announced a plan to introduce a \u201cpublic space protection order\u201d to ban antisocial behaviour, including \u201caggressive and intimidating begging\u201d, drinking in public, discarding syringes, urinating or defecating in public, and blocking building entrances and exits. The human rights group Liberty described the policy as \u201ccruel and perverse\u201d. Billings suggests the policy has unfairly targeted the homeless and achieved nothing except to shift the burden to communities outside the city centre. We tell him we\u2019re going to see Burnham the following day, and ask if he\u2019s got any message to pass on. Yes, he says \u2013 all of this. \u201cAnd one more thing, he promised to bring Vincent Kompany to the Wellspring. Well, we\u2019re still waiting.\u201d * * * While Jonathan Billings runs a regular homelessness charity, one man in Manchester has resorted to vigilante-style activism. On a sweltering June day on Deansgate in central Manchester, Stuart Potts is in shorts and shirtless, with an electronic tag attached to his ankle. Potts runs the Saving People Shelter Project, which is essentially a mobile hostel occupying abandoned buildings to house homeless people. Potts is a one-off: tough, funny, intense and off the wall. Combine Shaun Ryder with Mother Teresa and you might come close. Like many working with homeless people in the city, Potts knew Clive, but not well. He says he was quiet and kept himself to himself. \u201cI saw his work,\u201d he says. \u201cBrilliant artist.\u201d Potts has had his own struggles with mental health and addiction. He became homeless after being evicted from his flat, and was inspired to take the law into his own hands after losing a homeless friend he had helped get off the streets. \u201cI took a lad in from Rochdale,\u201d Potts says. He explains that Rochdale council had evicted his friend from a three-bedroom house after his mother died. Potts took him off the streets, weaned him off heroin with beer, then weaned him off beer and got him back on his feet. Potts says they were turfed out by their landlord after a neighbour told him he had taken in a lodger, and the young man from Rochdale died of a drugs overdose a couple weeks after returning to the streets. Potts went to live by the canal. \u201cI was sitting on the canal, homeless. Police came down and gave me a 48-hour dispersal notice not to camp anywhere within the Salford area within the next 48 hours. I asked: \u2018Where can I go? I\u2019ve got no roof over my head?\u2019 They said: \u2018Go to Manchester.\u2019 I said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to go to Manchester. I slept with my phone down my bollocks in Manchester and another homeless guy tried to take it off me while I was asleep.\u2019\u201d Instead, Potts began to research squatting. As a former locksmith, he knew a bit about getting into locked buildings. After occupying a decaying mansion in Eccles, an area of Salford, he has moved into \u2013 and out of \u2013 several abandoned buildings in the area, including a former vet\u2019s and a disused chemist\u2019s shop. At any given time, he has about 14 adults with him in these makeshift hostels. Potts has to stay one step ahead of the police, who have evicted him on several occasions. Although, oddly, the police are now referring people to his squats. \u201cWe got a phone call from the police the other day,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018Hi, is that Mr Potts?\u2019 I say: \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve got a young vulnerable lady here. She has just come out of Meadowbrook mental health unit, and she\u2019s got nowhere to go. I was just wondering if there was any room at your shelters?\u2019 I say: \u2018Are you mad? You are the ones who are kicking us out, mate.\u2019\u201d He cackles at the craziness of it. Potts points out another oddity: the first time they were evicted by the police, Burnham was announcing his A Bed Every Night policy. Potts prides himself on telling it as it is to everybody, and Burnham is no exception. When he met Burnham earlier this year, Potts claims he told the mayor that within 48 hours he had housed 18 people in a functioning safe space. \u201cWe had on-site support, we had food in the cupboards, it was staffed. We\u2019ve got no money. \u2018You\u2019ve got all the money in the world and all the resources in the world and you can\u2019t even do it,\u2019\u201d Potts claims he told Burnham. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019ve got red tape, you haven\u2019t.\u2019 I\u2019ve got red tape! Well fuck that shit. Solve the problem!\u201d It is early September, and Potts has been evicted from two squats since we last met. He is now occupying the Unicorn hotel, a pub that recently closed in Eccles. The bar area has been transformed into an ad-hoc storage facility for donated clothes and other items. The living quarters are upstairs, and we\u2019re greeted in the lounge by residents, as well as by Tara the dog, a big, soppy white staffy-akita cross. The atmosphere is relaxed, with people watching Sky TV on a big screen and chatting. Potts says the residents share responsibilities \u2013 cooking, cleaning, DIY. He says it has not always been so harmonious. When one resident attacked him a few months ago, he hit him on the head with a frying pan in self-defence. Paul Doyle from Bolton, who is living in the Unicorn, has been homeless for several years, and says he has never been happier in that time. He has first-hand experience of A Bed Every Night and its emergency Narrowgate shelter project. \u201cYou don\u2019t get proper food,\u201d says Doyle. \u201cNow and again Greggs donated. But sometimes we\u2019d just have a bowl of soup at night.\u201d Potts says he \u201cwouldn\u2019t put a rat\u201d in Narrowgate, and likens it to a \u201crefugee camp\u201d in which \u201c30 to 35 people are bunked up\u201d. * * * The mayor of Greater Manchester\u2019s office in Manchester city centre, is smart, minimalist and corporate. It could not be more different from the Unicorn hotel. Andy Burnham stands up and points to a painting above his desk of a rough sleeper wrapped in a sleeping bag. The artwork also features on A Bed Every Night\u2019s website and literature. It was painted by another homeless man, but Burnham is aware of Clive. \u201cClive was well known locally \u2013 his paintings were loved, and people tried their best to help him,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a tragedy that this talented artist was living out the last years of his life on the streets of Manchester.\u201d Burnham says eradicating street homelessness remains his \u201cNo 1 priority\u201d and that he is staking his political legacy on it. Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian. We put some of the criticisms about A Bed Every Night to him. \u201cI think the quality of accommodation is quite variable [and] more single-room provision would be good,\u201d he concedes. \u201cThere are some people who really like the sort of company or camaraderie of being in a big space. Others would rather turn the key, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d He admits that there needs to be at least the option of single-room provision for women. Are women separated from men? \u201cYes \u2026 I think nearly in all of our locations. I wouldn\u2019t like to say in all.\u201d Burnham cites Greater Manchester\u2019s first decline in rough sleeping numbers for eight years \u2013 229 rough sleepers were recorded in the 2018 snapshot, compared with 278 the previous year \u2013 as a measure of his success. He credits the falling figures to A Bed Every Night: \u201cThat was the thing that was most responsible for that change. Because London carried on seeing an increase; Birmingham carried on seeing an increase. Now I won\u2019t overclaim for it, but I think that was a significant thing.\u201d The statistics, however, tell a more complex story than Burnham suggests. Rough sleeping figures in Greater Manchester have declined, but the figures in central Manchester have increased by 31%, which suggests that the problem is merely migrating to the centre. Moreover, A Bed Every Night was launched in November 2018, and the decline Burnham refers to was measured on a single night snapshot during autumn 2018. We tell him activists have complained about the begging ban in the city centre, saying it is penalising genuinely homeless people. \u201cThere\u2019s not a ban on begging,\u201d Burnham says with a hint of frustration in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a more considered approach, and actually what we\u2019ve agreed with Greater Manchester police is that it\u2019s a supportive approach. We will not penalise people in Greater Manchester for want of a home. We will just not do that. A lot of people claim that this is done, and there may be individual officers who have done things that do equate to that, but it\u2019s not the policy of the force.\u201d Does he regret saying he would end rough sleeping by 2020? \u201cI wasn\u2019t making what you would call a traditional target,\u201d Burnham says. \u201cI issued my commitment to make it more of a wake-up call to the system. And I think it has had that effect.\u201d But the bottom line is that it was a pledge, and many people, including the Wellspring\u2019s Jonathan Billings, argue it was an unrealistic one. Aloma Owens, sister of Clive Dalrymple, photographed in Memphis, Tennessee, where she now lives. Photographer: Phillip Parker/Getty Images Burnham says he knows he could have worded it differently to give himself wriggle room, but he wasn\u2019t interested in doing so. \u201cThe team here said I should have said: \u2018End the need for rough sleeping,\u2019 because you can\u2019t force people into a shelter if they don\u2019t want to because they have a concern about it. In retrospect, if I had said \u2018end the need for\u2019, that probably would have been a wiser thing to have done. But I wasn\u2019t in the space of wanting to play semantics with it. Honestly, I don\u2019t regret it. I feel in spirit I\u2019m meeting it by creating 400 places every single night from October until the middle of June.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely that Clive, with his claustrophobia and complex needs, would have accepted a sleeping bag in a room crammed with 30-plus people. He had a place at Newbury House in Manchester \u2013 supported accommodation set up to cope with homeless people with addiction issues and mental health problems \u2013 but his aversion to being inside was so profound that he discharged himself from hospital the day after undergoing heart surgery and returned to the streets. He died five weeks later. Ray struggles with Clive\u2019s choices: \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could opt to live on the streets, I really don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ll never understand.\u201d Ray wonders if his brother\u2019s problems stemmed from his childhood, and says he often wonders what Clive was running from when he left home at 13. Aloma Owens is Clive\u2019s sister. She is a year older and grew up with him in the same household in Glasgow. Owens juggles two jobs: one as a material handler for Federal Express at Memphis international airport; the other as a table games dealer at the MGM Goldstrike casino on the Mississippi river. She has just finished a shift at the airport when she speaks to us on the phone. Owens says people thought she and Clive were twins because they looked so alike. \u201cI was always with him. It was me and him together pretty much when we were young,\u201d Owens says. She says the family weren\u2019t poor growing up, but weren\u2019t rich either. \u201cWe had a nice house, food on the table, a garden. We never had any problems.\u201d She remembers how adventurous he was as a child. \u201cHe would climb the rooftops, jump on the backs of garbage trucks, getting a little ride. I was a little tomboy. Anything my brothers did, I was like: \u2018I\u2019m coming, too.\u2019\u201d Owens was just as surprised as Ray when she discovered Clive\u2019s paintings, as he wasn\u2019t at all arty when they were young. But she disagrees strongly with Ray about one thing \u2013 the dancing. \u201cWe were in a break-dancing group, and we used to dance in the streets \u2013 street busking \u2013 in Scotland.\u201d Ray says he was a stiff dancer? \u201cHe was an excellent dancer,\u201d she insists. \u201cWe were in a group called Street Damage and got a lot of gigs out of that, so he was real good.\u201d Owens says Clive\u2019s charm got him out of sticky situations in his childhood. One night, when he and Owens were 10 and 11, they were out with two friends and decided to pick some apples from a tree in a private garden. \u201cA man started shouting: \u2018Get out of here!\u2019 So, everybody started running, but poor Clive was so slow. He got caught. The man took him in the house and the other two guys took off and I\u2019m waiting on my brother. Do you know, Clive came out with some food, some money and some apples. A big bag of apples! So, I said: \u2018What did you tell him?\u2019 He said: \u2018I told him the boys were threatening us and making us come and pick the apples.\u2019 So he knew how to talk to people and get himself out of things the right way.\u201d Although Owens describes a happy childhood, the pair had to endure racist abuse. \u201cWe used to get called \u2018nignogs\u2019, and the \u2018twin Twix pack\u2019, and \u2018there\u2019s the two Guinnesses coming\u2019. Crazy stuff,\u201d she says. Owens took the abuse in her stride, but she says Clive took it to heart. After Clive died, Owen was shown a letter that one of her siblings had received from Clive. Owens gets emotional when reading it out loud, as Clive talks about missing their mum, who followed her to the US in 1991. Clive ran away from home with his older brother Vernon when he was 13. Owens never fully discovered what happened to Clive during that period. When she asks Vernon about it, she says, he just cries. Ray is equally in the dark, but learned from Clive, during a rare moment of openness, that he sought out their father at around this time. According to Ray, he was a selfish, violent man with a callous attitude towards his many children. \u201cWho\u2019s for me, I\u2019m for them,\u201d was his motto, Ray says. \u201cClive told me he ran away from home in Glasgow to Liverpool,\u201d Ray recalls. \u201cSo Clive sat outside our dad\u2019s house because he wasn\u2019t home, and my dad came back from wherever he was and asked: \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 He fed him, put him in his car and took him to the motorway and said: \u2018Thumb a lift back to Scotland.\u2019\u201d Ray sobs quietly, and apologises. \u201cIt tears me up thinking that a parent can do something like that to a kid.\u201d Ameera Ramzan says that, after discharging himself from hospital, Clive returned to the streets to make a living. According to Ramzan, he had two bleeds on the brain and had heart surgery twice in the space of a year before he died. \u201cNobody should be left on the street like that,\u201d she says. When we ask Manchester University NHS foundation trust, which runs Manchester Royal Infirmary, if Clive had a mental health assessment and whether he was in a fit state to leave hospital, the trust says it is unable to comment on individual cases. Five weeks after leaving hospital, Clive died from pulmonary heart failure. Ramzan is still haunted by his death. \u201cI was coming out of the hospital and I\u2019ve got a clear bag with his name on it with just a few belongings. And I\u2019m hugging this bag with his clothes in it, thinking: \u2018What is this?\u2019 This is all this man\u2019s got for 52 years in this world \u2013 one bag.\u201d Aloma Owens is also trying to come to terms with his death. She is grieving for a brother who couldn\u2019t have been closer as a child, but was a stranger as an adult. After he left home at 13, she only saw him on a handful of occasions before she went to live in the US at the age of 21. How does she remember him? \u201cBreak-dancing, happy thoughts, y\u2019know.\u201d Her voice quivers. \u201cI get really emotional. I look at the pictures of his childhood and this is how I remember Clive. This is how I remember his face. I don\u2019t know the other part of him. I don\u2019t know the adult pictures that my brother sends me. I know that\u2019s Clive, but I don\u2019t know that Clive.\u201d * * * On 9 October, the homeless squatters were evicted from the Unicorn hotel. Stuart Potts livestreamed the eviction, and then occupied the Albert Edward pub in Eccles. For all his good deeds, Potts has a knack for getting himself in trouble, and was arrested after letting off fireworks during the two-minute silence on Remembrance Sunday. He told Manchester magistrates court they were a tribute intended to mirror the cannons fired during the televised service in London. The judge didn\u2019t accept his argument, and Potts is serving a 16-week prison sentence. At the end of October, Manchester city council announced it had dropped plans to fine people \u00a3100 for \u201caggressive or intimidating begging\u201d. Burnham is rapidly running out of time to meet his impossible deadline, but he says that he feels he has kept his promise in spirit: a year on from its launch, more than 2,600 people have accessed temporary accommodation through A Bed Every Night and 817 rough sleepers across Greater Manchester have moved off the streets into longer-term accommodation. \u201cIf people think I haven\u2019t done enough, it\u2019s up to them,\u201d Burnham says. \u201cAnd if they want to vote me out on that basis, they should do that. I\u2019m perfectly happy for people to say at the election: \u2018Well, sorry, you said \u2026\u2019 But, no, I don\u2019t consider it a failure to have looked after so many people through A Bed Every Night.\u201d Meanwhile, Ray is still struggling to come to terms with Clive\u2019s death. Ray tries to tell himself that his brother was his own man, a loner who couldn\u2019t be helped. But he doesn\u2019t quite believe it. \u201cI feel as if I have failed him. I do feel I should have gone to Manchester looking for him, to try to bring him home. But I can\u2019t put that right.\u201d One comfort is discovering after his death that Clive was such a talented artist. The painting that Katy Cavanagh bought from Clive tells the story of his life so well, he says \u2013 storm clouds and choppy waters on the high seas. But there is one feature Ray missed on first viewing: a tiny ship among the giant waves. \u201cI reckon that\u2019s him,\u201d Ray says. \u201cA little ship in the storm.\u201d Additional reporting by Eric Allison If you are worried about becoming homeless, contact the housing department of your local authority to fill in a homeless application.

Top stories The penultimate week of the election campaign began badly for Jeremy Corbyn as the Labour leader, grilled by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil, insisted antisemitism had not risen in Labour on his watch and resisted repeated calls to apologise to Britain\u2019s Jews. Things looked up somewhat, however, when he presented a 451-page dossier which he said proved the showing the US preferred a no-deal Brexit and was demanding the NHS would be \u201con the table\u201d in talks on a future trade deal. Apparently rattled by an in-depth YouGov \u201cMRP\u201d poll (of the kind that predicted the outcome of the 2017 election) showing the Conservatives on course for a comfortable 68-seat majority, Labour instigated a tactical switch from going after Tory marginals to consolidating seats they already hold and trying to win back leave voters. The Lib Dems, meanwhile, were told by their former leader Vince Cable that their policy of scrapping Brexit without another referendum \u2013 which looks like doing them no favours with voters \u2013 was \u201ca distraction and not a very helpful one\u201d. The Conservatives, for their part, were embarrassed by Boris Johnson\u2019s decision not to take part in a Channel 4 climate debate, prompting the broadcaster to replace him with a melting ice statue (thought not in the prime minister\u2019s image). Johnson claimed a Tory government would be freed up to give more state aid to struggling companies after leaving the EU, but faced criticism over whether he was prepared to face a Neil inquisition of the kind that had posed Corbyn such problems. The row is unresolved, but tragedy \u2013 in the form of a London Bridge terror attack that left two dead \u2013 prompted the BBC to invite the PM on to Andrew Marr\u2019s show anyway, where he blamed Labour for the early release of the killer and made a series of questionable and downright inaccurate statements. The independent and respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said neither the Conservatives nor Labour were offering a \u201cproperly credible prospectus\u201d in their respective manifestos. And in the polls, the gap between the two parties narrowed. What next First, the election is far from over: no less an authority than Dominic Cummings warned Tory campaigners it was way tighter than it looked.

But things may not be that easy on the EU side either, warned the incoming European council president Charles Michel: Brexit may have brought the EU27 together, but the next phase could see internal divisions emerging over trade talks with the UK.

      "bodyText": "The leader of the New South Wales Nationals, John Barilaro, and the water minister, Melinda Pavey, have demanded a major rewrite of the Murray-Darling Basin plan, including that the state be excused from recovering further water for the environment, or the state will pull out. With a drought wreaking havoc on rural economies, particularly in NSW, the two Nationals ministers have upped the ante and set out a list of demands including that evaporation losses count toward water for the environment. Responding to mounting pressure, the federal water resources minister, David Littleproud, announced a new review of water sharing by the interim inspector general of Murray-Darling Basin water resources, Mick Keelty. Littleproud told reporters in Canberra the snap three-month inquiry into the southern basin of the Murray-Darling would \u201ctake the politics out\u201d of the issue but stressed that he had not promised farmers extra water and water allocations were \u201ca matter for the states\u201d. The NSW ministers also want a pause on the timetable for new water resource plans until the drought breaks. NSW is one of the laggard states in developing these new rules on water sharing. These plans set out how water will be shared between classes of licence holders, the environment and Indigenous people along the river system. The current water sharing arrangements for the Barwon-Darling have been blamed by several scientific reports for the fish kills at Menindee last summer and the extended drying of the lower Darling River. NSW\u2019s demands, if agreed, to would effectively undermine the objectives of the plan. Just over 2,000GL of the target of 2,750GL has been recovered so far, but the last portion is proving extremely difficult. Barilaro refused to say whether his demands had backing from the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, or had been approved by cabinet. Berejiklian recommitted NSW to the Murray-Darling Basin plan at the August meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. The ministers\u2019 demands come after southern NSW irrigators rallied in Canberra on Monday demanding the plan be scrapped. Organiser Carly Marriott told Guardian Australia that \u201cenvironmental water is not an out-and-out good thing\u201d but rather is a piece of \u201cbranding\u201d used to persuade the public. \u201cThey\u2019re banking on ignorance. They\u2019re banking on the urban voter to think the government is doing what is right for the environment when in actual fact they punch that much water down a natural waterway to deliver on things ... that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d At a meeting on Monday Littleproud agreed to extend powers to Keelty to investigate the impact of changing distribution of in-flows to the southern basin on state shares under the plan. The proposal will be put to the ministerial council on 17 December, with Keelty to report back by 31 March. On Tuesday Littleproud also snapped back at the NSW ministers\u2019 demands, providing \u201ca little bit of education\u201d to them that \u201cthe federal government does not approve or decline demands in the Murray-Darling Basin\u201d. \u201cThat is done by all basin states who work together in cooperation \u2026 that is not a question for the federal government,\u201d he told reporters. Littleproud said the federal government \u201cdoes not have those powers\u201d and described his role instead as one of \u201cherding cats\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Farmers in the Riverina and the Goulburn Valley are doing it particularly tough as the allocations for less reliable water entitlements have been slashed and prices for high security water have skyrocketed. Many dairy farmers and rice growers sold their high security water entitlements during water buybacks last decade to reclaim water for environmental flows. Barilaro said NSW has no more water to give. \u201cWe simply can no longer stand by the Murray-Darling Basin plan in its current form, the plan needs to work for us, not against us,\u201d Barilaro said. \u201cIt is clear our communities in regional NSW have had enough, and today we stand with them. \u201cNSW is being crippled by the worst drought on record and our future is at risk. The plan should be flexible, adaptive and needs to produce good environmental outcomes for this state. \u201cI refuse to let regional communities die while we wash productive water into the Great Australian Bight, 1,000km away. As well as being excused from NSW\u2019s 450GL remaining water recovery target, Barilaro and Pavey also called for the barrages to be removed from lakes in South Australia to allow saltwater back in. It also wants transmission losses in the Murray-Darling Basin to count towards water returned to the environment. Evaporation and losses through water seeping into the ground are affected by rainfall, temperatures, winds and the dryness of the soil. In droughts the losses in conveying water down the Murray-Darling river system skyrocket. According to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority these losses were expected to reach 1,000GL for the 2018-19 year . Pavey said the MDBP was never intended to be an unaltered, static document. \u201cThe regional communities in NSW are being sold up the river by the commonwealth and South Australia is holding every other state to ransom,\u201d Pavey said. \u201cNSW has already done the heavy lifting and our communities are suffering as a result. South Australian lower lakes are full while NSW communities are dry. The barrages were constructed in the 1930s to stop seawater flowing back up the Murray. While this happened naturally, the reduced flows in the Murray due to irrigation in NSW and Victoria meant flushing of the lakes became inadequate. In the 1970s and 1980s salinity was identified as a major threat to the environment and drinking water quality in South Australia. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has responsibility for the overall management of the river system, but states are responsible for enforcement and detailed water sharing arrangements. The plan was tweaked in 2018 to reduce some of the water recovery targets in the northern basin, and put more emphasis on efficiency projects as a way of achieving environmental outcomes. Comment has been sought from the federal government and the MDBA.",

      "bodyText": "The planned extradition and prosecution of Julian Assange by the United States is a \u201cnew form of forced rendition\u201d and a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d for press freedom, according to the WikiLeaks editor-in-chief, Kristinn Hrafnsson. Ahead of a private briefing for Australian parliamentarians on Tuesday afternoon, Harfnsson, an Icelandic-based investigative journalist, told the National Press Club in Canberra the \u201cforced rendition\u201d of Assange was not occurring \u201cwith a sack over the head and an orange jumpsuit but with the enabling of the UK legal system and with the apparent support of the Australian government\u201d. \u201cI strongly believe that resolving this issue has important international implications,\u201d Hrafnsson said. \u201cProlonging it creates an enabling environment for the deterioration of press freedom standards globally\u201d. Political support for stopping the extradition of Assange has been growing in recent months and Australian MPs from across the political divide have formed the Parliamentary Friends of the Bring Julian Assange Home group. The group has membership from the LNP, National party, ALP and crossbench and is co-chaired by George Christensen and Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie. Hrafnsson acknowledged the work of the friendship group during his press club address. \u201cThank you for getting it, Barnaby Joyce, Rebekha Sharkie, Rex Patrick, Julian Hill, Steve Georganas, Richard Di Natale, Adam Bandt, Peter Whish-Wilson and Zali Steggal.\u201d He also thanked a group of more than 60 doctors who have written an open letter saying they fear Assange\u2019s health is currently so bad the WikiLeaks founder could die inside a top-security British jail. Hrafnsson challenged Australian journalists to press the Morrison government to advocate on Assange\u2019s behalf. \u201cYour government did take steps to secure the freedom of James Ricketson, also of Melinda Taylor, also of Peter Greste. \u201cPlease be direct. Please be insistent. Ask for details, not platitudes. Please be unrelenting and prepared to back each other when evasions occur,\u201d he said. \u201cYou, above all people, are able to distinguish between publishing and espionage, a distinction the US government and its allies seem intent on erasing, and you know as well as I that if they are successful in this, then Julian Assange won\u2019t be the last of our colleagues to have his life destroyed in this line of work.\u201d Assange faced allegations of sexual assault in Sweden, which he denied, when he entered the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012 and sought asylum because he feared being extradited to America. He spent nearly seven years in the embassy until police removed him in April after Ecuador revoked his political asylum. The Swedish investigation was dropped in November. The British home secretary, Sajid Javid, has signed a request for Assange to be extradited to the US, where he faces charges of computer hacking. Assange faces an 18-count indictment, issued by the US Department of Justice, that includes charges under the Espionage Act. He is accused of soliciting and publishing classified information and conspiring to hack into a government computer. As well as pressing Assange\u2019s case, the WikiLeaks editor-in-chief faced questions on Tuesday about the role of the organisation during the US presidential election. In November 2016, Assange issued a statement defending the role of his organisation, saying it published hacked emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign because publication was in the public interest, \u201cnot due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election\u201d. WikiLeaks did not publish any material about Donald Trump.

Rather, it\u2019s the point where the two intersect, and that for me is the essence of enlightening travel. How exactly does meeting new people and seeing new places affect you, change your attitudes and increase your self-knowledge? Sometimes it\u2019s faraway and exotic travel (in New Zealand: \u201cit fascinated me that people had Antarctica as a word in their ordinary, everyday lexicon.\u201d) and sometimes it\u2019s time spent for work in a city nearer home. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/mar/08/solo-travel-for-women-is-about-freedom-in-every-sense-of-the-word-rosita-boland\" title=\"\">Boland</a> is an observant and thoughtful traveller, who is also grateful for and aware of what her own \u201chome roots\u201d have given her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce10cea4afcb01d931a9ad3e28ffacb3d698069e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce10cea4afcb01d931a9ad3e28ffacb3d698069e/0_230_2016_1210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Books Paper Scissors bookshop, Belfast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Books Paper Scissors bookshop, Belfast</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over several years as an enthusiastic amateur traveller, I\u2019ve tried to keep a journal of experiences and journeys. Boland\u2019s determination to write diaries and notes, instead of taking hundreds of photographs, resonates with me. Do I ever look back at old holiday photos? Rarely.

At 26, Brown is studying for an MA in the US and thinks her career path is mapped out \u2013 until chance brings drystone waller \u201cJack\u201d from Wales to Washington DC. Fascinated by his craft, she accepts an invitation to visit his home in Wales. Mere months later, she is working alongside him. Delighting in the physicality of the job and the shifting beauty of the Welsh countryside, Brown discovers that she doesn\u2019t need to be on native soil to feel a sense of homecoming. She deftly sketches the local topography by listing the gear changes required to navigate its valleys, revels in the local language and discovers the joy of elevenses. Her quest to build a life from her craft takes her to Italy, North Carolina, Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge mountains, and back to rural Wales. Her evocation of place is pitch-perfect, from mist-shrouded hillsides to the \u201cgorgeous throb\u201d of the thick summer air of North Carolina.

Likewise, there\u2019s a neat line about the invention of the footnote, in a footnote. There will be many nature titles vying for a place on Christmas lists this year, and no doubt a cornucopia of literary anthologies and travelogues to boot.

The Rise of Fascism Through the Eyes of Everyday People by Julia Boyd (Elliott &amp; Thompson)\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In the 1930s, Germany was the most popular tourist destination in Europe. Yet few travel books were written about it at the time. Julia Boyd has tracked down those accounts and, together with descriptions from private letters and diaries and from public archives, produced a fresh view of between- the-wars Germany. This is land of friendly people, beautiful countryside, vineyards, forests, medieval villages and impressive culture. A female journalist notes how a woman could do what she liked in Weimar Germany. A New Zealand Rhodes Scholar writes of \u201cthe emergence of a new type of person, sunburnt, wearing sensible clothes and of splendid physique\u201d. Other accounts, especially those from journalists, politicians and diplomats, convey a sense of unease, of menace. Chilling stuff. This book will earn a permanent place on people\u2019s bookshelves, rather than being shipped out to a charity shop to make room for next year\u2019s batch.

Fellous\u2019 writing carries an innate intelligence that never feels contrived. With it she observes the rituals and language that fabricate an identity, focusing on what happens when these things dissolve or become fragmented. It is punctuated with photos taken on a phone and infused with poetic descriptions of Tunisia, Paris and Normandy, among other places that the author has passed through and allowed to pass through her. This piece of autofiction has a strange and perfectly balanced duality of softness and seriousness. The text is melancholic and nostalgic, but also urgent and of its time. Perhaps it is the value of living within such paradoxes that I took from this novel, memoir, text \u2013 whatever it is.<br><strong>Callum Churchill, store manager, <a href=\"http://www.stanfords.co.uk/bristol-store\" title=\"\">Stanfords</a>, Bristol</strong></p> <h2><strong>Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands, by Judith Schalansky</strong></h2> <p>Penguin, \u00a316.99</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad4e3a2d1104488d3e4bb050fb375b23c72a0762\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad4e3a2d1104488d3e4bb050fb375b23c72a0762/0_97_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Typewronger Books, Edinburgh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Typewronger Books, Edinburgh</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b47d821250c8c3544e44edfaba238edf789b71a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b47d821250c8c3544e44edfaba238edf789b71a6/0_0_1293_2013/642.jpg\" alt=\"Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands by Judith Schalansky (Penguin)\" width=\"642\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My favourite travel book is <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/as-i-walked-out-one-midsummer-morning-9780241953280.html\" title=\"\">As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning</a> by Laurie Lee.

      "bodyText": "Elsewhere, by Rosita Boland Doubleday Ireland, \u00a38.99 It\u2019s not entirely a travelogue nor is it a memoir. Rather, it\u2019s the point where the two intersect, and that for me is the essence of enlightening travel. How exactly does meeting new people and seeing new places affect you, change your attitudes and increase your self-knowledge? Sometimes it\u2019s faraway and exotic travel (in New Zealand: \u201cit fascinated me that people had Antarctica as a word in their ordinary, everyday lexicon.\u201d) and sometimes it\u2019s time spent for work in a city nearer home. Boland is an observant and thoughtful traveller, who is also grateful for and aware of what her own \u201chome roots\u201d have given her. Over several years as an enthusiastic amateur traveller, I\u2019ve tried to keep a journal of experiences and journeys. Boland\u2019s determination to write diaries and notes, instead of taking hundreds of photographs, resonates with me. Do I ever look back at old holiday photos? Rarely. But I get pleasure from re-reading my own notebooks. I\u2019d say to anyone who likes to travel, please read this book and start \u201cnoticing\u201d your own journeys \u2013 even if you can\u2019t be persuaded to put down your phone and write notes! Chosen by Linda Murray, owner, Books Paper Scissors, Belfast Between Stone and Sky, by Whitney Brown Constable, \u00a39.99 This beautiful memoir really got under my skin. At 26, Brown is studying for an MA in the US and thinks her career path is mapped out \u2013 until chance brings drystone waller \u201cJack\u201d from Wales to Washington DC. Fascinated by his craft, she accepts an invitation to visit his home in Wales. Mere months later, she is working alongside him. Delighting in the physicality of the job and the shifting beauty of the Welsh countryside, Brown discovers that she doesn\u2019t need to be on native soil to feel a sense of homecoming. She deftly sketches the local topography by listing the gear changes required to navigate its valleys, revels in the local language and discovers the joy of elevenses. Her quest to build a life from her craft takes her to Italy, North Carolina, Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge mountains, and back to rural Wales. Her evocation of place is pitch-perfect, from mist-shrouded hillsides to the \u201cgorgeous throb\u201d of the thick summer air of North Carolina. This is a tale of finding harmony between body and soul, between the heft of stone, the inspiration of good friends and the joy of travel. Jenny Tattersall, bookseller, Cogito Books, Hexham Footnotes: A Journey Round Britain in the Company of Great Writers, by Peter Fiennes Oneworld, \u00a316.99 Jostling to the front of a rather crowded pack of recent nature writers, Fiennes\u2019 2017 Oak and Ash and Thorn was justly revered for its lyrical prose and literary bedrock. Honing his easy-going and often witty style in this new book, Fiennes takes us on journeys of writers from 12th-century cleric Giraldus Cambrensis to Beryl Bainbridge, by way of Enid Blyton and Charles Dickens. Though literary travelogues aren\u2019t a wholly novel genre, there\u2019s an infectious enthusiasm and self-deprecating authority to Fiennes\u2019s insights and he\u2019s a most agreeable companion. Recounting a visit to a Welsh barber, he talks of \u201cmy scalp being kneaded and delicately teased by an early middle-aged, handsomely coiffed blond man from Neath\u201d. Likewise, there\u2019s a neat line about the invention of the footnote, in a footnote. There will be many nature titles vying for a place on Christmas lists this year, and no doubt a cornucopia of literary anthologies and travelogues to boot. This one should be towards the top. Tim Batcup, owner, Cover to Cover, Mumbles, Swansea Travellers in the Third Reich: the Rise of Fascism through the Eyes of Everyday People, by Julia Boyd Elliott &amp; Thompson, \u00a310.99 In the 1930s, Germany was the most popular tourist destination in Europe. Yet few travel books were written about it at the time. Julia Boyd has tracked down those accounts and, together with descriptions from private letters and diaries and from public archives, produced a fresh view of between- the-wars Germany. This is land of friendly people, beautiful countryside, vineyards, forests, medieval villages and impressive culture. A female journalist notes how a woman could do what she liked in Weimar Germany. A New Zealand Rhodes Scholar writes of \u201cthe emergence of a new type of person, sunburnt, wearing sensible clothes and of splendid physique\u201d. Other accounts, especially those from journalists, politicians and diplomats, convey a sense of unease, of menace. Chilling stuff. This book will earn a permanent place on people\u2019s bookshelves, rather than being shipped out to a charity shop to make room for next year\u2019s batch. The hardback, already out of print, is becoming scarce with secondhand copies for sale on Amazon at almost twice the original price. Evelyn Westwood, co-owner, Westwood Books, Sedbergh, Cumbria Love of Country: A Hebridean Journey, by Madeleine Bunting Granta, \u00a39.99 The first thing to say, and this is important in the book world, is that it has a terrific cover. The second is that old classic of it just being \u201ca good read\u201d. Bunting writes evocatively about the Hebrides and, for the most part, gets the details and description right. The best thing about it is that it made me want to revisit the islands I know, as well as visit the ones I haven\u2019t been to yet. The book has a lovely balance of autobiography, literary references, history, politics, religion and culture. I opened the shop in September 2018 \u2013 this is my retirement project \u2013 and though we don\u2019t carry many new books (we focus on secondhand), I\u2019ve had to restock this a number of times because it\u2019s so popular. Ruth Anderson, owner, Well-Read Books of Wigtown, Dumfries and Galloway This Tilting World, by Colette Fellous Les Fugitives, \u00a313 Translated from French by Sophie Lewis, this beautifully elusive book mixes biography, travel memoir, fiction, essay and journalism to weave a lyrical account of identity and its ambiguity. Fellous\u2019 writing carries an innate intelligence that never feels contrived. With it she observes the rituals and language that fabricate an identity, focusing on what happens when these things dissolve or become fragmented. It is punctuated with photos taken on a phone and infused with poetic descriptions of Tunisia, Paris and Normandy, among other places that the author has passed through and allowed to pass through her. This piece of autofiction has a strange and perfectly balanced duality of softness and seriousness. The text is melancholic and nostalgic, but also urgent and of its time. Perhaps it is the value of living within such paradoxes that I took from this novel, memoir, text \u2013 whatever it is. Callum Churchill, store manager, Stanfords, Bristol Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands, by Judith Schalansky Penguin, \u00a316.99 My favourite travel book is As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning by Laurie Lee. It\u2019s beautifully written and filled with adventure and hope, though Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s Travels with a Donkey in the C\u00e9vennes is also high on my list. His language is surprisingly modern for a Victorian and we discover he invented the sleeping bag! I know a lot of the travel writing stuff I like is rather old, so how about, for gift-giving, Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands: Fifty Islands I Have Not Visited and Never Will by Judith Schalansky. It\u2019s a gorgeous wee book and the perfect thing to browse through in a spare hour. Tom Hodges, owner, Typewronger Books, Edinburgh Waymaking: An Anthology of Women\u2019s Adventure Writing, Poetry and Art, edited by Helen Mort, Claire Carter, Heather Dawe and Camilla Barnard Vertebrate Publishing, \u00a317.99 This is a collection of musings, poems and illustrations from a wide range of women worldwide, all of whom share a great passion for the outdoors, adventure and the wild. Their pieces will transport you on incredible journeys from the majesty of the Cairngorms through to the glacial domes of southern Chile, from capturing underwater photographs in Fiji to shivering through a blizzard in Canada\u2019s Baffin Island. These amazing, intrepid women have captured the beauties of our world through their pens, brushes and lenses. The elegantly designed book includes both colour and black-and-white artwork to accompany the text. Enlightening and hugely inspirational, this is a book to treasure. Cate Simmons, bookseller, News from Nowhere, Liverpool Ghostland: In Search of a Haunted Country, by Edward Parnell William Collins, \u00a39.99 After a family tragedy, this author turned for comfort to British literature, particularly literature that involved ghost stories.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has landed, touching down at Stansted overnight for two days of meetings over Nato \u2013 an organisation he is openly ambivalent about. Conservatives will be hoping he keeps quiet and doesn\u2019t try to \u201chelp\u201d their electoral fortunes. Read on for the latest election news, and the best of the rest \u2013 and don\u2019t forget to follow our live politics coverage as the day progresses. What\u2019s going on? Donald Trump\u2019s presence in London today for Nato meetings is causing jitters in the Conservative camp, as the Tories worry about the US president\u2019s unpredictability and tendency to say things without necessarily thinking through the consequences. Trump is being seen as a potential liability for Boris Johnson in the campaign, amid Labour\u2019s accusations that a US-UK trade deal will lead to an NHS sell-off and higher drug prices for Britons. Rowena Mason writes that Johnson will seek to play down his relationship with the president in light of those accusations. Johnson has made clear he would not welcome any input from Trump at such a sensitive time in the campaign, after the US president offered his endorsement over the summer. But Trump has a full two days in the UK and is expected to give a press conference on Wednesday. The Tories will be hopeful he says little or nothing to inflame voter fears. Trump will be among Nato leaders attending a banquet with the Queen tonight at Buckingham Palace. NHS nurses and doctors will lead a \u201cHands off our NHS\u201d protest starting at Trafalgar Square then heading down the Mall to arrive at Canada Gate, opposite the palace. Also protesting outside Buckingham Palace will be the family of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old who was killed in a motorbike crash in Northamptonshire in August. Anne Sacoolas, the 42-year-old motorist allegedly responsible, claimed diplomatic immunity and was allowed to return to the US. Meanwhile the Conservatives face ongoing accusations of politicising a tragedy in their response to the London Bridge terror attack. One of Johnson\u2019s ministers has been accused of using the \u201cTrump playbook\u201d and Dave Merritt, father of victim Jack Merritt, has written a powerful piece in the Guardian saying his son \u201cwould be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against\u201d. At a glance Labour will launch its disability manifesto this morning, vowing to end prejudice faced by disabled people in the UK. Labour use a broad brush to target the many, while the Tories get dirty on Facebook \u2013 we unpack the parties\u2019 digital campaign strategies. Hugh Grant has joined the Lib Dems for a spot of campaigning \u2013 though he\u2019s not a party member, just in favour of tactical voting to prevent a Conservative majority and stop Brexit. Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign has been marked by a \u201ctsunami\u201d of lies and the BBC has allowed him to get away with them, writes Peter Oborne. Jeremy Corbyn has been spotted in a bespoke campaign suit with \u201cFor the many, not the few\u201d stitched into its red pinstripes. \u201cWhat British democracy needs right now is the advice of a cartoonist who doesn\u2019t even live in your wretched country,\u201d writes Guardian Australia\u2019s cartoonist First Dog on the Moon. The day ahead Boris Johnson is expected to be campaigning in south-west England. Jeremy Corbyn is due to give a speech in London on workers\u2019 rights. Jo Swinson is expected to visit a farm in the east of England. Nato leaders are gathering for the alliance summit over Tuesday and Wednesday. The main talks will take place tomorrow near Watford and Johnson will break off from election campaigning to play host.

Best of the rest &gt; The UK\u2019s six richest people control as much wealth as the poorest 13 million, according to research by the Equality Trust. They are businessmen Gopichand and Srichand Hinduja (\u00a312.8bn); Sir Jim Ratcliffe, boss of Ineos chemicals (\u00a39.2bn); hedge fund manager Michael Platt (\u00a36.1bn); and property developers David and Simon Reuben (\u00a35.7bn each). Their combined fortune of \u00a339.4bn jars very heavily with news that at least 135,000 children in Britain will spend Christmas homeless \u2013 the worst it has been in 12 years. Polly Neate from Shelter said: \u201cDay in, day out we see the devastating impact the housing emergency is having on children across the country. They are being uprooted from friends; living in cold, cramped B&amp;Bs and going to bed at night scared by the sound of strangers outside.\u201d &gt; Police have arrested a man aged 51 on suspicion of murder after a 12-year-old boy died in what police believe was a deliberate hit and run outside a school in Essex. Four teenagers and a woman in her 50s were also hurt during the incident in Loughton. \u201cAs a school and a community, we are devastated,\u201d said Helen Gascoyne, the headteacher of Debden Park high school, as she confirmed the boy who died was one of her students. &gt; Prince Andrew faces renewed pressure after his accuser Virginia Giuffre, formerly Roberts, went on BBC Panorama to underline allegations she was trafficked to have sex with him by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell when she was aged 17. Panorama said it had uncovered a 2015 email from Andrew to Maxwell where he wrote: \u201cLet me know when we can talk. Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts.\u201d Maxwell replied: \u201cHave some info. Call me when you have a moment.\u201d The prince, 59, has stood down from public duties over his relationship with Epstein but has consistently and categorically denied the sex allegations.

The letter said: \u201cWe want to be able to continue to source from, or invest in, the Brazilian soy industry but if the ASM is not maintained, this will risk our business with Brazilian soy.\u201d Peter Andrews, head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents many of the signatories, said they were seeking assurances from the Brazilian government that the moratorium would remain. \u201cCustomers expect the products they buy not to harm the environment, and retailers invest heavily in their supply chains to deliver that as far as possible,\u201d he said. The letter, which was coordinated by the Farm Animal Investment Risk &amp; Return Initiative, argued that continued increases in soy production were possible without further destroying the rainforest. Brazil was the world\u2019s largest soybean exporter in 2016-17, sending 60.3m metric tonnes abroad, the vast majority to China\u2019s rapidly expanding meat industry, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Lower land and labour costs than the US have made Brazil the key sources of soybeans to China. China\u2019s dependence on Brazil for the crop increased last year, when US soybeans were the subject of retaliatory tariffs in the trade war between Beijing and Washington. In March scientists writing in the Nature journal warned of a possible \u201csurge of tropical deforestation\u201d in the wake of the tariffs, as Bolsonaro\u2019s government weakened protections and Brazilian producers sought to replace their US rivals. Bolsonaro\u2019s widely condemned policies have drawn comparisons with his US counterpart, Donald Trump, who has also advocated deregulation \u2013 in the face of a global consensus in favour of action on the environment. In the US more than 70 CEOs, companies and union leaders signed a separate letter published on Monday calling for the US to remain within the Paris Climate Agreement, only weeks after Trump began the year-long process to exit the international accord. The signatories include two of the world\u2019s biggest tech firms, Google and Microsoft, and the FTSE-listed energy company National Grid. John Pettigrew, National Grid\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe scale and potential impact of the climate crisis has never been more real. The promise of the Paris Agreement is one of a just and prosperous world \u2013 something that can only be achieved through a collective effort of business, unions and governments that places climate action at the heart of everything we do.\u201d",

Chief operating officer Suresh Viswanathan, who was brought in from Barclays, has reorganised his division but only one of the people directly reporting into his office is a woman. Only two of the nine staff reporting into Robin Bulloch, who was recently put in charge of customer banking, are women.</p> <p>Sam Smethers, chief executive of the women\u2019s campaign group the Fawcett Society, said: \u201cTSB have clearly found it more challenging to hit their 2020 target than they anticipated. The precise reasons are unclear in this case, but we know that it can take time to progress gender equality, particularly at senior levels.

A spokeswoman for TSB would not comment on pay, but said: \u201cTSB takes gender diversity very seriously \u2026 and although we are making progress through initiatives such as our Promotion Ready and Aspiring Women programmes, we have revised our target. Internally, we are tracking interim targets as our ambition is to deliver on these targets before 2025.\u201d It is an embarrassing admission for the bank as it tries to restore its finances and reputation following an IT meltdown in 2018, which locked up to 1.9 million customers out of their accounts and led to the departure of Crosbie\u2019s predecessor, Paul Pester. TSB has since embarked on a turnaround plan that will involve closing more than 80 branches and cut nearly 400 jobs. But efforts to streamline the bank\u2019s operations have come at a cost. In one of her first major moves as chief executive, Crosbie cut down her leadership team from 15 to 10 members, leaving HR director Liz Ashford the only other woman on the team. Mark Brown, the general secretary for the Affinity trade union, said: \u201cGender diversity is not something you can switch off when things get difficult. For a challenger bank like TSB, ensuring that women are fairly represented in senior management roles should be a central part of its strategy especially when women make many of the consumer spending decisions. \u201cFor the new chief executive officer, Debbie Crosbie, to abandon TSB\u2019s target of having at least 45% of senior manager roles held by women by 2020 and pushing it out to 2025 is deeply offensive. She\u2019s well and truly pulled up the ladder on her female TSB colleagues.\u201d Aside from Ashford, Crosbie has made two external appointments since joining, both male. Chief operating officer Suresh Viswanathan, who was brought in from Barclays, has reorganised his division but only one of the people directly reporting into his office is a woman. Only two of the nine staff reporting into Robin Bulloch, who was recently put in charge of customer banking, are women. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the women\u2019s campaign group the Fawcett Society, said: \u201cTSB have clearly found it more challenging to hit their 2020 target than they anticipated. The precise reasons are unclear in this case, but we know that it can take time to progress gender equality, particularly at senior levels. This is why we argue for interventions such as positive action and proportionate progression to speed up change.\u201d",

As his party\u2019s manifesto suggests, we will be out of the European convention on human rights, and he will be free to do anything that takes his populist fancy (alone with Belarus, no place for minorities or journalists).

Extreme agitation grows, anticipating the exit poll results, seconds after 10pm on election night. One thing is certain: Labour will not win a majority. Whether you yearn for it or dread it, the party is as likely to have its HQ hit by a meteorite on 12 December as win outright. (Happy to eat a hundred hats if I\u2019m wrong.) What is all too possible is a blue wave sweeping all before it to wipe out all that tactical nuancing of each seat. In that instant our Brexit doom will be sealed and Boris Johnson will be off the leash \u2013 with the BBC, NHS, and safety, food and work regulations all in peril. As his party\u2019s manifesto suggests, we will be out of the European convention on human rights, and he will be free to do anything that takes his populist fancy (alone with Belarus, no place for minorities or journalists). Whether throwing away keys, reintroducing capital punishment, banishing foreigners, stamping on \u201cscroungers\u2019\u2019 or cracking down on Gypsies and Travellers, now that he\u2019s replaced Tory liberal lawyers with cohorts of Priti Patel, he will be able to use any means to bind his ex-Labour Brexit seats to Torydom. That\u2019s the nightmare: Britain joining the rightwing authoritarians to break Europe\u2019s civilised democratic values. Johnson has discovered that truth and rules are for little people. He finds there is no authority to stop his rule by yobs with posh accents, if only they can grab those Labour votes. Look at that peevish threat to \u201creview\u201d Channel 4\u2019s licence for empty-chairing him. There\u2019s only one alternative \u2013 but it\u2019s a good one. This deeply divided country needs a parliament to reflect itself and block the blue menace. The only balm is a parliament of compromise that blends progressive manifestos and sends the Brexit decision back to the voters, because nothing else can settle it. Here\u2019s another certainty: a majority will not have voted for Johnson. An even bigger majority will not have voted for Jeremy Corbyn. Call it what they like \u2013 a confidence and supply agreement, a vote by vote pact \u2013 but Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National party, Greens and Plaid Cymru together have the makings of a very good government. Never mind the nominal leader: its priorities, taxing and spending would be set together as all are agreed on ending austerity; electoral reform would be the glue. Can Labour stop a blue victory? We who travel about asking at bus queues, pubs and school gates, or knocking on doors, glean little more than those perusing unreliable polls. You sniff the air and hope to catch prevailing breezes. You hear pain, irritation with politics and ever more uncertainty. Sharp vignettes illuminate family lives framed in doorways. And some dottiness makes your head spin. I was listening in the Wakefield constituency, which voted 63% in favour of Brexit, making it one of the weak bricks in Labour\u2019s so-called red wall. Mary Creagh defends a 2,176-vote majority. If she falls, she leaves 14 years of landmarks: she fought for a new performing arts Brit school of the north, flood defences saving the city so far, a new hospital and more. She would be a loss to the green cause: the Environmental Audit Committee she chaired was instrumental in the ban on microbeads, and it won a single-use plastic bottle return law. Now it is in the midst of a fight over tons of fast-fashion waste. Good and bad MPs are swept along by election tides. In Ossett, Creagh\u2019s most Brexit-supporting ward, she talks of austerity \u2013 11 Sure Start centres lost, \u00a369m school cuts, food banks, a homeless man found dead last week. But there\u2019s a \u201cFuck off!\u201d from a man in paint-splashed overalls. \u201cI\u2019m for Farage,\u201d he says, \u201cfor sending back immigrants. You\u2019ve got a clown for a leader.\u201d Creagh usually tells Corbyn doubters, \u201cYou might not like the manager but you still back the team.\u201d That\u2019s no use here. A mother murmurs, yes, she\u2019s Labour. Her autistic son can\u2019t leave the house, four years out of school but he can only find three hours a week tutoring. \u201cSure Start was great when he was little,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it went. I\u2019m for remain, I\u2019m really worried what Brexit will do.\u201d Will her husband vote Labour? She looks nervous and whispers, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask. We don\u2019t talk about it. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Inside, he says brusquely: \u201cI was Labour, but no more. I\u2019m for Farage, got his feet on the ground. We voted out, so it\u2019s out!\u201d Many do greet Creagh warmly: firm Labour supporters, talking of cuts and remembering the time she got their personal independence payments (Pip) restored, the bedroom tax sorted, a universal credit payment challenged or the books she got for an empty school library. But there\u2019s that other wild card: one mum outside the school gates stomps past, hissing, \u201cI\u2019m voting Corbyn, not for you, Blairite!\u201d, a sign of another upcoming battle. Here\u2019s Brenda Trenam to cheer the day with her home full of animals and birds. She voted leave but regrets it now. \u201cChanged my mind, I never expected disruption,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for our children\u2019s future and for food prices. Labour? We always are.\u201d She\u2019s a housekeeper for a cystic fibrosis ward. \u201cI see the nurses\u2019 stress getting worse. I should be retired, but they took away my pension. Will Labour really give it back?\u201d But she\u2019s stunned when her husband Leslie says, \u201cI\u2019m uncertain. I\u2019m Brexit and Boris says he\u2019ll get us out. I\u2019ve been Tory a few years.\u201d \u201cOh no he hasn\u2019t!\u201d Brenda says, outraged. Lisa Dodd is another leave regretter. \u201cWe use the NHS a lot, my husband broke his neck, I had cancer, my mum was sick, so that \u00a3350m on the bus for the NHS swayed me. Now I worry what Brexit will do for our children and I want to vote again.\u201d She\u2019s out posting Labour leaflets. But what do you say to the mother who tells me her whole family is moving to Spain unless they get Brexit? Or to a nurse wasting a vote here on no-hope Lib Dems? Out of all that, the thwack of firm government forcing a non-consensual Brexit, with only minority support, would break politics as we know it. Roll on a progressive concordance of the reasonable that would let voters fix the Brexit mess. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended in two respects on 3 December 2019. The proportion of referendum voters in the constituency of Wakefield who favoured leaving the EU was corrected to 63%. The previously quoted figure (66%) referred to the area covered by Wakefield council. Secondly, the Environmental Audit Committee helped the passage of a return law for single-use plastic, rather than glass, bottles.",

      "body": "<p>If you do the kind of political journalism that involves talking to the general public, something faintly magical can sometimes happen. As events swirl around and you try to make sense of huge, complicated themes, a single conversation will bring everything into focus. And not via words alone: facial expressions, gestures, and the way individual words are emphasised can give you a vivid sense of how people think, and the way their feelings could create political change. The encounter might be fleeting, but a connection can be made; as one side understands, the other feels heard.</p> \n<p>Since 2010, we have been responsible for the Guardian video series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/anywhere-but-westminster\" title=\"\">Anywhere But Westminster</a>, in which we try to explore the gap between high politics and life as it is lived. With so much political coverage now based on opinion polling, we are interested not just in how people might vote, but what is behind their political choices. Vox pops have long been a crucial part of what we do.</p> \n<p>In the summer of 2014, our travels brought us to the town of Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. The local Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell, had resigned from his party and joined Ukip, then led by Nigel Farage. For us, the resulting byelection was a reason to visit the neighbourhood of Jaywick, which government statistics showed was the poorest place in England. It was here that we first got a sense of something potentially seismic. At that point, Ukip were largely understood as a new presence on the political right, who were appealing to habitual Tory voters. But things were shifting.</p> \n<p>When we arrive in a new place, the drill goes something like this. Find a location: a high street, or shopping parade; maybe a residential street, or the entrance to a railway station. Acknowledge the awkward nature of what you are about to do, but get over your nerves, and grit your teeth. Survey the people you can see. Then find your first potential interviewee, switch the camera on, and begin: \u201cExcuse me. We\u2019re making a film. Do you mind if we talk to you for a bit?\u201d</p> \n<p>In Jaywick, sitting on a bench on a raised step outside his house, was a retired man who had once been a railway worker in east London, and a member of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union. We shared his company for a quarter of an hour. Just about everything he said highlighted the unexpected turns politics was suddenly taking, and we have returned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/sep/15/ukip-england-east-world-upside-down-video\" title=\"\">the footage we shot</a> time and again. Sometimes, we don\u2019t ask for people\u2019s names (it can make people feel a bit like they\u2019re being interrogated), so we have always referred to him as \u201cStep Man\u201d. Our exchange began when we showed him one of Carswell\u2019s campaign leaflets.</p> \n<p>John Harris: \u201cSo you\u2019ve had one of these through your door?\u201d</p> \n<p>Step Man: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWhat do you think of him, and the fact that he\u2019s left the Conservative party?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cGood for him. It\u2019s about time somebody got up and spoke.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cRight now, what\u2019s wrong with Britain?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWell, nobody\u2019s doing anything are they? It\u2019s all going around in circles. They do bugger all.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cHave they done anything for Jaywick lately?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cNothing gets done for bloody Jaywick.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWhat needs doing?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cEverything. Look at the roads. Look at the state of it. The alleyways, look. Look at it all. We\u2019re a backwater, aren\u2019t we? That nobody gives a shit about.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cAnd do you think [Carswell], and Mr Farage, are any different?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cI\u2019m hoping so.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWho did you used to vote for in the past?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM <em>[Emphatically, before the end of the question]</em>: \u201cLabour. Always voted Labour.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cAnd what changed?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWell, bloody Blair. Let\u2019s face it, he did sod all for this country \u2026 And now he\u2019s in Europe, pissing about there, making millions. He went more Conservative than the Conservatives.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cBut this fellow [Carswell], until a week ago, was in the Conservative party himself. And now you\u2019re going to vote for him!\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWell, yeah. But he wants to make a few changes.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll help Jaywick?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cI bloody hope so.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cTime was, Labour was the party of the working man, eh?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cCourse it was. Course it was.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cBloody Thatcher got in \u2013 destroyed it, didn\u2019t she? <em>Done</em> the working classes, didn\u2019t she? Pissed the miners off. Done the railways. She pissed us all off, big time.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cBut Ukip\u2019s full of people who think Mrs Thatcher was the bee\u2019s knees.\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cNah \u2026 \u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cThey are! They\u2019re all Thatcherite\u2026 [Carswell] wants to shrink the state. He\u2019s no fan of the trade unions and the working man.\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose he is. Nobody is, are they?\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cBut somebody with your politics shouldn\u2019t be voting for him.\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: [Defiantly] \u201cYeah, course they should.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/sep/15/ukip-england-east-world-upside-down-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4xggv\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2157543\" data-video-name=\"Ukip's rise in the east of England: a world turned upside down \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\" data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/9/12/1410524220277/John-Harris-goes-to-UKIPs-017.jpg\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-447001543\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/9/12/1410524220277/John-Harris-goes-to-UKIPs-017.jpg\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/09/15/140912HarrisUkip-16x9.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/09/15/140912HarrisUkip_3gpSml16x9.3gp\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/09/15/140912HarrisUkip.webm\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/09/15/140912HarrisUkip_3gpLg16x9.3gp\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/09/15/140912HarrisUkip/140912HarrisUkip.m3u8\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/sep/15/ukip-england-east-world-upside-down-video\">Ukip\u2019s rise in the east of England: a world turned upside down</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Vox pops have a long history. A US radio series of that name began in 1932, sampling people\u2019s opinions about the presidential election that would bring Franklin Roosevelt to power. In 1961, an influential French documentary titled <em>Chronique d\u2019un \u00e9t\u00e9 </em>(Chronicle of a Summer)<em> </em>based a whole film around asking people on the street a simple but provocative question: \u201cAre you happy?\u201d Vox pops were popularised on British TV by the trailblazing presenter Alan Whicker (\u201cI went out with my cameras into the monstrous avenues of Houston, stopped passersby and asked whether they owned a gun \u2013 I discovered it wasn\u2019t a question of yes or no, but how many,\u201d he once said). By the time we started doing them, they were an established part of TV news packages \u2013 the bit that usually comes near the end to show some \u201cextra views of the subject matter in hand\u201d, to quote one set of BBC guidelines.</p> \n<p>But Step Man represented something different. In the footage of our conversation, interviewer and interviewee are sitting at the same level, instead of a TV crew being ranged in formation against their quarry. The interview turns into an exchange between equals, and by the end, the power structure is reversed. In effect, Step Man told us not only that the old political certainties are dying, but also that a different kind of political journalism is called for. Reporters needed to go to places outside the traditional centres of power. The story must be dictated, not by a script they bring with them, but by what they find when they get there.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>The initial spark for Anywhere But Westminster was the headache-inducing tedium of covering party conferences. The first time we worked together, in the autumn of 2009, we walked out of Labour\u2019s annual gathering in Brighton and asked members of the public what they thought of the party\u2019s sudden fixation with a group of voters termed \u201cthe squeezed middle\u201d. In response, people talked about their exasperation with such phrases (\u201cI\u2019m working-class,\u201d said one man, \u201cwhy\u2019s it always about the middle?\u201d), and their overwhelming sense of distance from an event that was happening only a few minutes away.</p> \n<p>With the arrival of the coalition government in 2010, we believed there was a damaging estrangement between politics and the public. We decided to put this alienation at the centre of our work, and started travelling around the country, talking to ordinary people in places that were rarely visited by journalists, TV news crews or political reporters. The after-effects of the financial crash of 2008 had yet to make an impact on British politics, and the UK seemed locked into certainties that had prevailed since the 1990s. Viewed from on high, a lot of voters seemed either uninterested in politics or sufficiently becalmed that they would behave mostly as the main parties expected. </p> \n<p>But out in the country, dissent and resentment were bubbling away, and through the prism of vox pops, we were starting to understand what was happening. We talked to people who had strong opinions, but were often not the kind of voters who had either the time or inclination to make their voices heard via the traditional forums: party activism, public meetings, protest marches. As journalists employed by the Guardian, we needed to be fair and balanced, but not necessarily impartial. We were trying to expose our viewers to opinions they were probably not used to hearing. Our own views came into the conversations we had, and made these exchanges more equal, authentic and spontaneous.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9d9d2314951df568980b2597ae0ef0804981256\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9d9d2314951df568980b2597ae0ef0804981256/0_204_2448_3060/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Domokos filming in Merthyr Tydfil in 2016\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Domokos filming in Merthyr Tydfil in 2016</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Domokos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The people we met during this initial period have been stuck in our heads for years. From 2011: the two young men selling paintball sessions in central Birmingham \u2013 one of them just back from military duty in Afghanistan \u2013 who were lucky to even make the minimum wage, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2011/sep/21/liberal-democrat-conference-economy-video\" title=\"\">completely detached</a> from politics. In 2013: the two older men in Merthyr Tydfil who answered our questions about the death of Margaret Thatcher by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2013/apr/12/the-big-thatcher-road-trip-video\" title=\"\">telling us</a> they still thought about the 1980s miners\u2019 strike \u201cevery day\u201d, and a 17-year-old student who did not know what a trade union was. In 2014 we met Debbie, a young mum from a council estate in Falkirk, Scotland. At a packed pro-independence public meeting on a Sunday night, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2014/sep/17/scottish-independence-political-reformation-video\" title=\"\">she told us</a> that the referendum had ignited her interest in politics for the first time. It had been, she said, \u201cOne of the most exciting things that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d</p> \n<p>Standard TV news packages tend to be scripted by the reporter, and vox pops are added to show what the public think of the story that\u2019s just been told. For us, although we always pre-arranged some encounters, vox pops were the first thing we did when we hit town. The views we encountered then guided a lot of what we did. We asked the people we met where we should go next, or who else we should meet. If a conversation with someone was particularly interesting, we would take their number, with a view to meeting them again.</p> \n<p>The films we were making were shaped by what we divined from talking to people, rather than the other way round. When we spoke to people for any length of time, our questions tended not to begin with \u201cWho are you going to vote for?\u201d or \u201cWhat do you think about Brexit?\u201d, but much more open, contextual lines of enquiry: \u201cWhat\u2019s it like living here?\u201d or \u201cHow do you feel about the future?\u201d We did not wear suits, or carry off-puttingly cumbersome equipment, or shine lights in people\u2019s faces.

It was also becoming unsustainable. \u201cThey\u2019re all in it for themselves, they don\u2019t care about us\u201d may have become the great cliche of vox pop journalism. But before it was a cliche, it was a warning.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>From the early 1990s until around 2010, mainstream debate was personified by such politicians as Tony Blair and Bill Clinton: men with an alleged genius for understanding public sentiment, and manipulating it. But since then, politics has been upended. Within a couple of years of David Cameron taking power, an often angry and unpredictable public was starting to render the usual rituals \u2013 big speeches, appearances on daytime TV \u2013 increasingly useless. Now, three years after Cameron left the stage, voters increasingly set the agenda. Not surprisingly, the vox pop \u2013 the literal \u201cvoice of the people\u201d \u2013 has itself become the focus of angry debate.</p> \n<p>Last month, an Ofcom review found that many viewers thought the use of vox pops in the BBC\u2019s news and current affairs coverage gave more prominence to extreme views at the expense of the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d. On Twitter you will find hundreds of tweets expressing exasperation with the form. There is a certain irony in people who habitually sound off online taking issue with other people voicing their opinions, but that doesn\u2019t seem to stem the torrent: \u201cI\u2019m fed up of seeing vox pops of closet racist Dave from Blackpool and closet xenophobe Tony from Skegness.\u201d \u201cBan all vox pops on the news. I really don\u2019t care what Pete the electrician from Stoke-on-Trent thinks about constitutional law.\u201d \u201cAnother day, another set of BBC vox pops from a load of pensioners at a ballroom dance.\u201d</p> \n<p>In March this year, as Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal collided with parliament, the writer and comedian David Baddiel expressed his dismay on Twitter: \u201cBBC News are once again doing that thing: \u2018We sent our reporter to \u2026 a Leave constituency, always. Because that\u2019s where people will be crossest. Which they think makes for better vox pops.\u201d</p> \n<p>Back in 2017, The Radio Times published a piece by the columnist Alison Graham: \u201cIf I were Queen of the world I would draw up an Act of Parliament on fancy notepaper banning television vox pops from the minute an election is called until the result is declared. Then I\u2019d give myself emergency powers to ban them for an unspecified period after that, too. Then I\u2019d hope that in a world where, thanks to social media, no opinion ever goes unexpressed in a torrent of online detritus, vox pops will surely, finally, be dead.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f82307cfa227c5ee6451ad34d43192febb0f7ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f82307cfa227c5ee6451ad34d43192febb0f7ca/72_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Harris interviewing a homeless woman in Dover in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Harris interviewing a homeless woman in Dover in 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Domokos/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>These furies seem of a piece with the regular explosions of annoyance about audience members on BBC1\u2019s Question Time, and viral mockery of the contradictory opinions of participants in radio phone-ins. Hostility to vox pops arises from the feeling that too much media attention is focused on a particular kind of leave supporter \u2013 white, old, working-class. It\u2019s true that the 48.1% of voters who backed remain often seem to play only a minor role in the media\u2019s portrayal of where Brexit sits in our politics, but there is perhaps a snobbish idea that some people are beyond the pale, and things would be a lot better if they were returned to a state of voicelessness.</p> \n<p>But there are questions to be asked about how vox pops are used, and what they say about the media\u2019s attitudes to so-called ordinary people. These interviews come at the end of a package \u2013 suggesting that the substance of the story has already been largely decided \u2013 and follow a basic formula: one for, one against, and one comedy reply.</p> \n<p>The superficial presentation of people\u2019s views in hasty vox pops is a key part of one of the biggest political stories of our time. In Britain and elsewhere, a constructed idea of \u201cthe people\u201d is now both central to events, and deeply problematic. The new breed of populist leaders use public appeal to justify a politics of division and nastiness. The same reductive approach is common to Nigel Farage, Donald Trump, the Italian politician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/09/how-matteo-salvini-pulled-italy-to-the-far-right\" title=\"\">Matteo Salvini</a>. Want to keep out immigrants? Build a wall. Fear for the nation\u2019s social fabric? Classify incomers by usefulness, according to the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/how-europes-far-right-fell-in-love-with-australias-immigration-policy\" title=\"\">Australian-style</a> points system\u201d. This kind of politics never deals substantially with the complicated, difficult stuff woven into a lot of people\u2019s sense of grievance \u2013 deindustrialisation, housing shortages, a world that has long since started moving into an era of automation and insecurity. In the populist worldview, \u201cthe people\u201d are one-dimensional; so are the solutions. </p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>On Wednesday 6 May 2015, opinion polls were still suggesting the next day\u2019s election would be very close. In the weeks immediately beforehand, 56% of published polls had put Labour ahead. That day, we published a film put together over two days talking to people in the bellwether Midlands constituency of Nuneaton. We had been exploring the effects of five years of austerity, and a narrative had taken shape in our heads that the country might be ready for a change. But the vox pops we did in Nuneaton hit us like a blast of cold air. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/may/06/nuneaton-election-2015-scottish-get-in-with-labour-were-done-for\" title=\"\">Our film</a> rejected the fashionable idea of a \u201cchange moment\u201d, and instead highlighted the tangle of resentments \u2013 against benefit claimants, immigrants, and the supposedly cushy lives of people who lived in Scotland \u2013 that seemed to be driving people\u2019s political thinking. It wasn\u2019t what we wanted to hear, but it was pretty much all we found.</p> \n<p>When the Conservatives won a parliamentary majority, there was a great deal of soul-searching among the editors, reporters and commentators who had been taken by surprise. Some theories held that there had been specific problems with the pollsters\u2019 methodologies (over-weighting particular groups of Labour voters, underestimating \u201cshy Tories\u201d). There was also general acknowledgement in the media that political journalism had relied too much on data, and not enough on qualitative conversations with voters.</p> \n<p>But something else was going on. In left-leaning political circles, people wondered how they had not seen the Tory victory coming. Part of the explanation came from an effect of social media, identified by the internet activist Eli Pariser in 2011 as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/08/eli-pariser-activist-whose-filter-bubble-warnings-presaged-trump-and-brexit\" title=\"\">filter bubble</a>\u201d: an effect of endless personalisation, which, he said, \u201cmoves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see.\u201d</p> \n<p>We were not aware of it at the time, but doing vox pops had become a way of bursting our bubbles. By going to locations we wouldn\u2019t normally visit, and allowing random chance to dictate who we spoke to, we had rediscovered some kind of antidote to the data-driven approach of polling and the algorithms of social media.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/dec/02/oldham-byelection-corbymania-collides-reality-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4eyjx\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2417149\" data-video-name=\"Oldham byelection: Corbynmania collides with reality \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-565ec08de4b0ef1f44c55c93\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/12/02/151202Oldham3_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/12/02/151202Oldham3.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/12/02/151202Oldham3_synd_768k_vp8.webm\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/12/02/151202Oldham3_large.3gp\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/12/02/151202Oldham3_small.3gp\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/dec/02/oldham-byelection-corbymania-collides-reality-video\">Oldham byelection: Corbynmania collides with reality</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But by the end of that year, it was our turn for some soul-searching. A December byelection in Oldham West and Royton was the first test for the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. We arrived in town buoyed by the sense that we had successfully divined the likely result of the election, and by our early coverage of the rise of Corbynism. It was raining torrentially for much that day, which makes for harder work than usual. We took cover in an indoor market, and got to work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/dec/02/oldham-byelection-corbymania-collides-reality-video\" title=\"\">talking to people</a>. We were shocked by the hostility towards Corbyn among older Labour voters; in our minds, the force of their opinions signified a serious possibility that the party would lose the seat.</p> \n<p>In fact, Labour won with a majority of more than 10,000. We learned several lessons. First, predicting political outcomes was a mug\u2019s game. Second, we had been guilty of creating our own filter bubble, by relying too much on a particular type of voter found in a particular place. Statisticians call this \u201cavailability bias\u201d. In simple terms, you can\u2019t base political coverage only on the sort of people you find in a market in the middle of the day.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>In May 2016, the referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU was looming. Polls were tight, but the general consensus was that the remain side would win. As we began a new series of Anywhere But Westminster, we were determined not to repeat our own mistakes. We spent a week driving from Merthyr Tydfil (we like it there \u2013 people talk) to Manchester, via the English Midlands. We had nothing set up: our only aim was to speak to as wide a variety of voters in as wide a variety of places as possible.</p> \n<p>We listened to Labour-voting leavers in Merthyr, and wealthier Eurosceptic Tory supporters in Leominster, Herefordshire. In the inner-city neighbourhood of Handsworth in Birmingham, we got a sense that assumptions of a remain victory were by no means well founded. There, we tested the received view of Brexit as a cause that only appealed to a certain kind of white person. At that point, many people were describing the respective sides of the battle as \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d. In a downpour, we spotted a British-Asian man taking shelter, wound down the car window, and asked him which side he was on. \u201cOut,\u201d he shot back. </p> \n<p>In Soho Road, the multicultural thoroughfare that is Handsworth\u2019s main drag, we talked to Sikh business owners \u2013 who, in defiance of the facts, seemed to think that people from EU countries were a drain on the state and on taxpayers, and other people whose support for Brexit seemed to be down to the decay and decline they saw in their immediate environment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9dc83916e78a53ea0b3d9192b8e63047ec1e51d8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dc83916e78a53ea0b3d9192b8e63047ec1e51d8/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On Soho Road in Handsworth, Birmingham in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On Soho Road in Handsworth, Birmingham in 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Domokos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We then went up the M6 to Manchester. At a university recruitment fair, 10 vox pops turned up only one leave supporter. When we asked them how they felt about the future, most of the students we met were optimistic. But 15 minutes drive away, in the deprived northern Mancunian neighbourhood of Collyhurst, the polarities were reversed. \u201cI fear for the kids \u2013 for my grandkids and that,\u201d said one woman. \u201cJobs, and things like that: so I\u2019m looking at pulling out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her neighbour had come to the UK from Malawi. \u201cI\u2019m looking at immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cI studied environmental health, and I can\u2019t even get a job. As a person that came into the UK, I\u2019ve seen the change. I know what is happening. It\u2019s affected me. And the thing is \u2026 I\u2019m pulling out.\u201d</p> \n<p>We stopped to talk to two women next to a burned-out pub called the Billy Greens. Close by was an abandoned playing field, where rusty goalposts protruded from an expanse of overgrown grass. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-welcome-to-the-divided-angry-kingdom-video\" title=\"\">The conversation</a> was brief, but it got to the heart of how the leave campaign had managed to frame its campaign as the vehicle for an unlikely kind of class war.</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cHow is Collyhurst doing?\u201d</p> \n<p>Woman 1: \u201cCollyhurst is coming up again. It\u2019s a really nice place to live. But we do need more money spent on it.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cHave people in power talked about spending money here?\u201d</p> \n<p>W1: \u201cThey\u2019ve had the gardens done, but that\u2019s it.

And yet it\u2019s a lovely place to live.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cBut booming, thriving Manchester\u2019s only 10 minutes\u2019 drive down there.\u201d</p> \n<p>W1: \u201cYears ago, when I grew up here, there were places to go: playschemes, and everything.

But for us, the film that finished in Collyhurst helped to frame what had happened. Lots of analysis and data since that referendum has cast doubt on the idea that Brexit was some kind of working-class revolt. But all across Britain, in neglected places that rarely saw TV cameras, we had met people who were voting to leave the EU as a way of calling for change: to be heard. The idea of listening to the \u201cleft behind\u201d briefly took hold, and found its way into Theresa May\u2019s early speeches as prime minister. It felt to us like Brexit might be a turning point for Britain, and that the vox pop was somehow part of what was changing.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>A year later, Theresa May called the general election of 2017. Mostly because we had never been there, we decided to begin our coverage in the Cornish town of Redruth, where the last Cornish tin mine had closed 20 years earlier. Partly because tin is a crucial component in smartphones and electric cars, there had recently been talk of reopening the mine, something that seemed to interest a lot more people than party politics. The campaign had yet to ignite: the people we spoke to seemed largely detached from it, and the few people we could persuade to talk specifics said they would be voting Conservative.</p> \n<p>Theresa May was ahead in the polls, and there was a sense that right-leaning Brexit supporters would have things their way. But as we kicked our heels on an almost deserted, pedestrianised street, a man on a mobility scooter came into view, and clocked our camera. He would identify himself only as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2017/may/04/is-this-the-weirdest-election-ever-video\" title=\"\">the tin man</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>Tin Man: \u201cAre you making a film about the deprivation in this country?

If you fell down dead now, mate, no one would give a shit. Isn\u2019t that a sign of a fascist country?\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cI meet a lot of people who seem quite cheered up, because they voted Brexit and we\u2019re getting out and things are going their way.\u201d</p> \n<p>TM: \u201cYeah, brilliant. Prices are going up, and it\u2019s costing another $30m to reopen the tin mine because of the fall in the pound. This wonderful country doesn\u2019t manufacture anything any more. We\u2019re totally reliant on Swedish mining equipment, which is costing us more money. It\u2019s not helping us, mate.

For the first time ever I think we\u2019ve genuinely got a choice.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cAnd the choice is?\u201d</p> \n<p>TM: \u201cTo do things differently. There are countries that do things differently. I want to vote against crony capitalism. And the only way to do that is to vote for someone like Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d</p> \n<p>JD: \u201cWhat\u2019s it like being disabled in the current climate?\u201d</p> \n<p>TM: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely miserable experience. Constantly picked on and harassed by the government. I got myself a cracking job down the mine: a job I was born to do. Now I get problems with my health, and I get treated like dirt. I\u2019m running around on a scooter that was given to me [by a friend]. I don\u2019t get any help from the government whatsoever.

He\u2019s a man who wants to change things for the better. Change the priority. Stop spending money on bloody war, feed and clothe the poor. Not one person excluded, yeah? And then we can start to progress as a species, for the first time ever.\u201d</p> \n<p>We met the Tin Man when Labour were 15 points behind in the polls. The encounter with him was cut into a short standalone video that was posted on Facebook. It quickly amassed 2.2m views, and he was the subject of a story in the Camborne and Redruth Gazette. Labour came within 1,500 votes of winning the seat.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Now another election is looming, and we are still doing vox pops. But in the course of the last three years or so, encounters between the media and the public have been so built into the Brexit moment that they have become ritualised.</p> \n<p>In terms of the sheer amount of vitriol, mistrust, mocking memes and conspiracy-mongering, we are arguably in the middle of Britain\u2019s first true social-media election. In some ways, Twitter is one giant vox pop. But there are crucial differences. Most people don\u2019t have a huge Twitter following.<strong> </strong>And the things that make vox pops both revealing and satisfying are absent: all context and local surroundings, all the non-verbal communication that humans use to signal respect and empathy.</p> \n<p>One thing seems particularly striking while going back through our archive of roughly 140 films, and probably more than 1,000 hours of footage: almost all of our encounters have ended on friendly terms. No matter what political differences come to the surface, the encounters usually proceed respectfully \u2013 that\u2019s how people tend to behave when they come face to face.</p> \n<p>Ten years of vox-popping has taught us that calling the results of elections is not our job. But if Anywhere But Westminster has one key purpose, it is to at least try to transcend the polarisation and mutual loathing. At the risk of sounding sentimental, we want people to listen to each other.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, after we had finished <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2019/nov/25/homeless-people-the-voters-without-a-voice-anywhere-but-westminster-video\" title=\"\">filming</a> in Southend-on-Sea, we drove the 30 miles to Jaywick, and went back to find Step Man. At the local convenience store, the woman behind the counter told us that people in Jaywick now hated the media: there had been too many programmes, she said, reducing it to a caricature of deprivation. The worst, she said, had been a Channel 5 show titled Benefits By the Sea. </p> \n<p>It was surprisingly easy to locate his house: the same red car was parked outside, and the bench was still there, propped against the wall. But when we rang the bell, there was at least two minutes of complete silence, before an upstairs window opened. There he was: paler and more gaunt before, and half-hidden behind the pane. We spoke for 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cHello there.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cHello. I don\u2019t know whether you remember us. Five years ago, we were making a film in Jaywick. We spoke to you on that bench there.\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cCan we talk to you again?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cNot really. I\u2019m not very well at the moment. I\u2019ve got emphysema.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWhat do you think of the state of the country?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201c[Laughs] Shit.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cDo you think things are better or worse than when we met you five years ago?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cGoing like that [moves arm downwards], isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cDid you vote in the referendum?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cOf course I did. And I voted to leave.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWell, I want to be out. Nobody seems to know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cAnd how\u2019s Jaywick doing?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cOh, the same old same old. Nothing seems to change in Jaywick. Jaywick just rattles along. Like the rest of the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cAre you going to vote in the election?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWho are you going to vote for?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cI\u2019ve voted Labour all my life, and I\u2019m not going to vote for Corbyn. He\u2019s not doing the working classes any good at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cSo if not him, who are you going to vote for?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cBoris.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cGod \u2013 you\u2019re a lifelong Labour voter, voting for Boris?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cYeah, because I want to get out of bloody Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cBut what\u2019s he going to do to the country?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. But as long as he gets us out of the mire.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cEton-educated, very wealthy \u2026 \u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cI wish I was. But they need to get it all sorted.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cAnd the future of the country? How do you feel about that?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWell, I\u2019d love to see it blossom. The poor having a few bob in their pocket. Pensioners doing well. All looked after. Hospitals. None of this \u2026 Every time you go into hospitals, hanging about in corridors \u2013 I\u2019ve been there many, many times. Friday and Saturday night \u2013 all these arseholes who\u2019ve had too many shandies, cluttering it all up, and people lying on trolleys, here there and everywhere.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cAnd you\u2019ve had that experience?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cYes. Many, many times.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWhen you voted for Brexit, was the NHS in your mind? The idea of bringing the money back?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cOf course it was.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cIt was a dirty lie, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cYou were a railwayman and you voted Labour all your life. You know of old that if we get Conservative governments, they don\u2019t make anything better.\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cYeah, but I can\u2019t see Corbyn making it any better.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cThe conversation we had with you was a big thing for us. It changed the way we thought about politics.\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWell \u2026 I hope we just get out [of the EU]. And do very, very well.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was getting colder: he was starting to cough. We said our goodbyes \u2013 \u201cSee you later, my old mate,\u201d he said \u2013 and he closed the window and went back inside, after we\u2019d asked him his name.

      "bodyText": "If you do the kind of political journalism that involves talking to the general public, something faintly magical can sometimes happen. As events swirl around and you try to make sense of huge, complicated themes, a single conversation will bring everything into focus. And not via words alone: facial expressions, gestures, and the way individual words are emphasised can give you a vivid sense of how people think, and the way their feelings could create political change. The encounter might be fleeting, but a connection can be made; as one side understands, the other feels heard. Since 2010, we have been responsible for the Guardian video series Anywhere But Westminster, in which we try to explore the gap between high politics and life as it is lived. With so much political coverage now based on opinion polling, we are interested not just in how people might vote, but what is behind their political choices. Vox pops have long been a crucial part of what we do. In the summer of 2014, our travels brought us to the town of Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. The local Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell, had resigned from his party and joined Ukip, then led by Nigel Farage. For us, the resulting byelection was a reason to visit the neighbourhood of Jaywick, which government statistics showed was the poorest place in England. It was here that we first got a sense of something potentially seismic. At that point, Ukip were largely understood as a new presence on the political right, who were appealing to habitual Tory voters. But things were shifting. When we arrive in a new place, the drill goes something like this. Find a location: a high street, or shopping parade; maybe a residential street, or the entrance to a railway station. Acknowledge the awkward nature of what you are about to do, but get over your nerves, and grit your teeth. Survey the people you can see. Then find your first potential interviewee, switch the camera on, and begin: \u201cExcuse me. We\u2019re making a film. Do you mind if we talk to you for a bit?\u201d In Jaywick, sitting on a bench on a raised step outside his house, was a retired man who had once been a railway worker in east London, and a member of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union. We shared his company for a quarter of an hour. Just about everything he said highlighted the unexpected turns politics was suddenly taking, and we have returned to the footage we shot time and again. Sometimes, we don\u2019t ask for people\u2019s names (it can make people feel a bit like they\u2019re being interrogated), so we have always referred to him as \u201cStep Man\u201d. Our exchange began when we showed him one of Carswell\u2019s campaign leaflets. John Harris: \u201cSo you\u2019ve had one of these through your door?\u201d Step Man: \u201cYeah.\u201d JH: \u201cWhat do you think of him, and the fact that he\u2019s left the Conservative party?\u201d SM: \u201cGood for him. It\u2019s about time somebody got up and spoke.\u201d JH: \u201cRight now, what\u2019s wrong with Britain?\u201d SM: \u201cWell, nobody\u2019s doing anything are they? It\u2019s all going around in circles. They do bugger all.\u201d JH: \u201cHave they done anything for Jaywick lately?\u201d SM: \u201cNothing gets done for bloody Jaywick.\u201d JH: \u201cWhat needs doing?\u201d SM: \u201cEverything. Look at the roads. Look at the state of it. The alleyways, look. Look at it all. We\u2019re a backwater, aren\u2019t we? That nobody gives a shit about.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd do you think [Carswell], and Mr Farage, are any different?\u201d SM: \u201cI\u2019m hoping so.\u201d JH: \u201cWho did you used to vote for in the past?\u201d SM [Emphatically, before the end of the question]: \u201cLabour. Always voted Labour.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd what changed?\u201d SM: \u201cWell, bloody Blair. Let\u2019s face it, he did sod all for this country \u2026 And now he\u2019s in Europe, pissing about there, making millions. He went more Conservative than the Conservatives.\u201d JH: \u201cBut this fellow [Carswell], until a week ago, was in the Conservative party himself. And now you\u2019re going to vote for him!\u201d SM: \u201cWell, yeah. But he wants to make a few changes.\u201d JH: \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll help Jaywick?\u201d SM: \u201cI bloody hope so.\u201d JH: \u201cTime was, Labour was the party of the working man, eh?\u201d SM: \u201cCourse it was. Course it was.\u201d JH: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d SM: \u201cBloody Thatcher got in \u2013 destroyed it, didn\u2019t she? Done the working classes, didn\u2019t she? Pissed the miners off. Done the railways. She pissed us all off, big time.\u201d JH: \u201cBut Ukip\u2019s full of people who think Mrs Thatcher was the bee\u2019s knees.\u201d SM: \u201cNah \u2026 \u201d JH: \u201cThey are! They\u2019re all Thatcherite\u2026 [Carswell] wants to shrink the state. He\u2019s no fan of the trade unions and the working man.\u201d SM: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose he is. Nobody is, are they?\u201d JH: \u201cBut somebody with your politics shouldn\u2019t be voting for him.\u201d SM: [Defiantly] \u201cYeah, course they should.\u201d Vox pops have a long history. A US radio series of that name began in 1932, sampling people\u2019s opinions about the presidential election that would bring Franklin Roosevelt to power. In 1961, an influential French documentary titled Chronique d\u2019un \u00e9t\u00e9 (Chronicle of a Summer) based a whole film around asking people on the street a simple but provocative question: \u201cAre you happy?\u201d Vox pops were popularised on British TV by the trailblazing presenter Alan Whicker (\u201cI went out with my cameras into the monstrous avenues of Houston, stopped passersby and asked whether they owned a gun \u2013 I discovered it wasn\u2019t a question of yes or no, but how many,\u201d he once said). By the time we started doing them, they were an established part of TV news packages \u2013 the bit that usually comes near the end to show some \u201cextra views of the subject matter in hand\u201d, to quote one set of BBC guidelines. But Step Man represented something different. In the footage of our conversation, interviewer and interviewee are sitting at the same level, instead of a TV crew being ranged in formation against their quarry. The interview turns into an exchange between equals, and by the end, the power structure is reversed. In effect, Step Man told us not only that the old political certainties are dying, but also that a different kind of political journalism is called for. Reporters needed to go to places outside the traditional centres of power. The story must be dictated, not by a script they bring with them, but by what they find when they get there. * * * The initial spark for Anywhere But Westminster was the headache-inducing tedium of covering party conferences. The first time we worked together, in the autumn of 2009, we walked out of Labour\u2019s annual gathering in Brighton and asked members of the public what they thought of the party\u2019s sudden fixation with a group of voters termed \u201cthe squeezed middle\u201d. In response, people talked about their exasperation with such phrases (\u201cI\u2019m working-class,\u201d said one man, \u201cwhy\u2019s it always about the middle?\u201d), and their overwhelming sense of distance from an event that was happening only a few minutes away. With the arrival of the coalition government in 2010, we believed there was a damaging estrangement between politics and the public. We decided to put this alienation at the centre of our work, and started travelling around the country, talking to ordinary people in places that were rarely visited by journalists, TV news crews or political reporters. The after-effects of the financial crash of 2008 had yet to make an impact on British politics, and the UK seemed locked into certainties that had prevailed since the 1990s. Viewed from on high, a lot of voters seemed either uninterested in politics or sufficiently becalmed that they would behave mostly as the main parties expected. But out in the country, dissent and resentment were bubbling away, and through the prism of vox pops, we were starting to understand what was happening. We talked to people who had strong opinions, but were often not the kind of voters who had either the time or inclination to make their voices heard via the traditional forums: party activism, public meetings, protest marches. As journalists employed by the Guardian, we needed to be fair and balanced, but not necessarily impartial. We were trying to expose our viewers to opinions they were probably not used to hearing. Our own views came into the conversations we had, and made these exchanges more equal, authentic and spontaneous. The people we met during this initial period have been stuck in our heads for years. From 2011: the two young men selling paintball sessions in central Birmingham \u2013 one of them just back from military duty in Afghanistan \u2013 who were lucky to even make the minimum wage, and completely detached from politics. In 2013: the two older men in Merthyr Tydfil who answered our questions about the death of Margaret Thatcher by telling us they still thought about the 1980s miners\u2019 strike \u201cevery day\u201d, and a 17-year-old student who did not know what a trade union was. In 2014 we met Debbie, a young mum from a council estate in Falkirk, Scotland. At a packed pro-independence public meeting on a Sunday night, she told us that the referendum had ignited her interest in politics for the first time. It had been, she said, \u201cOne of the most exciting things that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d Standard TV news packages tend to be scripted by the reporter, and vox pops are added to show what the public think of the story that\u2019s just been told. For us, although we always pre-arranged some encounters, vox pops were the first thing we did when we hit town. The views we encountered then guided a lot of what we did. We asked the people we met where we should go next, or who else we should meet. If a conversation with someone was particularly interesting, we would take their number, with a view to meeting them again. The films we were making were shaped by what we divined from talking to people, rather than the other way round. When we spoke to people for any length of time, our questions tended not to begin with \u201cWho are you going to vote for?\u201d or \u201cWhat do you think about Brexit?\u201d, but much more open, contextual lines of enquiry: \u201cWhat\u2019s it like living here?\u201d or \u201cHow do you feel about the future?\u201d We did not wear suits, or carry off-puttingly cumbersome equipment, or shine lights in people\u2019s faces. If the interviewee had the time, the conversation often lasted for 10 or 15 minutes. As we spoke to people, we sensed that the gap between politics, the media and the public was widening. It was also becoming unsustainable. \u201cThey\u2019re all in it for themselves, they don\u2019t care about us\u201d may have become the great cliche of vox pop journalism. But before it was a cliche, it was a warning. * * * From the early 1990s until around 2010, mainstream debate was personified by such politicians as Tony Blair and Bill Clinton: men with an alleged genius for understanding public sentiment, and manipulating it. But since then, politics has been upended. Within a couple of years of David Cameron taking power, an often angry and unpredictable public was starting to render the usual rituals \u2013 big speeches, appearances on daytime TV \u2013 increasingly useless. Now, three years after Cameron left the stage, voters increasingly set the agenda. Not surprisingly, the vox pop \u2013 the literal \u201cvoice of the people\u201d \u2013 has itself become the focus of angry debate. Last month, an Ofcom review found that many viewers thought the use of vox pops in the BBC\u2019s news and current affairs coverage gave more prominence to extreme views at the expense of the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d. On Twitter you will find hundreds of tweets expressing exasperation with the form. There is a certain irony in people who habitually sound off online taking issue with other people voicing their opinions, but that doesn\u2019t seem to stem the torrent: \u201cI\u2019m fed up of seeing vox pops of closet racist Dave from Blackpool and closet xenophobe Tony from Skegness.\u201d \u201cBan all vox pops on the news. I really don\u2019t care what Pete the electrician from Stoke-on-Trent thinks about constitutional law.\u201d \u201cAnother day, another set of BBC vox pops from a load of pensioners at a ballroom dance.\u201d In March this year, as Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal collided with parliament, the writer and comedian David Baddiel expressed his dismay on Twitter: \u201cBBC News are once again doing that thing: \u2018We sent our reporter to \u2026 a Leave constituency, always. Because that\u2019s where people will be crossest. Which they think makes for better vox pops.\u201d Back in 2017, The Radio Times published a piece by the columnist Alison Graham: \u201cIf I were Queen of the world I would draw up an Act of Parliament on fancy notepaper banning television vox pops from the minute an election is called until the result is declared. Then I\u2019d give myself emergency powers to ban them for an unspecified period after that, too. Then I\u2019d hope that in a world where, thanks to social media, no opinion ever goes unexpressed in a torrent of online detritus, vox pops will surely, finally, be dead.\u201d These furies seem of a piece with the regular explosions of annoyance about audience members on BBC1\u2019s Question Time, and viral mockery of the contradictory opinions of participants in radio phone-ins. Hostility to vox pops arises from the feeling that too much media attention is focused on a particular kind of leave supporter \u2013 white, old, working-class. It\u2019s true that the 48.1% of voters who backed remain often seem to play only a minor role in the media\u2019s portrayal of where Brexit sits in our politics, but there is perhaps a snobbish idea that some people are beyond the pale, and things would be a lot better if they were returned to a state of voicelessness. But there are questions to be asked about how vox pops are used, and what they say about the media\u2019s attitudes to so-called ordinary people. These interviews come at the end of a package \u2013 suggesting that the substance of the story has already been largely decided \u2013 and follow a basic formula: one for, one against, and one comedy reply. The superficial presentation of people\u2019s views in hasty vox pops is a key part of one of the biggest political stories of our time. In Britain and elsewhere, a constructed idea of \u201cthe people\u201d is now both central to events, and deeply problematic. The new breed of populist leaders use public appeal to justify a politics of division and nastiness. The same reductive approach is common to Nigel Farage, Donald Trump, the Italian politician Matteo Salvini. Want to keep out immigrants? Build a wall. Fear for the nation\u2019s social fabric? Classify incomers by usefulness, according to the \u201cAustralian-style points system\u201d. This kind of politics never deals substantially with the complicated, difficult stuff woven into a lot of people\u2019s sense of grievance \u2013 deindustrialisation, housing shortages, a world that has long since started moving into an era of automation and insecurity. In the populist worldview, \u201cthe people\u201d are one-dimensional; so are the solutions. * * * On Wednesday 6 May 2015, opinion polls were still suggesting the next day\u2019s election would be very close. In the weeks immediately beforehand, 56% of published polls had put Labour ahead. That day, we published a film put together over two days talking to people in the bellwether Midlands constituency of Nuneaton. We had been exploring the effects of five years of austerity, and a narrative had taken shape in our heads that the country might be ready for a change. But the vox pops we did in Nuneaton hit us like a blast of cold air. Our film rejected the fashionable idea of a \u201cchange moment\u201d, and instead highlighted the tangle of resentments \u2013 against benefit claimants, immigrants, and the supposedly cushy lives of people who lived in Scotland \u2013 that seemed to be driving people\u2019s political thinking. It wasn\u2019t what we wanted to hear, but it was pretty much all we found. When the Conservatives won a parliamentary majority, there was a great deal of soul-searching among the editors, reporters and commentators who had been taken by surprise. Some theories held that there had been specific problems with the pollsters\u2019 methodologies (over-weighting particular groups of Labour voters, underestimating \u201cshy Tories\u201d). There was also general acknowledgement in the media that political journalism had relied too much on data, and not enough on qualitative conversations with voters. But something else was going on. In left-leaning political circles, people wondered how they had not seen the Tory victory coming. Part of the explanation came from an effect of social media, identified by the internet activist Eli Pariser in 2011 as the \u201cfilter bubble\u201d: an effect of endless personalisation, which, he said, \u201cmoves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see.\u201d We were not aware of it at the time, but doing vox pops had become a way of bursting our bubbles. By going to locations we wouldn\u2019t normally visit, and allowing random chance to dictate who we spoke to, we had rediscovered some kind of antidote to the data-driven approach of polling and the algorithms of social media. But by the end of that year, it was our turn for some soul-searching. A December byelection in Oldham West and Royton was the first test for the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. We arrived in town buoyed by the sense that we had successfully divined the likely result of the election, and by our early coverage of the rise of Corbynism. It was raining torrentially for much that day, which makes for harder work than usual. We took cover in an indoor market, and got to work talking to people. We were shocked by the hostility towards Corbyn among older Labour voters; in our minds, the force of their opinions signified a serious possibility that the party would lose the seat. In fact, Labour won with a majority of more than 10,000. We learned several lessons. First, predicting political outcomes was a mug\u2019s game. Second, we had been guilty of creating our own filter bubble, by relying too much on a particular type of voter found in a particular place. Statisticians call this \u201cavailability bias\u201d. In simple terms, you can\u2019t base political coverage only on the sort of people you find in a market in the middle of the day. * * * In May 2016, the referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU was looming. Polls were tight, but the general consensus was that the remain side would win. As we began a new series of Anywhere But Westminster, we were determined not to repeat our own mistakes. We spent a week driving from Merthyr Tydfil (we like it there \u2013 people talk) to Manchester, via the English Midlands. We had nothing set up: our only aim was to speak to as wide a variety of voters in as wide a variety of places as possible. We listened to Labour-voting leavers in Merthyr, and wealthier Eurosceptic Tory supporters in Leominster, Herefordshire. In the inner-city neighbourhood of Handsworth in Birmingham, we got a sense that assumptions of a remain victory were by no means well founded. There, we tested the received view of Brexit as a cause that only appealed to a certain kind of white person. At that point, many people were describing the respective sides of the battle as \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d. In a downpour, we spotted a British-Asian man taking shelter, wound down the car window, and asked him which side he was on. \u201cOut,\u201d he shot back. In Soho Road, the multicultural thoroughfare that is Handsworth\u2019s main drag, we talked to Sikh business owners \u2013 who, in defiance of the facts, seemed to think that people from EU countries were a drain on the state and on taxpayers, and other people whose support for Brexit seemed to be down to the decay and decline they saw in their immediate environment. We then went up the M6 to Manchester. At a university recruitment fair, 10 vox pops turned up only one leave supporter. When we asked them how they felt about the future, most of the students we met were optimistic. But 15 minutes drive away, in the deprived northern Mancunian neighbourhood of Collyhurst, the polarities were reversed. \u201cI fear for the kids \u2013 for my grandkids and that,\u201d said one woman. \u201cJobs, and things like that: so I\u2019m looking at pulling out.\u201d Her neighbour had come to the UK from Malawi. \u201cI\u2019m looking at immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cI studied environmental health, and I can\u2019t even get a job. As a person that came into the UK, I\u2019ve seen the change. I know what is happening. It\u2019s affected me. And the thing is \u2026 I\u2019m pulling out.\u201d We stopped to talk to two women next to a burned-out pub called the Billy Greens. Close by was an abandoned playing field, where rusty goalposts protruded from an expanse of overgrown grass. The conversation was brief, but it got to the heart of how the leave campaign had managed to frame its campaign as the vehicle for an unlikely kind of class war. JH: \u201cHow is Collyhurst doing?\u201d Woman 1: \u201cCollyhurst is coming up again. It\u2019s a really nice place to live. But we do need more money spent on it.\u201d JH: \u201cHave people in power talked about spending money here?\u201d W1: \u201cThey\u2019ve had the gardens done, but that\u2019s it. Nothing else. There\u2019s nothing for the kids to do. Nothing for the kids to play on. Nothing at all. And yet it\u2019s a lovely place to live.\u201d JH: \u201cBut booming, thriving Manchester\u2019s only 10 minutes\u2019 drive down there.\u201d W1: \u201cYears ago, when I grew up here, there were places to go: playschemes, and everything. There\u2019s nothing for kids. Nothing at all. You can look round and see.\u201d JH: \u201cIt\u2019s home, though, right? You feel very connected to it. W1: \u201cOh yeah. [Pointing at the pub] My mum had her wake there, God rest her soul, in the Billy Greens.\u201d JH: \u201cWhat I find odd coming here, is that they\u2019ve spent millions of pounds regenerating the middle of Manchester \u2026 \u201d W1: \u201cOh yeah.\u201d JH: \u201cBut you haven\u2019t had money spent here.\u201d Woman 2: \u201cIn Miles Platting [nearby area], they closed the swimming baths and all that lot.\u201d W1: \u201cAnd the library. They\u2019ve got nothing. And I feel sorry for them. For those six weeks [of school] holidays, if you haven\u2019t got a lot of money, you\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d John Domokos: \u201cI\u2019m curious about why you think that happens: all the money gets spent there, not here.\u201d Woman 1: \u201cIt\u2019s people with money. People with money. Money talks!\u201d JH: \u201cLast question. How are you voting in this referendum?\u201d W1 and W2, loudly and emphatically: \u201cOut!\u201d JH: \u201cThey\u2019re all voting \u2018in\u2019 in town.\u201d Woman 1: \u201cCourse they will! \u2018Cos they\u2019ve got that!\u201d [rubs thumb and finger together to suggest money] JH: \u201cSo it\u2019s down to a very simple thing for you \u2013 those who\u2019ve got money vote which way?\u201d W1: \u201cTo stay in.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd those who haven\u2019t got as much money?\u201d W1: \u201cTo come out.\u201d We didn\u2019t predict the referendum result. But for us, the film that finished in Collyhurst helped to frame what had happened. Lots of analysis and data since that referendum has cast doubt on the idea that Brexit was some kind of working-class revolt. But all across Britain, in neglected places that rarely saw TV cameras, we had met people who were voting to leave the EU as a way of calling for change: to be heard. The idea of listening to the \u201cleft behind\u201d briefly took hold, and found its way into Theresa May\u2019s early speeches as prime minister. It felt to us like Brexit might be a turning point for Britain, and that the vox pop was somehow part of what was changing. * * * A year later, Theresa May called the general election of 2017. Mostly because we had never been there, we decided to begin our coverage in the Cornish town of Redruth, where the last Cornish tin mine had closed 20 years earlier. Partly because tin is a crucial component in smartphones and electric cars, there had recently been talk of reopening the mine, something that seemed to interest a lot more people than party politics. The campaign had yet to ignite: the people we spoke to seemed largely detached from it, and the few people we could persuade to talk specifics said they would be voting Conservative. Theresa May was ahead in the polls, and there was a sense that right-leaning Brexit supporters would have things their way. But as we kicked our heels on an almost deserted, pedestrianised street, a man on a mobility scooter came into view, and clocked our camera. He would identify himself only as \u201cthe tin man\u201d. Tin Man: \u201cAre you making a film about the deprivation in this country? This fascist shithole?\u201d JH: \u201cIs it that bad?\u201d TM: \u201cWell, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s that bad? Or do you not see it as it is? If you fell down dead now, mate, no one would give a shit. Isn\u2019t that a sign of a fascist country?\u201d JH: \u201cI meet a lot of people who seem quite cheered up, because they voted Brexit and we\u2019re getting out and things are going their way.\u201d TM: \u201cYeah, brilliant. Prices are going up, and it\u2019s costing another $30m to reopen the tin mine because of the fall in the pound. This wonderful country doesn\u2019t manufacture anything any more. We\u2019re totally reliant on Swedish mining equipment, which is costing us more money. It\u2019s not helping us, mate. People have been conned.\u201d JH: \u201cDo you have a meaningful option in this election, do you think?\u201d TM: \u201cAbsolutely. For the first time ever I think we\u2019ve genuinely got a choice.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd the choice is?\u201d TM: \u201cTo do things differently. There are countries that do things differently. I want to vote against crony capitalism. And the only way to do that is to vote for someone like Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d JD: \u201cWhat\u2019s it like being disabled in the current climate?\u201d TM: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely miserable experience. Constantly picked on and harassed by the government. I got myself a cracking job down the mine: a job I was born to do. Now I get problems with my health, and I get treated like dirt. I\u2019m running around on a scooter that was given to me [by a friend]. I don\u2019t get any help from the government whatsoever. And this is after I put millions of pounds in the economy, working at the tin mine.\u201d JD: \u201cThe crux of this is \u2026 \u201d TM: [loudly] \u201cThe crux of it is, surely society can be better than this!\u201d JH: \u201cWe met a woman down there who said she thought Jeremy Corbyn was dangerous.\u201d TM: \u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s a man who wants to change things for the better. Change the priority. Stop spending money on bloody war, feed and clothe the poor. Not one person excluded, yeah? And then we can start to progress as a species, for the first time ever.\u201d We met the Tin Man when Labour were 15 points behind in the polls. The encounter with him was cut into a short standalone video that was posted on Facebook. It quickly amassed 2.2m views, and he was the subject of a story in the Camborne and Redruth Gazette. Labour came within 1,500 votes of winning the seat. * * * Now another election is looming, and we are still doing vox pops. But in the course of the last three years or so, encounters between the media and the public have been so built into the Brexit moment that they have become ritualised. In terms of the sheer amount of vitriol, mistrust, mocking memes and conspiracy-mongering, we are arguably in the middle of Britain\u2019s first true social-media election. In some ways, Twitter is one giant vox pop. But there are crucial differences. Most people don\u2019t have a huge Twitter following. And the things that make vox pops both revealing and satisfying are absent: all context and local surroundings, all the non-verbal communication that humans use to signal respect and empathy. One thing seems particularly striking while going back through our archive of roughly 140 films, and probably more than 1,000 hours of footage: almost all of our encounters have ended on friendly terms. No matter what political differences come to the surface, the encounters usually proceed respectfully \u2013 that\u2019s how people tend to behave when they come face to face. Ten years of vox-popping has taught us that calling the results of elections is not our job. But if Anywhere But Westminster has one key purpose, it is to at least try to transcend the polarisation and mutual loathing. At the risk of sounding sentimental, we want people to listen to each other. Two weeks ago, after we had finished filming in Southend-on-Sea, we drove the 30 miles to Jaywick, and went back to find Step Man. At the local convenience store, the woman behind the counter told us that people in Jaywick now hated the media: there had been too many programmes, she said, reducing it to a caricature of deprivation. The worst, she said, had been a Channel 5 show titled Benefits By the Sea. It was surprisingly easy to locate his house: the same red car was parked outside, and the bench was still there, propped against the wall. But when we rang the bell, there was at least two minutes of complete silence, before an upstairs window opened. There he was: paler and more gaunt before, and half-hidden behind the pane. We spoke for 10 minutes. SM: \u201cHello there.\u201d JH: \u201cHello. I don\u2019t know whether you remember us. Five years ago, we were making a film in Jaywick. We spoke to you on that bench there.\u201d SM: \u201cOh yeah?\u201d JH: \u201cCan we talk to you again?\u201d SM: \u201cNot really. I\u2019m not very well at the moment. I\u2019ve got emphysema.\u201d JH: \u201cWhat do you think of the state of the country?\u201d SM: \u201c[Laughs] Shit.\u201d JH: \u201cDo you think things are better or worse than when we met you five years ago?\u201d SM: \u201cGoing like that [moves arm downwards], isn\u2019t it?\u201d JH: \u201cDid you vote in the referendum?\u201d SM: \u201cOf course I did. And I voted to leave.\u201d JH: \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d SM: \u201cWell, I want to be out. Nobody seems to know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd how\u2019s Jaywick doing?\u201d SM: \u201cOh, the same old same old. Nothing seems to change in Jaywick. Jaywick just rattles along. Like the rest of the country.\u201d JH: \u201cAre you going to vote in the election?\u201d SM: \u201cOf course I am.\u201d JH: \u201cWho are you going to vote for?\u201d SM: \u201cI\u2019ve voted Labour all my life, and I\u2019m not going to vote for Corbyn. He\u2019s not doing the working classes any good at all.\u201d JH: \u201cSo if not him, who are you going to vote for?\u201d SM: \u201cBoris.\u201d JH: \u201cGod \u2013 you\u2019re a lifelong Labour voter, voting for Boris?\u201d SM: \u201cYeah, because I want to get out of bloody Europe.\u201d JH: \u201cBut what\u2019s he going to do to the country?\u201d SM: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. But as long as he gets us out of the mire.\u201d JH: \u201cEton-educated, very wealthy \u2026 \u201d SM: \u201cI wish I was. But they need to get it all sorted.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd the future of the country? How do you feel about that?\u201d SM: \u201cWell, I\u2019d love to see it blossom. The poor having a few bob in their pocket. Pensioners doing well. All looked after. Hospitals. None of this \u2026 Every time you go into hospitals, hanging about in corridors \u2013 I\u2019ve been there many, many times. Friday and Saturday night \u2013 all these arseholes who\u2019ve had too many shandies, cluttering it all up, and people lying on trolleys, here there and everywhere.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd you\u2019ve had that experience?\u201d SM: \u201cYes. Many, many times.\u201d JH: \u201cWhen you voted for Brexit, was the NHS in your mind? The idea of bringing the money back?\u201d SM: \u201cOf course it was.\u201d JH: \u201cIt was a dirty lie, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d SM: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201d JH: \u201cYou were a railwayman and you voted Labour all your life. You know of old that if we get Conservative governments, they don\u2019t make anything better.\u201d SM: \u201cYeah, but I can\u2019t see Corbyn making it any better.\u201d JH: \u201cThe conversation we had with you was a big thing for us. It changed the way we thought about politics.\u201d SM: \u201cWell \u2026 I hope we just get out [of the EU]. And do very, very well.\u201d It was getting colder: he was starting to cough. We said our goodbyes \u2013 \u201cSee you later, my old mate,\u201d he said \u2013 and he closed the window and went back inside, after we\u2019d asked him his name. He told us it was Frank. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "body": "<h2>Kaye Adams, presenter</h2> <p>I got a call asking me to screen test for a new all-female lunchtime panel show. It was summer, always a slow time for TV, so I thought: \u201cWhy not?\u201d The remit was that we would talk about anything and everything from a female point of view, but it didn\u2019t have to be limited to women\u2019s issues.</p> <p>I remember walking in, suited and booted, to the studios in Westminster and seeing [co-presenter] Nadia for the first time. She filled the room, all curls and breasts with her bohemian dress, sandals and rings on her toes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get on with that woman,\u201d I thought, because any woman with toe-rings is not my kind of woman. So I hid behind my newspaper. I know Nadia thought I was posh, but I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m Scottish. You don\u2019t get posh in Scotland, apart from Kirsty Young.</p> <p>I knew early that we were on to something good. Loose Women is unlike anything else on TV. The View, an American talk show, predates it, but that\u2019s quite political. The British take was to add humour. Over the years, various producers have come in with different ideas. Some have worked, some haven\u2019t, and we\u2019ve changed the set and the colourings a million times, but the absolute essence hasn\u2019t changed. There is no point in trying to add bells and whistles. We agreed it should follow the normal pattern of female conversation. When we ladies are out for lunch, we go from uproarious laughter to something topical to something bit teary. So we mimic that in the show. We switch from serious topics to emotional ones, to some sort of public debate, like: \u201cDo you iron your knickers?\u201d</p> <p>We did a month initially, and the viewing figures were good and we all thought it had potential, so when it was commissioned for a further 12-week run we hoped we were onto something. But it was only ever recommissioned in short bursts. We\u2019d have a fantastic wrap party: \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t we brilliant?\u201d \u201cHa ha ha,\u201d \u201cWe love each other,\u201d \u201cSee ya.\u201d Then we\u2019d have to wait weeks and weeks for a call. Nadia and I co-presented from 1999 until 2002 when she left to have her first daughter. At one point we lived together too, like Eric and Ernie. Nadia would roll in at three o\u2019clock in the morning, blind drunk, and I\u2019d have fallen asleep after Question Time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf94f37c3e3d133d5af442848868a6970c038cc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf94f37c3e3d133d5af442848868a6970c038cc7/164_156_2276_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadia Sawalha and Kaye Adams.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nadia Sawalha and Kaye Adams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Nadia Sawalha, presenter</h2> <p>We are called Loose Women because the format is loose. It\u2019s how women talk. One minute we\u2019re roaring with laughter, the next we\u2019re crying with misery. I\u2019d come from this hippy, gin-swilling, actressy background, and back in summer 1999 I\u2019d just come out of EastEnders, playing a gangster character called Annie Palmer, when I was asked to film the pilot. I was in makeup, flicking through OK! magazine, chatting about Victoria Beckham, not realising I was talking to the show\u2019s editor. She later told me she\u2019d decided I\u2019d got the part there and then.</p> <p>Jane Moore had a similar \u201cinterview\u201d. At the pilot, they asked her to look into the camera and say: \u201cHello, I\u2019m a Loose Woman.\u201d She said no. That\u2019s when the editor decided to offer Jane the job as a presenter.</p> <p>I\u2019ll never forget meeting Kaye. She had a great big newspaper, I believe it was the Guardian, and she kept shaking it, as if to show me she reads the big newspapers. All the women seemed highbrow and posh and I didn\u2019t understand why they needed me. Then I realised: opposites was actually what they needed. It was all about getting different types of women: four sassy, smart, witty, women who can talk the hind legs off a donkey.</p> <p>We only have celebrity guests on if they bring something to the show.

      "bodyText": "Kaye Adams, presenter I got a call asking me to screen test for a new all-female lunchtime panel show. It was summer, always a slow time for TV, so I thought: \u201cWhy not?\u201d The remit was that we would talk about anything and everything from a female point of view, but it didn\u2019t have to be limited to women\u2019s issues. I remember walking in, suited and booted, to the studios in Westminster and seeing [co-presenter] Nadia for the first time. She filled the room, all curls and breasts with her bohemian dress, sandals and rings on her toes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get on with that woman,\u201d I thought, because any woman with toe-rings is not my kind of woman. So I hid behind my newspaper. I know Nadia thought I was posh, but I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m Scottish. You don\u2019t get posh in Scotland, apart from Kirsty Young. I knew early that we were on to something good. Loose Women is unlike anything else on TV. The View, an American talk show, predates it, but that\u2019s quite political. The British take was to add humour. Over the years, various producers have come in with different ideas. Some have worked, some haven\u2019t, and we\u2019ve changed the set and the colourings a million times, but the absolute essence hasn\u2019t changed. There is no point in trying to add bells and whistles. We agreed it should follow the normal pattern of female conversation. When we ladies are out for lunch, we go from uproarious laughter to something topical to something bit teary. So we mimic that in the show. We switch from serious topics to emotional ones, to some sort of public debate, like: \u201cDo you iron your knickers?\u201d We did a month initially, and the viewing figures were good and we all thought it had potential, so when it was commissioned for a further 12-week run we hoped we were onto something. But it was only ever recommissioned in short bursts. We\u2019d have a fantastic wrap party: \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t we brilliant?\u201d \u201cHa ha ha,\u201d \u201cWe love each other,\u201d \u201cSee ya.\u201d Then we\u2019d have to wait weeks and weeks for a call. Nadia and I co-presented from 1999 until 2002 when she left to have her first daughter. At one point we lived together too, like Eric and Ernie. Nadia would roll in at three o\u2019clock in the morning, blind drunk, and I\u2019d have fallen asleep after Question Time. Nadia Sawalha, presenter We are called Loose Women because the format is loose. It\u2019s how women talk. One minute we\u2019re roaring with laughter, the next we\u2019re crying with misery. I\u2019d come from this hippy, gin-swilling, actressy background, and back in summer 1999 I\u2019d just come out of EastEnders, playing a gangster character called Annie Palmer, when I was asked to film the pilot. I was in makeup, flicking through OK! magazine, chatting about Victoria Beckham, not realising I was talking to the show\u2019s editor. She later told me she\u2019d decided I\u2019d got the part there and then. Jane Moore had a similar \u201cinterview\u201d. At the pilot, they asked her to look into the camera and say: \u201cHello, I\u2019m a Loose Woman.\u201d She said no. That\u2019s when the editor decided to offer Jane the job as a presenter. I\u2019ll never forget meeting Kaye. She had a great big newspaper, I believe it was the Guardian, and she kept shaking it, as if to show me she reads the big newspapers. All the women seemed highbrow and posh and I didn\u2019t understand why they needed me. Then I realised: opposites was actually what they needed. It was all about getting different types of women: four sassy, smart, witty, women who can talk the hind legs off a donkey. We only have celebrity guests on if they bring something to the show. Whoopi Goldberg was charming and loved me because I\u2019d been on EastEnders \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe she watched it! In the early days a man wouldn\u2019t come anywhere near the set, but now we have two Loose Men on the panel and we\u2019ve had Gok Wan and Freddie Flintoff on talking about their mental health, which would only happen on a women\u2019s show.

I have seen the case files.</p> <p>\u201cSome prisoners who have said they are willing, never get on it before their release. Some are waiting a long time.</p> <p>\u201cIt can have a real impact. It could use more resources.

      "bodyText": "Convicted terrorists are having to be put on waiting lists for the main government-backed programme that will turn them away from violent extremism, an expert has revealed. Prof Andrew Silke has studied the efforts to deradicalise those jailed for terrorism offences and his claim comes as debate rages following Friday\u2019s attack at London Bridge in which two people were killed. The fallout from the attack by Usman Khan has triggered investigations by counter-terrorism investigators and a series of searches by police at properties linked to the attacker in Stafford and Stoke. Those searches which began after Friday\u2019s attack have now ended, police said, as the investigation into Khan, released half way through a conviction for a terrorist plot, continues. The attack at an event on prisoner rehabilitation has also refocused attention on whether those convicted of terrorism offences can be safely released. Silke, professor of terrorism, risk and resilience at Cranfield University in Bedfordshire, has been into prisons to study deradicalisation and is one of the UK\u2019s leading experts in the field. He said lack of resources meant those convicted of terrorism offences cannot get the best help. The main deradicalisation programme in prisons is called Healthy Identity Intervention. It is open to those convicted of Islamist terrorism offences and those jailed for extreme rightwing violence. Silke said there was a waiting list for the scheme \u201cI\u2019m absolutely sure. I have seen the case files. \u201cSome prisoners who have said they are willing, never get on it before their release. Some are waiting a long time. \u201cIt can have a real impact. It could use more resources. It is hard to imagine austerity did not have some impact.\u201d Prisons have been hit by steep cuts and Silke pointed out the impact this has had on the number of psychologists prisoners could access. The scheme is essentially intensive counselling sessions led by a psychologist and Silke said the results are good. \u201cMany interventions involve two to three sessions a week, which are one or two hours long, so it ties up quite a lot of time and resources. It can last several months.\u201d A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cWhile Healthy Identity Intervention is the core rehabilitative programme for TACT offenders, there are multiple other counter-terrorist specific interventions being used in the prison estate. They have been accredited by an independent panel of experts, who approved its evidence base, methodology and delivery.\u201d Meanwhile Scotland Yard\u2019s counter-terrorism command said searches into addresses linked to Khan had been completed. While they do not believe anyone helped him in the attack, they want to rule out every lead and reasonable possibility. Initial investigations will have focused on his communications in the run-up to the deadly attack on Friday. The fake suicide vest was rudimentary, one source familiar with the investigation added, and there is no evidence that Khan\u2019s former association with al-Muhajiroun at the beginning of the decade had any bearing on recent events. Investigators are now reexamining the 74 cases of people who have been recently released from prison after serving time for terror offences, as indicated by the prime minister on Friday. Home Office sources said that \u201cthey wanted law enforcement to see if there is a reason to pull them back. At the least they will have double the manpower looking at them.\u201d One source said Khan was not always a model for rehabilitation in prison, and that he had displayed some signs of problematic behaviour, although there were few further details. The security service is expected to be engaged in heightened monitoring, to ward off any copycat attacks and to see what reaction Friday\u2019s events have prompted among its subjects of interest. While there has been fierce debate as to whether it was appropriate to reduce the terror threat level recently, Home Office sources said it made no difference to the allocation of investigators or response times. Police said they had already received 500 videos or photos of the attack, but asked for anyone to come forward with more photo evidence if they have not yet done so.",

      "body": "<p>Recently, when a prominent medical journal asked if there was gender equity in medicine, many Australian female doctors flatly said no.</p> <p>It\u2019s notable that <a href=\"https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2019/211/10/gender-inequity-medicine-and-medical-leadership\">their monosyllabic but eloquent reply</a> did not satisfy the editors and they had to write a letter imploring the editors to stop perpetuating the disparity by posing an archaic question which has already been answered.</p> <p>Reading the ensuing commentary, I couldn\u2019t help but reflect that the gender gap in medicine is actually a gap in respect.

Even after adjusting for years of training, productivity, specialisation and billing, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/06/whats-holding-women-in-medicine-back-from-leadership\">women in medicine earn nearly 30% less than men</a>.</p> <p>This is despite emerging evidence that female doctors listen to patients longer, interrupt them less and may provide more cost-effective and patient-centred care associated with <a href=\"http://levelmedicine.org.au/resources/completed-fellowship-papers/gender-pay-gap/\">lower rates of hospitalisation and mortality</a>.</p> <p>In a multicultural country like Australia, nearly half of doctors are \u201cforeign\u201d. Highly qualified women stand at the unforgiving intersection of gender and race.</p> <p>In a galling incident, one such woman stepped up to rescue a small hospital embroiled in a crisis. She undertook an urgent audit, but for public consumption the executive wanted a man to present her findings, and warned her not to \u201cbe a bitch\u201d.</p> <p>He was unqualified; she\u2019d written the national guidelines. She offered to resign on principle and the hospital panicked, but not before the man had pocketed a handsome \u201cconsulting\u201d fee. Imagine what that money could have achieved for a bit of pay equity.</p> <p>A senior surgeon openly fantasises about a trainee\u2019s breasts during an operation and she keeps her eyes firmly on the retractor.</p> <p>A student endures the lurid glances of a male tutor who talks of feeding her a \u201clove potion\u201d and prays for the end of term.</p> <p>Countless women stress over <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k3685\">how to keep a pregnancy quiet</a>.</p> <p>Where does this awfulness happen? If you listen closely, everywhere. Men in medicine are judged largely by their accomplishments; women in medicine must answer for their attire, attitude and ambition.</p> <p>Around the world, women encounter outright discrimination, micro-aggressions and casual disrespect \u2013 and if they haven\u2019t, that\u2019s a good thing because these things shouldn\u2019t have a 100% strike rate to be real.</p> <p>When writing about disrespect, I am surprised by how my own humiliation involuntarily bubbles to the surface, much as I have tried to bury it.</p> <p>Once, a senior male doctor insisted on being my \u201csponsor\u201d for a role and his recommendation mistakenly reached me. Skimming over any actual accomplishments, he opined that my \u201cresolve and motivation\u201d be tested in an unpaid capacity for a year, with my promotion to be decided by him on a \u201cmeritorious\u201d basis.</p> <p>I was puzzled. I thought he\u2019d applauded me for said resolve, motivation and merit. But there was more. He sealed his case by calling me \u201chigh-maintenance\u201d.</p> <p>From the Urban Dictionary<em>: the definition of a high-maintenance girl is an excessively talkative, over-reactive, highly emotional, attention-seeking female who requires a firm handler. (see also: bitch)</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/11/employer-secrecy-around-staff-pay-is-fuelling-gender-pay-gap-says-expert\">Employer secrecy around staff pay is fueling gender pay gap, says expert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To all the women reading this, I\u2019d love to say that I called out the hypocrisy although I sincerely hope I would do so now from a position of greater strength.</p> <p>But on that day I became a ball of shame at the perception of being a champagne-swilling, Prada-toting woman when in fact I worked in one of the poorest places in the country with crumbling infrastructure, where despite being threatened and robbed I came to work because my patients were sacrosanct.</p> <p>When his male boss congratulated his \u201csophisticated\u201d (unethical) approach to the problem (payment for work), I tearfully searched for confirmation bias. If I stopped to wolf down my first meal at noon, was that high maintenance? If I didn\u2019t want to add to my existing load of unpaid work and had young children and ageing parents, was that high maintenance?</p> <p>In truth I didn\u2019t know a single doctor who fit that description but now I was it and the accusation stung.</p> <p>A male surgeon concluded, \u201cYou\u2019ve been white-anted!\u201d, which sent me scurrying to the dictionary.</p> <p><em>White-anting (Australian, colloquial): the act of bringing down from within, undermining. Derived from the action of termites eating the inside of foundations, often leaving no outward </em>evidence<em> until the structure crumbles.</em></p> <p>Some might protest that such broad assertions taint \u201ceven the good\u201d men but the point is not to disparage all men, rather to point out the abundant evidence for a lack of respect for women.</p> <p>Women in medicine tolerate their indignities quietly because to speak is to attract backlash. Their critics silence them by saying that respect must be earned and pay equity must be deserved. They\u2019re told to grow a thicker skin and lectured to get along with men.</p> <p>In other words, if women were actually as good as men, the problem of gender equity wouldn\u2019t exist. This distorted rhetoric distracts from the very real barriers that obstruct progress.</p> <p>A recent World Health Organisation report highlights that women fill a staggering 70% of healthcare roles but only a quarter of senior roles. The report is titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.who.int/hrh/resources/en_exec-summ_delivered-by-women-led-by-men.pdf?ua=1\">Delivered by Women, Led by Men</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Publishing pay scales, promoting more women, giving them a seat at the important tables and creating family-friendly policies help gender equity. Holding senior doctors accountable for their conduct towards women is vital because they lead by example. But these ideas aren\u2019t novel, so why is change so slow?</p> <p>In my opinion, it is because at the heart of change is respect, which is an easy word to say but a really difficult one to teach. The highest goal of medicine is to help patients and it is inarguable that patient care is enriched by the inclusion of women in the highest echelons of medicine.</p> <p>Gender equity is not about being nice to women doctors \u2013 there is a powerful business case for it. But as long as we think of basic decency as a concession and fairness as a gift to women, we will be stuck writing to journals while our patients pay the price.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

      "bodyText": "Recently, when a prominent medical journal asked if there was gender equity in medicine, many Australian female doctors flatly said no. It\u2019s notable that their monosyllabic but eloquent reply did not satisfy the editors and they had to write a letter imploring the editors to stop perpetuating the disparity by posing an archaic question which has already been answered. Reading the ensuing commentary, I couldn\u2019t help but reflect that the gender gap in medicine is actually a gap in respect. Women in medicine are not accorded the respect they deserve, neither from their male colleagues nor, sadly, from many patients. Remember the black American specialist who was told to pipe down during a flight emergency because the situation needed \u201can actual physician\u201d? She wasn\u2019t unique. \u201cWhat do you think, doc?\u201d a patient winked at a man. \u201cDoes she know her stuff?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s my boss,\u201d my resident stammered. An old man with a failing heart couldn\u2019t breathe but sneaked his hand up an intern\u2019s skirt as she auscultated his chest. She told me that rather than risk a scene at the dawn of her career she quietly removed his hand and continued. Women in medicine suffer discrimination from the time they are students to the time they retire. When men introduce women physicians, they skip their professional title and address them by their first name more often compared with male speakers. Female doctors are overlooked for opportunities to become dean, chief executive, tenured professor, editor-in-chief, first author and lead researcher. Even after adjusting for years of training, productivity, specialisation and billing, women in medicine earn nearly 30% less than men. This is despite emerging evidence that female doctors listen to patients longer, interrupt them less and may provide more cost-effective and patient-centred care associated with lower rates of hospitalisation and mortality. In a multicultural country like Australia, nearly half of doctors are \u201cforeign\u201d. Highly qualified women stand at the unforgiving intersection of gender and race. In a galling incident, one such woman stepped up to rescue a small hospital embroiled in a crisis. She undertook an urgent audit, but for public consumption the executive wanted a man to present her findings, and warned her not to \u201cbe a bitch\u201d. He was unqualified; she\u2019d written the national guidelines. She offered to resign on principle and the hospital panicked, but not before the man had pocketed a handsome \u201cconsulting\u201d fee. Imagine what that money could have achieved for a bit of pay equity. A senior surgeon openly fantasises about a trainee\u2019s breasts during an operation and she keeps her eyes firmly on the retractor. A student endures the lurid glances of a male tutor who talks of feeding her a \u201clove potion\u201d and prays for the end of term. Countless women stress over how to keep a pregnancy quiet. Where does this awfulness happen? If you listen closely, everywhere. Men in medicine are judged largely by their accomplishments; women in medicine must answer for their attire, attitude and ambition. Around the world, women encounter outright discrimination, micro-aggressions and casual disrespect \u2013 and if they haven\u2019t, that\u2019s a good thing because these things shouldn\u2019t have a 100% strike rate to be real. When writing about disrespect, I am surprised by how my own humiliation involuntarily bubbles to the surface, much as I have tried to bury it. Once, a senior male doctor insisted on being my \u201csponsor\u201d for a role and his recommendation mistakenly reached me. Skimming over any actual accomplishments, he opined that my \u201cresolve and motivation\u201d be tested in an unpaid capacity for a year, with my promotion to be decided by him on a \u201cmeritorious\u201d basis. I was puzzled. I thought he\u2019d applauded me for said resolve, motivation and merit. But there was more. He sealed his case by calling me \u201chigh-maintenance\u201d. From the Urban Dictionary: the definition of a high-maintenance girl is an excessively talkative, over-reactive, highly emotional, attention-seeking female who requires a firm handler. (see also: bitch) To all the women reading this, I\u2019d love to say that I called out the hypocrisy although I sincerely hope I would do so now from a position of greater strength. But on that day I became a ball of shame at the perception of being a champagne-swilling, Prada-toting woman when in fact I worked in one of the poorest places in the country with crumbling infrastructure, where despite being threatened and robbed I came to work because my patients were sacrosanct. When his male boss congratulated his \u201csophisticated\u201d (unethical) approach to the problem (payment for work), I tearfully searched for confirmation bias. If I stopped to wolf down my first meal at noon, was that high maintenance? If I didn\u2019t want to add to my existing load of unpaid work and had young children and ageing parents, was that high maintenance? In truth I didn\u2019t know a single doctor who fit that description but now I was it and the accusation stung. A male surgeon concluded, \u201cYou\u2019ve been white-anted!\u201d, which sent me scurrying to the dictionary. White-anting (Australian, colloquial): the act of bringing down from within, undermining. Derived from the action of termites eating the inside of foundations, often leaving no outward evidence until the structure crumbles. Some might protest that such broad assertions taint \u201ceven the good\u201d men but the point is not to disparage all men, rather to point out the abundant evidence for a lack of respect for women. Women in medicine tolerate their indignities quietly because to speak is to attract backlash. Their critics silence them by saying that respect must be earned and pay equity must be deserved. They\u2019re told to grow a thicker skin and lectured to get along with men. In other words, if women were actually as good as men, the problem of gender equity wouldn\u2019t exist. This distorted rhetoric distracts from the very real barriers that obstruct progress. A recent World Health Organisation report highlights that women fill a staggering 70% of healthcare roles but only a quarter of senior roles. The report is titled \u201cDelivered by Women, Led by Men\u201d. Publishing pay scales, promoting more women, giving them a seat at the important tables and creating family-friendly policies help gender equity. Holding senior doctors accountable for their conduct towards women is vital because they lead by example. But these ideas aren\u2019t novel, so why is change so slow? In my opinion, it is because at the heart of change is respect, which is an easy word to say but a really difficult one to teach. The highest goal of medicine is to help patients and it is inarguable that patient care is enriched by the inclusion of women in the highest echelons of medicine. Gender equity is not about being nice to women doctors \u2013 there is a powerful business case for it. But as long as we think of basic decency as a concession and fairness as a gift to women, we will be stuck writing to journals while our patients pay the price.

      "bodyText": "Otherwise, I suppose that\u2019s us. New Zealand win 1-0, so congratulations to an excellent and likeable team. However the combination of flat, slow pitches, along with the Kookaburra ball, made for a relatively dull series between two teams who should be anything but that \u2013 and that was a shame. Still, cricket is better than no cricket and we\u2019ll be back extremely soon for the SA series. Thanks for your company and comments over the last fortnight or so \u2013 ta-ra! Here\u2019s Ali Martin\u2019s report... Finally, he thinks a lot has been learnt about the group. Ideally, that would\u2019ve happened in the context of a 2-0 win, but it didn\u2019t happen like that. On the plus side, the series in SA is for championship points and he thinks his team will be better for it. As for the batting, Root says Pope showed great maturity to play within himself and manage situation, getting the team into a situation where England could dictate and he could play his natural game. He says that Sibley will have learnt a lot, and that Pope is adequate as a deputy keeper. Wood and Anderson are both in South Africa getting overs in; both should be ready to go if selected. Bairstow is out there too, and Root needs to speak to Moeen and Ed Smith about his availability. He says he\u2019s a fine player and will be back but doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be for the next series. On himself, Root says he\u2019s felt close to proper form for a while and once he got set wasn\u2019t going to give it away, so is pleased to make the most of a flat track. Root tells Sky that it feels like England tried everything today but dropped a couple of chances. He says England are learning a lot and learnt from New Zealand, namechecking Wanger\u2019s engine and perseverance. He says his team need to take more chances, but there was a vast improvement this week, and laughs that Denly is a bit sore. Root thinks it was the right call not to play a spinner, and it was an opportunity to try something outside of the Test championship. He says Archer has found that Test cricket is hard and you can bowl well without getting rewards; he has a lot of learning to do but has to stay mentally and physically resilient. He\u2019s a fast learner and will be better for this experience. He praises Woakes and Curran, saying Woakes is better with the Kookaburra ball now, and Curran is always there to get stuck in. Williamson accepts the trophy, and his team join him for photos. Like Wagner, he seems an absolutely superb bloke. Kane Williamson is up next and praises a great fighting effort despite losing both tosses; I like his hoody, which is grey with orange detail. He says this surface was a tough one and didn\u2019t break up as expected, but his players kept wanting the ball in their hand when nothing was happening. His team have good challenges coming up, and he praises Daryl Mitchell on debut along with Matt Henry, while hoping Trent Boult and Colin DeGrandhomme will be ready for Australia. Er, Root\u2019s back. He thinks the pitch might\u2019ve deteriorated quicker without the rain and his team would\u2019ve batted differently at the end of their innings. His team want to learn quickly - unlike those who don\u2019t - and make big totals which put opponents under scoreboard pressure. The group have learnt a lot and he\u2019s learnt a lot about them, he says, and is looking forward to South Africa. He thanks the fans who\u2019ve supported his team, and he\u2019s off again. Neil Wagner is man of the series, and that\u2019s richly deserved for top bloke and a developing top bowler. Joe Root is man of the match and says he felt good following a tricky period at the start. Simon Doull tells him he felt the criticism of him was \u201cunwarranted\u201d - I really could not tell you why - and Root says he was working on some little technical things, trying to get movement back into his hands and a solid base. The pitch didn\u2019t break up as he\u2019d hoped - I\u2019m sure his spinners would\u2019ve taken advantage of that - and he says he\u2019s proud of how his team came back and learnt the lessons of the first Test. They\u2019re shaking hands and such. So there we go. \u201cI think he could,\u201d says Benjamin Macintyre of Santner. \u201cIt does depend on many things we can\u2019t predict though. If it\u2019s stifling hot the week leading up to Boxing Day in Melbourne the groundsmen will not be able to stop it getting dry quickly. If it\u2019s a fast bowler\u2019s wicket though, I\u2019m not sure any spinner would be able to hold an end down on days 1 and 2 - not just Santner. This is, of course, all academic as Sodhi is going to make a surprise appearance and rip through everyone.\u201d This was the glory of Graeme Swann, who not only held down an end but found a way to get people out. The more I think about it, the more he was the key to that great England side. You cannot see that Denly drop enough times, and they\u2019ve just blessed us with it yet again. Sensational. It\u2019s stopped raining but is extremely wet. I can\u2019t see anyone\u2019s arsed to keep on with this, but we can hope. On which point, I absolutely loved this. Mark Wood is such a great interviewee. I mentioned him taking us through the final yesterday, because they played it at lunchtime, and I\u2019m still enjoying it now I\u2019m seeing it a second time. He\u2019s just informed us that the dressing room \u201cwas literally flying\u201d. Back to Santner, Sydney might spin, but they\u2019re not playing at Adelaide. And maybe he\u2019ll get fourth-innings wickets if NZ bat first, but are we really saying he\u2019s good enough to hold down an end on days 1 and 2? Hmmm. And he\u2019s back! \u201cAs a Kiwi, your retelling of England\u2019s world cup tie-umph is giving me flashbacks,\u201d he says. Cricket was the winner. I deadpanned that. \u201cI think it\u2019s harsh to suggest that NZ doesn\u2019t have a quality spinner when they have Mitchell Santner,\u201d says Benjamin Macintyre. \u201cHis Test stats don\u2019t show the progress he has made this year and whilst he doesn\u2019t necessarily rip through sides in the manner of legendary spinners such as Warne he is the perfect option when you need to quieten a batting pair hitting their strides and even get one or two of them to nick off. If the Australian summer sun starts to really dry up the surface I can see Santner doing some real damage in the upcoming Australia v NZ series.\u201d Fair enough. I\u2019ve not seen that yet, and I\u2019d expect Warner, Smith and ilk to go after him. But I\u2019m often wrong. We\u2019re seeing pictures of umpires and captain chatting. It\u2019s still raining, but England can still pull this off... I cannot believe what I\u2019ve just seen! According to Cricinfo, there\u2019ll be a final decision made at the hour. We know what it\u2019ll be, but that\u2019s when it\u2019ll be. \u201cIf I were a betting man, I would say that the upcoming series against Australia has got the potential to be one of the best in recent times,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cWith the exception of Raval, the Kiwi batting has never been in better form. If flat pitches are the order of the day, they\u2019ll feel right at home. As for the Aussie bowling threat, they did seem to lose the plot at certain times on the field against Pakistan in the recently-concluded affair, but their great returns nonetheless speaks volumes about the threat they possess. This might be the first time New Zealand has a favourable chance of winning a series Down Under. I, for one, will be following with a keen eye.\u201d I\u2019d love to see that, but I\u2019m not sure. Taking 20 wickets in Australia, where medium pace gets whacked, if extremely difficult. New Zealand lack a quality spinner, and will be needing plenty from Ferguson and Wagner. It\u2019s possible, but probably not likely. ...or, put another way, we\u2019re almost done. Inspection in five minutes... Stokes has just played a glorious dive for six. What a player! This World Cup final wasn\u2019t bad yano. I think I\u2019m about ten to tears. \u201cIf Australians ridiculed Mike Brearley\u2019s long jumpers,\u201d says Ian Forth, \u201cwhat are they to make of David Warner\u2019s (image, over 48)? I mean a lesser man than me might say \u2018What is he hiding in there?!\u2019, but fortunately I\u2019m much, much better than that.\u201d I don\u2019t mind him wearing it, but not with trousers. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in education for many years,\u201d confesses Noel Sheppard, no relation of Dr from the Murder of Roger Ackroyd. \u201cMainly primary, with some secondary and a smattering of university thrown in. And for the last several years I\u2019ve been teaching 11-year-olds, and every morning we would have a discussion of any news that caught their fancy. One morning Teddy came in, to tell us he\u2019d just heard the Admiral in charge of the Danish Navy on the news. He was on to announce the completion of a lengthy program to barcode every vessel in the Danish sea-force. When asked why, he replied, \u2018So we can Scandinavian.\u2019 To this day, Teddy remains a source of some of my best jokes!\u201d My six-year-old\u2019s friend told her the following: What\u2019s a cow\u2019s favourite subject? Moosic. So she has come up with the following: What\u2019s a turkey\u2019s favourite subject? Geography. What\u2019s a pirate\u2019s favourite subject? Aaaaarrrrt. And a niche one: Why was Gru upset on Saturday? Because he couldn\u2019t find a minyan. Thanks Tanya and greetings all. On Sky, they\u2019re showing the Borg-McEnroe tiebreak World Cup final, which tells you all you need ta kna. Anyhow, we can chat, for as long as we can pretend this isn\u2019t over \u2013 send me your thoughts to the addresses which will appear above when you hit the re-fresh. Kim Thonger scrambles brains from a distance. If Schr\u00f6dinger took up cricket, and was stationed at deep square leg, and was under a skied hook, at the moment the ball landed in his hands, would it be Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Catch, but also would we not know whether it was held or dropped? And, with that, I\u2019ll hand over to my colleague Daniel Harris. Thanks for sticking with us, and thanks for all the emails, tweets, jokes and more over the series - it\u2019s been a blast. What riches! Another message, this time from Sebastian Bloomfield. I\u2019m enjoying The Guardian\u2019s commentary all the way down in NZ. Do you think Jeet Raval should be replaced by Martin Guptill in the Australia series? Surely more opening experience would warrant a draft into the squad for Guppy, especially considering the Australian pitches. What are your thoughts on a Guptill/Latham opening combination? Kane Williamson may not have to open (as he is doing, essentially) anymore. I learnt today, that the NZ selectors had already picked the squad for Australia before this series. In that case it would be quite a statement to drop Raval from the squad - though he\u2019s in the middle of a rotten run. According to NZ stuff: \u201cSince Raval\u2019s maiden, and sole, test century against Bangladesh in Hamilton in February, he has scored, in a limited mix of first-class and test matches - 3, 33, 4, 0, 7, 3, 14, 19, 5; 88 runs at an average of 9.78. That\u2019s lessened his test average to a still respectable but not overwhelming 33.27.\u201d Guptill and Latham sounds interesting. The Aussies have just named their squad btw: Tim Paine (c, wk), Joe Burns, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Michael Neser, James Pattinson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade, David Warner Sky chat away in the studio, but we break briefly to look at the ground. Whoops, apocalypse, as they say. But an email to warm our cockles, from Hugh McCarroll: As a local, my condolences regarding the weather. Please, don\u2019t apologise, I live in Manchester. Do you remember a radio program called \u2018Tales from the long room\u2019 or something like that. I remember it was very very funny, and quite outrageous. Cricket generates much good material because of the unforgiving minutes you lot have to fill with words. It rings a bell, and google is helpful - it was by the playwright Peter Tinniswood and concerned the cricket-loving Brigadier from Witney Scrotum and his Uncle Mort. And you\u2019re right, cricket writers are very well acquainted with filling empty minutes with hot air... There\u2019s someone out there! AJ Hunter writes: As an American watching, why is this series not considered part of the ICC World Test Championship? Is it so each teams series count even? Or something else? Hi AJ. Yes, there\u2019s no conspiracy, it is just that the World Test Championship was designed after this series was already in the bank. Each team in the Championship will play six series between August 2019 and June 2021 (three home and three away). They all count - (excluding games against non WTC counties Ireland, Zimbabwe and Afghanistan) except this one! This looks like a long rain delay, though the crowd haven\u2019t left the ground yet. Do send me your thoughts, on this or that, on New Zealand\u2019s chances in Australia, or England\u2019s in South Africa. 75th over: New Zealand 241-2 ( Williamson 104, Taylor 105) Taylor sniffs the air and smells rain. Four, six, six, thanks very much, his 19th Test hundred, and just on cue, the groundstaff zip up their jackets and the rain starts to fall . 74th over: New Zealand 225-2 ( Williamson 104, Taylor 89) Denly whizzes through another over. 73rd over: New Zealand 220-2 ( Williamson 103, Taylor 85) A barmy quick single, saved only by an off-target throw by Sam Curran, is followed by a sweep down on one knee as Williamson reaches his 21st Test hundred. He removes his helmet and the wind ruffles both hair and beard in celebration. He\u2019s given a few chances, and ridden out the Ben Stokes storm, but classic Kane. 72nd over: New Zealand 213-2 ( Williamson 97, Taylor 85) Williamson drives Denly through the off-side to shuffle closer to three figures. The heavens have indeed opened here in Auckland....and it looks like Hamilton won\u2019t be far behind (according to the rain radar on the Met Service website) writes Andy Goulden. Will Captain Kane get his ton? You\u2019d think they could forgo the sarnies for half an hour as the weather is closing in but I suppose that\u2019s one reason we love the ever logic defying game of test cricket. 71st over: New Zealand 211-2 ( Williamson 96, Taylor 84) The umpires\u2019 black slacks undulate in the breeze and the floodlights are on. Root thinks he might as well keep going and Taylor plays out a maiden. He and Williamson are second and fourth in the list of all-time leading New Zealand run-scorers. We see Root giving his troops a pep talk before they all stroll back onto the pitch. The sky is grey, but not black. The heavens have opened in Auckland about 70 miles away... 70th over: New Zealand 211-2 ( Williamson 96, Taylor 84) Ben Stokes bowls the last over before lunch. Williamson considers the forecast and pulls him twice, quite beautifully to the square leg boundary. They all potter off for sandwiches and we catch a glimpse of the sky, which is darkening. A bumbling morning for England, with those two drops by Ollie Pope and meme creator Joe Denly. The game drifts towards its natural end. Time for a quick stretch, back soon. 69th over: New Zealand 202-2 ( Williamson 88, Taylor 83) Time for some Joe Root. He brings the fielders forward, he urges them back with his long conductorial fingers. Sleeves buttoned down, he twirls; Taylor plays him with nuff respect, then a nudge down to square leg to reach 7000 Test runs, only the second New Zealander to get there. Then Root turns one into Taylor\u2019s pads, big appeal turned down, but decides not to review. 68th over: New Zealand 201-2 ( Williamson 88, Taylor 82) Against the run of play, a little Christmas sparkle . Stokes fires one in short, Williamson misjudges as he swivels to pull and the ball pings into his helmet and sprays behind where Pope catches it. A half-hearted appeal from both Stokes and Pope and Root decides to go for the review. And why not? He\u2019s not out - there\u2019s no contact with the swooshing bat, and Lockie Ferguson brings out a new helmet. Taylor and Williamson continue to get their eye in for the battle ahead across the Tasman. New Zealand\u2019s lead is 100. 67th over: New Zealand 197-2 ( Williamson 87, Taylor 80) Curran heads wide of the crease to send the ball in. Williamson eases a couple of runs and starts to think about lunch. 66th over: New Zealand 195-2 ( Williamson 85, Taylor 80) Ben Stokes, to bowl for your life? He digs six short balls into unresponsive soil, undaunted by the lack of reward. He laughs in the face of pancakes. 65th over: New Zealand 190-2 ( Williamson 84, Taylor 77) Nowt of note. Speaking of Gatting, writes Tom from North London, watch this. 64th over: New Zealand 186-2 ( Williamson 80, Taylor 77) Denly. Two singles. Lots of school kids in maroon t-shirt and shorts frolic on the grass. 63rd over: New Zealand 184-2 ( Williamson 79, Taylor 76) The Christmas perfume ads have hit - though none as memorable as the one years ago for L\u2019egoiste that involved lots of people opening and closing shutters loudly whilst shouting. It made quite an impression at a sensitive age. Not that I ever bought it. Curran skips through a maiden with a smile on his face and a lolly in his pocket. 62nd over: New Zealand 183-2 ( Williamson 79, Taylor 75) Denly whizzes through his over, as if he might fast-forward through the day so fast that it disappears. 61st over: New Zealand 179-2 ( Williamson 75, Taylor 75) Woakes strides actively to the crease. Williamson trots through for a single. Would it be too harsh to say the most interesting thing that is going to happen before lunch is the race to see who reaches their century first? Though when I say race, I mean it in its broadest possible sense. Antnie writes from across the channel. I am following, avidly, I promise, in deepest France, though I\u2019m having trouble picturing pink stains on bowlers trousers. I hope your hottie bottle is under control tonight. No hot water bottle yet - that\u2019s for the 1.40am shift. Perhaps Daniel has got his ready and waiting by the kettle right now. 60th over: New Zealand 178-2 ( Williamson 74, Taylor 75) And with a single to mid-on off Denly, that\u2019s the 150 partnership between Williamson and Taylor, off 306 balls. They reach out, and shake hands. 59th over: New Zealand 176-2 ( Williamson 72, Taylor 75) A bearded Chris Woakes is rather discombobulating , he starts to look like all the other bearded warriors, a bit of Mark Wood, with a touch of Virat Kohli. Beards have definitely got better though. Compare Mike Gatting\u2019s to the 2019 versions. 58th over: New Zealand 175-2 ( Williamson 72, Taylor 74) Denly is bowling with his shades on, as Root polishes the ball for him on the back of his trousers. Not much happens, but the odd brain cell starts to disengage. 57th over: New Zealand 172-2 ( Williamson 70, Taylor 73) And a maiden from Woakes, as the wind ruffles the players\u2019 shirts. And some more appreciation for Steven Finn pops into my email box. Good evening, Tanya, writes Peter Stoker. Not much to cheer about in this series other than, perhaps, the emergence of Steve Finn as a splendidly genial and good-natured pundit on TMS (although I appreciate, of course, that you have to follow the Sky telly feed). Let\u2019s hope the lad has a good few years left steaming in from the Pavilion End at Lord\u2019s. But after hanging up the size 16s... 56th over: New Zealand 172-2 ( Williamson 70, Taylor 73) Denly again, Taylor and Williamson are untroubled, Taylor laying into a crisp cut for four off his last ball. 55th over: New Zealand 164-2 ( Williamson 68, Taylor 67) Time for a bit of Chris Woakes, who takes long, brisk strides back to his mark and unfurls a tidy over. Surely if the DRS was applied to Schr\u00f6dinger\u2018s Cat, writes Kim Thonger, we\u2019d find out once and for all if the ruddy thing was dead or alive and put an end to the uncertainty? 54th over: New Zealand 163-2 ( Williamson 68, Taylor 66) Nice little bit of captaincy here, as Root throws the ball to Denly - let him try to make amends, or at least not mull over the drop isolated in the field. The wind is getting up, and rattling the trees surrounding the ground. 53rd over: New Zealand 161-2 ( Williamson 66, Taylor 66) Fortified by drinks, Archer rolls through another over. It\u2019s free entry today by the way, so if you\u2019ve got time on your hands in Hamilton, why not mosey down. Joe Denly should never have gone to the Marnus Labuschagne catching school, snorts David Markham. while Dave Harris wonders, \u201cDo you think Mrs Denly\u2019s going to be letting Joe hold their little\u2019un (https://mobile.twitter.com/joed1986/status/1172466162761908225) uunsupervised when he gets home? 52nd over: New Zealand 157-2 ( Williamson 65, Taylor 63) Good old Stuart Broad runs yet another over into those tired old legs. Enthusiasm undimmed. Three not particularly memorable singles and that be drinks. This seems a bit cruel, but here you go, to accompany your coffee/cocoa. 51st over: New Zealand 155-2 ( Williamson 62, Taylor 61) A maiden from Archer. Trouble at the last ball when Taylor sends Williamson back and he only just makes his crease via a sprawled dive. 50th over: New Zealand 155-2 ( Williamson 62, Taylor 61) A maiden from Broad, as poor ostracised Denly trudges around the field unloved. Give him a hug someone. 49th over: New Zealand 154-2 ( Williamson 62, Taylor 61) Oh dear. Cover your eyes. Joe Denly has just dropped the sitter of all sitters. Archer bowls to Williamson, one of those balls where he doesn\u2019t use his front arm, Williamson tips it straight into Denly\u2019s hands at short midwicket, and I mean straight, Denly doesn\u2019t move his feet an inch, and just waits for the ball to come into his hands, which it does, and then falls straight back out. Broad covers his mouth with his hands , Archer, who was already celebrating, puts head to his hand and then laughs. 48th over: New Zealand 151-2 ( Williamson 59, Taylor 61) There\u2019s a scattering of bare-footed crowd on the banks either side of the sightscreen as this game meanders away. A steady over from Broad. 47th over: New Zealand 149-2 ( Williamson 59, Taylor 61) Archer again, nothing too steamy, but on the button. Just a couple from the over. Geoff Wignall offers this up: Knock, knock Who\u2019s there? Schr\u00f6dinger And you expect me to.open the door? 46th over: New Zealand 147-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 60) A double-switch as Broad replaces Stokes. Nothing much to report except for Zak Crawley tripping over himself in the covers, like a British rom-com hero negociating unexpected ice. 45th over: New Zealand 143-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 56) So Root turns to Archer. They have a man to man at the top of the mark and Root shuffles the field. Taylor swivels and pulls a short one, 117kph, for a single, then Williamson ducks, like a leapfrogger. I think if we\u2019ve learned anything it\u2019s that New Zealand are good enough to beat England, and that the groundskeepers should be more adventurous in preparing pitches for a result, writes Joe Harvey, wisely, This second test has been disappointing. As an England supporter, I worry that we haven\u2019t learned much- we\u2019re still trying to figure out if Root is cut out for Captaincy, and if the Bowling attack needs a more aggressive shuffle. I don\u2019t think our bowling hand is too bad: Broad, Archer, Curran, Woakes, Stokes - then throw in Anderson and Wood with Mahmood sculling around in a florescent tabard. 44th over: New Zealand 143-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 56) And fifty for Taylor too, a more chunky, risky, effort but very entertaining. He jumps off the ground to swish a Stokes wide one over gully for four, then next ball sends him through the covers for successive boundaries. Taylor and Williamson stroll together, shoot the breeze, and touch gloves. 43rd over: New Zealand 134-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 47) Beautiful from Kane Williamson, first a dreamy extra cover drive, then he drops the hands and kisses Curran down to third man for another four. I like him too. And Ramprakash, they both add something new to the squad. 42nd over: New Zealand 124-2 ( Williamson 49, Taylor 46) Taylor decides to lay into Stokes with a swift-handed slap through backward point for four. Lots of muscle but no reward yet for Stokes. 41st over: New Zealand 115-2 ( Williamson 45, Taylor 40) Curran goes through the motions, all effort and sweaty hair. Williamson plays him poker-faced until stealing a couple down to long-off. A cracking email from John Starbuck. Good evening. 1) You\u2019d think that a sport more obsessed with stats than perhaps any other (OK Baseball, but that\u2019s just a sort of rounders) would place more trust in meteorological forecasts and start even earlier on the final day; 2) We seems to be selecting players for the next but one series at the moment and even later given the chance to select youngsters who need overseas experience; 3) Mince pies should, properly, be accompanied by glasses of Madeira now we\u2019re in December. Boast: since the early 1980s I\u2019ve been buying an extra bottle of Madeira each year to lay down for my retirement and, now it\u2019s arrived, I\u2019m very pleased to say it was all worthwhile. The problem is that word has got about and I now have to take a 40-year old bottle to every Yuletide family party. Note to the uninformed: Madeira in bottles is known to mature fabulously well for longer and varied treatment - in my case, several house removals, which isn\u2019t the same as multiple trips across the Atlantic but it\u2019ll do; 4) Here\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll sign off this series on a high. 40th over: New Zealand 113-2 ( Williamson 45, Taylor 40) A Stokes tester, he torments Williamson with variations of length and bounce. You could say that, or it just means he\u2019ll be a more confident captain with some form behind him, and can grow into the job while other candidates develop/secure their place in the side. 39th over: New Zealand 113-2 ( Williamson 43, Taylor 40) Two contrasting boundaries for Taylor off Curran, a cover drive, all smooth hazelnut, then a Toxic Waste outside edge, down through third man. Good evening Tanya Good evening Damian Clarke. My nephew also has a new joke book. His favourite so far? Knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock. Who\u2019s there? Mr. Octopus. Very Good. 37th over: New Zealand 103-2 ( Williamson 43, Taylor 32) A drop! Stokes shoves one short and Williamson gloves it down the leg-side only for a porridge-legged Ollie Pope to drop it . To rub salt into the wound, Williamson then pulls Stokes with pizazz for four and New Zealand go into the lead. 37th over: New Zealand 99-2 ( Williamson 39, Taylor 32) A smart shy at the stumps from Sam Curran could have had Taylor in trouble, but his foot was comfortably back over the crease. Curran completes a neat maiden. William Hargreaves drops a line. What do you feel will be the outcome, how fair a reflection of two teams\u2019 capabilities would this be, and how do you think this will influence two teams going forward, please? Gosh. I think that deserves two sides of A4. But briefly: a draw, a fairly true reflection (of England abroad) and I think it will give NZ some confidence going into the Australian series and reveals England\u2019s weaknesses to be where they knew they were anyway. Incisive spin, Spots 2 and 3 in the batting order, and the killer instinct with the ball out of English conditions. 36th over: New Zealand 99-2 ( Williamson 39, Taylor 32) I was wondering whether Archer might get the ball from the other end, but Root has plumped for Stokes who toyed with Taylor yesterday evening. Again he seems to get Taylor in two minds, with the odd ball behaving unexpectedly off the pitch. Taylor pulls, inconclusively. 35th over: New Zealand 98-2 ( Williamson 39, Taylor 31) Sam Curran is handed the ball and scampers in from the Barmy Army end where a half-cut rendition of Jerusalem assaults the ears. And out the players come - for perhaps the last session of the series. An early joke, for our more mature readers, care of James Debens. Someone\u2019s stolen the Trotters\u2019 Reliant Robin van and sold it to the US. \u201cDelaware?\u201d No, but Rodney\u2019s bloody livid. Another James, Butler this time, thinks Mike Atherton has forgotten the lesson of the near past. It feels a bit ironic to now be saying that Sibley is \u2018a bit limited\u2019. Personally I would have given away my most treasured cricketing possession (a signed copy of \u2018Angus Fraser\u2019s Tour Diaries\u2019) during the Ashes if we could have found a \u2018limited\u2019 player who could have ground out 20 between lunch and tea in the face of Pat Cummins. Mark Butcher fancies Moeen Ali to rejoin England for the South Africa tour. I do hope so. Then they move on to Jofra Archer - Atherton says he\u2019s an absolute diamond, but has realised how difficult Test cricket is away from England and the Dukes ball. Says we need to dampen expectation a little, but he\u2019s a wonderful player. An interesting tale here: My son has a new joke book. This is his favourite. Bill: I\u2019m letting my pet pig sleep on my bed. Jenny: What about the smell? Bill: He\u2019ll just have to get used to it. In the Sky studio they\u2019re having a selection chat for the South Africa series. Mike Atherton think Dom Sibley might not be right, for now, and looks a bit limited. He suggests they might shove Denly up to open and thinks Ollie Pope looks the best English batsman since Joe Root. Butcher would keep Sibley for the tour to South Africa and see what happens. The England touring staff, according to Atherton, are both quite optimistic about Sibley and Crawley because of the way they are shaping up in practice. It\u2019s not raining by the way, looks quite nice actually. So, here we are, two mince pies into December, with just one day left of the first tour of the new regime. Downpours are due, probably by lunch, so any hopes of England levelling the series, or New Zealand pulling another rabbit out of the hat, seem remote. It\u2019s all about the little presents left unobtrusively at the foot of the tree. In foil, England\u2019s longest Test innings for four years. With raffia, Ollie Pope\u2019s debut fifty and Tom Latham\u2019s century. Gift-boxed, Joe Root\u2019s double ton. And finally, busting out of a too-small envelope, Neil Wagner\u2019s five wickets. On Saturday New Zealand fly to Australia, where they need to hit the ground running. The first of the three Test series starts at Perth, before moving on to Melbourne on Boxing Day and Sydney at New Year. Their last Test win in Australia was in 2011 , but you have to travel back to the era of big hair and pixie boots to unearth their last series win, when Richard Hadless was in charge way back 1985-86. England have a couple of warm-up games before the first Test against South Africa which starts at Centurion on Boxing day. Three more Tests, three ODIs and three T20s follow. But we\u2019ve still got today. Something to play for, even if it is Williamson and Taylor knocking themselves into form before the rain . Play is due to start at 10.30am NZST or 9.30pm GMT. See you soon!",

Designed as a pre-emptive strike on an imminent report from the Democratic majority, the GOP document underlines how evidence presented at the hearings failed to shatter Republicans\u2019 united front. It also provides a blueprint for House Republicans to defend the US president at Wednesday\u2019s judiciary committee hearing and for their Senate counterparts to acquit him in a trial. Democrats accuse Trump of attempting to bribe the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, by making a White House meeting and nearly $400m in military aid conditional on Ukraine announcing two investigations that would boost Trump politically. The 123-page Republican report was prepared for Devin Nunes, Jim Jordan and Michael McCaul, the ranking members on the House intelligence, oversight and foreign affairs committees, respectively. It directly contradicts the testimony of career diplomats and makes little attempt to get to grips with the devastating evidence of Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, who spoke about the existence of a quid pro quo, or Fiona Hill, former top Russia expert at the White House, who warned against falling for Moscow\u2019s propaganda about Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election.

They\u2019ll be reading it throughout the day tomorrow and essentially it outlines in considerable detail a scheme that began, actually, well before the recall of Ambassador [Marie] Yovanovitch and was designed to further two political objectives of the president, which is an investigation into Joe Biden and an investigation into this debunked conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine that interfered in the last election, not Russia.\u201d Trump has persistently told Democrats and other critics to read the call transcript. But they have pointed to 10 words, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though\u201d, as clear proof he expected a quid pro quo in the context of congressionally approved military funding being frozen. It was later released. The report adds: \u201cEven examining evidence beyond the presidential phone call shows no quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, or abuse of power. The evidence shows that President Trump holds a deepseated, genuine, and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine due to its history of pervasive corruption.\u201d Trump has also been vocal about his doubts over US foreign aid and the need for European allies to shoulder more of the financial burden for regional defence, it goes on. \u201cUnderstood in this proper context, the President\u2019s initial hesitation to meet with President Zelensky or to provide US taxpayer-funded security assistance to Ukraine without thoughtful review is entirely prudent.\u201d All members of the House intelligence committee can review a draft of Democrats\u2019 report in classified spaces on Monday night. It will be adopted at meeting behind closed doors on Tuesday evening, then sent to the judiciary committee.",

      "bodyText": "More than 10% of the area covered by New South Wales national parks has been burned in this season\u2019s bushfires, including 20% of the Blue Mountains world heritage area, state government data obtained by Guardian Australia has revealed. The amount of bushland destroyed within NSW national parks dwarfs that of the entire previous fire season, when 80,000 hectares were lost. Ten times that amount has burnt since July. The damage caused by fire in the Gondwana rainforest world heritage area in the north of the state is a \u201cglobal tragedy\u201d and an \u201cabsolute crisis\u201d a Nature Conservation Council ecologist says. The chief executive of the council, Chris Gambian, said the loss of 800,000 hectares in NSW national parks, out of a total of 1.9m hectares burnt in the state since 1 July, \u201cchanges the calculus of nature conservation in the state\u201d. The \u201cmonumental\u201d scale of the fires meant conservation of land would now be \u201cmore important than ever\u201d, Gambian said. \u201cNational parks are the best way to protect species and landscapes, but when your national parks have been decimated, you have to look at the total picture and other measures.\u201d As well as the losses in the Blue Mountains, concern has centred on the Gondwana rainforest world heritage area, a collection of reserves of subtropical rainforest that span 366,500 hectares across NSW and Queensland. Mark Graham, an ecologist with the council who specialises in fire and biodiversity, said the fires there were \u201ca global tragedy\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s over-egging it,\u201d Graham said. Last week, the Unesco World Heritage Centre expressed concern about the Gondwana fires and asked the federal government whether the damage was affecting their universal values. Twelve of 28 NSW world heritage reserves have been at least partly affected by fire. Graham said until a week ago Barrington Tops and the New England national park were the two largest blocks of Gondwana that had not been affected by fire. That changed after lightning strikes sparked fires in those areas. \u201cTo be really blunt, it\u2019s an absolute crisis,\u201d Graham said. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve been permanently wet and have never burnt right through, they\u2019re like mountaintop arcs of ancient biodiversity. \u201cThese fires have directly impacted upon the values they were listed for.\u201d Further south, the Gospers Mountain fire has been burning out of control since last month in the Wollemi and Yengo national parks, part of the Greater Blue Mountains world heritage area, which covers one million hectares of national park and is dominated by temperate eucalypt forest. The executive officer of the National Parks Association of NSW, Gary Dunnett, said the national parks of the Blue Mountains were some of the most fire-prone landscape in the country, particularly during drought. \u201cThey\u2019re particularly vulnerable to these large-scale fires,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s reasonable to say we haven\u2019t seen anything on this scale since 2000-2001 and, again, the millennium drought was the big driver for that.\u201d On Tuesday morning, 118 fires were burning in NSW, 48 of them out of control. A spokeswoman for the NSW planning, industry and environment department said \u201cat 800,000 hectares burnt to date, this is much larger than the average season\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest season since 2002-03 which affected over one million hectares of parks and reserves,\u201d she said. \u201cThe environmental conditions, combined with strong winds and extremely low humidity, makes firefighting extremely difficult and dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cMany have referred to the NSW situation this year as unprecedented, and our experience to date would support this statement.\u201d She said the Blue Mountains area was a landscape adapted to recover after fire, and more detailed assessments of the impact would occur when conditions were safer. Similarly, post-fire mapping would be done in the Gondwana area to determine the full impact on the world heritage area because in some reserves it is only sections of national park that are world heritage listed.",

      "bodyText": "Actor John Jarratt has launched a second defamation lawsuit against the Sunday Telegraph over its reporting of rape allegations against him. Jarratt originally sued the Telegraph in the NSW supreme court over a front-page story detailing allegations by a former housemate, but dropped the lawsuit in August after he was found not guilty of rape. However, on 22 November he filed a fresh lawsuit in the federal court \u2013 a jurisdiction that has several advantages to plaintiffs including speed and the lack of a jury. In a statement of claim filed with the court, Jarratt says a separate article the Telegraph published on 7 July reporting the reaction of his accuser to the not guilty verdict conveyed imputations including that he \u201cis a rapist\u201d and \u201cgot away with rape\u201d. He claims the article also defamed him by saying he \u201cruined a woman\u2019s life by sexually assaulting her\u201d so that she was \u201cunable to marry and have children\u201d and \u201cgot away with ruining a woman\u2019s life by sexually assaulting her\u201d. Jarratt has applied for aggravated damages because of the \u201cover-sensationalised\u201d tone of the article and because the Telegraph knew he had been acquitted three days earlier. His lawyer, Bill Kalantzis, declined to comment when asked why Jarratt had commenced a second defamation suit in the federal court. However, barrister Bruce McClintock SC, who represented Jarratt in the first defamation action, said it was \u201cbecause he was defamed a second time\u201d. McClintock said Jarratt had no need to avoid a jury by choosing the federal court, pointing out he was found not guilty by a jury at his criminal trial. \u201cThe real reason is speed,\u201d he said. The aggravated damages claim was not absurd, he said. \u201cThis looks to me like News Corp doubling down. News asserted Jarratt was guilty when they knew he had been acquitted.\u201d Speaking generally, McClintock said defamation lawsuits were not a quick and easy money-maker. \u201cNo plaintiff commences proceedings as a shakedown for quick cash and I\u2019ll tell you why: it never happens. Media organisations fight and they fight very hard.\u201d The Telegraph\u2019s owner, News Corp, has been contacted for comment. Jarratt\u2019s lawsuit comes as state and federal attorneys general consider an overhaul of defamation laws that media companies and journalists say have become unworkable and created a chilling effect due to a series of sky-high payouts to plaintiffs. The role and increased popularity of the federal court for these cases has also come under scrutiny, with experts saying the ability for plaintiffs to choose whether or not to run their case in front of a jury is \u201ccontrary to the legislative intent\u201d of Australia\u2019s defamation laws. Media organisations are also believed to be unhappy with new guidelines for defamation cases issued by the court\u2019s chief justice, James Allsop, that contain several plaintiff-friendly features. These include a tight timeline to file defences and a clause that discourages judges from carving off the question of whether imputations claimed by the plaintiff are actually contained in the publication in question.

Founded in 1949, the treaty provides that if one country is attacked, all Nato members would collectively respond. Nato was set up to counter the threat of the Soviet Union.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The 12 founding members were: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, United Kingdom and the United States.</p>\n    <p>Over the years the organisation has expanded to its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52044.htm\">current membership of 29</a>. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, North Macedonia and Ukraine are recognised as states with aspirations to join.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it meeting in London?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This week's summit marks a celebration of the 70th anniversary of the organisation. London was chosen partly because it was the location of the original headquarters of the organisation when it was founded.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is on the agenda?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>During the two-day gathering there will be addresses by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, a formal reception at Buckingham Palace hosted by the Queen, and a meeting of the North Atlantic Council attended by heads of state and government. The agenda features discussions about Russia, China and the future of arms control. There will also be a series of bilateral meetings between leaders - the most testing of which are likely to feature Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan looking for support for his country's recent incursion into Syria.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What's the context?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Infighting is a major issue. For the third summit in a row, Donald Trump is expected to renew demands that European allies and Canada step up defence spending. He is also unhappy with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, over a tax on American tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook.</p>\n    <p>For his part Macron has lamented Nato's \"brain death\" due to a lack of US leadership, and said the organisation needs a wake-up call. He insists that strategic questions must be addressed, like improving ties with Russia and how to handle an unpredictable ally like Turkey.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In turn, Erdo\u011fan has lashed out at Macron. Their very public argument bodes ill for the summit, which is being hosted by the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. Johnson will want who to smooth things over and downplay any links to Trump, who is unpopular in the UK.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Before leaving Washington on Monday, Trump repeated his complaint about \u201cother countries that we protect, that weren\u2019t paying\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey were delinquent.

Days before Wednesday\u2019s leaders\u2019 meeting just outside London to mark Nato\u2019s 70th anniversary, the US announced it was cutting its contribution to joint Nato projects. Nato officials say the cut (which reduces the US contribution to equivalence with Germany\u2019s) was mutually agreed, but it comes against a backdrop of Trump\u2019s longstanding ambivalence about the value of the alliance, and suggestions that US security guarantees to allied nations were dependent on their military spending. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser until September, heightened fears among allies about the president\u2019s intentions in a private speech to a hedge fund last month, in which Bolton (according to a NBC report) warned that Trump could \u201cgo full isolationist\u201d if he wins re-election next November, withdrawing from Nato and other international alliances.

before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/05/questions-about-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-dumped-from-census\">the ABS ditched the questions</a> after assistant treasurer Michael Sukkar\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/24/abs-dumped-census-test-forms-with-new-sexuality-questions-after-input-from-ministers-office\">office intervened</a>, according to evidence to Senate estimates by chief statistician David Kalisch.</p> <p>The documents \u2013 tabled after a Greens order for production \u2013 reveal that in July Kalisch recommended to Sukkar that the only new topics for the census be on chronic health conditions and Australian Defence Force service, with old questions on household internet access and number of motor vehicles slated to be dropped.</p> <p>The ABS nevertheless asked the government to consider gender and sexual orientation questions because \u201cclaims have been made about the need for information\u201d on those topics which the government \u201cis best placed to judge\u201d.</p> <p>The submission to Sukkar noted increased scrutiny of the census due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/09/the-great-australian-census-fail-of-2016-website-crashes-under-load\">the 2016 census website outage</a>, suggesting the government \u201cmay not want to progress any controversial topics at this time\u201d as a result.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an acknowledged risk of adverse public reaction to possible topics on gender identity and sexual orientation,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The submission noted that initial local testing and international experience suggests the adverse reaction is not \u201csignificant enough to impact on response rates or quality of data\u201d.</p> <p>In a more detailed topic brief on the sexuality question, the ABS said there was an \u201cidentified need from organisations such as the Department of Social Services, Department of Health, National LGBTI Health Alliance and a number of state and local government agencies for a reliable evidence base\u201d to inform programs and budgets.</p> <p>There was no \u201clarge scale\u201d sources of data on sexuality, it said, and noted only those aged 15 years or older would be asked their sexuality.</p> <p>\u201cSubmissions indicated that a new census topic on sexual orientation would have strong value across all levels of government and it is hoped that this would allow targeted support to be developed nationally and, potentially, in small areas.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, the ABS noted \u201csensitivities and potential risks\u201d with the sexual orientation question, including \u201clack of trust in government by respondents and privacy concerns which could reduce the accuracy of the data\u201d.</p> <p>On gender identity, the brief noted that stakeholders have argued the \u201csignificant lack of data available on LGBTI people \u2026 has led to inaccuracy in reporting and significant underestimates that have left LGBTI people relatively invisible in mental health and suicide prevention policies, strategies and programs\u201d.</p> <p>More data would help inform service provision in health, mental health and aged care, it said.</p> <p>The brief noted the gender question \u201ccreated confusion in some test respondents\u201d in small scale tests, but did not detract from the response rate.</p> <p>The ABS noted that both the sexuality and gender identity questions were \u201cexpected to generate public comment and debate\u201d which would need to be \u201ccarefully navigated\u201d by the government and ABS.</p> <p>The ABS suggested the sensitivities and risks of the two new questions could be \u201cevaluated further through a large-scale field test\u201d before the questions were later dumped from the census test conducted in Wagga Wagga and south Brisbane.</p> <p>The submission noted that the results of the October test were \u201cunlikely to be available in time to help inform government decisions on census content\u201d.</p> <p>LGBTI Health Alliance executive director, Nicky Bath, said the revelation was \u201cdisappointing\u201d because of the \u201cgreat need\u201d for gender and sexuality data which should be put above \u201cthe politics and individual viewpoints\u201d.</p> <p>Bath noted the UK and New Zealand are set to include the questions in their next censuses, but failure to include them in 2021 will see Australia wait until 2026.</p> <p>The Greens\u2019 LGBTI spokeswoman, Janet Rice, told Guardian Australia the documents failed to explain why the ABS \u201cdecided to do a complete about-face on their own decision to include gender and sexuality questions in the census field test\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

      "bodyText": "The Australian Bureau of Statistics recommended the government not put a new question on sexual orientation into the 2021 census, despite acknowledging that two federal departments need the data to deliver services and it would have \u201cstrong value across all levels of government\u201d. Documents produced to the Senate on Monday reveal that despite extensive consultation with LGBTI health groups about questions on sexual orientation and gender identity and an \u201cidentified need\u201d for sexuality data, the ABS believed the potential new topics were too sensitive and risked public backlash. Gender and sexuality questions were among eight potential new topics identified by consultation in 2018 and were set to be included in a census test in October before the ABS ditched the questions after assistant treasurer Michael Sukkar\u2019s office intervened, according to evidence to Senate estimates by chief statistician David Kalisch. The documents \u2013 tabled after a Greens order for production \u2013 reveal that in July Kalisch recommended to Sukkar that the only new topics for the census be on chronic health conditions and Australian Defence Force service, with old questions on household internet access and number of motor vehicles slated to be dropped. The ABS nevertheless asked the government to consider gender and sexual orientation questions because \u201cclaims have been made about the need for information\u201d on those topics which the government \u201cis best placed to judge\u201d. The submission to Sukkar noted increased scrutiny of the census due to the 2016 census website outage, suggesting the government \u201cmay not want to progress any controversial topics at this time\u201d as a result. \u201cThere is an acknowledged risk of adverse public reaction to possible topics on gender identity and sexual orientation,\u201d it said. The submission noted that initial local testing and international experience suggests the adverse reaction is not \u201csignificant enough to impact on response rates or quality of data\u201d. In a more detailed topic brief on the sexuality question, the ABS said there was an \u201cidentified need from organisations such as the Department of Social Services, Department of Health, National LGBTI Health Alliance and a number of state and local government agencies for a reliable evidence base\u201d to inform programs and budgets. There was no \u201clarge scale\u201d sources of data on sexuality, it said, and noted only those aged 15 years or older would be asked their sexuality. \u201cSubmissions indicated that a new census topic on sexual orientation would have strong value across all levels of government and it is hoped that this would allow targeted support to be developed nationally and, potentially, in small areas.\u201d Nevertheless, the ABS noted \u201csensitivities and potential risks\u201d with the sexual orientation question, including \u201clack of trust in government by respondents and privacy concerns which could reduce the accuracy of the data\u201d. On gender identity, the brief noted that stakeholders have argued the \u201csignificant lack of data available on LGBTI people \u2026 has led to inaccuracy in reporting and significant underestimates that have left LGBTI people relatively invisible in mental health and suicide prevention policies, strategies and programs\u201d. More data would help inform service provision in health, mental health and aged care, it said. The brief noted the gender question \u201ccreated confusion in some test respondents\u201d in small scale tests, but did not detract from the response rate. The ABS noted that both the sexuality and gender identity questions were \u201cexpected to generate public comment and debate\u201d which would need to be \u201ccarefully navigated\u201d by the government and ABS. The ABS suggested the sensitivities and risks of the two new questions could be \u201cevaluated further through a large-scale field test\u201d before the questions were later dumped from the census test conducted in Wagga Wagga and south Brisbane. The submission noted that the results of the October test were \u201cunlikely to be available in time to help inform government decisions on census content\u201d. LGBTI Health Alliance executive director, Nicky Bath, said the revelation was \u201cdisappointing\u201d because of the \u201cgreat need\u201d for gender and sexuality data which should be put above \u201cthe politics and individual viewpoints\u201d. Bath noted the UK and New Zealand are set to include the questions in their next censuses, but failure to include them in 2021 will see Australia wait until 2026. The Greens\u2019 LGBTI spokeswoman, Janet Rice, told Guardian Australia the documents failed to explain why the ABS \u201cdecided to do a complete about-face on their own decision to include gender and sexuality questions in the census field test\u201d. \u201cThis is what we know: the ABS told minister Sukkar the questions would be included in the field test. Then, without any obvious rhyme, reason or explanation, the ABS decided to remove those questions.\u201d Rice called on Sukkar to \u201ccome clean\u201d about what contact his office made with the ABS, suggesting the decision to dump the questions from the test \u201clooks suspiciously like [the product of] political pressure\u201d. \u201cThese questions are vital to ensuring that all Australians are counted. How is the government going to ever adequately address the needs of LGBTIQ+ communities if they refuse to count us in the census?\u201d The ABS recommended the question on sex be changed to offer a non-binary response option because the current binary question \u201ccannot be answered accurately by people who are neither male nor female\u201d. The submission explains the ABS decided against potential new questions on journey to education and improved household and family measures, including shared care of children, because they were \u201ctoo complex and expensive to collect\u201d. The ABS did not proceed with a new topic on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural identity \u201cdue to Indigenous community concerns\u201d, it said. Smoking status was considered \u201cof less value than other proposed topics for inclusion, such as chronic health conditions\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Tuesday\u2019s blog: Wrapping up our live coverage for tonight. The president is now in London for the Nato summit as the House intelligence committee prepares to review its report on the impeachment inquiry. Among today\u2019s many impeachment-adjacent developments: House Republicans released a 123-page report defending Trump against the impeachment inquiry against him. Two Giuliani associates will likely face additional charges, a federal prosecutor said in court in Manhattan. A federal judge denied the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to delay an order requiring former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before Congress. The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee \u201cthoroughly investigated\u201d and debunked a key GOP talking point about Ukraine and the 2016 election, Politico reported. Attorney general William Barr is signaling that he may publicly disagree with an inspector general\u2019s conclusion, in an independent report, that the FBI had enough information in the summer of 2016 to justify launching an investigation into members of the Trump campaign, the Washington Post reported. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign announced it would no longer credential Bloomberg News reporters after the outlet said it would not investigate its owner, Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire former Republican who recently announced his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, or any of Bloomberg\u2019s Democratic rivals, while still continuing to investigate Trump. Trump tweeted angrily that the news agency\u2019s approach was \u201cnot O.K.\u201d Many media critics actually agree. Trump said in a tweet that his administration would restore steel and aluminum tariffs on Brazil and Argentina, despite the efforts of Brazil\u2019s far-right president to develop an alliance with Trump. Trump\u2019s Attorney General, William Barr, has told associates he disagrees with the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general on a central finding of a forthcoming report \u2014 that the FBI had enough information in the summer of 2016 to justify launching an investigation into members of the Trump campaign, the Washington Post reports. The report from Justice Department\u2019s inspector general Michael Horowitz is expected to be made public in a week. The inspector general operates independently of Justice Department leadership, so Barr cannot order Horowitz to change his findings, the Washington Post notes. Democrats have long argued that Barr, who was confirmed as attorney general in early 2019, acts more like the president\u2019s personal attorney than the attorney general of the entire country, and that his behavior is eroding the independence of the Justice Department. File under Freedom of Information Act victories. Buzzfeed News is suing the Justice Department to publicly release as many documents as possible generated during the Mueller investigation. The Justice Department released a new batch of documents today: hundreds of pages of summaries of FBI interviews. Some highlights from the new documents, according to Buzzfeed News: In February 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump wanted former New Jersey governor Chris Christie to tell then-FBI director James Comey that \u201cI really like him.\u201d Christie did not do this, he told FBI investigators, saying it \u201cwould have been uncomfortable.\u201d On Valentine\u2019s Day 2017, Christie was having lunch with Trump when the president told him, \u201cNow that we fired [former Trump national security adviser Michael] Flynn, the Russia thing is over.\u201d Christie told the FBI that he laughed and said \u201cNo way. We\u2019ll be here on Valentine\u2019s Day 2018 talking about this.\u201d Deputy campaign manager Rick Gates told the FBI that \u201cwhile Paul Manafort was running Trump\u2019s campaign, Manafort had pushed the unfounded theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that had hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers.\u201d Trump still cites this debunked theory, as Buzzfeed notes\u2014 and did so during the summer 2019 call with the Ukrainian President that\u2019s at the center of the current impeachment inquiry. Donald Trump\u2019s actions towards Ukraine were \u201centirely prudent\u201d and involved \u201cno quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, or abuse of power\u201d, according to a draft Republican report on last month\u2019s impeachment inquiry hearings. The report provides a blueprint for House Republicans to defend the US president at Wednesday\u2019s judiciary committee hearing and for their Senate counterparts to acquit him in a trial. It also directly contradicts the testimony of career diplomats and makes little attempt to get to grips with the devastating evidence of Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, who spoke about the existence of a quid pro quo, or Fiona Hill, former top Russia expert at the White House, who warned against falling for Moscow\u2019s propaganda about Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election. Earlier today, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign announced it will no longer issue press credentials to reporters for Bloomberg News, the agency owned by billionaire Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg, after it announced a controversial plan for how it would continue to cover American politics while its owner was running for president. Trump added his own aggrieved tweet on the situation this afternoon, shortly after arriving in the United Kingdom for a NATO meeting. He complained that \u201cMini Mike Bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization not to investigate him or any Democrat, but to go after President Trump, only\u201d and that this was \u201cnot O.K.!\u201d While generally hostile to the existence of an independent press, Trump is not alone in his opinion that Bloomberg News\u2019 currently approach to managing a massive conflict of interest is \u201cnot O.K.\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019 editor-in-chief announced in late November that the agency\u2019s reporters would still cover polls, policies and how the Bloomberg campaign is faring. But Bloomberg News\u2019 reporters would not do investigative stories on Bloomberg or any other Democratic contender for president, he told the agency\u2019s journalists, while still recapping others\u2019 investigations of Democratic contenders and continuing to investigate the Trump administration. Multiple former Bloomberg editors called the coverage plan unsatisfying and inappropriate. Margaret Sullivan, a prominent Washington Post media columnist and the former public editor of The New York Times, wrote that the initial coverage plans \u201cput Bloomberg\u2019s many talented journalists, especially those in Washington and New York, in a compromised position.\u201d Sullivan and others have argued that a better plan would have been for Bloomberg himself to have \u201centirely recused himself from decision-making or influence at the news organization \u2014 saying, in effect, \u2018cover me like anyone else and do it with journalistic integrity.\u2019\u201d But that\u2019s not what the billionaire former mayor of New York City has decided to do. Sullivan noted that Bloomberg \u201chalf-jokingly\u201d told a radio interviewer last year, \u201cQuite honestly, I don\u2019t want all the reporters I\u2019m paying to write a bad story about me. I don\u2019t want them to be independent.\u201d For Sullivan, Bloomberg\u2019s approach highlighted a similarity between the new 2020 Democratic contender and Trump: \u201cWe already have a rich-guy president who thinks the tried-and-true rules that underpin our democracy aren\u2019t made for him and who doesn\u2019t exhibit a core understanding of the accountability role of an independent press,\u201d she wrote. A month after dropping out of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, and after pledging he would not run for senate as a challenger to Texas Republican John Cornyn, Beto O\u2019Rourke is focusing on state-level politics in Texas, the Houston Chronicle reports. O\u2019Rourke is trying to use some of his political capital to help flip the Texas House of Representatives from Republican to Democratic control. As House Democrats push forward with their impeachment inquiry, House Republicans have released a 123-page report defending President Donald Trump. Washington journalists called the GOP report a \u201cpre-buttal to the Democrats\u2019 not-yet-drafted articles of impeachment\u201d and a \u201cfull-throated defense\u201d of the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. You can read the report here. U.S. District Judge Kentanji Brown Jackson has denied the Trump administration\u2019s request to stay an order requiring former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before Congress while the administration appeals Jackson\u2019s ruling to a higher court. \u201cFurther delay of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s enforcement of its valid subpoena causes grave harm to both the Committee\u2019s investigation and the interests of the public more broadly,\u201d Jackson wrote, noting also that delaying McGahn\u2019s testimony \u201cwould impede an investigation that a committee of Congress is undertaking as part of an impeachment inquiry.\u201d The judge made clear that McGahn may still invoke executive privilege and refuse to answer Congressional questions during his testimony, but had previously rejected the Trump Justice Department\u2019s argument that the president could give senior aides immunity from having to testify at all. What additional charges might Giuliani allies Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman face from federal prosecutors? A prosector said during a hearing today in Manhattan that additional charges were \u201clikely.\u201d A Florida reporter suggests these charges might involve donations Parnas and Fruman made to Republicans in Florida: Ron DeSantis, now the state\u2019s governor; Rick Scott, the former governor and now one of Florida\u2019s senators, and Brian Mast, one of the state\u2019s members of Congress. As the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine\u2019s president continues, Trump\u2019s Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that the Ukrainian government tried to meddle in the 2016 election to favor Hillary Clinton. That claim was \u201cthoroughly investigated\u201d and debunked by the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee, Politico reports. The committee \u201cfound no evidence that Ukraine waged a top-down interference campaign akin to the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to help Trump win in 2016.\u201d More from Politico here. More details from federal court in Manhattan: A prosecutor said an upgraded indictment is likely in the criminal case against two Rudy Giuliani associates with ties to Ukraine, the Associated Press reports. Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Zolkind made the prediction during a pretrial hearing Monday in the case against Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. The men are charged with using foreign money to make illegal campaign contributions. Prosecutors say the donations were made while the men were lobbying U.S. politicians to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. The arrest of Parnas and Fruman brought new scrutiny to Giuliani, a former New York City mayor who is President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. Giuliani has tried to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump\u2019s potential Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. Giuliani has said he knew nothing about illegal campaign donations. The Trump administration has quietly released more than $100 million in military assistance to Lebanon after months of unexplained delay, the Associated Press reports. The White House has yet to offer any explanation for the delay, despite repeated queries from Congress. Officials familiar with the matter told the Associated Press that, unlike Ukraine, there has been no suggestion that President Donald Trump is seeking \u201ca favor\u201d from Lebanon in exchange for the aid. Democrats have released a list of witnesses for Wednesday\u2019s hearing to review the evidence for impeaching the president, The Hill\u2019s Olivia Beavers reports: Georgia\u2019s Republican governor is ignoring Donald Trump\u2019s preference and appointing a financial services executive, Kelly Loeffler, to fill the senate seat left vacant when Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson retires for health reasons at the end of the year, according to news reports. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which broke the story, has more background on Loeffler, a multimillionaire with a history of donating to Democratic politicians. Loeffler, the female CEO of a bitcoin business, is not beloved by more conservative Republican politicians in Georgia. But political analysts in the state see her as potentially \u201cable to bring back suburban women who have left the Republican Party during the Trump administration,\u201d the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Her personal wealth is also seen as a useful asset in funding the special election campaign to fill Isakson\u2019s seat over the longer term. In her application for the open senate job, Loeffler wrote that she would be a staunch ally of Trump, something conservatives have said they doubt. \u201cIf chosen, I will stand with President Trump...to Keep America Great,\u201d Loeffler wrote, according to Politico. \u201cTogether, we will grow jobs, strengthen the border, shutdown drug cartels and human traffickers, lower health care costs, and protect our national interests \u2014 at home and abroad.\u201d Trump wanted Georgia\u2019s Republican governor to appoint Rep. Doug Collins, who is currently the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, who \u201ccould have been a potentially critical juror in any Senate impeachment trial,\u201d Politico reported. Isakson, 74, has been struggling with Parkinson\u2019s disease. At a court hearing in Manhattan, a federal prosecutor said there will \u201clikely\u201d be additional charges in the case against two associates of Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Bloomberg News reports. The two men pleaded not guilty in October to charges that they used foreign money to make illegal campaign contributions to politicians and committees to advance their business interests. This is Lois Beckett, taking over our live politics coverage from our West Coast bureau. California Gov. Gavin Newsom will travel to Iowa to campaign for Sen. Kamala Harris in mid-December as she tries to rebound amid a critical stretch in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, the Associated Press reports. Harris has staked her campaign on a strong showing in Iowa and recently spent six days over the Thanksgiving holiday campaigning in the state. But she\u2019s still stuck in single digits in most polls, far from the top of the pack that includes former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. More from Free, Melania, of which the Guardian has obtained a copy. CNN reporter Kate Bennett wrote that the first lady suspected Trump ally and adviser, Roger Stone, was responsible for the release of nude photos from her modelling past during the 2016 presidential campaign: Melania has not commented on how she thinks they got into the hands of the tabloid and on to the cover, but friends say she still refuses to believe Trump would do that to her. As for Stone, she\u2019s not so sure. The White House did not respond directly to the allegation, but said the book includes \u201cmany false details and opinions.\u201d Roger Stone\u2019s wife, Nydia, told the Guardian via text that the allegation was \u201ccategorically false and completely illogical.\u201d Roger Stone is awaiting sentencing after being found guilty of obstructing the Mueller investigation. An unauthorized biography of the first lady, Free, Melania, is being released this week, authored by CNN reporter Kate Bennett. Per CNN, takeaways from the book include: Melania Trump has \u201cfrequent, opinionated discussions\u201d with the president, oftentimes more than once a day, via telephone, about policy. The first couple doesn\u2019t share a bedroom. Melania Trump investigated dog breeds and the what types of care a presidential pup would need, but the family ultimately decided not to get a pet \u2013 the first White House family to not have one for the past three decades of first families. California representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican, will plead guilty to campaign finance violations in federal court tomorrow, reversing his previous not guilty position. His wife, Margaret Hunter, has already plead guilty in the case, which included her admission in a plea agreement that the family spent $500 in campaign funds to fly the family\u2019s pet rabbit, Eggburt, across the country. The couple is alleged to hae spent more than $200,000 in campaign donations on family expenses such as vacations and groceries, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Ahead of Trump\u2019s visit to the UK, five political party leaders in the country expressed concern about prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s relationship with the US president in a television debate last night. \u201cWe obviously have a hugely important relationship with the US.\u201d said Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader. \u201cBut make no mistake, the current occupant of the White House is not somebody who shares our values.\u201d Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit party, was the only of seven candidates to defend the president, describing Trump as \u201cour most important friend in the world.\u201d The representative for the Conservative party, Rishi Sunak, tried to stay out of the fray. Meanwhile, 350 leading climate researchers urged Johnson to challenge Trump on his \u201cdangerous\u201d denial of the risks of climate change in a letter tied to the US president\u2019s visit. And the Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, urged the prime minister to break off trade talks with Trump until any reference to pharmaceuticals is struck off the US list of objectives. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump\u2019s reelection campaign announced it would no longer credential Bloomberg News reporters after the outlet said it would not investigate its owner, Michael Bloomberg, or any other Democratic presidential candidate. The president is headed to London for the Nato summit as the House intelligence committee prepares to review its report on the impeachment inquiry. Trump said in a tweet that his administration would restore steel and aluminum tariffs on Brazil and Argentina, despite the efforts of Brazil\u2019s far-right president to develop an alliance with Trump. Lisa Page, the former FBI lawyer whose anti-Trump texts with former FBI agent Peter Strzok intensified the president\u2019s accusations of a \u201cdeep state\u201d biased against him, spoke out for the first time in a Daily Beast interview. Page said she decided to do the interview because she wanted to \u201ctake my power back.\u201d My colleague Amanda Holpuch will steer the blog for the next few hours, so stay tuned for more updates from her. Bloomberg News justified its decision to continue investigating Trump, even as it abandoned investigating Democratic presidential candidates, by arguing that the outlet must scrutinize the current government, which the sitting president leads. However, that argument sparked some pushback from media commentators, who warned of a double standard in Bloomberg\u2019s political coverage. Senator Ted Cruz came to Trump\u2019s defense after the president\u2019s reelection campaign announced it would no longer credential Bloomberg News reporters for rallies or other events. The Texas Republican claimed the outlet\u2019s new policy of not investigating Michael Bloomberg or other Democratic presidential candidates as it continues to cover Trump in the same manner equated to conducting opposition research against Republicans. Bloomberg News\u2019 editor-in-chief has pushed back against the Trump campaign\u2019s claim that the outlet\u2019s editors have \u201cdeclared their bias openly\u201d by saying reporters would not investigate Michael Bloomberg or any other Democratic presidential candidate. The Trump campaign\u2019s announcement sparked questions about covering the president\u2019s rallies, given that Bloomberg is one of three outlets that consistently travel to the events. Shortly after Michael Bloomberg announced he would seek the Democratic presidential nomination, the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News sent a memo to staff outlining how the outlet would cover its owner. \u201cSo Mike is running,\u201d John Micklethwait wrote in the memo. \u201cThere is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy for a newsroom that has built up its reputation for independence in part by not writing about ourselves (and very rarely about our direct competitors). No previous presidential candidate has owned a journalistic organization of this size.\u201d Micklethwait said Bloomberg would suspend its editorial board but would strive to report on the billionaire\u2019s campaign as it did everyone else\u2019s. \u201cWe will describe who is winning and who is losing,\u201d Micklethwait said. \u201cWe will look at policies and their consequences. We will carry polls, we will interview candidates and we will track their campaigns, including Mike\u2019s.\u201d But the announcement that Bloomberg News would not investigate its owner or any other Democratic presidential candidate sparked outrage from some media commentators -- and now from Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign has just released a statement saying it will no longer issue credentials to Bloomberg News reporters for rallies or other events after the outlet announced it would not investigate Michael Bloomberg or other Democratic presidential candidates in light of the billionaire\u2019s campaign launch. \u201cBloomberg News has declared that they won\u2019t investigate their boss or his Democrat competitors, many of whom are current holders of high office, but will continue critical reporting on President Trump,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale said in the statement. \u201cSince they have declared their bias openly, the Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events. We will determine whether to engage with individual reporters or answer inquiries from Bloomberg News on a case-by-case basis. This will remain the policy of the Trump campaign until Bloomberg News publicly rescinds its decision.\u201d Trump, who is en route to London for the Nato summit, is tweeting from Air Force One and applauding senator John Kennedy, who once again peddled a baseless conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election while appearing on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d yesterday. \u201cThank you to Great Republican @SenJohnKennedy for the job he did in representing both the Republican Party and myself against Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd on Meet the Depressed!\u201d Trump tweeted. Kennedy told host Chuck Todd yesterday, \u201cI think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.\u201d However, the US intelligence community has only concluded that Russia did so, and intelligence officials have reportedly briefed senators about the Kremlin trying to frame Ukraine for the election meddling. During a public impeachment hearing earlier this month, Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s former top expert on Russia, said the baseless accusation against Ukraine was \u201ca fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t briefed,\u201d Kennedy told Todd yesterday. \u201cDr. Hill is entitled to her opinion.\u201d Pete Buttigieg has released his first statewide television ad in South Carolina, which will start to air in the early voting state tomorrow as the Democratic presidential candidate makes his seventh trip there. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign is spending $2 million on the TV ad buy as the Indiana mayor struggles to win over voters in South Carolina. A recent poll showed Buttigieg hitting 6% in the state, but he attracted almost 0% of the support of African Americans, who made up more than half of the state\u2019s 2016 primary electorate. The video itself takes excerpts from Buttigieg\u2019s speech at the Liberty and Justice Dinner in Des Moines last month. \u201cIn our White House, you won\u2019t have to shake your head and ask yourself, \u2018Whatever happened to, \u2018I was hungry and you fed me. I was a stranger and you welcomed me?\u2019\u201d Buttigieg says in the ad. \u201cWhen I say we\u2019ve got to unify the American people it doesn\u2019t mean pretending that we\u2019re all the same. It means unifying around issues from wages and family leave to gun violence and immigration. The hope of an American experience defined not by exclusion but by belonging.\u201d Lisa Page, the former FBI lawyer whose anti-Trump text messages have been used by the president to claim the existence of a \u201cdeep state\u201d within the federal government, has spoken out for the first time in a Daily Beast interview. \u201cI had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away, but instead it got worse,\u201d Page said. \u201cIt had been so hard not to defend myself, to let people who hate me control the narrative. I decided to take my power back.\u201d The president has repeatedly mocked Page and Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who had an extramarital affair with her, and pointed to their critical messages as proof that the bureau was biased against Trump. However, the justice department\u2019s inspector general has reportedly concluded that Page did not conduct herself unprofessionally while working on the bureau\u2019s Russia investigation. \u201cWhile it would be nice to have the IG confirm publicly that my personal opinions had absolutely no bearing on the course of the Russia investigations, I don\u2019t kid myself that the fact will matter very much for a lot of people,\u201d Page said. \u201cThe president has a very loud megaphone.\u201d Speaking to reporters before he left for London, Trump falsely claimed the Ukrainian president had cleared him of wrongdoing in a recent interview with Time magazine. \u201cThe Ukrainian president came out and said very strongly that President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong. That should be case over,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cBut it will never end it because [Democrats] want to do what they want to do.\u201d In reality, Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticized Trump for holding up Ukraine\u2019s military assistance and said that the US president had harmed his country\u2019s economic propsects by calling it corrupt. \u201cLook, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That\u2019s not my thing,\u201d Zelenskiy told Time magazine. \u201cBut you have to understand. We\u2019re at war. If you\u2019re our strategic partner, then you can\u2019t go blocking anything for us. I think that\u2019s just about fairness. It\u2019s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.\u201d Zelenskiy added that Trump\u2019s claims of corruption in Ukraine could spook companies with capital in the country. \u201cThe United States of America is a signal, for the world, for everyone,\u201d the Ukrainian president said. \u201cWhen America says, for instance, that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that is the hardest of signals.\u201d Trump briefly took questions from reporters before flying to London for the Nato summit, and the president said the Hong Kong bill he just signed could complicate efforts to secure a trade deal with China. Trump signed the bill on Wednesday after much speculation about whether or not he would put his name to it. But the president didn\u2019t have much choice because the legislation, which signaled support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and authorized sanctions against officials trying to suppress the demonstrations, passed both chambers of Congress with veto-proof majorities. In addition to tweeting complaints about the impeachment inquiry, Trump was also taking care of some trade business this morning -- restoring tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina. The president blamed the two countries\u2019 depreciating currencies for harming the prospects of US steel and once again urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The announcement marks a defeat for Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s right-wing president who appeared to have developed an alliance with Trump. But their shared conservative beliefs were apparently not enough to protect Brazil from these tariffs. The White House announced last night that Trump would not send a lawyer to represent him at the House judiciary committee\u2019s first impeachment hearing, which will take place Wednesday and focus on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. \u201cWe cannot fairly be expected to participate in a hearing while the witnesses are yet to be named and while it remains unclear whether the Judiciary Committee will afford the President a fair process through additional hearings,\u201d White House counsel Pat Cipollone said in a letter to committee chairman Jerry Nadler. \u201cMore importantly, an invitation to an academic discussion with law professors does not begin to provide the President with an semblance of a fair process. Accordingly, under the current circumstances, we do not intend to participate in your Wednesday hearing.\u201d The House intelligence committee is expected to transmit its report on the impeachment inquiry to the judiciary committee tomorrow, after the panel holds a vote on approving its findings. The timeline keeps the House on track to hold a vote on impeaching Trump by the end of the year, followed by a Senate trial in January. Senate Republicans and the White House have reportedly discussed keeping the trial to two weeks, which means Trump would likely be acquitted before Democrats kick off their presidential primary in February. Nearly everyone in Washington is betting that Trump will be impeached by the Democratic-controlled House before being acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate. Even if Republicans didn\u2019t control the Senate, it would take a two-thirds majority to remove Trump from office, which seems highly unlikely. Like the president, House speaker Nancy Pelosi is abroad this week, attending the UN climate change conference in Madrid as Trump participates in the Nato summit in London. Pelosi is leading a delegation of 14 other Democrats to the 2019 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. \u201cIt is a privilege to accompany a high-level Congressional delegation to Spain to combat the existential threat of our time: the climate crisis,\u201d Pelosi said in a Saturday statement announcing the trip. During a news conference this morning, the House speaker specified that she would not discuss the impeachment inquiry while she was abroad. The field of candidates chasing the Democratic presidential nomination has (slightly) narrowed with the withdrawals of Montana governor Steve Bullock and former Pennsylvania caongressman Joe Sestak. Neither Bullock nor Sestak were major players in the race, attracting nearly no support in polls and consistently failing to qualify for debates. (Bullock participated in one debate back in July, and Sestak never managed to qualify.) Bullock argued he could capture Democrats\u2019 attention without partcipating in the debates by touting his repeated victories in a state Trump safely carried in 2016, but the Montana governor failed to break through as the presidential field has remained crowded. \u201cWhile there were many obstacles we could not have anticipated when entering this race, it has become clear that in this moment, I won\u2019t be able to break through to the top tier of this still-crowded field of candidates,\u201d Bullock said in a statement announcing his decision. Even with the withdrawals of Bullock and Sestak, 16 candidates remain in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, with just two months left until the Iowa caucuses. Good morning, live blog readers! It will be a busy (and nerve-wracking) week for Donald Trump as the president heads to London for a Nato summit and awaits the release of the House intelligence committee\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry. Members of the intelligence committee are expected to receive a draft of the report today and will have 24 hours to review it, with a vote on approving the findings likely to take place tomorrow. This will leave enough time for the report to be transmitted to the House judiciary committee before the panel holds its first public impeachment hearing on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Trump will be in London to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Nato, an alliance whose value he has repeatedly questioned. But if history is any indication, the president can be expected to weigh in on the progress of the impeachment inquiry by tweeting from the other side of the pond. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping an eye on today: Trump will depart the White House for London at 9:45 a.m. ET. A status conference will be held for Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Rudy Giuliani\u2019s former associates who are facing federal campaign-finance charges. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren will campaign in Iowa, with the state\u2019s caucuses now two months away. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, has defended awarding a $2.2m contract without a tender process to an organisation linked to the former Liberal candidate Bill Glasson. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday revealed an internal complaint was made about the process that awarded the contract to the Indigenous and Remote Eye Health Service (IRIS) for the delivery of ophthalmology services in remote areas at twice the market rate. It came after a former chief of staff to Wyatt, Kate Johnson, went public with allegations that the minister fostered \u201ca culture of bullying in his office\u201d, which became the subject of a Department of Finance investigation. Glasson, who ran as the Liberal candidate against Kevin Rudd at the 2013 election, was a director of IRIS between 2016 and 2019, along with lobbyist Kerry Gallagher. The holding company of IRIS is called Vanguard Consulting. Vanguard Health has donated at least $21,000 to the Liberal National party of Queensland since 2009. In a statement on Tuesday, a spokesman for Wyatt said the contract to Vanguard was awarded \u201cfollowing advice provided by the Health Department\u201d on 1 August 2018. Initial briefs were signed by Wyatt on 9 August, and the health minister, Greg Hunt, on 15 August. The contract was approved on 24 August. \u201cThe Australian Society of Ophthalmologists \u2013 through Vanguard Health \u2013 was provided funding from the previous Labor federal government in 2010/11, to plan and develop a four-year plan for eye services (IRIS 1.0),\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cThe IRIS proposal was assessed by the Indigenous Health Division, in line with the standard process for unsolicited proposals under the Indigenous Australians\u2019 Health program, and was assessed as suitable for the funding on the basis it would meet the unmet need for cataract surgery. \u201cGiven the pending delivery of the \u2018roadmap\u2019 for Indigenous Eye Health and relative value for money considerations, the department recommended the IRIS initiative be funded as a two-year trial, with an independent evaluation in the second half of year two to assess effectiveness and efficiency.\u201d The spokesman said that the department\u2019s advice was that \u201cthe initiative would deliver 500 eye procedures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the two years\u201d. To date, more than 300 remote operations have been carried out. According to the Herald\u2019s report, a staff member in Wyatt\u2019s office complained that \u201cthe company [Vanguard] has party connections\u201d and they \u201ccontacted every man and their dog\u201d over the contract. The staff member, who has asked to remain anonymous, told the Department of Finance that that \u201cjust because you\u2019re connected to the party doesn\u2019t mean you get written a blank cheque\u201d. Labor\u2019s assistant minister for Treasury, Andrew Leigh, said the issue was a \u201cmatter of scrutiny\u201d for the Morrison government. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s a matter of scrutiny \u2013 whether that\u2019s scrutiny for the big banks, scrutiny for George Christensen, scrutiny for Ken Wyatt \u2013 they pull the covers over,\u201d Leigh said on Tuesday. \u201cThey say there\u2019s nothing thing to see here. A doona is the best metaphor for the Morrison government that anyone can come up. They\u2019re either asleep or pulling the covers over.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will seek to downplay his relationship with president Donald Trump at this week\u2019s Nato meeting, amid Labour\u2019s accusations that a US-UK trade deal will lead to an NHS sell-off and higher drug prices for Britons. As the US president landed at London Stansted just before 10pm on Monday and disembarked with his wife, Melania, Conservative strategists were hoping Trump would not add fuel to accusations that the US will seek to profit from the NHS as the price for any trade deal. Johnson has made clear that he would not welcome any input from Trump into the election debate at such a sensitive time in the campaign, after the US president offered him his endorsement over the summer. There is nervousness within the Conservative campaign about Trump\u2019s unpredictability, as he has a full two days in the UK and is expected to give a press conference on Wednesday. Johnson said last week that \u201cclose friends and allies\u201d like the UK and the US should not get involved in each other elections. As Trump landed on Monday night, Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the US president demanding assurances that any trade deal would exclude any reference to pharmaceuticals and accept the role of the UK\u2019s drugs watchdog in setting the threshold for the cost-effectiveness of drugs for the NHS. He also requested that the US drop the demand for \u201ctotal market access\u201d to UK public services and rule out any investor-state dispute settlement mechanism by which the UK government could be sued for protecting public services. Corbyn also wrote to the prime minister, urging him to break off trade talks with Trump until any reference to pharmaceuticals is struck out of Washington\u2019s negotiating objectives. The Labour leader has repeatedly accused Johnson of preparing to sell off the NHS, and Labour activists at recent rallies have taken up a chorus of \u201cNot for sale! Not for sale!\u201d Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, also highlighted Trump\u2019s previous claims that foreign \u201cfreeloaders\u201d are paying too low a price for US medicines and instructions to his chief trade negotiator to make drug prices a \u201ctop priority\u201d in any talks with trade partners. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, accused the opposition of scaremongering, denying the NHS would be up for sale. \u201cOnce again, Jeremy Corbyn is desperately trying to whip up absurd scare stories about our NHS to distract from his confused position on Brexit and plans for two referendums,\u201d he said. Johnson is yet to have fixed a bilateral meeting with Trump in his diary but he may still meet the US president one-to-one on Wednesday. On Tuesday, he will host a reception in Downing Street for the Nato leaders and attend a separate event at Buckingham Palace, where Corbyn will also be present. The Nato meeting is expected to be dominated by tensions within the alliance over the conflict in Syria and Turkey\u2019s incursion into Kurdish-held areas. The leaders\u2019 meeting, hosted by Johnson just outside Watford, was called to mark the alliance\u2019s 70th anniversary. However, the celebrations are likely to be overshadowed by French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s accusation that Nato was \u201cbrain dead\u201d for failing to stop Turkey\u2019s attack on Kurds. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the Turkish president, accused Macron of having \u201ca sick and shallow understanding\u201d of terrorism, suggesting he was the one who was \u201cbrain dead\u201d. Johnson will host the two leaders, together with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for talks in Downing Street on Tuesday ahead of the main gathering on Wednesday, when the 29 world leaders are expected to give speeches and discuss Nato missions, member states\u2019 spending and Nato\u2019s role in responding to threats around the world. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThe PM\u2019s position is that Nato is the most enduring and successful alliance in military history and that it continues to adapt to the evolving threats that we face. \u201cIt is the cornerstone of Euro-Atlantic security and it helps to keep a billion people safe. The PM will emphasise that all members must be united behind shared priorities so Nato can adapt to the challenges ahead.\u201d",

The award was presented to her by Tyler, the Creator and by Janet Jackson, who told her: \u201cYou are loved for your style.\u201d Rihanna thanked the British Fashion Council and her collaborators. She was previously nominated for her Fenty x Puma collaboration in 2017. The model Naomi Campbell also collected a prize \u2013 the Fashion Icon award. In her extensive acceptance speech, a tearful Campbell called the honour a \u201cdeeply humbling experience\u201d. She thanked fellow models Linda Evangelista, Kate Moss and Christy Turlington \u2013 her \u201csisters for life\u201d \u2013 as well as Gianni Versace, the late fashion designer. Campbell said she was the \u201cfirst woman of colour to receive this award\u201d before thanking women who she said had come before her, including Janet Jackson, Tina Turner, Iman, Bethann Hardison and Eartha Kitt. As a campaigner for inclusivity in fashion and one of the founders of the Diversity Coalition, Campbell called for \u201cdiversity in the workplace and in everything we do.\u201d The Fashion Awards honoured the British designer Daniel Lee, the man responsible for revitalising Bottega Veneta since July 2018. He picked up four awards: British designer of the year womenswear, designer of the year, accessories designer of the year and brand of the year. Adut Akech won model of the year and Giorgio Armani picked up the outstanding achievement award, which was presented to him by Julia Roberts and Cate Blanchett, who said he revolutionised dressing on the red carpet. The collective signatories of the fashion industry charter for climate change (which included Stella McCartney, Burberry and Nike) won the positive change award, for individuals and fashion brands who are making concerted efforts to be more sustainable. Earlier this year, an agreement in Paris signed by many of the top fashion houses agreed to net zero emissions by 2050. \u201cWe need leaders from prominent and influential industries like fashion to step up in a big way, and we hope this initiative will give a push in the right direction,\u201d Robert Skinner, executive director of the UN Office for Partnerships, told the Guardian. Rihanna\u2019s victory caps off a game-changing year for the singer, which has seen her making huge strides for racial advancement within the industry. With Fenty, Barbadian Rihanna became the first black woman to head a major fashion house, in conjunction with luxury goods company LVMH (Christian Dior, Celine, Marc Jacobs). And, through its cosmetics subsidiary, Fenty Beauty (with its \u201cfoundation for all\u201d philosophy) , she helped democratise make-up, introducing more shades of foundation than had been previously been available from a cosmetic company before. Fenty Beauty has been condemned by some for not being inclusive enough, but has made strides to become more so. \u201cSome [people] are finding their shade of foundation for the first time, getting emotional at the counter,\u201d she explained to Time magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s something I will never get over.\u201d It has led to other brands like MAC, Covergirl and Maybelline dramatically increasing the number of foundations on offer. In September, the singer launched the autumn/winter line of her Savage X Fenty lingerie range, premiering it with a high-profile, guest-heavy fashion show cum musical extravaganza that streamed exclusively on Amazon Prime. Featuring a range of diverse models in all shapes and sizes (including transgender actor/model Laverne Cox and plus-size model Margie Plus) the body positive brand stood in stark contrast to Victoria\u2019s Secret, whose singular vision of beauty was seen by many as outdated and not inclusive. In an interview after the Savage X Fenty show, Rihanna said: \u201cI don\u2019t care about any skinny Victoria\u2019s Secret model \u2026 there are a lot of women out there who are feeling in the dark, invisible, [saying]: \u2018I can\u2019t try that on because I\u2019m not made like that.\u2019 This is where you feel safe, right here at Savage.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The seeds of more than 370 wild crop species have been collected as part of a six-year Indiana Jones-style mission to widen the gene pool of staple crops and ensure future global food security in increasingly unpredictable growing conditions. A hundred scientists from 25 countries travelled by horse, canoe and even elephant to reach remote corners of the world in search of wild species of common agricultural crops such as rice, barley, beans and potatoes that billions of people rely on for basic nutrition. Domesticated crops are generally selected for their high yield and nutritional value but this means they have dangerously low genetic diversity. Their wild relatives \u2013 many of which are at risk of extinction \u2013 are sturdier because they have evolved to survive more challenging conditions. Without adaptation, the climate crisis could reduce agricultural production by up to 30% by 2050, according to a report produced by the Global Commission on Adaptation. Breeders want to create new crops that look and taste like domesticated varieties but that are more resilient to drought, flooding and temperature extremes. \u201cThese wild plants are related to a wide range of important crops,\u201d said Hannes Dempewolf, a senior scientist at the Crop Trust, which ran the project in partnership with the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens\u2019 Millennium Seed Bank project. \u201cThey hold the genetic diversity which breeders will need to improve those crops so we can feed 9 billion people with nutritious food.\u201d For centuries scientists have travelled the world collecting plants \u2013 initially to grow in gardens \u2013 but increasingly they are looking to save seeds and store them in sub-zero vaults to ensure long-term survival. Collectors working on the Crop Wild Relatives (CWR) project spent a total of 2,973 days in the field and saved 4,644 seed samples from 371 crop wild relatives, according to a report published by the Crop Trust. They found seeds from 28 globally important crops, including nine species of banana, 21 of wild barley, two species of wild potato and four of wild aubergine. Researchers examined gene banks across the world and identified which had dangerously low diversity before setting out on expeditions to far-flung parts of Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. They used GPS to tag the location of their discoveries and silica gel to preserve the seeds. In one of the most treacherous expeditions, collectors in Nepal travelled on elephants to ward off tigers and rhinos. They found a species of wild rice (Oryza meyeriana) that is resistant to bacterial blight and collected a relative of the sweet potato (Ipomoea cairica) with high resistance to insect attack that can grow in salty soils. In Ecuador, collectors wore long plastic boots with metal tips to protect them from snakebites while collecting an elusive variety of high-yielding rice (Oryza grandiglumi) that is endemic to tropical America and tolerates flooding. Security concerns caused by al-Shabaab prevented collectors reaching their targets in the Lamu district of Kenya. Missions to north-eastern Nigeria were abandoned in 2015 and 2016 due to the Boko Haram insurgency but collectors were able to access the region in 2017. Dempewolf said: \u201cThe expeditions were not a walk in the park. They were perilous at times and physically demanding, with heat, dust, sweat and danger from wild animals \u2013 from blood-sucking leeches to tigers. The stories these seed collectors brought back from the field often resemble scenes from an Indiana Jones movie.\u201d Seeds are only ripe for a narrow window of time and if collectors were too early they had to visit the site again. If they were too late they had to wait until the following year. Nicola Ardenghi from the University of Pavia in Italy spotted a type of pea with edible tubers while looking out of a train window between Piacenza and Milan \u2013 his team had almost given up hope before it was found. Many of these crops are already threatened with extinction due to deforestation, urban sprawl, conflict and the climate crisis. In some cases, wild crop relatives were already lost. For example in Costa Rica, land which was once home to wild rice has been turned into sugarcane plantations and tilapia ponds. Scientists say this work is more important than ever. \u201cIf we are to feed a growing population, we need to make our food crops more resilient. And crop wild relatives can help breeders develop new \u2018climate-proof\u2019 varieties,\u201d said Marie Haga, the outgoing executive director of the Crop Trust. \u201cWe have made incredible progress tracking down crop wild relatives that could hold the key to food\u2019s survival but there is more to be done, and as threats to the world\u2019s biodiversity mount, this work is more urgent than ever. [This project] offers hope and a guide for future efforts to save and use the diversity we rely on for our food security,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s six richest people control as much wealth as the poorest 13 million, according to research into the gaping inequality in British society. Six billionaires at the top of the UK wealth league have a combined fortune of \u00a339.4bn, which, according to analysis by the Equality Trust, is roughly equal to the assets of 13.2 million Britons. The richest six are: the Indian brothers Gopichand and Srichand Hinduja, who control a conglomerate of businesses, including cars and banks, and top the table with a \u00a312.8bn fortune; Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the chairman and chief executive of the chemicals company Ineos, with \u00a39.2bn; the hedge fund manager Michael Platt, who has an estimated \u00a36.1bn; and the property developer brothers David and Simon Reuben, whose net worth is estimated at \u00a35.7bn each. The estimates are based on wealth reports produced by Forbes magazine and Credit Suisse. At the other end of the scale, the Equality Trust estimated that about 14m people in Britain live in poverty. Four million of these are said to be more than 50% below the poverty line and 1.5 million are destitute. \u201cThis report should shock anyone who cares about the state of the UK today,\u201d said Dr Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the Equality Trust. \u201cSuch a huge gap between the very rich and the vast majority of the country is dangerous. Such extreme wealth in the hands of so few people demonstrates just how broken the economic system is. \u201cBehind the numbers, the UK\u2019s extreme inequality is the story of Ferraris and food banks. Families across the country are working for their poverty and unable to promise their children a better, secure future. The rich live longer and their children get the best education, the best jobs and a leg up on the housing ladder. The UK\u2019s economy delivers billions for a few and poverty for millions. Destitution is the sad reality for millions this Christmas.\u201d Tackling inequality has become a key battle ground in the general election campaign, with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, vowing that a Labour government would go after super-rich people who exploit a \u201crigged system\u201d to benefit themselves at the expense of the many. Corbyn named five other members of \u201cthe elite\u201d he would target if he becomes prime minister: Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct; Crispin Odey, a hedge fund boss who made millions betting against the pound in the run-up to the EU referendum; Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Sun and the Times; Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, who controls a large central London property empire; and Ratcliffe.",
