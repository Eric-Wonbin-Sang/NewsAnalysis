      "bodyText": "Carol Heriot was standing in the kitchen thinking about what to cook for dinner on Tuesday afternoon when a police officer knocked on her door. \u201cHe said: \u2018Love, it\u2019s time to get out of here.\u2019 I said: \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 and he pointed up the hill and he said: \u2018You see that smoke? It\u2019s coming this way.\u2019\u201d Heriot, her partner Rodney Smith and their dog Bundy were among the 80-odd people, dogs, birds, cats and goldfish crowded into the auditorium of the Tuncurry bowling club on Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit of a menagerie at the moment and it looks a bit like Noah\u2019s ark out the back,\u201d the manager, Terry Green, told Guardian Australia earlier in the day. Some played cards, others chatted over a barbecue while the ABC\u2019s rolling coverage of the bushfires that have ripped through New South Wales in the past 24 hours played silently on a big screen in the background. Others somehow managed to sleep as volunteers busily organised the steady flow of donated mattresses into orderly rows. Located about 35km (22 miles) from Taree on the NSW mid-north coast, the twin towns of Forster-Tuncurry \u2013 sleepy, seaside places popular with retired people and summer tourists \u2013 have found themselves precariously hemmed in on many sides by the bushfire crisis. Besides the three minor (for now) fires that surround the two towns, the out-of-control Hillville Road fire, which by Tuesday night had burned through more than 21,000 hectares (52,000 acres), sits just to the north. In fact, a quick look at the rural fire service\u2019s increasingly visited Fires Near Me app shows there are, indeed, fires near here. So many in fact that in the 650km (400 miles) between Tuncurry and Brisbane it\u2019s hard to see land for all the alerts. The town is almost cut off. The Pacific Highway \u2013 the main road in from the south \u2013 has been closed, as has Failford Road to the north. The one remaining entry point \u2013 the narrow, undulating Lakes Way \u2013 is thick with smoke that hangs eerily over the Myall Lakes along which it runs. In the tiny village of Bungwahl, Joseph Schuelein was filling up jerry cans with water from the lake for his gutters. He had been told to leave, he said, but had no intention of going. \u201cThe bloke from the local fire brigade did come down and say we should think about moving, but where are we going to go?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be bad if the fire comes through, for sure, [but] our place is pretty well protected, and we\u2019ve got Dad\u2019s boat on the lake if things got really bad.\u201d A little earlier, down on the Pacific Highway, a line of trucks too large to handle the Lakes Way snaked back for a few hundred metres. \u201cI reckon I could get her around it, but those bastards up there won\u2019t let me through,\u201d one driver said. By Tuesday night, there were more than 70 fires burning across NSW. Half of them were out of control, with emergency alerts issued for nine of them. Of those nine, five were on the state\u2019s mid-north or mid coast. At least a dozen homes have been damaged or destroyed, and the rural fire service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, was at pains to warn that a southerly wind that was making its way up the coast could worsen conditions on the mid-north coast overnight. \u201cAll of those fires are going to demand a bit of attention tonight and are going to be increased and exacerbated by those southerly winds even if it is at 2am in the morning,\u201d he said. While Tuesday was marked as a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fire day for NSW, people in this part of the state have gotten used to the smoke haze that has hung over them for the last week or so. Like Heriot, most of those crowded into the bowling club on Tuesday night came from the nearby suburb of Failford, just north of Forster. Lucy and John Van Hoof were in their home at a caravan park on the edge of town when they were told to leave. For days, the smoke had been building, but by Tuesday afternoon the black and grey clouds seemed to loom unnervingly close. \u201cThere was smoke everywhere. We could see it all coming up over the hill,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here 23 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. When they told us to leave I thought: \u2018I\u2019d rather leave now than wait.\u2019 \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened. I just hope it\u2019s still there when we get back. We don\u2019t even know whether we can leave tomorrow.\u201d Another caravan park resident, Doreen Bigness, was worried about two pillows she had lost in the evacuation centre. She asked a staff member to make an announcement about them over the club\u2019s loudspeaker, then revealed that not everyone at the caravan park had left. \u201cI called my neighbour a couple of hours ago and he\u2019s still there,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought he was right behind me when I left. He\u2019s older than me and he\u2019s got problems with his breathing; he uses a machine, you know? I almost wish I didn\u2019t know, that I didn\u2019t call, but I was just being neighbourly. I just thought he must have booked into a motel.\u201d Evacuation centres like the bowling club dot the coast now. This one was set up, almost accidentally, by Lauren Whitty and some friends who run a community Facebook group. When the fires ran through to the nearby northern towns of Taree and Port Macquarie, they started using the group to see if they could organise a few donations. \u201cWe just put out a call for help and we\u2019ve had people from Sydney, Newcastle and some of the locals wanting to donate things. For a while we were like: \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t know where to send everything,\u2019\u201d she said. As the fire edged closer to them, though, they organised the evacuation centre with the bowling club and almost immediately people began trickling in. As the auditorium continued to fill, another load of air mattresses arrived from a local store and people filed in and out with more supplies. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got plenty, but they have told us to expect more people later. I don\u2019t know, to be honest, I don\u2019t know what most of these people have been through,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>A two-game end-of-year friendly series against an emerging women\u2019s football nation, months between significant competitive games. It\u2019s hard to be either overly-critical or overly-impressed by a Matildas showing that on the surface has taught us simultaneously both a lot, and very little.</p> <p>Competitive at France 2019, Chile are no easy-beats. So dual wins, while perhaps expected, still needed to be achieved. As coach Ante Milicic pointed out post-match in Sydney, the South Americans were probably the perfect opponent for this stage of the Matildas\u2019 preparations. \u201cIt\u2019s a team that\u2019s drawn recently with Brazil, a team that\u2019s got a strong footballing culture, it\u2019s actually a type of opponent that causes us problems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/12/emily-gielnik-fires-matildas-past-chile-for-second-time-in-a-week\">Emily Gielnik fires Matildas past Chile for second time in a week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cA direct style of football, a stop-start game that makes it [all about] transition. A couple of good individuals \u2013 they\u2019re the ones that we struggle, in patches, against.\u201d</p> <p>And struggle at times they did. By his own definition \u201cnervous\u201d, too prone to allowing the game to be stretched, Milicic emerged frustrated after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/sam-kerr-stars-as-matildas-celebrate-historic-week-with-defeat-of-chile\">the Sydney performance</a>, bemoaning the Matildas\u2019 inability to kill off the contest, telling journalists post-match: \u201cthe coaching staff, we don\u2019t need a final 10 minutes like that.\u201d</p> <p>And yet in the circumstances, the positives were evident. With some players appearing in their first competitive match since the July World Cup and scheduling clashes denying Young Matildas like Karly Roestbakken, Mary Fowler or Kyra Cooney-Cross a chance to appear, these were understandable performances.</p> <p>Most pleasingly, in these twin friendlies the Matildas took significant steps to addressing the two biggest concerns exposed at the France World Cup: a lack of depth at centre-back, and an over-reliance on Elise Kellond-Knight at the base of midfield.</p> <p>Despite playing only in the WNPL \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/football/matildas-coach-ante-milicic-believes-european-football-investing-in-womens-football-will-affect-australia-unless-action-is-taken/news-story/a78e9589039f12035fee8b7eb94c2512\">a level Milicic criticised midweek</a> as \u201ctoo big\u201d a gulf from the professional level required for Matildas \u2013 Jenna McCormick made her Matildas debut at centre-back, looking assured in her role, alongside both first-choice starters Clare Polkinghorne in game one, and Alanna Kennedy in game two, with Emma Checker also performing well as a late substitute.</p> <p>It was a position that caused notorious headaches in France, with Laura Alleway\u2019s pre-tournament injury leaving the Matildas with just two recognised centre-backs. On this showing the stocks, should Australia qualify for next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo, will look far healthier.</p> <p>Across the two games Milicic was also able to experiment considerably with his midfield, with the absence of first-choice defensive screen Kellond-Knight allowing new combinations to be tested.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a206554fdb52043eab0c1c5c8609bcc7e4da3b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a206554fdb52043eab0c1c5c8609bcc7e4da3b4/0_0_3000_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tameka Yallop puts in a tackle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tameka Yallop puts in a tackle on Chile forward Yanara Aedo in Adelaide.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brenton Edwards/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having tried, with mixed success, playing Emily van Egmond in a deeper role than she\u2019s used to, the performances of Aivi Luik in game one and Tameka Yallop in game two were especially pleasing \u2013 especially the latter, who under Milicic first featured as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/06/courage-the-new-hallmark-as-matildas-pose-questions-of-worlds-best\">attacking wide forward in a hyper-aggressive 4-2-4 against</a> the USA.

      "bodyText": "A two-game end-of-year friendly series against an emerging women\u2019s football nation, months between significant competitive games. It\u2019s hard to be either overly-critical or overly-impressed by a Matildas showing that on the surface has taught us simultaneously both a lot, and very little. Competitive at France 2019, Chile are no easy-beats. So dual wins, while perhaps expected, still needed to be achieved. As coach Ante Milicic pointed out post-match in Sydney, the South Americans were probably the perfect opponent for this stage of the Matildas\u2019 preparations. \u201cIt\u2019s a team that\u2019s drawn recently with Brazil, a team that\u2019s got a strong footballing culture, it\u2019s actually a type of opponent that causes us problems. \u201cA direct style of football, a stop-start game that makes it [all about] transition. A couple of good individuals \u2013 they\u2019re the ones that we struggle, in patches, against.\u201d And struggle at times they did. By his own definition \u201cnervous\u201d, too prone to allowing the game to be stretched, Milicic emerged frustrated after the Sydney performance, bemoaning the Matildas\u2019 inability to kill off the contest, telling journalists post-match: \u201cthe coaching staff, we don\u2019t need a final 10 minutes like that.\u201d And yet in the circumstances, the positives were evident. With some players appearing in their first competitive match since the July World Cup and scheduling clashes denying Young Matildas like Karly Roestbakken, Mary Fowler or Kyra Cooney-Cross a chance to appear, these were understandable performances. Most pleasingly, in these twin friendlies the Matildas took significant steps to addressing the two biggest concerns exposed at the France World Cup: a lack of depth at centre-back, and an over-reliance on Elise Kellond-Knight at the base of midfield. Despite playing only in the WNPL \u2013 a level Milicic criticised midweek as \u201ctoo big\u201d a gulf from the professional level required for Matildas \u2013 Jenna McCormick made her Matildas debut at centre-back, looking assured in her role, alongside both first-choice starters Clare Polkinghorne in game one, and Alanna Kennedy in game two, with Emma Checker also performing well as a late substitute. It was a position that caused notorious headaches in France, with Laura Alleway\u2019s pre-tournament injury leaving the Matildas with just two recognised centre-backs. On this showing the stocks, should Australia qualify for next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo, will look far healthier. Across the two games Milicic was also able to experiment considerably with his midfield, with the absence of first-choice defensive screen Kellond-Knight allowing new combinations to be tested. Having tried, with mixed success, playing Emily van Egmond in a deeper role than she\u2019s used to, the performances of Aivi Luik in game one and Tameka Yallop in game two were especially pleasing \u2013 especially the latter, who under Milicic first featured as an attacking wide forward in a hyper-aggressive 4-2-4 against the USA. Such is her footballing intelligence, the well-travelled Yallop adapted admirably to her new role, bringing her trademark physicality and aggression as well as poise. Normally after a World Cup there can be a major turnover in personnel, but Milicic and his staff were shrewd in selecting a squad for France 2019 with Tokyo 2020 also in mind. Veteran Lisa de Vanna appears the only major casualty of that campaign, although the coach is adamant she remains in selection contention. With the flying winger\u2019s absence comes an additional evolution. Rather than speedsters down both flanks, with Caitlin Foord starting nominally on the left of a front three but drifting more centrally, it allowed left full-back Steph Catley to play more aggressively, moving into the vacated space, and gave more support centrally for Sam Kerr to be fed by means other than crosses. Like that period when the Socceroos appeared to have no other avenue to goal apart from via the golden forehead of Timmy Cahill, when Kerr is in such prodigious goalscoring form \u2013 the kind that 40 goals in 41 games in 2019 suggests \u2013 the temptation is huge for the Matildas to try to run everything through the skipper. At the World Cup at times it became too predictable. In these games there were just the hints that the evolution of Foord as a playmaker could invite others such as Chloe Logarzo or Van Egmond to pick up this load from midfield. As also seen in these twin friendlies, with every competitive match it becomes more apparent that Ellie Carpenter is a jewel in this Matildas side.

It\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to have to factor in when scheduling and planning.\u201d</p> <p>It has been clear for a while that Murray has returned to the sport with greater perspective and understanding of everything he has. During his press conferences in January, he admitted that he felt like he had pushed his body too much at times. No more. From deciding to rest the day before a match for the first time in his life during the Chinese swing to inhaling chocolate biscuits on the couch, the moments of indulgence seem to reflect a slightly more relaxed Murray.</p> <p>But that does not mean that his 12 days of rest were a preview of his life after tennis: \u201cHe\u2019ll probably kill me for saying this but I always said I don\u2019t want to end up with what happened to Ivan [Lendl],\u201d said Murray. Then he laughed: \u201cIf you put that in your papers I know I\u2019ll get a message from him tomorrow. When he was playing he was in great shape and very thin. And when he stopped things went south so I need to avoid that.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Andy Murray revealed how the recent birth of his third child, Teddy Barron Murray, has led to an altered schedule, temporary weight gain and numerous adjustments in his life as he set his sights on next week\u2019s Davis Cup finals and then the Australian Open in January. The former world No 1 was speaking after a triumphant and chaotic October in which his four-week tournament run across two continents culminated in a European Open victory over Stan Wawrinka in Antwerp. A few days later Murray\u2019s wife, Kim, gave birth to their first son. As Murray took his first timid steps into parenthood in 2016 he revealed that one of his dreams was to compete long enough for his children to see him playing tennis. But as he completed his magnificent comeback last month in Belgium, his daughters had other ideas. \u201cI think they were having dinner at Wagamama\u2019s during the final,\u201d said Murray at the launch of his AMC collection with the clothing brand Castore on Tuesday. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think they were watching. They\u2019ve seen me on the tennis court on TV over the last couple of months. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ve got the patience to sit and watch a tennis match.\u201d Murray will play his final tournament of the season at the Davis Cup Finals alongside his Great Britain teammates Dan Evans, Kyle Edmund, Neal Skupski and his brother, Jamie, in the revamped format starting this year. He used the gap in the calendar as efficiently as most would. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything for 12 days, literally nothing,\u201d he said, beaming with pride. \u201cGot up to my heaviest weight in my career probably. My elbow was pretty sore afterwards so I needed to take a break because of that.\u201d \u201cIt was evenings that were the issue. When the newborn has been going to bed at seven, sleeping for a three-hour period, my wife would sleep upstairs and get a period of good sleep in before the baby would wake up. I\u2019d be on my own downstairs and chocolate biscuits and stuff. \u201cThere was Halloween and my second daughter\u2019s birthday party, then also my sister-in-law had a birthday. So there was lots of cake and junk and that, with no training, is not a good combination. I was 88.5 kilos and I\u2019m normally 84.\u201d After the Davis Cup Murray will immediately look to his next big challenge, the best of five sets at the Australian Open. The 32-year-old says he has had \u201cno issues\u201d with his hip. As in China, he is curious to see how his body holds up as it continues to readjust to the intense grind of the sport. The new arrival has meant a change in his schedule. He will go to Miami in the off-season but for no more than two weeks rather than the four weeks he previously spent toiling in the Floridian heat. Instead of travelling with his kids, as he did after the birth of his first daughter, Sophia, he will leave them at home as much as possible. \u201cI didn\u2019t particularly like trying to wake my daughter up in the middle of the day and she\u2019s completely out of it,\u201d he said of his experience after the 2017 Australian Open. \u201cSo we decided we wouldn\u2019t be doing any more long-haul trips because it\u2019s better for them. It\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to have to factor in when scheduling and planning.\u201d It has been clear for a while that Murray has returned to the sport with greater perspective and understanding of everything he has. During his press conferences in January, he admitted that he felt like he had pushed his body too much at times. No more. From deciding to rest the day before a match for the first time in his life during the Chinese swing to inhaling chocolate biscuits on the couch, the moments of indulgence seem to reflect a slightly more relaxed Murray. But that does not mean that his 12 days of rest were a preview of his life after tennis: \u201cHe\u2019ll probably kill me for saying this but I always said I don\u2019t want to end up with what happened to Ivan [Lendl],\u201d said Murray. Then he laughed: \u201cIf you put that in your papers I know I\u2019ll get a message from him tomorrow. When he was playing he was in great shape and very thin. And when he stopped things went south so I need to avoid that.\u201d",

That ended in April, when the NHS\u2019s budget rose by 3.4% after Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/15/why-is-theresa-may-expected-to-increase-nhs-funding-by-6bn-a-year\">pledge last year</a> to give the service an extra \u00a320.5bn by 2023-24.</p> <p>The NHS has emerged as the main domestic issue of the election campaign so far, mainly because Labour has consistently claimed that a post-Brexit US trade deal would allow the NHS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/03/labour-promises-remove-privatisation-nhs-mcdonnell-trump\">to be put \u201cup for sale\u201d</a> to US healthcare firms and its drugs bill to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/01/nhs-drugs-bill-could-soar-if-johnson-signs-trump-trade-deal-report\">soar from \u00a318bn to \u00a345bn</a>, which the government denies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/07/what-claims-from-the-uk-general-election-should-we-fact-check\">What claims from the UK general election should we factcheck?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The \u00a326bn would come from reversing cuts in corporation tax and raising taxes for the wealthy.

That is, they also include specific sums for capital spending (which funds repairs, building new NHS premises and buying new equipment such as scanners), public health and moves to boost the service\u2019s workforce, such as by bringing back bursaries for student nurses. However, they would be paid for out of the chunk of the DHSC\u2019s budget which does not go to the NHS, not the \u00a326bn. Labour would apply the 4.3% rise to the whole DHSC budget.</p> <p>In contrast, the Tories have so far only set out by how much the NHS\u2019s budget would rise, not the DHSC\u2019s. And while they have announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/boris-johnson-makes-13bn-hospital-pledge-as-tory-party-conference-looms\">\u00a32.7bn to build six new hospitals</a>, they have not yet said how much they will put into capital, public health or workforce training by 2023-24.</p> <h2><strong>Verdict</strong></h2> <p>It is unclear that if even increasing health spending by this much will be enough to deliver all the improvements Labour is seeking. But their \u201c\u00a326bn more for the NHS\u201d offer is \u201cmore generous\u201d than the Conservative one because their plans are more wide-ranging, the independent thinktank the King\u2019s Fund says. </p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Claim Labour has pledged to put an extra \u00a326bn \u2013 over and above inflation \u2013 into the NHS in England by 2023-24 if it forms the next government. The party claims its plans for the NHS would deliver the \u201cworld-class health service we all need\u201d. Background NHS funding has been a key political battleground since 2010, when the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition limited the NHS to annual rises of just over 1%, far below the 3.7% increases it received on average between its creation in 1948 and 2010. That ended in April, when the NHS\u2019s budget rose by 3.4% after Theresa May\u2019s pledge last year to give the service an extra \u00a320.5bn by 2023-24. The NHS has emerged as the main domestic issue of the election campaign so far, mainly because Labour has consistently claimed that a post-Brexit US trade deal would allow the NHS to be put \u201cup for sale\u201d to US healthcare firms and its drugs bill to soar from \u00a318bn to \u00a345bn, which the government denies. The \u00a326bn would come from reversing cuts in corporation tax and raising taxes for the wealthy. It would see NHS England\u2019s budget rising to \u00a3154.9bn by 2023-24 and the income of the Department of Health and Social Care \u2013 which gives the NHS its money \u2013 reach \u00a3178bn in that year. Crucially, Labour would give the NHS about \u00a35.5bn a year more by 2023-24 than the Conservatives, because it is pledging to increase its budget by 4.3% compared with the 3.4% planned by the Tories. Reality Labour\u2019s NHS plans are more comprehensive than those set out so far by the government. That is, they also include specific sums for capital spending (which funds repairs, building new NHS premises and buying new equipment such as scanners), public health and moves to boost the service\u2019s workforce, such as by bringing back bursaries for student nurses. However, they would be paid for out of the chunk of the DHSC\u2019s budget which does not go to the NHS, not the \u00a326bn. Labour would apply the 4.3% rise to the whole DHSC budget. In contrast, the Tories have so far only set out by how much the NHS\u2019s budget would rise, not the DHSC\u2019s. And while they have announced \u00a32.7bn to build six new hospitals, they have not yet said how much they will put into capital, public health or workforce training by 2023-24. Verdict It is unclear that if even increasing health spending by this much will be enough to deliver all the improvements Labour is seeking. But their \u201c\u00a326bn more for the NHS\u201d offer is \u201cmore generous\u201d than the Conservative one because their plans are more wide-ranging, the independent thinktank the King\u2019s Fund says.",

And, of course, poses the wider question of how society views female sexuality versus men\u2019s as they move through life, and how brutal it can be. There is something for everyone here, my friends.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/10/gold-digger-marnie-dickens-older-women-sex-bbc-drama\">Gold Digger: the shocking drama busting taboos about older women and sex</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Julia Day (Julia Ormond, and please, while we\u2019re here, why don\u2019t we see more of Ormond? She is so good everywhere and brilliantly believable in this) falls into conversation with Benjamin (Ben Barnes) during a visit to the British Museum after a planned 60th birthday celebration that all three of her children failed to attend. Her husband, Tom (Alex Jennings), ran off with her best friend, Marsha (Nikki Amuka-Bird), a while ago and she is altogether at a low ebb. She and Benjamin get chatting, he asks her to go for a drink, an affair begins that evolves into a relationship and, a year later, a wedding is being prepared.</p> <p>Well? What would you have done? Been secretly flattered, laughed it off, but gone about the rest of your day with a lighter step? Been instantly defensive and sent him away with a flea in his young ear? Or confidently accepted it as your due? Whatever the answer, you are unlikely not to be hooked for the rest of the series. There is nothing more compelling than dramas in which every scene delivers the story and a new Rorschach test at the same time.</p> <p>And if you were one of her three children presented with him at dinner a few short months later, how would you react?</p> <p>Her sons Patrick (Sebastian Armesto) and Leo (Archie Renaux) are instantly appalled, and suspicious of his motives. Their mother is a rich woman and Benjamin is a copywriter who, in all fairness to the boys, appears to do very little copywriting. And they do love and want to protect her; they have all but stopped speaking to their father after his betrayal and Patrick especially understands how much she has been hurt. This is also partly why he is manfully trying to resist having an affair with a colleague while his newborn baby is turning his life upside down at home.</p> <p>Julia\u2019s daughter Della (Jemima Rooper) is relatively sanguine about the relationship, noting that her mother seems happy for the first time since Tom left (and possibly reasoning that if cashing in a few ISAs was the price of being with a thirtysomething with Benjamin\u2019s lean muscle/body fat percentage it is money well spent \u2013 though I may be projecting. But that is half the fun of watching any drama in which sexual politics swirl so potently).</p> <p>Benjamin appears almost to revel in the family\u2019s discomfort. Whether this means he is truly the wrong \u2019un they fear him to be, only the next five weeks will make clear. The first scenes in this opening episode are of a distraught Julia muddying her wedding dress as she runs for her car before driving off in haste. But surely the obvious inference is too obvious, no? Then we must factor in the chances of a drama having been written and commissioned that ends in the humiliation of an older woman by a younger lover, instead of fighting the good fight for a cultural shift that no longer pushes anyone over the age of 35 out of the sexual (televisual) arena.</p> <p>However, Gold Digger works beautifully as a soapy drama that promises to be full of twists and turns but emotional and psychological substance too. Jennings surely has much more to show us with Tom (otherwise, y\u2019know, you don\u2019t get Jennings) and Ormond grounds the whole thing in truth. If it turns out that their relationship is real and Benjamin on the side of the angels, it will work. If the rippling ambiguities send things another way, that will be wholly earned too.</p> <p>I would give myself up to it body and soul if I could just stop worrying about the stress it must have caused the casting directors. It\u2019s bad enough when you just have to find and pair actors viewers will believe are having sex without age gaps, possibly nefarious intentions and assorted other curveballs being lobbed in. But you did brilliantly. We all look forward to next week and many chats round the water cooler before then.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As someone who lived through this seminal moment in human history, I can confidently state that the simplicity to febrile conversational avenues ratio attained by the premise of Indecent Proposal in 1993 \u2013 what would you do if multimillionaire Robert Redford offered you $1m to sleep with your wife \u2013 will never be equalled. But Gold Digger (BBC One) is a bold and hugely entertaining attempt by writer Marnie Dickens. It asks how you would react if your 60-year-old mother/ex-wife/friend became involved with a man nearly 30 years her junior \u2013 or how you would react if a man nearly half your age came on to you. And, of course, poses the wider question of how society views female sexuality versus men\u2019s as they move through life, and how brutal it can be. There is something for everyone here, my friends. Julia Day (Julia Ormond, and please, while we\u2019re here, why don\u2019t we see more of Ormond? She is so good everywhere and brilliantly believable in this) falls into conversation with Benjamin (Ben Barnes) during a visit to the British Museum after a planned 60th birthday celebration that all three of her children failed to attend. Her husband, Tom (Alex Jennings), ran off with her best friend, Marsha (Nikki Amuka-Bird), a while ago and she is altogether at a low ebb. She and Benjamin get chatting, he asks her to go for a drink, an affair begins that evolves into a relationship and, a year later, a wedding is being prepared. Well? What would you have done? Been secretly flattered, laughed it off, but gone about the rest of your day with a lighter step? Been instantly defensive and sent him away with a flea in his young ear? Or confidently accepted it as your due? Whatever the answer, you are unlikely not to be hooked for the rest of the series. There is nothing more compelling than dramas in which every scene delivers the story and a new Rorschach test at the same time. And if you were one of her three children presented with him at dinner a few short months later, how would you react? Her sons Patrick (Sebastian Armesto) and Leo (Archie Renaux) are instantly appalled, and suspicious of his motives. Their mother is a rich woman and Benjamin is a copywriter who, in all fairness to the boys, appears to do very little copywriting. And they do love and want to protect her; they have all but stopped speaking to their father after his betrayal and Patrick especially understands how much she has been hurt. This is also partly why he is manfully trying to resist having an affair with a colleague while his newborn baby is turning his life upside down at home. Julia\u2019s daughter Della (Jemima Rooper) is relatively sanguine about the relationship, noting that her mother seems happy for the first time since Tom left (and possibly reasoning that if cashing in a few ISAs was the price of being with a thirtysomething with Benjamin\u2019s lean muscle/body fat percentage it is money well spent \u2013 though I may be projecting. But that is half the fun of watching any drama in which sexual politics swirl so potently). Benjamin appears almost to revel in the family\u2019s discomfort. Whether this means he is truly the wrong \u2019un they fear him to be, only the next five weeks will make clear. The first scenes in this opening episode are of a distraught Julia muddying her wedding dress as she runs for her car before driving off in haste. But surely the obvious inference is too obvious, no? Then we must factor in the chances of a drama having been written and commissioned that ends in the humiliation of an older woman by a younger lover, instead of fighting the good fight for a cultural shift that no longer pushes anyone over the age of 35 out of the sexual (televisual) arena. However, Gold Digger works beautifully as a soapy drama that promises to be full of twists and turns but emotional and psychological substance too. Jennings surely has much more to show us with Tom (otherwise, y\u2019know, you don\u2019t get Jennings) and Ormond grounds the whole thing in truth. If it turns out that their relationship is real and Benjamin on the side of the angels, it will work. If the rippling ambiguities send things another way, that will be wholly earned too. I would give myself up to it body and soul if I could just stop worrying about the stress it must have caused the casting directors. It\u2019s bad enough when you just have to find and pair actors viewers will believe are having sex without age gaps, possibly nefarious intentions and assorted other curveballs being lobbed in. But you did brilliantly. We all look forward to next week and many chats round the water cooler before then.",

I wanted no part in that.\u201d He added: \u201cI now wish Rosie well and urge her to fight for our country and, when she hopefully gets to resume her seat in the Commons, to continue to think for herself.\u201d The Lib Dems are part of a so-called remain alliance, which has seen them, Plaid Cymru and the Greens give each others\u2019 candidates a free run in 60 seats around England and Wales. However, Labour has declined to take part in any pacts, while the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has been vehemently critical of Corbyn, saying she could not back him as prime minister.",

      "body": "<p>Field Marshal Lord Bramall, who has died aged 95, was chief of the defence staff from 1982 until 1985, the pinnacle of a long military career that began just in time to land him on the beaches of Normandy as a freshly minted second lieutenant in the D-day invasion of June 1944.</p> <p>But in March 2015 he was drawn into the saga of claims of historical paedophilia and child abuse in high places that began with the unmasking of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/02/research-finds-jimmy-savile-abused-at-least-500-children\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile</a> in 2012.

All this was part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/04/operation-midland-met-police-boss-urged-to-consider-her-position\" title=\"\">Operation Midland</a>, set up by the Metropolitan police in response to allegations against a number of notable public figures.</p> <p>Bramall said in a statement: \u201cCategorically, never have I had a connection or anything to do with the matters being investigated.\u201d He was vindicated when, in March 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/21/last-living-suspect-harvey-proctor-vip-paedophile-ring-inquiry-will-face-no-charges\" title=\"\">the investigation collapsed</a>. No charges were brought as a result of allegations made by Carl Beech, known as \u201cNick\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/26/carl-beech-vip-paedophile-ring-accuser-jailed-for-18-years\" title=\"\">in July this year Beech was convicted of perverting the course of justice</a>.</p> <p>Born in Tonbridge, Kent, Edwin was the son of Major Edmund Bramall and his wife, Katherine (nee Westby). At Eton college he achieved distinction not for academic prowess but for cricket, a lifelong passion. He became captain of cricket, playing at Lord\u2019s for a public schools team and later for the army. Some said he could have made a career in first-class cricket. When commander of British forces in Hong Kong at the age of 51, he was the last player to hit a century at the Victoria cricket ground. In 1988-89 he served as president of the MCC.</p> <p>Although his army postings were many and various, his career began only really took off in 1967, when he made the promotional jump from lieutenant colonel to brigadier. After officer training at Sandhurst he was commissioned in 1943 as a second lieutenant in the King\u2019s Royal Rifle Corps (now part of <a href=\"https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/units/1508/kings-royal-rifle-corps/\" title=\"\">The Rifles</a>). After D-day he fought in the final campaign against Germany, winning the Military Cross for bravery. After promotion to first lieutenant in 1946 he was briefly posted to Japan for the allied occupation, which soon became an overwhelmingly American responsibility.</p> <p>Bramall\u2019s first staff post was as an instructor at the school of infantry in 1949 and he became a captain the next year. He was stationed in the Middle East in 1953 and moved up to major at the end of 1957. He became an instructor again in 1958, this time at the staff college in Camberley. In 1963 he was appointed to the staff of Lord (Louis) Mountbatten, the first holder of the post of chief of defence staff.</p> <p>In 1965 Bramall was appointed OBE, promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 2nd Royal Green Jackets, as his old regiment had become. He took his battalion to Borneo and participated in the final stages of \u201cconfrontation\u201d, an undeclared war of skirmishes focused on the divided island of Borneo, between an expansionist Indonesia and Malaysia, a new federation of former British colonies, which ended with an Indonesian withdrawal in autumn 1966. Bramall won a mention in dispatches.</p> <p>At the end of 1967 he was promoted to brigadier in command of 5th (Airportable) Infantry Brigade. Five years later he was made a major general commanding the 1st Division.

      "bodyText": "Field Marshal Lord Bramall, who has died aged 95, was chief of the defence staff from 1982 until 1985, the pinnacle of a long military career that began just in time to land him on the beaches of Normandy as a freshly minted second lieutenant in the D-day invasion of June 1944. But in March 2015 he was drawn into the saga of claims of historical paedophilia and child abuse in high places that began with the unmasking of Jimmy Savile in 2012. Bramall\u2019s cottage in a village near Farnham, Surrey, was raided by police as part of a co-ordinated initiative that also included the homes of Lord (Leon) Brittan, the former home secretary, who died in January 2015. All this was part of Operation Midland, set up by the Metropolitan police in response to allegations against a number of notable public figures. Bramall said in a statement: \u201cCategorically, never have I had a connection or anything to do with the matters being investigated.\u201d He was vindicated when, in March 2016, the investigation collapsed. No charges were brought as a result of allegations made by Carl Beech, known as \u201cNick\u201d, and in July this year Beech was convicted of perverting the course of justice. Born in Tonbridge, Kent, Edwin was the son of Major Edmund Bramall and his wife, Katherine (nee Westby). At Eton college he achieved distinction not for academic prowess but for cricket, a lifelong passion. He became captain of cricket, playing at Lord\u2019s for a public schools team and later for the army. Some said he could have made a career in first-class cricket. When commander of British forces in Hong Kong at the age of 51, he was the last player to hit a century at the Victoria cricket ground. In 1988-89 he served as president of the MCC. Although his army postings were many and various, his career began only really took off in 1967, when he made the promotional jump from lieutenant colonel to brigadier. After officer training at Sandhurst he was commissioned in 1943 as a second lieutenant in the King\u2019s Royal Rifle Corps (now part of The Rifles). After D-day he fought in the final campaign against Germany, winning the Military Cross for bravery. After promotion to first lieutenant in 1946 he was briefly posted to Japan for the allied occupation, which soon became an overwhelmingly American responsibility. Bramall\u2019s first staff post was as an instructor at the school of infantry in 1949 and he became a captain the next year. He was stationed in the Middle East in 1953 and moved up to major at the end of 1957. He became an instructor again in 1958, this time at the staff college in Camberley. In 1963 he was appointed to the staff of Lord (Louis) Mountbatten, the first holder of the post of chief of defence staff. In 1965 Bramall was appointed OBE, promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 2nd Royal Green Jackets, as his old regiment had become. He took his battalion to Borneo and participated in the final stages of \u201cconfrontation\u201d, an undeclared war of skirmishes focused on the divided island of Borneo, between an expansionist Indonesia and Malaysia, a new federation of former British colonies, which ended with an Indonesian withdrawal in autumn 1966. Bramall won a mention in dispatches. At the end of 1967 he was promoted to brigadier in command of 5th (Airportable) Infantry Brigade. Five years later he was made a major general commanding the 1st Division. In 1973 he was appointed commander of British forces in Hong Kong as a lieutenant general, and knighted. In May 1976 he was made C-in-C of UK land forces, advancing to full general. Two years later he was vice chief of the defence staff. In 1979 he became head of the army as chief of the general staff. He was promoted again to field marshal in 1982, and then appointed chief of defence staff. Soon after retiring from the army in 1985, he became lord lieutenant of Greater London (1986-98).

So he wants his team to summon righteous fury today and use this friendly to show how much they despise the current state of things. Things such as the fact that England have managed to garner one win and five defeats from their last seven matches; and the fact that criticism of that miserable run has been \u201cprobably only half of what it should be\u201d, according to Neville. The manager reckons it\u2019s about time the Lionesses got their hulking act together. </p> <p>\u201cI want them to be really angry, I want them to be angry with me, I want them to be angry with themselves, and I want us to play angry,\u201d stormed Neville, almost bursting his waistcoat with rage. \u201cBecause I think we\u2019ve gone a little bit soft.\u201d Now some folks might say that pleas such as that are the last resort of the clueless, but let\u2019s wait and see how the one plays out. England must cope without four significant absentees - Steph Houghton, Alex Greenwood, Jodie Taylor and Ellen White - but if they don\u2019t play with (a) anger and (b) brains, then everyone can feel free to vent on Neville. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 7.15pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-12T18:02:46.047Z\">at 6.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe got the win and that\u2019s what I demanded from the team. We totally dominated the second half but were careless a little bit in possession ... We wanted to finish the last game of the year with a win and we did that. I don\u2019t think we should take anything away from the last 12 months in terms of where we\u2019ve taken women\u2019s football and the Lionesses ... Now the hard work starts next year ... to get them performing to the level that I believe they can.\u201d England\u2019s last fixture of the year ends with a win thanks to William\u2019s deflected late strike. It wasn\u2019t an especially impressive performance but the conditions were difficult and the team at least made sure they got a result that relieves pressure at least a little. Mead and Staniforth had decent games and Hemp did well off the bench. 90 min: There will be at least three minutes to stoppage time. Absolutely nothing suggests the Czechs can draw level again. They spend most of the second half hanging on and they don\u2019t look to have the energy to mount a comeback now. So all England have to do is play it cool in the snow ... Nobbs delivers England\u2019s 10th corner of the game. It\u2019s headed out for their 11th. This one is headed out to the edge of the area, where Williamson controls it before unloading a shot that takes a big deflection and then squirms past the goalkeeper\u2019s outstretched hand. Hardly a work of art, but that goal should give England the victory they crave! It\u2019s Williamson\u2019s first for her country. Czech Republic substitution: Dubcova on, Staskova off 84 min: Nobbs gets the game\u2019s first yellow card, seemingly for kicking the ball away after having a foul given against her. Play angry! 83 min: Mead\u2019s corner from the right this the crossbar before going wide on the far side! 80 min: Svitkova has a go from 30 yards. Telford deals with it without fuss, which is commendable seen as how she\u2019s had nothing to do in this half until then other than stand around in the snow. 78 min: Hemp, who has made a big impact since her introduction, races down the left and sends over a low cross that triggers chaos in the area. After a mighty scramble, the Czechs hoik the ball to safety. But it\u2019ll be coming back at them soon, you can count on that. England substitution: Daly on, England off England substitution: Nobbs on, Staniforth off 75 min: Bright steps forward to extinguish a nascent Czech counter-attack. Then she decides to go for goal herself. And it\u2019s a fine effort from long range, forcing a decent diving save from the keeper. 73 min: Scott tries to slip a pass through to England, but the keeper hurtles off her line to claim it before the striker. Czech Republic substitution: Khyrova on, Szewieczkova off - there\u2019ll be no hat-trick for her. 70 min: Hemp goes on a zigzag run in-field and then tries her luck from over 25 yards. The keeper spills it ... but recovers just in time! 69 min: Hemp gets a chance to run at the full-back for the first time. She skins her and then bangs in a low cross towards the near post. The keeper gathers before England can get to it. 67 min: Scott recklessly takes out Cahynova in a bid to atone for giving away the ball. That gives the hosts a freekick some 25 yards out, to the left. Svitkova dabs a dire effort straight into the wall. 65 min: Penalty? No! Mead seemed to be bowled over by a backtracking defender as she controlled a cross from the left, but the referee figures that Jarchovska legitimately put her body between player and ball. England substitution: Hemp on, Parris off. 63 min: The game is being played almost exclusively in the Czech half. But there\u2019s still a dearth of quality around their box. 60 min: Mead heads into the net but the goal won\u2019t stand because Scott climbed a over a defender before nodding it down for the Arsenal forward. 60 min: Neat play by Mead and Scott to set up Staniforth for a shot from 20 yards. She can\u2019t keep it down, driving a couple of yards over. 58 min: Mead, England\u2019s most dangerous player, skedaddles down the left and digs out a useful cross from the byline. It\u2019s headed clear. 56 min: Bright to Mead with yet another diagonal pass. Mead\u2019s cross from the left is too close to the keeper. 53 min: A better buildup from England, Parris and Bronze combining well down the right to win a corner. Staniforth\u2019s drives it towards the near post, where England pulled away to find space. But she can\u2019t direct her header on target. 51 min: Nice work by Bronze to shoulder Szewieczkova off the ball and recycle it for England. But their move unravels as soon as they get into opposition territory. It\u2019s been a horrible second half so far. 48 min: The trusty diagonal pass from Bright to Mead does the trick again. Mead takes it down and feeds the overlapping Stokes, whose cross from the left is headed way over by Scott. 47 min: It\u2019s been a scrappy half so far, with both sides guilty of errant passing. 46 min: The snowfall is relatively light as England set the second half in motion. England began shoddily and deservedly fell behind. But they reacted well to that ignominy, overturning their deficit in a matter of minutes. Then Szewieczkova shocked them with a long-range screamer. England have dominated since then but lacked finesse in the final third and still looked vulnerable to rare Czech counter-attacks. 45 min: Good defending by Mead. She got back to interrupt an ominous-looking counter-attack with a firm tackle. 44 min: England have made good use of long diagonals passes so far. The latest one releases Mead, who scurries down the left before shanking her cross. 42 min: Meads slides into a 50/50 challenge with Staskova, winning the ball first before upending the Czech on the follow-through. Couldn\u2019t be helped, reckons the ref. 41 min: A freekick wide on the left is taken short to Mead, who tonks a long diagonal ball towards the back post. Bright soars to meet it but can\u2019t keep her header down. 39 min: Bronze chips over a cross from the right. Scott meets it with a humdrum volley, of which the keeper makes a meal, pushing it around the post for a corner 38 min: A straightforward ball over the top catches out England, as Staskova runs past Stokes to collect it. But her touch betrays her and she runs over the endline before attempting a cross. 37 min: England are fitter than their opponents and are doing a good job of winning the ball back soon after losing it. 35 min: After a long spell of probing by the visitors, Stokes lashes in a low cross from the left. But England is offside again. 33 min: Bertholdova takes down Mead to give England a freekick in a useful crossing position wide on the left. Staniforth\u2019s delivery is good but Czech Republic scramble it clear, eventually. 30 min: Staniforth sends England\u2019s fourth corner of the game towards the back post. Bronze gets her head to it and bops it into the ground. The ball bounces up into the arms of the untroubled keeper. From out of nowhere the home side are level. England did not deal with a long ball from the back, heading it square to Szewieczkova, who lets fly with an excellent strike from over 20 yards. Telford plunges to her right but can\u2019t get a hand to it as it whizzes high into the net. 27 min: As the rain turns into snow, England take a short corner and the Czechs defence melts away. A low cross from the right skids across the six-yard box and Bright has to stretch to meet it, sending a looping shot bouncing off the top of the bar. 26 min: England are passing more snappily now but could still do with a lot more precision when they get near the opposing box. They\u2019re stretching the Czechs plenty and there are plenty of goals there for the visitors if they play their passes right. 24 min: Mead pings a low pass to Parris near the D. The Lyon forward turns sharply and cracks off a fierce shot, which Sonntagova deflects over for a corner. 22 min: \u201cIs it too early to mention the US put three goals past Sweden in the opening 30 minutes last week?\u201d asks C Noyes. Certainly not, but don\u2019t forget to add that they didn\u2019t score any in the second 60, during which they conceded twice. Mead opens up her body to receive a pass near the right-hand corner of the box and then curler a lovely shot into the far corner of the net. It looks like the Czechs\u2019 opening goal made England as angry as Neville wanted them to be. England have woken up and deliver the perfect response to falling behind. Parris created, retrieving the ball at the byline after a heavy touch and then clipping it back to England, who hooked it high into the net at the near post. That\u2019s a beautifully constructed goal, albeit against a very sluggish defence. Vonkova fed Svitkova, who, from a central position about 25 yards out, threaded a perfect pass through the English defence and into the path of the on-rushing Szewieczkova, who finished smartly. 13 min: England fire off their first shots. Parris\u2019 half-volley from 15 yards is charged down before a follow-up effort from 25 yards wobbles miles wide. 11 min: The Czechs get in behind England again, Staskova running beyond Bright to collect a clever pass by Szewieckova. Then, from a difficult angle on the left, Staskova tries to fire a low shot into the far corner but it whizzes wide. Telford had it covered, anyway. 9 min: The hosts are well organised. England haven\u2019t been able to work any openings yet and tend to lose the ball as soon as they get near their opponent\u2019s well-defended box. 7 min: Nice counter-attack by the home team. Staskova, wide on the left, tees up Vonkova at the edge of the area. She shifts the ball nicely on to her left foot and then sends a decent curler a couple of yards over the bar from 20 yards. The Czechs have been the more polished side so far. 5 min: Mead comes in off the flank to meet a long diagonal pass and play a nice cushioned pass towards England, who had strayed offside. 3 min: What a chance for Staskova! Martinkova easily found space for a cross from the left and delivered a fine ball to the striker, who was unmarked six yards from goal! Luckily for England, Staskova\u2019s finish was as bad as the defending. She nodded over the bar. 2 min: The early signs suggest England are going to have plenty of the ball today. The question is whether they can make astute use of it. Not so far, as Bright plays a sloppy ball straight into touch. 1 min: After pre-match huddle to check everyone is suitably peeved, England declare themselves ready to begin. The Czechs kick off .... The teams file out on to the pitch, where they are greeted by heavy rain and a very light scattering of spectators. Anger levels must be rising among England\u2019s players. The England manager tells the BBC: \u201cI want to see a performance. I want to see us play like people have been talking about us in the last 12 months - like one of the best teams in world football. We\u2019ve left the players under no illusions as to what\u2019s expected. We have to be ruthless.\u201d \u201cHonestly England look like they need a change of manager and another disappointing result might help speed things along,\u201d reckons C Noyes. \u201cThen again, as an American looking forward to England being our major competition for a gold medal next year - go Lionesses! Play like you are angry with your manager! He\u2019s given you that license.\u201d So are you saying England\u2019s manager is good or bad? \u201cBad, but in a good way,\u201d replies C Noyes pronto. \u201cA sort of useful idiot for USWNT world dominance. Long live the Reign of Phil!\u201d Any England fans care to defend your manager? Nikita Parris in the starting lineup but won\u2019t be on spotkick duty, having missed three of her last four penalties for England. Czech Republic: Votikova; Sonntagova, Bertholdova, Martinova, Sedlackova, Vonkova, Svitkova, CAhynova, Szewiekova, Staskova, Jarschovska England: Telford; Bronze, Bright, Stokes, Williamson, Walsh, Parris, Scott, England, Staniforth, Mead Always with his finger on the pulse, Phil Neville reckons there just isn\u2019t enough anger in the world right now. So he wants his team to summon righteous fury today and use this friendly to show how much they despise the current state of things. Things such as the fact that England have managed to garner one win and five defeats from their last seven matches; and the fact that criticism of that miserable run has been \u201cprobably only half of what it should be\u201d, according to Neville. The manager reckons it\u2019s about time the Lionesses got their hulking act together. \u201cI want them to be really angry, I want them to be angry with me, I want them to be angry with themselves, and I want us to play angry,\u201d stormed Neville, almost bursting his waistcoat with rage. \u201cBecause I think we\u2019ve gone a little bit soft.\u201d Now some folks might say that pleas such as that are the last resort of the clueless, but let\u2019s wait and see how the one plays out. England must cope without four significant absentees - Steph Houghton, Alex Greenwood, Jodie Taylor and Ellen White - but if they don\u2019t play with (a) anger and (b) brains, then everyone can feel free to vent on Neville. Kick-off: 7.15pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "To recap, England\u2019s star player, a trailblazer and one of the most popular in the country, has been at the heart of a bust-up with a teammate on international duty. It has seen him punished with a one-game internal suspension and the simmering Premier League title rivalry between Manchester City and Liverpool enter the dynamics of the national team squad. \u201cIt\u2019s done, we move forward,\u201d Raheem Sterling wrote on Instagram in the early hours of Tuesday, in the wake of his confrontation with Liverpool\u2019s Joe Gomez at St George\u2019s Park on Monday. \u201c[Let\u2019s] not make this bigger than it is.\u201d At which point, the only thing to say was to wish the City winger all the very best with that. The Football Association had been looking forward to promoting the Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday night as the 1,000th England international, a feelgood story taking in plenty of nostalgia but also optimism for the future, specifically concerning the championship finals next summer. Now the organisation has switched into crisis management mode with the issue of squad discipline and harmony front and centre. All of the cameras were on Sterling and Gomez in Tuesday morning\u2019s training session and there were eyes on stalks when Gomez was seen to be sporting a cut on the side of his face. To the Sterling camp it was nothing more than a scratch, evidence that this really was a storm in a St George\u2019s Park restaurant teacup. But to others it was confirmation of just how physical things had got between the players. Enter Gareth Southgate at the media session in the afternoon.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration should have to reckon with its decision to \u201cdestroy lives\u201d by ending a program that protects young undocumented migrants, one justice declared as the supreme court deliberated the future of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca. The legality of Daca, which allows about 700,000 people brought to the US as youngsters to live and work in the country with two-year, renewable authorizations, was not actually the focus of Tuesday\u2019s hearing. Instead, the court was tasked with deciding if it was allowed to review the government\u2019s decision to end Daca in 2017 and, if it was, whether the government followed the right procedures. The 80-minute oral argument threatened to become bogged down in legal practicalities, but early on Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked where in the decision to rescind Daca did the administration explain \u201cthat this is not about the law, that this is about our choice to destroy lives\u201d. Sotomayor\u2019s impassioned comments were a rare reminder from the bench that while the case is mired in legal minutiae, on the line is the future of 700,000 people who have Daca, and another 600,000 who could qualify if it is upheld. Some such people, known as Dreamers, gathered in the courtroom after waiting outside in rainy and cold conditions. For Dreamers, the Daca battle has never been just about them. They are often the children of at least one undocumented migrant who does not have a path to legal status in the US, but stayed in the country for their children. Given temporary protection, Dreamers moved closer to being able to fight for families and friends who have not had the same opportunities. Daca was implemented in 2012 by the Obama administration because so many people who knew the US better than the country in which they were born were forced to live in the shadows: working illegally, curbing dreams of higher education and living in fear of discovery that could turn their lives upside down. It is not known how many young people have, since Daca was ended, decided to rebuild their lives in countries where they may not even speak the local language. The liberal justice Stephen Breyer underscored the impact of Daca by listing how many entities had said they would be affected by its end: 66 healthcare organizations, three labor unions, 210 educational associations, six military organizations, three home builders, 108 municipalities and cities, 129 religious organization and 145 businesses. Breyer said all the groups detailed the effect ending Daca would have, but underlined that those were separate from the central issue of 700,000 people potentially being forced to return to countries they barely knew. It was Sotomayor, the first Latino supreme court justice, who put the human impact of the case front and center. \u201c[The US government] can\u2019t, even when it wants to, remove the vast majority of aliens we have here,\u201d Sotomayor said. \u201cAnd so I\u2019ve always had some difficulty in understanding what\u2019s wrong with an agency saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to prioritize our removals, and for those people, like the Daca people \u2013 who haven\u2019t committed crimes, who are lawfully employed, who are paying taxes, who pose no threat to our security, and there\u2019s a whole list of prerequisites \u2013 we\u2019re not going to exercise our limited resources to try to get rid of those people.\u201d Sotomayor\u2019s full-throated defense of Daca was expected, as she is one of four justices who reliably rule in favor of liberal issues. In her first statement on Tuesday, she asked why more consideration was not being given to Donald Trump\u2019s repeated declarations that he would help Daca recipients before he rescinded the program, giving them a six-month window to make alternative life plans and to hope Congress would step in to create a new program.

If it decides it does not have the jurisdiction to review the case, the decision to end Daca will stand. If it decides it does have jurisdiction, it could still say the government was within its rights to end the program. The future of Dreamers would then depend on the court\u2019s argument. If the court decides the government was wrong in how it ended Daca, the program will stand and it will be possible to file new applications. Outside the courtroom, a crowd chanted \u201cHome is here\u201d and \u201cS\u00ed se puede\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Back in 2000, the glossy relaunch of Charlie\u2019s Angels felt like a genuine pop culture event. The central casting of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu, all at the height of their fame, was an impressively inspired get. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lPQZni7I18\">The accompanying lead single from Destiny\u2019s Child</a> was not only a smash hit but a deserved one.

Clashes continued late into the night on Tuesday, after protestors built street barricades, set fires and threw petrol bombs, chairs and other objects at police during another day of strikes demanding greater democracy in the Chinese territory. Universities have emerged as new battlegrounds in recent days. At Chinese University of Hong Kong, pro-vice chancellor Dennis Ng pleaded with police to stop firing teargas. \u201cIt is out of control,\u201d he yelled over a loudspeaker. The police later said they would retreat in an effort to \u201cdiffuse the situation\u201d.</p> \n<p><strong>A camper trailer company in the marginal NSW seat of Gilmore was awarded a $750,000 federal government grant</strong> at a time that it may have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/regional-grant-scheme-business-awarded-750000-then-goes-bust-six-months-later\">trading while insolvent</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 13 November. Top stories The army stand ready to be deployed as New South Wales and Queensland fires blaze out of control. More than 100 fires continue to rage across eastern Australia, dozens of them running out of control, but the nation escaped its predicted \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fire day without further loss of life. However, fire chiefs have warned that despite cooler conditions expected on Wednesday and Thursday, dangerous fire conditions will return late in the week. At least 170 houses have been razed in fires across NSW and Queensland, but no further lives were lost on Tuesday, predicted by fire chiefs to be the most dangerous bushfire conditions the nation had ever seen. Follow all our latest coverage here. Police in Hong Kong have accused protesters of bringing the city to the \u201cbrink of total collapse\u201d and urged residents not to support them as demonstrations paralysed the city for a second day in a row. Clashes continued late into the night on Tuesday, after protestors built street barricades, set fires and threw petrol bombs, chairs and other objects at police during another day of strikes demanding greater democracy in the Chinese territory. Universities have emerged as new battlegrounds in recent days. At Chinese University of Hong Kong, pro-vice chancellor Dennis Ng pleaded with police to stop firing teargas. \u201cIt is out of control,\u201d he yelled over a loudspeaker. The police later said they would retreat in an effort to \u201cdiffuse the situation\u201d. A camper trailer company in the marginal NSW seat of Gilmore was awarded a $750,000 federal government grant at a time that it may have been trading while insolvent. Under the grant, awarded under the regional jobs and investment program that was subject to a scathing report from the auditor general, applicants were required to spend a matching amount to the government contribution. But six months after the company\u2019s $1.5m project was announced as successful under the program\u2019s business innovation stream, the company was placed into administration and the company\u2019s 50 employees were made redundant. Australia Cardinal George Pell will on Wednesday find out if he has reached the end of the road in fighting his conviction for historical child sexual abuse offences, when the high court decides whether it will grant his legal team special leave to appeal for a final time. In June Victoria\u2019s court of appeal dismissed the appeal by a majority of two to one, prompting Pell\u2019s lawyers to take the matter to the high court. But there is no automatic right to have an appeal heard. When the court delivers its decision on Wednesday morning it will do so based on papers alone and, if unsuccessful, Pell will have no other option but to accept his conviction. The biggest barrier to suicide prevention is discrimination, according to Scott Morrison\u2019s suicide prevention adviser. Christine Morgan says she has been shocked by the \u201chorrific\u201d level of stigma that Australians face when people learn they have attempted self-harm. Rich Australians lobbied the tax office to exempt some of their companies from increased scrutiny, according to submissions from their accountants seen by the Guardian. Angus Taylor will face a further grilling when parliament returns over the origins of a doctored document he says informed a letter blasting the City of Sydney over its travel spending. The world A whistleblower has told the Guardian of growing alarm over secret transfer of medical history data, which can be accessed by Google staff. The whistleblower works in Project Nightingale, the secret transfer of the personal medical data of up to 50 million Americans from one of the largest healthcare providers in the US to Google. The British Labour party has faced a second cyber-attack, a day after experiencing what it called a \u201csophisticated and large-scale\u201d attempt to disrupt its digital systems. Meanwhile 25 sitting and former Conservative councillors have been exposed for posting Islamophobic and racist material on social media, according to a dossier obtained by the Guardian that intensifies the row over anti-Muslim sentiment in the party. White House officials are reportedly drafting plans to make US foreign aid conditional on how countries treat their religious minorities, in an effort that is seen as a sop to Christian evangelicals in Donald Trump\u2019s base. Recommended reads Carol Heriot was standing in the kitchen thinking about what to cook for dinner on Tuesday afternoon when a police officer knocked on her door. \u201cHe said: \u2018Love, it\u2019s time to get out of here.\u2019 I said: \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 and he pointed up the hill and he said: \u2018You see that smoke? It\u2019s coming this way.\u2019\u201d Heriot, her partner Rodney Smith and their dog Bundy were among the 80-odd people, dogs, birds, cats and goldfish crowded into the auditorium of the Tuncurry bowling club on Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit of a menagerie at the moment and it looks a bit like Noah\u2019s ark out the back,\u201d the manager, Terry Green, told Guardian Australia earlier in the day. What if we treated history as a giant data set? asks Laura Spinney. \u201cPeter Turchin used sophisticated maths to show how the interactions of predators and prey produce oscillations in animal populations in the wild. He had published in the journals Nature and Science and become respected in his field, but by the late 1990s he had answered all the ecological questions that interested him. He found himself drawn to history instead: could the rise and fall of human societies also be captured by a handful of variables and some differential equations?\u201d Listen After Scott Morrison signalled the Coalition would crackdown on environmental activism, Katharine Murphy and Ben Butler examine exactly what that means on today\u2019s Full Story podcast. In a speech at a mining conference in Queensland, Morrison raised the possibility of outlawing secondary boycotts and making sure companies listen to their \u201cquiet shareholders\u201d. These proposals seem to run against the Liberal party\u2019s free market ethos. What is behind this new push and will the government be able to legislate any of these proposals? Sport The 2019-20 W-League season looks set to inspire a new cluster of fans as it makes up for lost time. Energised by local youth but anchored by international stars, here\u2019s how the nine clubs shape up for season 11. Roger Federer warmed up for his hugely anticipated rematch with Novak Djokovic on Thursday by blunting the power of Matteo Berrettini on the third day of the ATP World Tour Finals. The young Italian, who scraped into the last eight at the last minute, could not live with a Federer playing near his peak to win 7-6 (2), 6-3. Media roundup \u201cTwo-thirds of junior doctors working in NSW hospitals are so exhausted they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll make a medical mistake that could potentially harm their patients, or come to harm themselves,\u201d the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The Washington Post reveals \u201chow climate change is triggering a chain reaction that threatens the heart of the Pacific.\u201d The ABC looks at screen time in Australian schools. Coming up Today the high court will rule on whether disgraced cardinal George Pell can appeal his child sexual abuse conviction. The former ACTU boss Bill Kelty will deliver the annual Bob Hawke lecture in Adelaide and will pay tribute to his long-time friend. The aged care royal commission is holding a hearing in Hobart.

I spent a year living upstairs last time until the downstairs of my house was back to normal and now i\u2019m going to have to do it again.\u201d David Hughes, the mayor of Matlock, said it was right that the government had called an emergency meeting but he was surprised that Johnson had not yet visited the worst-affected areas. \u201cObviously if people are flooded for days and days on end then it is an emergency for them and it seems to be over a large area,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the persistency [of the floods], yes I think he probably should make a visit.\u201d In the Doncaster suburb of Bentley, which remained under a severe flood warning on Tuesday, Tony Nicholson said there was anger at the hierarchy of the town\u2019s Labour council and the Conservative government over their response to the disaster. \u201cIf this was in another area this would be deemed a national emergency. This is devastating for people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Nicholson, a Green party parish councillor. Nicholson said he was not making a party political point but was angry at the official response at a national and local level. \u201cIt\u2019s the official response that\u2019s the issue, whoever is in charge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems it has not been fast enough and because these people are not wealthy people and it has happened before, they have a sense that they\u2019re not that important.\u201d Jane Cox, the leader of the Conservative group on Doncaster council, said it was inappropriate to score political points out of a human tragedy. \u201cIt does matter that [the government] should acknowledge it but I firmly believe it should not be politicised,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be horrified if anyone started slating anyone from the Labour party for what has happened.\u201d",

Twenty of the victims are suing the Turkish government for damages, in two separate lawsuits.</p> <p>State department documents declassified in response to freedom of information requests by the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers show the extent of tension between US and Turkish security officers from the moment of the arrival of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s entourage.</p> <p>In an official report of the visit, the unnamed diplomatic service agent in charge said he had to step in to contain a furious row among Turkish security guards at Washington\u2019s Andrews military airfield because he feared \u201ca possible altercation or assault on the tarmac\u201d. He reported Erdo\u011fan\u2019s chief bodyguard appeared to be responsible.</p> <p>The US agent describes the attack on Sheridan Circle as being \u201cprovoked by Turkish security officers who upon seeing the protesters had run directly into the crowd to physically engage them, and that one Turkish security officer had punched a [metropolitan police] officer directly in the nose causing massive blood flow, and other MPD officers were also assaulted.\u201d</p> <p>The agent also noted a police report that \u201cTurkish security officers used some sort of unknown aerosol on the protesters which they are investigating further.\u201d It is still unclear what was in the spray.</p> <p>According to the agent\u2019s report, Turkish security officers repeatedly ignored US instructions to stay in their cars, and instead leapt out to join in the attack on protesters.</p> <p>In a later incident outside the Turkish embassy, a few hundred yards from Sheridan Circle, a spat broke out over who should take the visiting foreign minister\u2019s luggage out of a US car, which led to a Turkish guard slapping a US officer who was trying to remove the bags.</p> <p>A few minutes later, a fight broke out between US and Turkish officers outside the embassy. Washington police intervened to subdue the Turks. But the incident could easily have escalated further, the report said.</p> <p>Before the presidential party left, the Turkish ambassador to Washington, Serdar Kili\u00e7, asked the diplomatic service agent-in-charge \u201cif I could find a way to have the Turkish security officers released by \u2018looking past\u2019 what had happened and allowing them to fly back to Turkey as scheduled\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/18/trumps-turkey-deal-hands-power-to-ankara-and-leaves-syrian-kurds-for-dead\">Trump's Turkey deal hands power to Ankara and leaves Syrian Kurds for dead</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Turkish guards were released an hour and a half later, and left the country.

      "bodyText": "Police in Washington DC, the US state department and the Secret Service are girding themselves for the return of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Wednesday, 18 months after the Turkish president\u2019s bodyguards ran riot in the city, assaulting protesters and American security officers. Newly declassified state department documents provide fresh details of the aggression shown by the Turkish security detail towards their US counterparts both before and after the 2017 attack near the Turkish embassy in north-west Washington. Six officers from the US Secret Service, two from the diplomatic service and one from the Washington police required medical treatment. The worst injuries, however, were suffered by a small group of protesters that included women, children and elderly men, who were punched and pushed. Some were kicked repeatedly by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s bodyguards and supporters while they were on the ground, and at least two sustained brain injuries from which they are still trying to recover. The protesters, mostly Kurdish Americans, are making their own preparations for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s return. They plan to turn up in far greater numbers, with the support of ethnic Armenians, dissident Turks and others, to protest against Erdo\u011fan\u2019s treatment of minorities, the Turkish incursion into Syria, Donald Trump\u2019s support for Erdo\u011fan and the failure to bring any of the Turkish security officers to justice after the last visit. Murat Yasa will be among the protesters on Wednesday, just as he was on 16 May 2017 in Sheridan Circle, a large grassy roundabout near the Turkish ambassador\u2019s residence, in the heart of Washington\u2019s embassy district. His life has been utterly changed since that day when he was pushed to the ground and kicked repeatedly in the head. \u201cAbout 20 or 30 of them attacked us from the right, the left, the middle. The police couldn\u2019t stop it,\u201d Yasa, a 62-year-old Kurdish American from Virginia, said. Video of the incident shows Erdo\u011fan\u2019s security agents were among the attackers, dressed either in black suits and ties or olive green shirts. The video footage also shows Erdo\u011fan looking on while attacks took place. \u201cWhen they attacked us, as I was next to Kurdish woman, I tried to protect her, because they, someone was trying to kick her, and then someone pushed me from behind, I lost my control and I was on the ground. And then one after another, after another, they were kicking my head,\u201d Yasa recalled. He remembered one of his attackers shouting at him as he lay bleeding: \u201cYou think when you came to America you saved yourself. Wherever you go, you Kurd bastard, we will come to get you.\u201d Yasa sustained brain injuries from the attack. He needs medication to sleep and ward off nightmares, and he suffers from short-term memory loss. He had to give up working in the flooring company he built up since arriving in the US in 1987, and is now an Uber driver. \u201cI never, ever thought that this is going to happen to me in the United States,\u201d Yasa said. He knows others who took part in the 2017 protests whose families in Turkey have been threatened. He takes greater security precautions to reassure himself he is protecting his immediate family in Virginia but vows nothing will stop him joining the protests against Erdo\u011fan once more on Wednesday. Nineteen people, including 15 Turkish security officers, were indicted for the 2017 attacks. But in the spring of 2018, with no official explanation, charges were dropped against 11 of the Turkish agents. Twenty of the victims are suing the Turkish government for damages, in two separate lawsuits. State department documents declassified in response to freedom of information requests by the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers show the extent of tension between US and Turkish security officers from the moment of the arrival of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s entourage. In an official report of the visit, the unnamed diplomatic service agent in charge said he had to step in to contain a furious row among Turkish security guards at Washington\u2019s Andrews military airfield because he feared \u201ca possible altercation or assault on the tarmac\u201d. He reported Erdo\u011fan\u2019s chief bodyguard appeared to be responsible. The US agent describes the attack on Sheridan Circle as being \u201cprovoked by Turkish security officers who upon seeing the protesters had run directly into the crowd to physically engage them, and that one Turkish security officer had punched a [metropolitan police] officer directly in the nose causing massive blood flow, and other MPD officers were also assaulted.\u201d The agent also noted a police report that \u201cTurkish security officers used some sort of unknown aerosol on the protesters which they are investigating further.\u201d It is still unclear what was in the spray. According to the agent\u2019s report, Turkish security officers repeatedly ignored US instructions to stay in their cars, and instead leapt out to join in the attack on protesters. In a later incident outside the Turkish embassy, a few hundred yards from Sheridan Circle, a spat broke out over who should take the visiting foreign minister\u2019s luggage out of a US car, which led to a Turkish guard slapping a US officer who was trying to remove the bags. A few minutes later, a fight broke out between US and Turkish officers outside the embassy. Washington police intervened to subdue the Turks. But the incident could easily have escalated further, the report said. Before the presidential party left, the Turkish ambassador to Washington, Serdar Kili\u00e7, asked the diplomatic service agent-in-charge \u201cif I could find a way to have the Turkish security officers released by \u2018looking past\u2019 what had happened and allowing them to fly back to Turkey as scheduled\u201d. The Turkish guards were released an hour and a half later, and left the country. The injured protesters believe that the demands of justice were subordinated to Trump\u2019s desire to maintain a good relationship with Erdo\u011fan, a desire that ultimately led to him to green-light the Turkish incursion into north-eastern Syria last month. \u201cIt is so outrageous on so many levels that Erdo\u011fan is being allowed back,\u201d said Elif Genc, a Kurdish-Canadian graduate student who was also beaten up and kicked at the 2017 protest, leaving her with concussion and severe bruising. \u201cIt just shows us that everything that we went through and everything that we\u2019ve been fighting for and everything that we\u2019ve been trying to do is just for nought, and it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The US Secret Service said it would not comment for operational security reasons about \u201cprotectees, protective means, methods and or protective responsibilities\u201d. The state department said the diplomatic security service \u201cdoes not go into details about specific security plans, nor does DSS comment on security plans for United States Secret Service protectees\u201d. The Turkish embassy did not respond to a request for comment on preparations for Wednesday\u2019s Erdo\u011fan visit. It is unclear what action, if any, US authorities would take if the bodyguards responsible for the 2017 attack returned as part of the presidential party. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to have his goons with him,\u201d Genc said. \u201cI really hope sincerely that he doesn\u2019t have the same guys with him because that would just be literally like spitting on our face.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The former chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond has found a job worth about \u00a3125,000 a year within a week of stepping down as an MP. He has become a non-executive director of Irish metal and glass packaging firm Ardagh, which is listed on the New York stock exchange. The firm said Hammond had joined its board and would serve on its audit committee, which oversees financial reporting and disclosure. Stock market filings from the US show that Ardagh, owned and chaired by Irish billionaire Paul Coulson, paid four \u201cnon-employee\u201d directors $800,000 (\u00a3622,000) between them last year. Hammond is understood to be in line for a package worth between \u00a3125,000 and \u00a3135,000 for attending meetings of the board and audit committee. He will also be reimbursed for any expenses he incurs travelling to the meetings at its Luxembourg headquarters, which take place about 10 times a year. The former chancellor stood down after 22 years as an MP earlier this month after repeatedly clashing with Boris Johnson over Brexit. The former MP for Runnymede and Weybridge, who lost the party whip last month after opposing leaving the EU without a deal, said he had been forced to stand aside because he would lose his party membership if he stood against an official Conservative candidate. Any minister who is offered a job in the private sector within two years of leaving office must seek approval from the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba) before accepting it. In 2017, a report accused Hammond\u2019s predecessor, George Osborne, of disrespect and setting an \u201cunhelpful example\u201d by accepting the post of editor of the London Evening Standard without first clearing it with Acoba. Acoba\u2019s website says its approval process helps avoid suspicion that former ministers are being rewarded for past favours and ensures that the employer is not gaining an improper advantage by hiring someone with information about competitors or about future government policy. The process is also designed to ensure that former ministers and senior officials cannot exploit contacts at Westminster to aid their new employer. \u201cFormer ministers are expected to refrain from drawing on any privileged information which was available to them when a minister,\u201d Acoba says. \u201cThey will normally be asked to observe a two-year ban on lobbying government on behalf of their new employer or clients. \u201cFormer cabinet ministers will normally be subject to a three-month waiting period from their last day in office before taking up any outside employment.\u201d Johnson sacked Hammond as chancellor in July, replacing him with Sajid Javid, meaning that the three-month period has now elapsed.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson chairs emergency meeting on floods Boris Johnson has claimed the situation is \u201cstabilising\u201d for those affected by the flooding in northern England, as he spoke to broadcasters after chairing a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee. He rejected claims that the government had been complacent. But No 10 announced the Cobra meeting only after Jeremy Corbyn publicly called for one (although Downing Street says it was scheduled anyway), and Corbyn and the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson both made visits today to residents affected. Corbyn said Labour would spend \u00a35.6bn over 10 years improving flood defences. Corbyn spells out lifelong learning plans The Labour leader has unveiled what he described as one of the party\u2019s most transformative plans: a lifelong learning proposal that he said would give every adult an entitlement to six years of free education. At a launch in Blackpool, Corbyn said this was one of the plans he was \u201cmost excited about\u201d. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said people taking up the offer would be able to get the same maintenance support available to students in higher education, and workers would have the right to paid time off for study. Rayner\u2019s speech was powerful because she was able to recount how, as a teenage mother, her own life was transformed by adult education, and her performance will do nothing to quell speculation that, if she is not setting up a national education service after the election (and the polls continue to imply she won\u2019t be), she might be running for the leadership instead. Corbyn and Rayner: Heather Stewart\u2019s snap verdict Corbyn was given a standing ovation by the activists here in Blackpool, and his promise that the NHS is \u201cnot for sale\u201d in a trade deal with the US was greeted with enthusiastic applause. But the star turn was Rayner, who talked about the importance of adult education in her own life, after she left school at 16 to look after her son. Under Labour\u2019s policy, she said, \u201cwhether you left school with no GCSEs or 10, your ability to pay or your willingness to take on debt will not determine whether you get the education you need\u201d.

Just anecdotally, the atmosphere is warm here, but the audience doesn\u2019t seem quite as big, as young or as lively as the most memorable Labour events I went to during the 2017 campaign. Back then, some Corbyn fans were coming from miles around just to get a glimpse of their man. Labour campaigners I chatted to here said they were finding a lot of \u201cundecideds\u201d on the doorstep. Perhaps enthusiasm will build as we get closer to 12 December? We\u2019ll see. Meanwhile Corbyn told reporters that British voters were now at risk from a Trump/Farage/Johnson alliance that would threaten the NHS, workers\u2019 rights and safe food. Labour has described a Tory claim that personal taxes would go up by \u00a32,400 a head under a Corbyn government as \u201cfake news\u201d. It is. The costings on which the claim is based are flawed, making it even more dubious than these election projections normally are. Nigel Farage has branded Conservative calls for the Brexit party to stand down in Labour marginals as \u201calmost comical\u201d, saying his party needs to get MPs into parliament to hold Johnson\u2019s feet to the fire. But Farage has also faced a backlash from some of the Brexit party candidates asked to stand down, with one saying he only learned the news when a passing driver asked him why he was still campaigning. Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Corbyn have led tributes to Frank Dobson, the former Labour health secretary, who has died at the age of 79. An MP for 36 years, socialist, campaigner, loyalist, wit and raconteur, he was widely admired, and even more widely liked. Labour\u2019s Anna Turley, who is suing the union Unite, has told the high court that the party has moved too far to the left under Corbyn and has refused to apologise for insulting the union\u2019s leader, Len McCluskey. The Labour party has faced a second cyber-attack in two days, after experiencing what it called a \u201csophisticated and large-scale\u201d attempt to disrupt its digital systems. Labour has responded to a backlash among voters of Indian heritage in the UK by shifting its stance on the Kashmir dispute and insisting it is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan in which Labour will not interfere.

If the Australian is not in Melbourne, Williams will not be bothered. But she will seriously love to prove she is as good as Court was. And then there would be the irresistible urge to put the issue beyond argument and win one more to be hailed, unequivocally, as the greatest player of all time \u2013 as Andy Murray described her earlier this year. Champions need something more than a mere trophy to inspire them. They need rivalry to validate their own assessment of their gifts. Just as Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have lifted each other to dizzy levels for more than 15 years \u2013 with no immediate end in sight, barring injuries \u2013 so Williams carries on, determined to beat an opponent who first ruled their sport 50 years ago \u2013 and is still not satisfied.",

While cameras in recent days have been trained on and around Doncaster, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2019/nov/08/flooding-in-yorkshire-in-pictures\" title=\"\">dramatic pictures</a> from the village of Fishlake and suburb of Bentley showed people being towed along red-brick residential streets in inflatable boats \u2013 and where the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, paid a visit \u2013 the affected area stretches south along the course of the river Don through Rotherham and Sheffield, and on to Lincolnshire and Derbyshire, where the river Derwent burst its banks last week.</p> \n<p>Road closures, buildings underwater so that residents who have chosen to stay are stuck upstairs, thousands more homes evacuated while gardens are turned into lakes, transport chaos (Rotherham\u2019s railway station, for example, currently resembles a canal), volunteers ferrying neighbours and journalists around, police standing guard to ward off looters \u2013 the chaos creates a kind of spectacle while it lasts, and opportunities for generosity as well as danger. But one resident, Sue Marshall, surely spoke for many when she said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/12/boris-johnson-accused-of-outrageous-lack-of-concern-about-floods\" title=\"\">she feared becoming old news very fast</a>. \u201cWhat we need to know is that in two months\u2019 time, the MPs will look at what has been done to stop it happening again.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is in the nature of an election campaign that politicians seek to capitalise on events such as the past week\u2019s record-breaking rainfall (114mm fell in Derbyshire in 24 hours \u2013 more than a normal month\u2019s total) to expose their opponents\u2019 weaknesses. Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to convene a Cobra meeting on Tuesday came after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, suggested that floods in Surrey would have been more likely to prompt the declaration of a national emergency. But while the reaction of Doncaster council has been criticised by residents \u2013 health and safety concerns having prevented officials from joining rescue efforts \u2013 and local flood defence schemes, as well as land use and planning decisions, will rightly be scrutinised once the waters have retreated, there is no suggestion that government agencies or the emergency services failed to respond appropriately.</p> \n<p>Spending on flood defences was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/28/flood-defences-row-uk-paying-price-david-cameron-tories-broken-promises\" title=\"\">cut by David Cameron</a>, despite research showing that increased flooding is the greatest threat to the UK from global heating. In 2013 the number of officials working on national adaptation was cut from 38 to six. Since then, climate scientists\u2019 predictions appear to have come true with the frequency of floods increasing, and the two wettest winters on record in 2013-14 and 2015-16. Funding has again been increased, and natural flood prevention schemes such as tree planting and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/12/flooding-caused-by-poor-management-and-floodplain-building\" title=\"\">moorland restoration</a> are being tried \u2013 although not yet on the scale that will be needed if future disasters are to be averted.</p> \n<p>Those residents who have seen homes and possessions destroyed, particularly those who lack insurance, deserve sympathy and assistance. But, as with the catastrophic fires currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/nov/12/nsw-fires-qld-bushfires-queensland-australia-new-south-wales-catastrophic-fire-danger-warning-emergency-sydney-illawarra-hunter-shoalhaven\" title=\"\">raging in Australia</a>, the only rational response to these floods is to redouble every effort to treat increasing climate chaos as the global emergency it is.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The death of Annie Hall, the former high sheriff of Derbyshire who was swept away by floodwater last Friday in Darley Dale near Matlock, was the saddest and most shocking consequence so far of the destruction wreaked across northern parts of England over the past week. While cameras in recent days have been trained on and around Doncaster, where dramatic pictures from the village of Fishlake and suburb of Bentley showed people being towed along red-brick residential streets in inflatable boats \u2013 and where the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, paid a visit \u2013 the affected area stretches south along the course of the river Don through Rotherham and Sheffield, and on to Lincolnshire and Derbyshire, where the river Derwent burst its banks last week. Road closures, buildings underwater so that residents who have chosen to stay are stuck upstairs, thousands more homes evacuated while gardens are turned into lakes, transport chaos (Rotherham\u2019s railway station, for example, currently resembles a canal), volunteers ferrying neighbours and journalists around, police standing guard to ward off looters \u2013 the chaos creates a kind of spectacle while it lasts, and opportunities for generosity as well as danger. But one resident, Sue Marshall, surely spoke for many when she said that she feared becoming old news very fast. \u201cWhat we need to know is that in two months\u2019 time, the MPs will look at what has been done to stop it happening again.\u201d It is in the nature of an election campaign that politicians seek to capitalise on events such as the past week\u2019s record-breaking rainfall (114mm fell in Derbyshire in 24 hours \u2013 more than a normal month\u2019s total) to expose their opponents\u2019 weaknesses. Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to convene a Cobra meeting on Tuesday came after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, suggested that floods in Surrey would have been more likely to prompt the declaration of a national emergency. But while the reaction of Doncaster council has been criticised by residents \u2013 health and safety concerns having prevented officials from joining rescue efforts \u2013 and local flood defence schemes, as well as land use and planning decisions, will rightly be scrutinised once the waters have retreated, there is no suggestion that government agencies or the emergency services failed to respond appropriately. Spending on flood defences was cut by David Cameron, despite research showing that increased flooding is the greatest threat to the UK from global heating. In 2013 the number of officials working on national adaptation was cut from 38 to six. Since then, climate scientists\u2019 predictions appear to have come true with the frequency of floods increasing, and the two wettest winters on record in 2013-14 and 2015-16. Funding has again been increased, and natural flood prevention schemes such as tree planting and moorland restoration are being tried \u2013 although not yet on the scale that will be needed if future disasters are to be averted. Those residents who have seen homes and possessions destroyed, particularly those who lack insurance, deserve sympathy and assistance. But, as with the catastrophic fires currently raging in Australia, the only rational response to these floods is to redouble every effort to treat increasing climate chaos as the global emergency it is.",

The first two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday are William Taylor, the acting ambassador in Kyiv who told investigators in closed-door hearings Trump \u201cwas adamant\u201d about the need for a public announcement of investigations by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy; and state department deputy assistant secretary George Kent, who said Trump \u201cwanted nothing less than President Zelenskiy to go to a microphone and say \u2018investigations\u2019, \u2018Biden\u2019, and \u2018Clinton\u2019\u201d. Clinton was a reference to a conspiracy theory about 2016 election tampering that Trump credited, witnesses have said. A third witness, the former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, was to testify on Friday. The intelligence committee announced late on Tuesday that an additional eight witnesses, including almost every witness to have been deposed behind closed doors, would be called to appear in public next week. Jockeying over testimony continues: on Tuesday the White House acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, became the latest senior Trump aide to say he would defy a congressional subpoena. Public testimony is expected to last about two weeks. After that, the House is expected to hold an impeachment vote. If Trump were impeached, requiring a straight majority, the proceedings would move to the Senate, where a two-thirds majority vote would remove Trump from office. In the most recent presidential impeachment, in 1998, Bill Clinton was impeached in the House but acquitted in the Senate, and remained in office. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the intelligence committee, sent colleagues a memo on Tuesday reminding them that the impeachment hearings were \u201ca sober and rigorous undertaking\u201d. \u201cThe hearings will be conducted in a manner that ensures that all participants are treated fairly and with respect, mindful of the solemn and historic task before us,\u201d Schiff wrote. He told colleagues he intended to turn over a significant portion of his time for questioning to a committee lawyer, Daniel Goldman, a former federal prosecutor with experience in cases on organized crime. The Republicans circulated a memo of their own, laying out talking points for defending the president. Trump\u2019s \u201cstate of mind\u201d during a 25 July phone call with Zelenskiy in which he said \u201cthe United States has been very very good to Ukraine\u201d and then asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d was not cued to his own personal political interests, the memo argues, but to corruption in Ukraine. The memo also urges Republicans to argue that \u201cthe evidence gathered does not establish an impeachable offense\u201d. Democrats argue that Trump\u2019s actions amounted to an abuse of power falling within the category of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d mentioned in the constitution as grounds for impeachment. The phrase was borrowed from British law, said Brettschneider, and \u201creferred to the idea of an abuse of power\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d say there certainly is enough evidence already to show that Trump has committed a high crime and misdemeanor,\u201d he said. While members of Congress will vote on impeachment, precedent indicates that Trump\u2019s political fate, even before the 2020 election, lies in public opinion. Televised hearings in the impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon quickly swung public opinion against him, causing Republicans to pressure him to resign, Pew Research has noted. In his memo, Schiff seemed conscious that the goal of televised hearings was to present the case to voters with a minimum of partisan sniping that could cause viewers to write off the proceedings as another Washington melodrama. \u201cLike the depositions preceding them,\u201d Schiff wrote, \u201cthese hearings will address subjects of profound consequence for the Nation and the functioning of our government under the constitution.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The UK\u2019s privacy regulator has criticised the Department for Education (DfE) for secretly sharing children\u2019s personal data with the Home Office, triggering fears it could be used for immigration enforcement as part of the government\u2019s hostile environment policy.</p> <p>Acting on a complaint by the campaigning organisation, Against Borders for Children (ABC), the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) ruled that the DfE had failed to comply fully with its data protection obligations and may face further regulatory action.</p> <p>Pupil data is routinely collected by schools, according to the human rights organisation Liberty, representing the complainant, but teachers and parents were unaware in this case that the children\u2019s information could be shared with immigration enforcement and result in their families being deported.</p> <p>In a letter to Liberty, seen by the Guardian, the ICO says its investigations team is now considering whether to take further action against the DfE for \u201cwide ranging and serious concerns\u201d highlighted in this case and in response to further concerns raised by \u201ca number of other sources\u201d.</p> <p>The ICO only upheld part of the complaint, but its letter said concerns raised had \u201chighlighted deficiencies in the processing of pupil personal data by the DfE\u201d, adding: \u201cOur view is that the DfE is failing to comply fully with its data protection obligations, primarily in the areas of transparency and accountability, where there are far reaching issues, impacting a huge number of individuals in a variety of ways.\u201d</p> <p>According to Liberty, the complaint arose out of events which followed the signing of a memorandum of understanding in June 2015, by which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/15/pupil-data-shared-with-home-office-to-identify-illegal-migrants\">the DfE agreed to pass the personal details of up to 1,500 school children to the Home Office each month</a> as part of a policy to create a hostile environment for migrants.</p> <p>Parents and campaigners became concerned the following year when the DfE asked schools to start collecting data on children\u2019s nationality and country of birth. This resulted in a mass boycott by families who were worried it might be used for immigration enforcement.</p> <p>Following legal action brought in April 2018 by ABC, again represented by Liberty, the DfE announced it would no longer ask schools to collect nationality and country of birth data but, according to Liberty, the DfE\u2019s actions left many parents afraid to send their children to school.</p> <p>Liberty lawyer Lara ten Caten said: \u201cData sharing is just one part of the government\u2019s discredited hostile environment which has left people too afraid to do things like send their children to school, report crime or seek medical help.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s privacy regulator has criticised the Department for Education (DfE) for secretly sharing children\u2019s personal data with the Home Office, triggering fears it could be used for immigration enforcement as part of the government\u2019s hostile environment policy. Acting on a complaint by the campaigning organisation, Against Borders for Children (ABC), the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) ruled that the DfE had failed to comply fully with its data protection obligations and may face further regulatory action. Pupil data is routinely collected by schools, according to the human rights organisation Liberty, representing the complainant, but teachers and parents were unaware in this case that the children\u2019s information could be shared with immigration enforcement and result in their families being deported. In a letter to Liberty, seen by the Guardian, the ICO says its investigations team is now considering whether to take further action against the DfE for \u201cwide ranging and serious concerns\u201d highlighted in this case and in response to further concerns raised by \u201ca number of other sources\u201d. The ICO only upheld part of the complaint, but its letter said concerns raised had \u201chighlighted deficiencies in the processing of pupil personal data by the DfE\u201d, adding: \u201cOur view is that the DfE is failing to comply fully with its data protection obligations, primarily in the areas of transparency and accountability, where there are far reaching issues, impacting a huge number of individuals in a variety of ways.\u201d According to Liberty, the complaint arose out of events which followed the signing of a memorandum of understanding in June 2015, by which the DfE agreed to pass the personal details of up to 1,500 school children to the Home Office each month as part of a policy to create a hostile environment for migrants. Parents and campaigners became concerned the following year when the DfE asked schools to start collecting data on children\u2019s nationality and country of birth. This resulted in a mass boycott by families who were worried it might be used for immigration enforcement. Following legal action brought in April 2018 by ABC, again represented by Liberty, the DfE announced it would no longer ask schools to collect nationality and country of birth data but, according to Liberty, the DfE\u2019s actions left many parents afraid to send their children to school. Liberty lawyer Lara ten Caten said: \u201cData sharing is just one part of the government\u2019s discredited hostile environment which has left people too afraid to do things like send their children to school, report crime or seek medical help. It\u2019s time to redesign our immigration system so it respects people\u2019s rights and treats everyone with dignity.\u201d Liberty called on the DfE to delete children\u2019s nationality and country of birth data that had been collected and urged all political parties to make manifesto commitments to introduce a data firewall which separated public services from immigration enforcement. The ABC\u2019s Kojo Kyerewaa said: \u201cThe ICO decision has shown that the DfE cannot be trusted with children\u2019s personal data. Without public debate or clear notification, schools have been covertly incorporated as part of Home Office immigration enforcement. These checks have put vulnerable children in further danger as parents are taken away via immigration detention and forced removals.\u201d The DfE, unable to respond because of general election purdah constraints, referred to answers to earlier parliamentary questions, which said the department collected data on the nationality and country of birth of pupils via the school census between autumn 2016 and summer 2018. \u201cThe Home Office can only request information from the Department for Education for immigration enforcement purposes in circumstances where they have clear evidence a child may be at risk or there is evidence of illegal activity, including illegal immigration,\u201d it said. An ICO spokesperson said: \u201cAs a non-departmental government body, the ICO has to consider its responsibilities during the pre-election period. Our regulatory work continues as usual but we will not be commenting publicly on every issue raised during the general election. We will, however, be closely monitoring how personal data is being used during political campaigning and making sure that all parties and campaigns are aware of their responsibilities under data protection and direct marketing laws.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "John McDonnell has accused McDonald\u2019s of failing to pay enough tax in Britain and demanded a wage rise for its workers and trade union rights to organise at its restaurants. Speaking at a protest arranged by striking McDonald\u2019s workers outside Downing Street, the shadow chancellor said the US company was mistreating its UK workers and should raise their pay to \u00a315 an hour and pay its fair share of tax. McDonnell told the Guardian: \u201cThey are one of those companies that makes large amounts of profits and then doesn\u2019t pay their workers properly and don\u2019t pay their taxes effectively. It\u2019s one of the things we will clamp down on. \u201cWe are saying to McDonald\u2019s: pay your workers a proper wage, treat them properly and actually also pay your taxes.\u201d Workers from six of the chain\u2019s restaurants were on strike to demand wages of at least \u00a315 an hour, mirroring a US campaign for fast-food workers to earn $15 an hour. Significantly higher than the government minimum wage of \u00a38.21 an hour for over-25s, the demand is also higher than Labour\u2019s policy to raise the minimum wage to at least \u00a310 an hour, including for younger workers. McDonnell said he supported the workers\u2019 demand for \u00a315 an hour at McDonald\u2019s. The shadow chancellor said the US company\u2019s executives were paid millions of pounds a year, while some UK workers lived a \u201cpoverty existence\u201d, resorting to food banks and sofa surfing. McDonald\u2019s allowed its outgoing chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, to keep stock awards worth more than $37m this month, as well as about $675,000 (\u00a3524,000) in severance pay, despite him being fired for having a consensual relationship with an employee. Filings with Companies House show McDonald\u2019s paid \u00a375m in UK corporation tax last year, up from \u00a364.9m in 2017. It made pre-tax profits of \u00a3406.3m, up from \u00a3341m in 2017, despite a slide in sales of almost \u00a380m to \u00a31.5bn. The EU ruled last year that an arrangement between McDonald\u2019s and Luxembourg, which allowed the firm to pay almost no tax on franchise royalties in the EU and US, did not break Brussels\u2019 laws. McDonald\u2019s said as few as nine of about 130,000 of its employees in Britain were on strike. It did not respond to requests for comment about its tax affairs. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to investing in our workforce, listening to and doing what is right by them.\u201d McDonald\u2019s added that it complied with UK tax rules, saying: \u201cWe pay substantial amounts of corporation tax in the UK.\u201d",

The Guardian revealed last month that the government had accused the Trump Organization of refusing to pay its legal costs despite a court order earlier this year after Trump lost a UK supreme court case in 2015.

The employment rate fell slightly in the latest three months from 76.1% of the working age population to 76%. The decline in part-time roles occupied by women is likely to reflect a tougher environment in the high street, where businesses have been struggling with business rates and an above-inflation increase in the minimum wage. The fall in employment coupled with a modest growth in the economy during the third quarter of 2019 meant productivity \u2013 or output per hour worked \u2013 rose by 0.3%. Over the 12 months to September, however, productivity was flat, continuing its weak performance in the period since the financial crisis and economic slump of 2008. Inactivity \u2013 the number of people of working age who have stopped looking for a job \u2013 also rose and their removal from the jobless count meant unemployment fell in the latest quarter by 23,000 to 1,306,000. The unemployment rate dipped from 3.9% to 3.8%, its joint lowest since the winter of 1974-75. The fall in employment was accompanied by an easing of annual earnings growth to 3.6% on both the measures used by the ONS \u2013 including and excluding bonuses. Real earnings, pay packets adjusted for inflation, are estimated to be up by 1.8% including bonuses and by 1.7% excluding bonuses, helping to underpin consumer spending. But the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cWorking families are thousands of pounds out of pocket after a decade of dismal pay growth. That is not right. The Conservatives have presided over the longest wage squeeze since Napoleonic times. They have nothing to boast about.\u201d Chris Williamson, the chief economist at IHS/Markit, said news on Monday that the economy had contracted in both August and September had \u201cbeen swiftly followed by a warning of how the growing economic malaise is feeding through to the labour market. Official data from the Office for National Statistics showed employers cutting headcounts at the fastest rate for four years in the third quarter.\u201d",

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His deputy prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/12/for-us-farmers-climate-change-is-the-headline-to-our-lives-but-mccormacks-nationals-avert-their-gaze\">Michael McCormack</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/12/for-us-farmers-climate-change-is-the-headline-to-our-lives-but-mccormacks-nationals-avert-their-gaze\">, from the country-based Nationals party</a>, said concerns over climate change while fires were burning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/11/dear-michael-mccormack-the-only-raving-lunatics-are-those-not-worrying-about-climate-change\">were a \u201cdisgrace\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t need the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies at this time.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7893e663-b7b9-4824-989c-291a195f7caa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nxpKvkbPFqw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But critics \u2013 some of whom had lost homes in the fires \u2013 argued the fires presented the reality of the impact of the climate crisis.</p> \n<p>As Morrison visited a fire command site in northern NSW, a protester heckled: \u201cClimate change is real.

After relief that no further lives were lost on Tuesday, concern was growing over unpredictable winds worsening fires in the neighbouring state of Queensland on Wednesday, with much hotter temperatures also predicted for the Sydney area in the coming days. Gusty winds changing direction are predicted to fan flames in new directions and widen \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fire fronts in Queensland and northern NSW, where more than 100 fires \u2013 one more than 150,000 hectares (370,000 acres) in size \u2013 are burning.

An extreme and persistent drought has left much of the two states tinder-dry, with forests, grasslands, and farmland vulnerable to dry lightning strikes or accidental blazes. Three people died in out-of-control bushfires at the weekend, two of them apparently trying to flee fast-moving fire fronts in cars.

They are extremely drained but they are passionate and steadfast in their resolve to do the very best they can for their community,\u201d added Fitzsimmons. On Tuesday, hundreds of schools were closed, and entire towns evacuated, as temperatures in the high 30s celsius and gusty winds fanned dozens of existing fires across NSW and Queensland. NSW had declared an unprecedented \u201ccatastrophic\u201d rating for Sydney and surrounding regions for Tuesday, when firefighting conditions were at their worst.

There were more than 70 fires burning across the state, and more than 40 were out of control. There are suspicions a fire in the northern Sydney suburb of Turramurra may have been deliberately lit. In Queensland, 50 fires were burning, according to state authorities.

Half a century after the advent of colour on the BBC, there are still 1,311 black and white permit holders in London, while Birmingham has 323 and Manchester has 245. We want to hear from people who still watch television without colour. Was your decision fuelled by nostalgia? Is your household \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 in other senses? Do you do it because it\u2019s cheaper than paying for a colour licence? Does it make it difficult to watch modern programmes?

Perhaps Johnson thought he\u2019d already done his bit, after footage had emerged of him attempting to mop the floor of a Specsavers in Derbyshire last Friday. The widespread verdict was that Johnson appeared to be actually making it worse \u2013 possibly understandable given his previous attempts to actually increase the volume of water in public life, via the purchase of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/19/boris-johnson-unused-water-cannon-sold-for-scrap-at-300000-loss\">three water cannon as London mayor</a>.</p> <p>Indeed, it was this latter period of public office which established that glacial responses to situations requiring leadership are something of a speciality for Johnson. When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/london-riots-escalate-police-battle\">London riots broke out in 2011</a>, the mayor was holidaying in a Winnebago in the Canadian Rockies, and deeply resisted backstage efforts to bring him back to work as public fury mounted.</p> <p>The official contortions to cover him became ever more ingenious. Some days in, his deputy mayor for policing, Kit Malthouse \u2013 who would go on to star in miscast vanity vehicle The Malthouse Compromise \u2013 explained it would be \u201crewarding\u201d the rioters for Boris to return. \u201cHe is not going to come back and allow these criminals to set the agenda.\u201d David Cameron\u2019s increasingly irate Downing Street briefed that it was \u201cincredible\u201d that Johnson hadn\u2019t returned. Alas, when the imperative to do so could no longer be ignored, Johnson contrived to perform even worse. A televised visit to Clapham saw his usual shtick fail to wash with Londoners whose businesses had been vandalised, with the lack of empathy widely criticised. The visit almost ended with locals chanting \u201cthree days too late!\u201d at his departing back.</p> <p>Almost, but not quite. Towards the end of the walkabout, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-14462001/london-mayor-boris-johnson-carries-riot-clean-up-brush\">Johnson grabbed a broom off a bystander and waved it about</a>, and thus ended up starring in a welter of press coverage suggesting he was mucking in with the clean-up. So perhaps he will expunge his current unforced error with a leadership-effect turn for the news bulletins. And perhaps he\u2019ll get his hands dirty in the election campaign, if not the flood region, in the days ahead. But at present the general impression given is of a highly-strung animal who can only be produced on extremely select occasions, and for lightning bursts. A bit like the show dog in The Big Lebowski which has to be handled with great care, otherwise \u201cit gets upset and its hair falls out\u201d. Is it all a brilliant strategy on the Tories\u2019 part \u2013 or are they just afraid the prime minister will hump someone\u2019s leg?</p>",

With that in the diary, though, the airwaves were left to his opponents for most of the day. Perhaps Johnson thought he\u2019d already done his bit, after footage had emerged of him attempting to mop the floor of a Specsavers in Derbyshire last Friday. The widespread verdict was that Johnson appeared to be actually making it worse \u2013 possibly understandable given his previous attempts to actually increase the volume of water in public life, via the purchase of three water cannon as London mayor. Indeed, it was this latter period of public office which established that glacial responses to situations requiring leadership are something of a speciality for Johnson. When the London riots broke out in 2011, the mayor was holidaying in a Winnebago in the Canadian Rockies, and deeply resisted backstage efforts to bring him back to work as public fury mounted. The official contortions to cover him became ever more ingenious. Some days in, his deputy mayor for policing, Kit Malthouse \u2013 who would go on to star in miscast vanity vehicle The Malthouse Compromise \u2013 explained it would be \u201crewarding\u201d the rioters for Boris to return. \u201cHe is not going to come back and allow these criminals to set the agenda.\u201d David Cameron\u2019s increasingly irate Downing Street briefed that it was \u201cincredible\u201d that Johnson hadn\u2019t returned. Alas, when the imperative to do so could no longer be ignored, Johnson contrived to perform even worse. A televised visit to Clapham saw his usual shtick fail to wash with Londoners whose businesses had been vandalised, with the lack of empathy widely criticised. The visit almost ended with locals chanting \u201cthree days too late!\u201d at his departing back. Almost, but not quite. Towards the end of the walkabout, Johnson grabbed a broom off a bystander and waved it about, and thus ended up starring in a welter of press coverage suggesting he was mucking in with the clean-up. So perhaps he will expunge his current unforced error with a leadership-effect turn for the news bulletins. And perhaps he\u2019ll get his hands dirty in the election campaign, if not the flood region, in the days ahead. But at present the general impression given is of a highly-strung animal who can only be produced on extremely select occasions, and for lightning bursts. A bit like the show dog in The Big Lebowski which has to be handled with great care, otherwise \u201cit gets upset and its hair falls out\u201d. Is it all a brilliant strategy on the Tories\u2019 part \u2013 or are they just afraid the prime minister will hump someone\u2019s leg?",

Stephen Burke Director, United for All Ages \u2022 As someone who runs 39 social enterprise nurseries across London and subsidises 35% of the places for children who can least afford them, I welcome the promise by the Lib Dems to provide 35 hours of free childcare (Report, 9 November), and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s pledge to expand free childcare to all two- to four-year-olds (Report, 12 November). But the big question is when will politicians drop the \u201cfree\u201d tag, as quality childcare is not free. Insufficient funding has been problematic for ever and this is no surprise because there is cross-party agreement that it needs to be reviewed. The consequences of a stubborn refusal to fund childcare are nurseries closing, childminder numbers declining, staff leaving the sector and quality reducing. Is this what MPs mean by investment in children and families? Evidence shows that a quality early years education gives every child the best start in life. If ministers can\u2019t get the basics right, how do our children stand a chance?

A senior boss at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) \u2013 which is in charge of policing bankers and financial firms \u2013 has written to staff over their bad behaviour at the watchdog\u2019s \u00a360m office in Stratford, east London. \u201cYou may have heard about some of these behaviours already and I\u2019m sure others will come as a shock,\u201d the FCA\u2019s chief operating officer, Georgina Philippou, said in a note published on the authority\u2019s internal website. She reprimanded staff for a list of unpleasant practices, including: \u201cLeaving cutlery and crockery in the kitchen areas, overflowing bins, stealing plants and charging cables from desks, catering and security teams being subject to verbal abuse, colleagues defecating on the floor in toilet cubicles on a particular floor, urinating on the floor in the men\u2019s toilets and leaving alcohol bottles in sanitary bins.\u201d Philippou\u2019s note, first reported by the Evening Standard, blamed the incidents on a \u201cminority of colleagues\u201d across the near 4,000-strong workforce but warned their bad manners and habits could not continue. \u201cI did think long and hard about whether to disclose all these behaviours because they are so distasteful and shameful but keeping quiet has not got us far in terms of changing ... This kind of behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated here.\u201d It is an embarrassing admission by the City regulator, which is headed up by Andrew Bailey, believed to be a top contender in the race to replace the the Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney. The FCA made its long-awaited move from Canary Wharf, which had been its home since the 1990s, last summer. But within weeks of moving to its new headquarters near east London\u2019s Olympic Park, the regulator was plagued by water supply issues, and was forced to send hundreds of staff home after water dried up in the building\u2019s toilets. Fitting out the 15-floor building cost the watchdog, which is funded by member fees, around \u00a360m. The FCA said in a statement: \u201cThere has been a small number of incidents of bad behaviour towards our colleagues and building. We have a duty as an employer to highlight this sort of poor behaviour and our senior management are very clear it is simply unacceptable. \u201cWe value all of our staff and it is only right that we call out poor behaviour when we see it. Judging from the feedback we have received on the article, our staff agree.\u201d",

The outrage over these cases can be traced back to the spectacular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/07/british-troops-war-crimes-iraq-historic-allegations-team\" title=\"\">failure of the Iraq Historic Allegations Team</a> (Ihat), an investigative body set up in the last days of Gordon Brown\u2019s government in 2010. With allegations of military misconduct in Iraq coming thick and fast, Ihat was intended to draw a line under the grossly unpopular war. It aimed to investigate credible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/british-army-abuses-iraq-compensation\" title=\"\">claims of abuse in Iraq</a> and secure criminal prosecutions where appropriate. But by February 2017, Ihat was the centre of a national scandal. An unexpected volume of cases coupled with poor oversight meant that investigations floundered, and in some cases soldiers were treated inappropriately, with, for instance, Ihat investigators turning up at their place of work with no prior warning. The way that Ihat was structured meant a focus on criminal culpability for individual soldiers, but no remit to examine the chain of command or bigger systemic problems with the military that might have been implicated too. This led to cases where soldiers were investigated for things they were ordered to do. Many felt betrayed by the army.</p> <p>Yet the focus ended up not on the army, but on the lawyers representing Iraqis. Phil Shiner, one of the human rights lawyers most active in gathering allegations from Iraqis and taking them to Ihat, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/02/iraq-human-rights-lawyer-phil-shiner-disqualified-for-professional-misconduct\" title=\"\">struck off as a solicitor</a> over his conduct in a separate public inquiry. Known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/al-sweady-inquiry\" title=\"\">Al-Sweady inquiry</a>, it looked at extreme allegations of wrongdoing in Iraq that were found to be baseless. Although this was not directly related to his work on Ihat, Shiner was found to have a lack of integrity, and his downfall was used to discredit all his cases as \u201cspurious\u201d. After a damning House of Commons report around the same time, the government closed Ihat.</p> <p>During the seven years that Ihat ran, public opinion in the UK shifted, from anger about the war to anger at those pursuing cases against soldiers. This is politically convenient for the army and the Ministry of Defence, which would rather avoid big questions about accountability. Yet this shift leaves serious questions unanswered: about the scale of abuses, who should be held accountable and how they should be held to account. Critics of the military argue that internal investigations processes are not fit for purpose. (After a trial over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/19/uk-army-investigators-under-fire-as-bullying-trial-collapses\" title=\"\">bullying of teenage recruits</a> collapsed last year, the Peace Pledge Union said, \u201cThe armed forces should not be allowed to police themselves.\u201d) In the context of battlefield crimes, this is evidenced by dropped charges or light sentencing. Corporal Donald Payne is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/01/military.iraq\" title=\"\">only British soldier ever convicted</a> of a war crime; he served one year in 2007 over the killing of Baha Mousa, a hotel receptionist tortured to death by British soldiers. Some of the soldiers involved in Camp Breadbasket \u2013 an early case of horrendous abuse of civilians in Iraq \u2013 received sentences of only five months. The longest was for a soldier photographed lifting an Iraqi prisoner with the prongs of a forklift truck. He served 18 months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/05/brexiters-ireland-civil-war-troubled-past\">Brexiters evoking Ireland\u2019s civil war should be careful what they wish for | Fintan O\u2019Toole</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Questions of moral and legal responsibility are particularly complex when it comes to Northern Ireland.

There has always been far more to the place \u2013 too much, in fact \u2013 so here\u2019s our guide to the best things to see and do in Bradford: Prashad Bradford takes curry incredibly seriously (it has won the award for UK\u2019s curry capital six times) and Prashad, with its exclusively vegetarian menu, is still the pick for many Bradfordians. The restaurant\u2019s Mayur Patel recently co-founded Bundobust, a chain of vegetarian Indian eateries that boasts an impeccable selection of beers. Karachi Rick Stein\u2019s favourite curry house comes a close second, and it still lives up to the decade-old Guardian review that said the food was so \u201cblisteringly good that basic good manners demanded it be shovelled in with bare hands\u201d. Waterside Bistro If you don\u2019t fancy curry, there is the this bistro in Shipley, which proudly boasts of its northern produce (\u201cCheese from Castleford, herbs from York and our fish from Hartlepool,\u201d says co-owner Ian Johnson).

Many affected areas, including Meadowhall shopping centre, where customers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/08/we-had-to-buy-blankets-floods-force-shoppers-to-spend-night-in-meadowhall\">stranded overnight</a>, lie within the river\u2019s floodplain \u2013 low-lying land next to the river that naturally floods during high flow.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is only a problem if you develop floodplains by building houses, businesses and factories on them, which is obviously what we have done over the years, so to some degree it\u2019s a problem of our own making,\u201d said Roy Mosley, the head of conservation and land management at Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust.</p> \n<p>The risk faced by floodplain communities is exacerbated by the management of land upstream of the city. Intensive animal grazing leads to short grass and compacted soil, which is less able to absorb and hold water. There are no longer enough trees and plants to absorb rain and stop it from running straight into the river, Mosley said.</p> \n<p>There are similar problems in Derbyshire, where the River Derwent burst its banks last week, forcing hundreds out of their homes and businesses, and leading to the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/09/severe-flood-warnings-remain-in-midlands-and-north-of-england\">former county high sheriff Annie Hall</a>.</p> \n<p>Matt Buckler, the head of nature recovery networks at Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, said the fact that fields below the river level remained dry while towns flooded exposed the problems with our rural land. \u201cIt would have been easy to reduce the level of the river by 10-15 centimetres by letting those fields flood.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople last week said \u2018Oh, we were very lucky, if the water had been a centimetre higher it would have come into the house\u2019. So reducing flood levels by just one or two centimetres can have a massive impact on people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/11/we-cant-go-fishlake-residents-defy-floodwaters-and-authorities\">'We can't go': Fishlake residents defy flood waters and authorities</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Increased flooding is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/12/uk-poorly-prepared-for-climate-change-impacts-government-advisers-warn\">biggest impact on the UK</a> of the climate crisis, according to the government\u2019s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. In July, the CCC said there were no areas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/10/uks-preparation-for-climate-crisis-like-dads-army\">where the government was preparing properly for climate impacts</a>, though it said flood planning was making progress \u2013 with the exception of flash flooding.</p> \n<p>Met Office data shows the amount of <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/understanding-climate/uk-extreme-events-_heavy-rainfall-and-floods\">rain from extremely wet days has increased by 17%</a>, when comparing 2008-17 records with those from 1961-90. The two wettest winters on record were 2013-14 and 2015-16. The Met Office calculates that an extended period of extreme winter rainfall in the UK, similar to winter 2013-14, is now about seven times more likely because of climate breakdown.</p> \n<p>One reason is that warmer air can contain more water vapour. Another likely reason is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">effect of global heating on the jet stream</a>. Its normal meandering across the nation appears to be slowing, meaning rain falls for longer on one region, increasing the risk of floods.</p> \n<p>Mosley said: \u201cThe last big flood in [South Yorkshire] and in much of the country was in 2007. At one time that would have been considered a one-in-100 flood, but here we are now just 12 years later with another flood that is actually bigger. We\u2019re going from something very infrequent to potentially something almost regular.\u201d</p> \n<p>The wildlife trust has worked on schemes such as the installation of the 4.5-hectare (11-acre) <a href=\"https://www.wildsheffield.com/reserves/centenary-riverside/\">Centenary Riverside flood storage area in Rotherham</a>. \u201cLast week it was full to the brim and clearly if that water wasn\u2019t there it would be somewhere else, probably in someone\u2019s business,\u201d said Mosley.</p> \n<p>The organisation is also working upstream in the hills above Sheffield to install water storage ponds and ditches, plant trees and manage livestock grazing. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging farmers to plough across slopes rather than up and down slope, which is mechanically easier but all that does is create water channels for water to rush off the hills,\u201d said Mosley. \u201cWe\u2019re delivering these measures across 14 sites but it needs to be 400.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"401dd6c12960d06c6f8dfcbe74125022fd8a3785\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/401dd6c12960d06c6f8dfcbe74125022fd8a3785/0_200_5923_3554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The hills above Glossop, Derbyshire, in the foothills of the Pennines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hills above Glossop, Derbyshire, in the foothills of the Pennines, where the wildlife trust is working to restore the moorlands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kearton/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, the conservation organisation Moors for the Future is working in the Pennines, where the River Don originates, to restore the moorlands, which were degraded by air pollution from previous industrial activity. They are reintroducing sphagnum moss, which was killed off by poor air quality but can store huge amounts of water.</p> \n<p>Chris Dean, the head of programme delivery for the group, said that while these efforts would not solve flooding problems, they should be considered as important as man-made flood defences. \u201cThere is no difference in my mind between getting sphagnum moss back on the top of the hill and building hard defences alongside the river.\u201d</p> \n<p>A previous project carried out by the group on <a href=\"https://www.moorsforthefuture.org.uk/our-work/our-projects/kinder-catchment-project\">the River Kinder</a> showed that moorland restoration can take 30% off the flood peak and reduce the time it takes water to leave the site by 20 minutes.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/29/deluge-farmers-flood-grouse-moor-drain-land\">burning and draining of moorland</a> to boost game bird populations for grouse shooting has also been blamed for increasing the risk of flooding across Yorkshire.</p> \n<p>In 2016, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/13/500000-tree-planting-project-helped-yorkshire-town-miss-winter-floods\">planting of 40,000 trees above Pickering</a> in North Yorkshire was credited with helping the frequently flooded town avert inundation during heavy rainfall by slowing the flow of water into the river and reducing its peak height. The \u00a3500,000 project was significantly cheaper than a proposed new flood wall.</p> \n<p>MPs criticised the government in 2016 over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/natural-measures-must-be-key-to-uk-flood-protection-mps-urge\">insufficient funding for natural ways to prevent floods</a>, including trees and putting logs in rivers to slow water flow. But scientists say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/11/planting-more-trees-can-reduce-uk-flooding-research-shows\">natural flood defences must be combined with conventional prevention techniques</a>.</p> \n<p>Prof Hannah Cloke, a hydrologist at the University of Reading, said more work could be done on the floodplain as well as in the uplands. \u201cYou can retrofit houses to be more resilient. If you are building on a floodplain because there\u2019s no other option at all, you can raise these buildings on stilts and make a space for the water to flow around the building. These technologies exist, but they are expensive and therefore are not popular with developers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Funding for flood defences in England was cut sharply after David Cameron became prime minister in 2010, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/16/flood-area-defences-funding-cuts\">delaying many schemes</a>. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/28/flood-defences-row-uk-paying-price-david-cameron-tories-broken-promises\">restored</a> after serious flooding hit many parts of the country. On Friday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-50380431\">said</a>: \u201cWe are seeing more and more serious flooding \u2013 perhaps because of building, almost certainly because of climate change.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dfb833f6-79e4-4cdc-8ffb-935295e0b413\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9I7HucHlYmU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Many affected areas, including Meadowhall shopping centre, where customers were stranded overnight, lie within the river\u2019s floodplain \u2013 low-lying land next to the river that naturally floods during high flow. \u201cThis is only a problem if you develop floodplains by building houses, businesses and factories on them, which is obviously what we have done over the years, so to some degree it\u2019s a problem of our own making,\u201d said Roy Mosley, the head of conservation and land management at Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust. The risk faced by floodplain communities is exacerbated by the management of land upstream of the city. Intensive animal grazing leads to short grass and compacted soil, which is less able to absorb and hold water. There are no longer enough trees and plants to absorb rain and stop it from running straight into the river, Mosley said. There are similar problems in Derbyshire, where the River Derwent burst its banks last week, forcing hundreds out of their homes and businesses, and leading to the death of former county high sheriff Annie Hall. Matt Buckler, the head of nature recovery networks at Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, said the fact that fields below the river level remained dry while towns flooded exposed the problems with our rural land. \u201cIt would have been easy to reduce the level of the river by 10-15 centimetres by letting those fields flood. \u201cPeople last week said \u2018Oh, we were very lucky, if the water had been a centimetre higher it would have come into the house\u2019. So reducing flood levels by just one or two centimetres can have a massive impact on people\u2019s lives.\u201d Increased flooding is the biggest impact on the UK of the climate crisis, according to the government\u2019s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. In July, the CCC said there were no areas where the government was preparing properly for climate impacts, though it said flood planning was making progress \u2013 with the exception of flash flooding. Met Office data shows the amount of rain from extremely wet days has increased by 17%, when comparing 2008-17 records with those from 1961-90. The two wettest winters on record were 2013-14 and 2015-16. The Met Office calculates that an extended period of extreme winter rainfall in the UK, similar to winter 2013-14, is now about seven times more likely because of climate breakdown. One reason is that warmer air can contain more water vapour. Another likely reason is the effect of global heating on the jet stream. Its normal meandering across the nation appears to be slowing, meaning rain falls for longer on one region, increasing the risk of floods. Mosley said: \u201cThe last big flood in [South Yorkshire] and in much of the country was in 2007. At one time that would have been considered a one-in-100 flood, but here we are now just 12 years later with another flood that is actually bigger. We\u2019re going from something very infrequent to potentially something almost regular.\u201d The wildlife trust has worked on schemes such as the installation of the 4.5-hectare (11-acre) Centenary Riverside flood storage area in Rotherham. \u201cLast week it was full to the brim and clearly if that water wasn\u2019t there it would be somewhere else, probably in someone\u2019s business,\u201d said Mosley. The organisation is also working upstream in the hills above Sheffield to install water storage ponds and ditches, plant trees and manage livestock grazing. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging farmers to plough across slopes rather than up and down slope, which is mechanically easier but all that does is create water channels for water to rush off the hills,\u201d said Mosley. \u201cWe\u2019re delivering these measures across 14 sites but it needs to be 400.\u201d Meanwhile, the conservation organisation Moors for the Future is working in the Pennines, where the River Don originates, to restore the moorlands, which were degraded by air pollution from previous industrial activity. They are reintroducing sphagnum moss, which was killed off by poor air quality but can store huge amounts of water. Chris Dean, the head of programme delivery for the group, said that while these efforts would not solve flooding problems, they should be considered as important as man-made flood defences. \u201cThere is no difference in my mind between getting sphagnum moss back on the top of the hill and building hard defences alongside the river.\u201d A previous project carried out by the group on the River Kinder showed that moorland restoration can take 30% off the flood peak and reduce the time it takes water to leave the site by 20 minutes. The burning and draining of moorland to boost game bird populations for grouse shooting has also been blamed for increasing the risk of flooding across Yorkshire. In 2016, the planting of 40,000 trees above Pickering in North Yorkshire was credited with helping the frequently flooded town avert inundation during heavy rainfall by slowing the flow of water into the river and reducing its peak height. The \u00a3500,000 project was significantly cheaper than a proposed new flood wall. MPs criticised the government in 2016 over insufficient funding for natural ways to prevent floods, including trees and putting logs in rivers to slow water flow. But scientists say that natural flood defences must be combined with conventional prevention techniques. Prof Hannah Cloke, a hydrologist at the University of Reading, said more work could be done on the floodplain as well as in the uplands. \u201cYou can retrofit houses to be more resilient. If you are building on a floodplain because there\u2019s no other option at all, you can raise these buildings on stilts and make a space for the water to flow around the building. These technologies exist, but they are expensive and therefore are not popular with developers.\u201d Funding for flood defences in England was cut sharply after David Cameron became prime minister in 2010, delaying many schemes. It was restored after serious flooding hit many parts of the country. On Friday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said: \u201cWe are seeing more and more serious flooding \u2013 perhaps because of building, almost certainly because of climate change.\u201d",

Just as well football is ultimately judged by the product on the pitch rather than its packaging off it. Thanks to the passion ignited by the Women\u2019s World Cup, the return of the Matildas to Australian shores and the new collective bargaining announcement \u2013 as well as the likelihood of more signings right up to Thursday night\u2019s kick-off \u2013 the 2019-20 W-League season looks set to inspire a new cluster of fans as it makes up for lost time.</p> <h2><strong>Adelaide United</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong>: Ivan Karlovi\u0107</p> <p><strong>Ins so far</strong>: Mary Fowler (Bankstown City FC), Ciara Fowler (Bankstown City FC), Julia Ashley (Link\u00f6pings FC), Mallory Weber (Utah Royals), Amber Brooks (Houston Dash), Evelyn Goldsmith (Adelaide University), Matilda McNamara (Adelaide City), Lais Araujo (Arna-Bj\u00f8rnar)</p> <p><strong>Outs/yet to re-sign</strong>: Emma Checker (Melbourne City), Gunnhildur J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir (Utah Royals), Veronica Latsko (Sydney FC), Fannd\u00eds Fri\u00f0riksd\u00f3ttir, Michelle Heyman, Georgia Iannella, Grace Abbey, Meleri Mullan, Lara Kirkby, Sian McLaren</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/12/w-league-2019-20-season-preview-10-reasons-to-be-excited\">W-League 2019-20 season preview: 10 reasons to be excited</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adelaide have had a tough time of it in the W-League. In their entire 10-year history, they have not finished higher than sixth \u2013 and that was last season. Their 2018-19 run took everyone by surprise, going unbeaten until round seven where they lost to eventual champions Sydney FC. Following some clever off-season recruiting in key areas of the field, Adelaide quickly became a dark horse for a top-four finish. Compared to seasons past, the team was far more balanced and threatening in the final third, but a series of poorly-timed losses towards the back-half of the season saw a first finals appearance slip from their grasp, missing out by one agonising point.</p> <p>With many local players returning, head coach Ivan Karlovi\u0107 will be hoping to build on last season\u2019s solid foundations. However, despite retaining stand-out centre-back Amber Brooks, the loss of captain Emma Checker, midfield workhorse Gunnhildur J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir and top scorer Veronica Latsko has weakened Adelaide\u2019s spine considerably. Despite recruiting Matildas starlet Mary Fowler alongside Americans Julia Ashley and Mallory Weber, a finals spot seems unlikely without another striker and a top-quality replacement for J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. With many clubs in the league leaning into local talent this season, it will be the Adelaide locals to keep an eye on, particularly midfielders Georgia Campagnale and Dylan Holmes, as well as goalkeeper Sarah Willacy, who recently earned her first call-up to the national side off the back of an exciting performance in 2018-19.

The departure of newly-capped Matilda Jenna McCormick leaves a hole in the defence, but the Roar\u2019s recruitment has a familiar flavour to it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7182a80d29a7fd7af711025bd2e3f20fa2f71d19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7182a80d29a7fd7af711025bd2e3f20fa2f71d19/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clare Polkinghorne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clare Polkinghorne will again lead out Brisbane this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Skipper and stalwart Clare Polkinghorne has re-signed as both a player and assistant coach while Hayley Raso, Katrina Gorry and Mackenzie Arnold have also returned along with foundation players Elise Kellond-Knight and all-time leading goalscorer (48 in 108 and counting) Tameka Yallop from Melbourne City. Isobel Dalton has been lured back from Nottingham Forest; so too the popular American defender Carson Pickett on loan from Orlando Pride for a third season and Portland Thorns midfielder Celeste Boureille. A host of young local talent has also be promoted.</p> <p>Being handed the first-round bye gives Brisbane an extra week of preparation, a boon in a league in which pre-seasons are short and sharp. While the Roar are top four regulars their challenge this season will be to convert this to premiership winning material as they did back in 2017-18. Brisbane are known for their consistency in the league, which unfortunately has also manifested as consistently failing to reprise their top two league finishes as playoff grand finalists. Could the 2019-20 season be the one to change this narrative?

From their illustrious 2011-12 premiership-championship double to finishing a disappointing eighth last season, Canberra have perhaps felt the brunt of increasing professionalism more than any other W-League club, unsupported as it is by the support an A-League counterpart can bring.</p> <p>Despite a wealth of talent and experience across the park in 2018-19, Canberra just never found their groove. Winning only three games and drawing four, including a wild 4-4 draw with Perth Glory, their season was marked by an inconsistency of strategy and an ineffectiveness in the final third. Although South African striker Rhoda Malaudzi provided some spark, United had the second-lowest goals scored in the league, only two more than wooden-spooners Western Sydney.</p> <p>The return of Norwegian international Elise Thorsnes, alongside the recruitment of former Newcastle Jets striker Katie Stengel and Under-23 USWNT winger Simone Charley, may provide an answer up front, while experienced Brazilian centre-back Camila and American Kaleigh Kurtz offer solid replacements for Rachel Corsie and Ellie Carpenter. However, with such a large turnover of players in the off-season, it\u2019s looking like 2019-20 will be another re-building year as Garriock brings through the fruits of the Canberra United Academy and as the club attempts to keep stride with their increasingly lucrative competition.

Unhampered by the AFC Women\u2019s Club Championship commitments of their cross-town rivals, devoid of the post-marquee hangover of Perth Glory and having beaten Sydney FC at both times of asking last term, Rado Vido\u0161i\u0107\u2019s side will look to capitalise on the perceived weaknesses of fellow top four contenders.</p> <p>They got off to a slow start last term \u2013 a single win in their first five outings ultimately cost them playoffs football \u2013 but the fixture list has been kind to them this time around with their first three games against Newcastle Jets, Canberra United and Adelaide United.

The recruitment of new Matilda Jenna McCormick and Portland Thorns defender Emily Menges offer solid centre-back replacements for American Sam Johnson and the injury-delayed Laura Brock (n\u00e9e Alleway), while Kiwi international Annalie Longo and Reign FC forward Darian Jenkins are exciting additions to an attack centred around captain Natasha Dowie.

New head coach Dean Heffernan has heeded the club\u2019s call to begin a new chapter in its history, first signalled by the completion of a world-class training facility in Blacktown, and then carried through by the men\u2019s excellent start to the A-League season. After a series of disappointing campaigns which saw the W-League side finish no higher than sixth since their inception in 2012, the Wanderers are finally looking like the force they always had the potential to be.</p> <p>With the signing of three current NWSL champions in Lynn Williams, Denise O\u2019Sullivan, and Kristen Hamilton, coupled with breakout Under-23 US national team defender Sam Staab, Heffernan has thrown down the gauntlet for all other clubs to respond to. Complementing these world-class athletes is an array of local talent, including Young Matildas stars Kyra Cooney-Cross and NSW NPLW golden boot winner Susan Phonsongkham.</p> <p>Combined with a few clever poaches such Amy Harrison from Sydney FC and midfield enforcer Ella Mastrantonio from Melbourne Victory, Western Sydney are building a team that, at least on paper, balances youthful vibrancy with gritty experience and a proven determination to win. Like Melbourne City\u2019s introduction to the league in 2015, this Wanderers season could mark the start of the next mini-dynasty in Australian women\u2019s football, becoming the new rising tide that lifts all boats.

      "bodyText": "On the face of it, a delayed draw, inconsistent squad announcements and a muted marketing campaign have not given much cause for enthusiasm for the uninitiated, nor hope for change for the long-suffering. Just as well football is ultimately judged by the product on the pitch rather than its packaging off it. Thanks to the passion ignited by the Women\u2019s World Cup, the return of the Matildas to Australian shores and the new collective bargaining announcement \u2013 as well as the likelihood of more signings right up to Thursday night\u2019s kick-off \u2013 the 2019-20 W-League season looks set to inspire a new cluster of fans as it makes up for lost time. Adelaide United Head coach: Ivan Karlovi\u0107 Ins so far: Mary Fowler (Bankstown City FC), Ciara Fowler (Bankstown City FC), Julia Ashley (Link\u00f6pings FC), Mallory Weber (Utah Royals), Amber Brooks (Houston Dash), Evelyn Goldsmith (Adelaide University), Matilda McNamara (Adelaide City), Lais Araujo (Arna-Bj\u00f8rnar) Outs/yet to re-sign: Emma Checker (Melbourne City), Gunnhildur J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir (Utah Royals), Veronica Latsko (Sydney FC), Fannd\u00eds Fri\u00f0riksd\u00f3ttir, Michelle Heyman, Georgia Iannella, Grace Abbey, Meleri Mullan, Lara Kirkby, Sian McLaren Adelaide have had a tough time of it in the W-League. In their entire 10-year history, they have not finished higher than sixth \u2013 and that was last season. Their 2018-19 run took everyone by surprise, going unbeaten until round seven where they lost to eventual champions Sydney FC. Following some clever off-season recruiting in key areas of the field, Adelaide quickly became a dark horse for a top-four finish. Compared to seasons past, the team was far more balanced and threatening in the final third, but a series of poorly-timed losses towards the back-half of the season saw a first finals appearance slip from their grasp, missing out by one agonising point. With many local players returning, head coach Ivan Karlovi\u0107 will be hoping to build on last season\u2019s solid foundations. However, despite retaining stand-out centre-back Amber Brooks, the loss of captain Emma Checker, midfield workhorse Gunnhildur J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir and top scorer Veronica Latsko has weakened Adelaide\u2019s spine considerably. Despite recruiting Matildas starlet Mary Fowler alongside Americans Julia Ashley and Mallory Weber, a finals spot seems unlikely without another striker and a top-quality replacement for J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. With many clubs in the league leaning into local talent this season, it will be the Adelaide locals to keep an eye on, particularly midfielders Georgia Campagnale and Dylan Holmes, as well as goalkeeper Sarah Willacy, who recently earned her first call-up to the national side off the back of an exciting performance in 2018-19. (SL) Brisbane Roar Head coach: Jake Goodship Ins so far: Tameka Yallop (Melbourne City), Georgina Worth (returns from injury), Elise Kellond-Knight (Melbourne City), Isobel Dalton (Nottingham Forest), Claire Farrington (Logan Lightning), Rylee Baisden (Moreton Bay United) Outs/yet to re-sign: Jenna McCormick (Melbourne Victory), Chioma Ubogagu (FC Ta\u0107on), Y\u016bki Nagasato (Chicago Red Stars), Summer O\u2019Brien, Abbey Lloyd While the departure of coach Mel Andreatta came as something of a surprise, the appointment of Roar academy coach Jake Goodship to the top job maintains a sense of continuity within the club. The departure of newly-capped Matilda Jenna McCormick leaves a hole in the defence, but the Roar\u2019s recruitment has a familiar flavour to it. Skipper and stalwart Clare Polkinghorne has re-signed as both a player and assistant coach while Hayley Raso, Katrina Gorry and Mackenzie Arnold have also returned along with foundation players Elise Kellond-Knight and all-time leading goalscorer (48 in 108 and counting) Tameka Yallop from Melbourne City. Isobel Dalton has been lured back from Nottingham Forest; so too the popular American defender Carson Pickett on loan from Orlando Pride for a third season and Portland Thorns midfielder Celeste Boureille. A host of young local talent has also be promoted. Being handed the first-round bye gives Brisbane an extra week of preparation, a boon in a league in which pre-seasons are short and sharp. While the Roar are top four regulars their challenge this season will be to convert this to premiership winning material as they did back in 2017-18. Brisbane are known for their consistency in the league, which unfortunately has also manifested as consistently failing to reprise their top two league finishes as playoff grand finalists. Could the 2019-20 season be the one to change this narrative? (ER) Canberra United Head coach: Heather Garriock Ins so far: Elise Thorsnes (LSK Kvinner), Katie Stengel (Newcastle Jets), Leena Khamis (WSW), Patty Charalambous (Apollon Ladies), Emma Stanbury (NWS Koalas), Ashlie Crofts (Blacktown Spartans), Hayley Taylor-Young (Canberra United Academy), Camila Martins Pereira (Orlando Pride), Simone Charley (Portland Thorns), Kaleigh Kurtz (North Carolina Courage), Annalee Grove (Brisbane Roar Academy), Jessie Rasschaert (Belconnen United), Rebekah Horsey (Lions FC) Outs/yet to re-sign: Ellie Carpenter (Melbourne City), Denise O\u2019Sullivan (WSW), Refiloe Jane (AC Milan), Rhoda Malaudzi (Apollon Ladies), Rachel Corsie (Utah Royals FC), Maria Jos\u00e9 Rojas (SK Slavia Praha), Rosie Galea, Nickoletta Flannery (Newcastle Jets), Melissa Maizels (Melbourne Victory), Natasha Prior, Aiofe Colvill, Meaghan McElligott Oh, how the mighty have fallen. From their illustrious 2011-12 premiership-championship double to finishing a disappointing eighth last season, Canberra have perhaps felt the brunt of increasing professionalism more than any other W-League club, unsupported as it is by the support an A-League counterpart can bring. Despite a wealth of talent and experience across the park in 2018-19, Canberra just never found their groove. Winning only three games and drawing four, including a wild 4-4 draw with Perth Glory, their season was marked by an inconsistency of strategy and an ineffectiveness in the final third. Although South African striker Rhoda Malaudzi provided some spark, United had the second-lowest goals scored in the league, only two more than wooden-spooners Western Sydney. The return of Norwegian international Elise Thorsnes, alongside the recruitment of former Newcastle Jets striker Katie Stengel and Under-23 USWNT winger Simone Charley, may provide an answer up front, while experienced Brazilian centre-back Camila and American Kaleigh Kurtz offer solid replacements for Rachel Corsie and Ellie Carpenter. However, with such a large turnover of players in the off-season, it\u2019s looking like 2019-20 will be another re-building year as Garriock brings through the fruits of the Canberra United Academy and as the club attempts to keep stride with their increasingly lucrative competition. (SL) Melbourne City Head coach: Rado Vido\u0161i\u0107 Ins so far: Emily Van Egmond (Newcastle Jets), Ellie Carpenter (Canberra United), Emma Checker (Adelaide United), Claire Emslie (Orlando Pride), Milica Mijatovi\u0107 (Arna-Bj\u00f8rnar) Outs/yet to re-sign: Tameka Yallop (Brisbane Roar), Elise Kellond-Knight (Brisbane Roar), Jasmyne Spencer, Rebekah Stott, Adriana Jones, Helen Caceres Having emerged from the 2018-19 season failing to make the playoffs for the first time in their history, three goals adrift from a place in the top four, Melbourne City will be champing at the bit to get the new season underway. Unhampered by the AFC Women\u2019s Club Championship commitments of their cross-town rivals, devoid of the post-marquee hangover of Perth Glory and having beaten Sydney FC at both times of asking last term, Rado Vido\u0161i\u0107\u2019s side will look to capitalise on the perceived weaknesses of fellow top four contenders. They got off to a slow start last term \u2013 a single win in their first five outings ultimately cost them playoffs football \u2013 but the fixture list has been kind to them this time around with their first three games against Newcastle Jets, Canberra United and Adelaide United. These opening matches also offer something of an awkward homecoming tour for three of City\u2019s signings, as experienced Matildas Emily van Egmond (Newcastle Jets), Ellie Carpenter (Canberra United) and Emma Checker (Adelaide United) all joined the former champions for new challenges. As in previous seasons City have a squad built from a blend of top local and international (often British) talent \u2013 this season they have added Scottish forward Claire Emslie, scorer of her country\u2019s first World Cup goal in June and who could form a fearsome combination with Carpenter down the right. Meanwhile, the retention of captain Steph Catley, on loan from Reign FC, as well as the services of Lydia Williams in goal (with Melissa Barbieri backing up as player-coach) sees a strong, experienced City squad line up this season \u2013 with a huge point to prove. (ER) Melbourne Victory Head coach: Jeff Hopkins Ins so far: Jenna McCormick (Brisbane Roar), Annalie Longo (Canterbury United Pride), Melissa Maizels (Canberra United), Emily Menges (Portland Thorns), Darian Jenkins (Reign FC), Rosie Sutton (WSW), Polly Doran (Calder United), Emma Robers (Calder United), Hayley Hanson (Houston Dash), Amy Jackson (Melbourne City) Outs/yet to re-sign: Emily Gielnik (Bayern Munich), Kyra Cooney-Cross (WSW), Ella Mastrantonio (WSW), Annabel Martin (Newcastle Jets), Bethany Mason-Jones, MelindaJ Barbieri (injury) Victory\u2019s hopes of repeating their inaugural premiership win comes with an additional hurdle this season: the AFC Women\u2019s Club Championship. Facing the premiers from Japan, China and South Korea at the end of November, Jeff Hopkins will be required to make some big decisions just as the season gets underway, possibly sacrificing a game or two\u2019s worth of W-League power to excel in the international competition, or vice-versa. Squad depth has never been a concern in the W-League given the short season length, which Victory demonstrated in their most recent run by using the fewest number of players across the whole league, including nine who started almost every game. But the AFC competition will require Hopkins to dip into his bench to a greater extent than he has done before, a decision made more difficult after losing winger Emily Gielnik, who joined Bayern Munich in August, as well as talented youngsters Kyra Cooney-Cross and Annabel Martin. Key to Victory\u2019s success will be finding replacements for their departing internationals, particularly central enforcer Dani Weatherholt and reigning Julie Dolan medallist Christine Nairn, the midfield puppet-master of Victory\u2019s sensational 2018-19 run. The recruitment of new Matilda Jenna McCormick and Portland Thorns defender Emily Menges offer solid centre-back replacements for American Sam Johnson and the injury-delayed Laura Brock (n\u00e9e Alleway), while Kiwi international Annalie Longo and Reign FC forward Darian Jenkins are exciting additions to an attack centred around captain Natasha Dowie. Overall, it\u2019ll be the midfield and the bench that will make or break their season. (SL) Newcastle Jets Head coach: Craig Deans Ins so far: Larissa Crummer (return from injury), Nickoletta Flannery (Canberra United), Lauren Allan (New Lambton), Annabel Martin (Melbourne Victory), Nicole Simonsen (WSW) Outs/yet to re-sign: Emily van Egmond (Melbourne City), Arin Wright (Chicago Red Stars), Cortnee Vine (WSW), Britt Eckerstrom (Portland Thorns), Katie Stengel (Canberra United), Taylor Smith (Reign FC) Talented youth and local pride are this season\u2019s watchwords for the Jets who, as with Canberra and Perth Glory, are in something of a rebuilding phase. Opting to reward local and academy talent instead of chasing big-name internationals, there are plenty of familiar faces in Newcastle\u2019s squad from last term. Signing Annabel Martin from Melbourne Victory will bolster the defence (as will the return of Larissa Crummer from her horrific leg break at the start of the year), while the acquisition of Nicki Flannery from Canberra will bolster attacking options. Looking locally, Lauren Allan has been rewarded for a prolific WPL season with her first W-League contract. On the senior side of the club, Matilda Gema Simon retains her co-captaincy role with 73-straight-games-and-counting ever-present Cassidy Davis, while player of the year Claire Wheeler becomes the leadership group\u2019s third musketeer, replacing former local hero Emily van Egmond. The question on the lips of the fans is whether there is enough in this squad to compensate for losing players of the calibre of Van Egmond, goalkeeper Britt Eckerstrom and defender Taylor Smith. With the squad perhaps lacking enough of that next level of player to help their rookies adapt to life in the W-League and consistently challenge their more fancied opposition, 2019-20 could prove a challenging season. And yet. Coming up against former favourite Van Egmond\u2019s new club Melbourne City in the very first match might just be the start the Jets need to kickstart a season of surprises. (ER) Perth Glory Head coach: Bobby Despotovski Ins so far: Celia Jimin\u00e9z Dolgado (Reign FC), Morgan Andrews (Reign FC), Arianna Romero (Houston Dash) Outs/yet to re-sign: Sam Kerr, Nikki Stanton (Chicago Red Stars), Katie Naughton (Chicago Red Stars), Rachel Hill (Orlando Pride), Alyssa Mautz (Chicago Red Stars), Eliza Campbell, Abbey Meakins, Abbey Green, Stacey Cavill Perhaps the biggest story of the upcoming season is who won\u2019t be there: Sam Kerr.

The problem is that their style and system has, for so long, been built around the one player, and now that this player has moved on, those left behind are having to find a new approach. Simply out-scoring other teams is no longer an option, so Despotovski may look to focus on shoring up Perth\u2019s defence given they conceded the third-most goals last season and only made third spot by virtue of having one of the best strikers in the world. The signing of Mexican international Arianna Romero from Houston Dash and Spanish international Celia Jimin\u00e9z Dolgado from Reign FC offer a solid starting-point defensively, while Dolgado\u2019s NWSL teammate Morgan Andrews could cover for Nikki Stanton in midfield, but it\u2019s in the final third that they\u2019ll struggle.

There is a wealth of attacking talent at Sydney\u2019s disposal: they\u2019ve signed Adelaide United goal machine Veronica Latsko, who netted twice against the Sky Blues last season, while the teenage tyro Mackenzie Hawkesby has been coaxed from cross-town rivals Wanderers and opened her account with two goals in a pre-season hit out against Newcastle. The retention of Caitlin Foord, now the league\u2019s pre-eminent forward (with 10 goals and five assists last season) and attacking midfielder Sofia Huerta means Ante Juric has at his disposal a fearsome attack with an eye for the back of the net both now and in the future. Re-signing the recently crowned NWSL goalkeeper of the year Aubrey Bledsoe while also marshalling the likes of Alanna Kennedy and dual-code athlete Ellie Brush, along with retaining the services of captain Teresa Polias and Chloe Logarzo in midfield, gives the side an incredibly strong spine. If Juric can get his formidable squad to gel quickly, starting with their mouth-watering Big Blue opener against Melbourne Victory on Sunday, Sydney FC will look to be pace-setters this season from the off.

After a series of disappointing campaigns which saw the W-League side finish no higher than sixth since their inception in 2012, the Wanderers are finally looking like the force they always had the potential to be. With the signing of three current NWSL champions in Lynn Williams, Denise O\u2019Sullivan, and Kristen Hamilton, coupled with breakout Under-23 US national team defender Sam Staab, Heffernan has thrown down the gauntlet for all other clubs to respond to. Complementing these world-class athletes is an array of local talent, including Young Matildas stars Kyra Cooney-Cross and NSW NPLW golden boot winner Susan Phonsongkham. Combined with a few clever poaches such Amy Harrison from Sydney FC and midfield enforcer Ella Mastrantonio from Melbourne Victory, Western Sydney are building a team that, at least on paper, balances youthful vibrancy with gritty experience and a proven determination to win. Like Melbourne City\u2019s introduction to the league in 2015, this Wanderers season could mark the start of the next mini-dynasty in Australian women\u2019s football, becoming the new rising tide that lifts all boats.

Neil Punchard pleaded guilty to nine counts of computer hacking last month. Punchard is appealing his sentence, including a recorded conviction which likely gives police reasonable grounds to dismiss him. The appeal comes as the state\u2019s Crime and Corruption Commission begins an inquiry to explore the scope of public sector data misuse. Ahead of the hearings, senior police and corrective services officers have attempted to frame documented instances of data misuse like the Punchard case as the actions of rogue individuals or instances of voyeurism, rather than the result of documented systemic failures to protect citizens\u2019 data. The commission was shown evidence on Monday that police employees were caught illegally accessing data more than 200 times last year. The rates of data misuse among police is more than 26 times the rates of other departments with responsibility for protecting large amounts of private personal information. The CCC has compiled a table showing that in 2018-19 there was one data breach for every 75 police. That compares with one in 322 employees at the transport department and one in 1,993 education department staff. The number of police misusing computer systems is likely much higher than known, given admissions there is no systemic auditing of computer use, no additional level or protection given to the data of vulnerable people, and that officers are only investigated when a breach is suspected or a complaint is made. On Friday the police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, blamed the \u201cactions of individuals\u201d for bringing the service \u201cinto disrepute\u201d. In its submission to the inquiry, the state\u2019s corrective services department \u2013 which has a rate of data breaches similar to police \u2013 said most incidents occurred \u201cthrough curiosity or misadventure\u201d. \u201cIf information is accessed inappropriately, it is typically to look into the records of high-profile offenders and/or prisoners,\u201d the submission said. \u201cThis behaviour must be viewed as distinct from, yet part of, a continuum that includes in the most serious cases, criminal or serious misconduct activity resulting from the access and disclosure of confidential information.

      "body": "<p>Just before the start, the blinds in the executive suite at Blackpool football club were drawn, throwing the room into semi-darkness. As a mark of respect, perhaps. Two years ago, Jeremy Corbyn was in the middle of a surprise sellout tour of the UK. The merchandise stalls had been doing great business with JC4PM T-shirts and the Labour leader had frequently been upgraded to bigger venues. He had been the man.</p> \n<p>Now he increasingly looks more like someone going through the motions. A last chance powerless drive to cash in by playing a few old favourites in front of a few die-hard fans, before he can dive back to his Born to Runner beans on the allotment, muttering to himself that he had given the election his best shot.</p> \n<p>Less than two weeks previously, Corbyn had launched Labour\u2019s election campaign with a high-octane rally in Battersea. Back then he still had hope. However small. Now he could barely keep his eyes open as he introduced a showcase programme for lifelong education that should be at the heart of his party\u2019s manifesto. It was almost as if he was punch-drunk. Years of being the underdog, of disproving the doubters, of always bouncing back, have finally taken their toll. Now it looked as if he had had enough.</p> \n<p>This was Corbyn at his most downbeat, his voice seldom rising above a mumble. \u201cIt makes me angry that some schools are closed on a Friday,\u201d he said. Only he didn\u2019t sound angry at all. Rather, he just sounded a bit fed up. The ageing geography supply teacher who is counting down the days to retirement and doesn\u2019t really give a toss whether the kids learn anything so long as they give him an easy ride and he gets out alive.</p> \n<p>Not that he didn\u2019t have plenty of good lines. About the floods, about the importance of training for everyone, about children going hungry in schools. He just couldn\u2019t deliver them. Sentences that must have looked great on the page died on his lips. Rallying cries that faded into whispers. It was all he could do to get a response from the audience when he ended with the old favourite of \u201cOur NHS is not for sale\u201d. A few of the hundred or so Labour activists in the room \u2013 there were plenty of empty seats \u2013 broke into a desultory, short-lived chorus of \u201cNot for sale\u201d, though more out of a sense of obligation than with any real enthusiasm. Live Aid it wasn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>Even Angela Rayner appeared taken aback by the lack of energy in the room. Normally the shadow education secretary can be relied on to fire up a crowd, but she was unusually hesitant and underpowered at first. \u201cI\u2019ve seen off four education secretaries,\u201d she began. Er, yes. But she had never actually been education secretary, which is Labour\u2019s entire raison d\u2019etre. Coming up with great policies is fairly pointless if you\u2019re never in a position to implement them. Corbyn has seen off three prime ministers and the Tories would be more than happy for him to stay in place and see off three more if it meant Labour was out of office for another 10 years.</p> \n<p>Gradually, though, Rayner began to hit her stride. She has a great back story and she tells it very well. How she was at home with a baby when her classmates were doing their GCSEs, and how it was only by going back to college to get qualifications that she learned how to help herself and her son by building a career. Everyone deserved a second chance at life. Though it didn\u2019t sound as if Corbyn was going to be allowed a third one. She then raced through her plans for a national education service \u2013 no need to cost them, as no one\u2019s costing anything these days \u2013 to close with a killer pay-off.

      "bodyText": "Just before the start, the blinds in the executive suite at Blackpool football club were drawn, throwing the room into semi-darkness. As a mark of respect, perhaps. Two years ago, Jeremy Corbyn was in the middle of a surprise sellout tour of the UK. The merchandise stalls had been doing great business with JC4PM T-shirts and the Labour leader had frequently been upgraded to bigger venues. He had been the man. Now he increasingly looks more like someone going through the motions. A last chance powerless drive to cash in by playing a few old favourites in front of a few die-hard fans, before he can dive back to his Born to Runner beans on the allotment, muttering to himself that he had given the election his best shot. Less than two weeks previously, Corbyn had launched Labour\u2019s election campaign with a high-octane rally in Battersea. Back then he still had hope. However small. Now he could barely keep his eyes open as he introduced a showcase programme for lifelong education that should be at the heart of his party\u2019s manifesto. It was almost as if he was punch-drunk. Years of being the underdog, of disproving the doubters, of always bouncing back, have finally taken their toll. Now it looked as if he had had enough. This was Corbyn at his most downbeat, his voice seldom rising above a mumble. \u201cIt makes me angry that some schools are closed on a Friday,\u201d he said. Only he didn\u2019t sound angry at all. Rather, he just sounded a bit fed up. The ageing geography supply teacher who is counting down the days to retirement and doesn\u2019t really give a toss whether the kids learn anything so long as they give him an easy ride and he gets out alive. Not that he didn\u2019t have plenty of good lines. About the floods, about the importance of training for everyone, about children going hungry in schools. He just couldn\u2019t deliver them. Sentences that must have looked great on the page died on his lips. Rallying cries that faded into whispers. It was all he could do to get a response from the audience when he ended with the old favourite of \u201cOur NHS is not for sale\u201d. A few of the hundred or so Labour activists in the room \u2013 there were plenty of empty seats \u2013 broke into a desultory, short-lived chorus of \u201cNot for sale\u201d, though more out of a sense of obligation than with any real enthusiasm. Live Aid it wasn\u2019t. Even Angela Rayner appeared taken aback by the lack of energy in the room. Normally the shadow education secretary can be relied on to fire up a crowd, but she was unusually hesitant and underpowered at first. \u201cI\u2019ve seen off four education secretaries,\u201d she began. Er, yes. But she had never actually been education secretary, which is Labour\u2019s entire raison d\u2019etre. Coming up with great policies is fairly pointless if you\u2019re never in a position to implement them. Corbyn has seen off three prime ministers and the Tories would be more than happy for him to stay in place and see off three more if it meant Labour was out of office for another 10 years. Gradually, though, Rayner began to hit her stride. She has a great back story and she tells it very well. How she was at home with a baby when her classmates were doing their GCSEs, and how it was only by going back to college to get qualifications that she learned how to help herself and her son by building a career. Everyone deserved a second chance at life. Though it didn\u2019t sound as if Corbyn was going to be allowed a third one. She then raced through her plans for a national education service \u2013 no need to cost them, as no one\u2019s costing anything these days \u2013 to close with a killer pay-off. Poverty wasn\u2019t just being penniless, it was being powerless. And she was the voice of the dispossessed. For the obligatory Q&amp;A, Corbyn joined Rayner on stage and the pair gave every impression of looking as though they were appearing in a hostage video together. Yes, we are being extremely well treated. Yes, we do love these jumpsuits. Orange is our favourite colour. Their eyes screamed \u201cHELP\u201d. Corbyn did most of the talking and his answers were mostly bland and noncommittal. The floods were very serious and he would definitely have done something different to the Tories. The cyber-attack was also serious and he didn\u2019t want to speculate who was behind it but he would encourage others to do the speculating for him. Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump were all bad. Finally, though, Rayner let rip. A new Labour government would make the postwar Attlee government look pedestrian. \u201cI am disgusted by Boris and Farage,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t fear them.

Confirmation of the fine came on the day that Royal Mail went to the high court in a legal bid to prevent strikes by postal workers in the run-up to Christmas. A verdict is expected on Wednesday. Ofcom handed Royal Mail a \u00a350m penalty in August last year after it said the delivery firm \u201cabused its position\u201d by \u201cdiscriminating\u201d against Whistl. It said the firm had abused its dominant position by penalising wholesale customers that sought to deliver bulk mail such as bank statements and council tax demands door to door. Royal Mail appealed against the decision but the Competition Appeal Tribunal upheld the decision on Tuesday, although the company could now launch a fresh appeal. Speaking after the verdict, Ofcom said: \u201cWe found that Royal Mail pursued a deliberate strategy of pricing discrimination against Whistl, which was its only major competitor for delivering business mail. \u201cRoyal Mail had a special responsibility to ensure its behaviour was not anti-competitive. \u201cWe hope that our fine, which has been upheld in full by the tribunal, will ensure that Royal Mail and other powerful companies take their legal duties very seriously.\u201d Royal Mail said it was \u201cdisappointed by the decision. \u201cWe are considering all legal options, including whether to seek permission to appeal and to request that payment of the penalty, which would otherwise become payable, be stayed pending any appeal.

      "bodyText": "The Yorkshire building society is to investigate how two fake \u00a320 notes were issued by a cash machine outside its Lancaster branch. The investigation was prompted after the Guardian\u2019s media editor, Jim Waterson, and a friend tried to use the cash to pay for breakfast in a London cafe last weekend. The waiter refused to accept the notes \u2013 which bear the words \u201cTwenty Poond\u201d on the reverse side and said they were \u201cobviously fake\u201d. Waterson\u2019s friend had received the notes among \u00a380 she had withdrawn from an ATM at the Lancaster branch of the Yorkshire the previous weekend. \u201cMy friend got the cash out and didn\u2019t think twice \u2013 after all, who closely examines banknotes when they come out of a high street ATM? But when we looked at them more closely we noticed it says Twenty Poond on them. It looks as though they were designed to be used in theatres, or as toys. It even states on them \u201cThis note is play money\u201d,\u201d says Waterson. Counterfeit \u00a320 notes are sold in bulk on the black market for around \u00a38 each and can easily end up in the wallets of unsuspecting shoppers. Notes the same as those uncovered are for sale on eBay, listed as Party, Realistic Prop Money with the warning NOT FOR USE. They are sold in bundles of 10 notes for \u00a314.99. In recent months, police have been warning retailers and shoppers to be on their guard against accepting skilfully faked \u00a320 notes. The Yorkshire building society confirmed that the contractor that operates the affected cash machine on its behalf is investigating the matter. \u201cOur cash machines are operated by a third-party supplier and are not under control of the colleagues within the branch. Anyone who suspects the notes received from one of our cash machines are forged should hand these in as soon as possible to their local branch to seek an exchange and have these notes taken out of circulation.\u201d Staff at both the Lancaster branch and the cash machine provider, Notemachine, said they had not received any other complaints about fake notes. While some cash machines in convenience stores are loaded by the store owner, official ATMs in banks are operated and filled by security staff. A spokesman for Link, which manages the UK\u2019s ATM network, said this was likely to be a case of \u201chuman error somewhere in the system\u201d. \u201cThis is a matter that we are looking at and take very seriously,\u201d he said.",

Earlier Sutton had accused his former colleague Dr Richard Freeman, who is the defendant in a fit-to-practise case, of being spineless and a drunk whom others in British Cycling wanted dismissed. Sutton finally boiled over after questions over an order of 30 sachets of the banned substance Testogel, sent to the Manchester velodrome in 2011, which he denied was to treat his alleged erectile dysfunction. \u201cI would have no problem in telling you it was for me. You are telling the press I can\u2019t get a hard on \u2013 my wife wants to testify that you are a bloody liar. \u201cI have never ordered any Testogel and I swear on my three-year-old daughter\u2019s life,\u201d said Sutton, who added that he would take a lie-detector test to prove it. That was just one wild exchange of many in what turned out to be a damaging day for British Cycling and Team Sky, with the reputation of both organisations and two of its key staff members during their period of unprecedented success put in the dock. Sutton was at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester to give evidence on behalf of the General Medical Council in their case against Freeman, who has already accepted 18 of the 22 charges against him. Freeman denies the GMC\u2019s claims that he ordered Testogel in order to microdose an unnamed cyclist and says that the 61-year-old Sutton bullied him into it to treat his erectile dysfunction. The spotlight quickly turned on to Sutton, a central figure behind British Cycling\u2019s success over several Olympics as well as Bradley Wiggins\u2019s Tour de France victory in 2012, who found his reputation under attack. Sutton said at one point: \u201cCan I ask, \u2018Am I the one who is on trial here?\u2019 I feel like I\u2019m the criminal.\u201d Freeman\u2019s QC, Mary O\u2019Rourke, said she had been given statements from \u201cindividuals that have come forward in the last two weeks saying that you are a liar, a doper and a bully\u201d. Sutton was then accused of having banned testosterone in his house in Rowley Regis during the late 90s or early 2000s \u2013 with O\u2019Rourke claiming that one witness had not only seen it in his fridge, but also watched Sutton inject the testosterone. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. I want to see the name and hear the evidence,\u201d said Sutton. \u201cThe individual in question wishes to remain anonymous,\u201d replied O\u2019Rourke, \u201cbut he has provided his name and details to UK Sport and UK Anti-Doping and to Damian Collins at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\u201d When Sutton named his accuser, who he said was jealous, O\u2019Rourke told him he had got the wrong man. Later O\u2019Rourke also pointed out to Sutton that he had sent Freeman \u201csome pretty hostile texts\u201d despite calling Freeman a friend. She then read out one text he had sent Freeman at the end of last year. \u201cBe careful what you say,\u201d it read. \u201cI can drag you in \u2013 you won\u2019t be the only person I can hurt.\u201d O\u2019Rourke also accused Sutton of having a laugh when he said that he had never heard of Testogel until it was reported in the press. \u201cThere\u2019s only one joker in the room and that\u2019s you,\u201d Sutton said. However, when O\u2019Rourke began picking over a statement Sutton had given the GMC last year, which she suggested meant he had assumed there was more than one box of Testogel, he finally boiled over. \u201cI am going to leave the hearing now,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be dragged through this shitfight that this individual is trying to bring on me. \u201cI was asked to come here and answer whether I ordered Testogel.

He was like the Scarlet Pimpernel. I covered his backside while he was there. Two critical cases of athletes ill and we couldn\u2019t get hold of him.

He said he had become emotional partly because of a serious family matter involving one of his children. If he does not return, Freeman\u2019s legal team could ask for Sutton\u2019s evidence to be struck from the record or given less weight. The tribunal heard that the Daily Mail had acknowledged a request to give what O\u2019Rourke claims is a secret affidavit from Sutton that is \u201ctotally inconsistent\u201d with evidence he had given to a parliamentary inquiry into doping in sport. O\u2019Rourke has previously claimed that document was in the newspaper\u2019s managing editor\u2019s safe as \u201can insurance policy against any potential claims for defamation by Sir Bradley Wiggins, Freeman or Sir Dave Brailsford\u201d and that it contained \u201ca number of lies\u201d. The tribunal continues.",

He was deported on Monday as part of Turkey\u2019s controversial new policy to deport foreign jihadists in its custody.</p> \n<p>A Turkish official told AFP that he had refused to be returned to the US and instead asked to be sent to Greece. Athens said he was refused entry when he tried to cross the no man\u2019s land between the two countries to the Greek town of Kastanies. He is reported to have spent the night outside and witnesses said he has been trying to shout to reporters on the Turkish side of the border.</p> \n<p>Asked to comment on the reports on Tuesday, Erdo\u011fan said: \u201cWhether [the deported Isis fighters] are stuck there at the border it doesn\u2019t concern us. We will continue to send them. Whether they take them or not, it is not our concern.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking to reporters in Ankara on Tuesday, Erdo\u011fan threatened that Turkey could release all of its jailed foreign militants and send them to Europe. </p> \n<p>\u201cYou should revise your stance towards Turkey, which at the moment holds so many Isis members in prison and at the same time controls those in Syria,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said, addressing European countries. </p> \n<p>\u201cThese gates will open and these Isis members who have started to be sent to you will continue to be sent. Then you can take care of your own problem.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd1180bf60bed8a32e1485ef054f25cfbb41e6a8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd1180bf60bed8a32e1485ef054f25cfbb41e6a8/413_0_3975_2385/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s president, says jailed foreign militants may be released and sent to Europe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s president, says jailed foreign militants may be released and sent to Europe.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Turkish leader\u2019s remarks come in the wake of a fresh push to repatriate some of the 1,200 foreign Isis fighters in Turkish detention centres and 287 captured recently in Syria, including those who have been stripped of western citizenship in an attempt to prevent them returning home.</p> \n<p>The interior ministry spokesperson \u0130smail \u00c7atakl\u0131 said on Monday one US citizen, believed to be Darwis, had already been repatriated and seven German nationals would be flown home on 14 November. Preparations to deport two Irish citizens, as well as French and Danish nationals, were also under way, he said.</p> \n<p>Turkey has not given total numbers and nationalities of those it is planning to send home, or details on how such a policy will work, particularly regarding stateless individuals. Many countries request passenger lists for both military and commercial flights before a plane is allowed to enter their airspace.</p> \n<p>Germany\u2019s foreign ministry confirmed that a German citizen had been returned to Berlin from Turkey on Monday, and that a further nine would be deported later this week. The suspects\u2019 alleged links to Isis are still under investigation by Germany.</p> \n<p>British diplomats said the policy did not appear to apply to UK citizens in Turkey at this time. Aine Davis, a member of the cell known as \u201cthe Beatles\u201d, who beheaded hostages in Syria, is serving seven and a half years in a Turkish prison.</p> \n<p>The British woman Tooba Gondal is also believed to be in Turkish custody, having escaped a Kurdish-run detention centre in the chaos caused by Turkey\u2019s invasion of Kurdish-held Syria last month.</p> \n<p>While Turkey has quietly deported members of Isis for years, Ankara has now brought the issue to the fore after facing condemnation from European allies over its assault on US-backed Kurdish fighters across the border in Syria, which Ankara considers a terrorist threat.</p> \n<p>Turkey was also angered at an EU decision on Monday to impose sanctions on the country over its drilling for gas in disputed Mediterranean waters off Cyprus.</p> \n<p>Erdo\u011fan is due to visit Washington on Wednesday, where he is expected to discuss the fate of foreign fighters caught in Isis ranks. </p> \n<p>A further 90,000 men, women and children with links to Isis are currently held in Kurdish-run detention centres in Syria.

      "bodyText": "An alleged American member of Islamic State, stranded for a second day on the border between Greece and Turkey after Turkey expelled him, is \u201cnot our problem\u201d, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has said. The man, named by the Turkish news agency Demiroren as Muhammed Darwis B, is believed to be a US citizen of Jordanian descent. He was deported on Monday as part of Turkey\u2019s controversial new policy to deport foreign jihadists in its custody. A Turkish official told AFP that he had refused to be returned to the US and instead asked to be sent to Greece. Athens said he was refused entry when he tried to cross the no man\u2019s land between the two countries to the Greek town of Kastanies. He is reported to have spent the night outside and witnesses said he has been trying to shout to reporters on the Turkish side of the border. Asked to comment on the reports on Tuesday, Erdo\u011fan said: \u201cWhether [the deported Isis fighters] are stuck there at the border it doesn\u2019t concern us. We will continue to send them. Whether they take them or not, it is not our concern.\u201d Speaking to reporters in Ankara on Tuesday, Erdo\u011fan threatened that Turkey could release all of its jailed foreign militants and send them to Europe. \u201cYou should revise your stance towards Turkey, which at the moment holds so many Isis members in prison and at the same time controls those in Syria,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said, addressing European countries. \u201cThese gates will open and these Isis members who have started to be sent to you will continue to be sent. Then you can take care of your own problem.\u201d The Turkish leader\u2019s remarks come in the wake of a fresh push to repatriate some of the 1,200 foreign Isis fighters in Turkish detention centres and 287 captured recently in Syria, including those who have been stripped of western citizenship in an attempt to prevent them returning home. The interior ministry spokesperson \u0130smail \u00c7atakl\u0131 said on Monday one US citizen, believed to be Darwis, had already been repatriated and seven German nationals would be flown home on 14 November. Preparations to deport two Irish citizens, as well as French and Danish nationals, were also under way, he said. Turkey has not given total numbers and nationalities of those it is planning to send home, or details on how such a policy will work, particularly regarding stateless individuals. Many countries request passenger lists for both military and commercial flights before a plane is allowed to enter their airspace. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry confirmed that a German citizen had been returned to Berlin from Turkey on Monday, and that a further nine would be deported later this week. The suspects\u2019 alleged links to Isis are still under investigation by Germany. British diplomats said the policy did not appear to apply to UK citizens in Turkey at this time. Aine Davis, a member of the cell known as \u201cthe Beatles\u201d, who beheaded hostages in Syria, is serving seven and a half years in a Turkish prison. The British woman Tooba Gondal is also believed to be in Turkish custody, having escaped a Kurdish-run detention centre in the chaos caused by Turkey\u2019s invasion of Kurdish-held Syria last month. While Turkey has quietly deported members of Isis for years, Ankara has now brought the issue to the fore after facing condemnation from European allies over its assault on US-backed Kurdish fighters across the border in Syria, which Ankara considers a terrorist threat. Turkey was also angered at an EU decision on Monday to impose sanctions on the country over its drilling for gas in disputed Mediterranean waters off Cyprus. Erdo\u011fan is due to visit Washington on Wednesday, where he is expected to discuss the fate of foreign fighters caught in Isis ranks. A further 90,000 men, women and children with links to Isis are currently held in Kurdish-run detention centres in Syria. Analysts and military strategists have warned that Ankara\u2019s invasion of northern Syria risks destabilising the detention camps and lead Isis to regroup.",

      "body": "<p>In 2016, the far-right Vox party gained a mere 0.2% of the vote in the Spanish legislative elections. This Sunday, Vox came in third with an estimated 15.1% percent, 5.7% behind the mainstream right Popular party (PP). Within three years, Spain has transformed from a European exception into a European average in terms of far-right electoral success.</p> <p>As I argue in my new book <a href=\"http://politybooks.com/bookdetail/?isbn=9781509536832\">The Far Right Today</a>, no country is immune to far-right politics. Almost all countries have a rather fertile breeding ground for at least populist radical right politics, with pluralities (and sometimes even majorities) of the population thinking there are too many immigrants (<em>nativism</em>), that crime is punished too leniently (<em>authoritarianism</em>), and that political elites are corrupt (<em>populism</em>). Whether or not this translates into electoral success for far-right parties is, simply stated, a matter of supply and demand.</p> <p>As long as socio-economic issues like pensions and unemployment dominate the political debate, far-right parties tend to struggle. They only become relevant when \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d can be connected to socio-cultural issues, like European integration or immigration. And they thrive when other issues easily related to their core ideology dominate the political agenda.</p> <p>In Spain, this was the rather specific issue of Catalonian independence. After polling around 1% for a few years, Vox started to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2019_Spanish_general_election#/media/File:OpinionPollingSpainGeneralElection2019.png\">rise in the polls</a> in October 2018, when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2019_Spanish_general_election#/media/File:OpinionPollingSpainGeneralElection2019.png\">tensions flared</a> over the first anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 2017. The party soared in the polls in December, amid <a href=\"http://v\">violent clashes</a> between the police and pro-independence supporters in Barcelona. As the issue remained high on the political agenda, Vox gained 10.3% in the April 2019 elections.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is therefore no longer accurate to speak of a 'populist' surge in Europe. At the very least, it is a 'rightwing populist' surge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Directly after the elections the political debate focused on the drama of the protracted, and ultimately unsuccessful, coalition formation process between the center-left PSOE and radical left United Podemos. Irrelevant to that story, Vox saw its support drop into single digits, until the Catalonia issue came back in the news. As pro-independence Catalans took to the streets to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/catalan-separatist-leaders-given-lengthy-prison-sentences\">protest</a> against the sentencing of their leaders for their role in the 2017 independence referendum (deemed illegal by the Spanish state), Vox once again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/catalan-separatist-leaders-given-lengthy-prison-sentences\">soared in the polls</a>.</p> <p>As in other countries, far-right electoral success is not only a matter of political events. Vox was helped by the right turn of the two mainstream rightwing parties, the old PP and the new Citizens (Cs), their courting of Vox at the local (Madrid) and regional (Andalusia) levels, and the disproportionate attention the Spanish media devoted to the party and its leader, Santiago Abascal.</p> <p>While the process has been uniquely rapid in Spain, the mainstreaming and normalization of the far right has become a common phenomenon of 21st-century Europe. Whereas far-right parties were challengers from the outside in the last two decades of the previous century (the so-called \u201cthird wave\u201d of postwar far-right politics), they have become part of the political mainstream in the first two decades of the new century (the so-called \u201cfourth wave\u201d). Not only do far-right parties now average some 15% of the national vote in Europe, they are considered <em>Koalitionsf\u00e4hig</em> (acceptable coalition partners) in many countries, at least at local or regional levels, while their key frames and policies are promoted, in less and less moderate versions, by mainstream (rightwing) parties from Austria to Sweden.</p> <p>Moreover, whereas rightwing populist parties continue to prosper, leftwing populist parties have lost their momentum. The left-populist party Podemos was the big sensation of the 2015 Spanish elections, but it has lost half its seats since then \u2013 despite shedding much of its populism and entering into an electoral coalition with the communist IU. United Podemos plays a minor role in the political debate, on Catalonia or other issues, although it is still the most important coalition option for the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez of PSOE.</p> <p>It is therefore no longer accurate to speak of a \u201cpopulist\u201d surge in Europe (and beyond, for that matter). At the very least, it is a \u201crightwing populist\u201d surge. More accurately, it is a \u201c<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/29/putting-our-own-people-first-nativism-us-vs-them-far-right-parties-lega-fpo-kkk-europe-usa/\">far-right</a>\u201d surge, which includes both populist (anti-liberal democracy) and extremist (anti-democracy) parties of the right.</p> <p>While populism is a crucial part of the story, the real king is nationalism, or better put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/cambridge-dictionary-nativism-populism-word-year\">nativism</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/17/why-is-the-far-right-dominated-by-men\">he</a> is here to stay.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia.

Almost all countries have a rather fertile breeding ground for at least populist radical right politics, with pluralities (and sometimes even majorities) of the population thinking there are too many immigrants (nativism), that crime is punished too leniently (authoritarianism), and that political elites are corrupt (populism). Whether or not this translates into electoral success for far-right parties is, simply stated, a matter of supply and demand. As long as socio-economic issues like pensions and unemployment dominate the political debate, far-right parties tend to struggle. They only become relevant when \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d can be connected to socio-cultural issues, like European integration or immigration. And they thrive when other issues easily related to their core ideology dominate the political agenda. In Spain, this was the rather specific issue of Catalonian independence. After polling around 1% for a few years, Vox started to rise in the polls in October 2018, when tensions flared over the first anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 2017. The party soared in the polls in December, amid violent clashes between the police and pro-independence supporters in Barcelona. As the issue remained high on the political agenda, Vox gained 10.3% in the April 2019 elections. Directly after the elections the political debate focused on the drama of the protracted, and ultimately unsuccessful, coalition formation process between the center-left PSOE and radical left United Podemos. Irrelevant to that story, Vox saw its support drop into single digits, until the Catalonia issue came back in the news. As pro-independence Catalans took to the streets to protest against the sentencing of their leaders for their role in the 2017 independence referendum (deemed illegal by the Spanish state), Vox once again soared in the polls. As in other countries, far-right electoral success is not only a matter of political events. Vox was helped by the right turn of the two mainstream rightwing parties, the old PP and the new Citizens (Cs), their courting of Vox at the local (Madrid) and regional (Andalusia) levels, and the disproportionate attention the Spanish media devoted to the party and its leader, Santiago Abascal. While the process has been uniquely rapid in Spain, the mainstreaming and normalization of the far right has become a common phenomenon of 21st-century Europe. Whereas far-right parties were challengers from the outside in the last two decades of the previous century (the so-called \u201cthird wave\u201d of postwar far-right politics), they have become part of the political mainstream in the first two decades of the new century (the so-called \u201cfourth wave\u201d). Not only do far-right parties now average some 15% of the national vote in Europe, they are considered Koalitionsf\u00e4hig (acceptable coalition partners) in many countries, at least at local or regional levels, while their key frames and policies are promoted, in less and less moderate versions, by mainstream (rightwing) parties from Austria to Sweden. Moreover, whereas rightwing populist parties continue to prosper, leftwing populist parties have lost their momentum. The left-populist party Podemos was the big sensation of the 2015 Spanish elections, but it has lost half its seats since then \u2013 despite shedding much of its populism and entering into an electoral coalition with the communist IU. United Podemos plays a minor role in the political debate, on Catalonia or other issues, although it is still the most important coalition option for the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez of PSOE. It is therefore no longer accurate to speak of a \u201cpopulist\u201d surge in Europe (and beyond, for that matter). At the very least, it is a \u201crightwing populist\u201d surge. More accurately, it is a \u201cfar-right\u201d surge, which includes both populist (anti-liberal democracy) and extremist (anti-democracy) parties of the right. While populism is a crucial part of the story, the real king is nationalism, or better put nativism, and he is here to stay.

Haley, who left the Trump administration last year, has denied rumours she could replace Mike Pence as Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick next year.</p> <p>On Monday night, Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, hit back at Haley\u2019s claim in the book that he worked to undermine aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda in an effort to \u201csave the country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDuring my service to our country as the secretary of state, at no time did I, nor to my direct knowledge did anyone else serving along with me, take any actions to undermine the president,\u201d Tillerson said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the president made a decision, we at the state department undertook our best efforts to implement that decision.\u201d</p> <p>Tillerson was responding to Haley\u2019s claim that he and the former White House chief of staff John Kelly invited her to join their attempts to subvert the president on several contentious issues, including pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, and moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.</p> <p>In his statement, Tillerson said Haley \u201cwas rarely a participant in my many meetings and is not in a position to know what I may or may not have said to the president\u201d.</p> <p>In her book, Haley claims the two advisers \u201cconfided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren\u2019t being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country\u201d.</p> <p>She also reveals the depth of animosity between advisers surrounding Trump. Tillerson, she writes, \u201cwas dismissive of my opinions, and he didn\u2019t make any secret about the fact that he believed his views carried more weight\u201d.</p> <p>Haley reiterated her accusations on Tuesday, telling NBC what Tillerson and Kelly did was \u201cdangerous\u201d and describing Tillerson as \u201carrogant and condescending\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTo undermine a president because you think you know better than him is wrong,\u201d Haley said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you disagree with getting out of the Iran nuclear arms deal, if you disagree with moving our embassy or getting out of the Paris climate agreement, go tell the president. If you still don\u2019t like it, quit.\u201d</p> <p>In his own response to Haley\u2019s claims, Kelly said that if providing the president \u201cwith the best and most open, legal and ethical staffing advice from across the [government] so he could make an informed decision is \u2018working against Trump\u2019, then guilty as charged.\u201d</p> <p>Haley also hit out at the impeachment inquiry, into Trump\u2019s conduct regarding Ukraine, which will bring public hearings on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cImpeachment is serious,\u201d she said, after saying Trump may not have acted appropriately but had not merited impeachment and possible removal.</p> <p>\u201cThe other side of this is we are less than a year away from the election.

      "bodyText": "The former UN ambassador Nikki Haley continued her dogged and faithful defence of Donald Trump on Tuesday, maintaining that the president is a \u201ctruthful\u201d person. \u201cIn every instance that I dealt with him, he was truthful, he listened and he was great to work with,\u201d Haley told NBC\u2019s Today. \u201cI never had any concerns on whether he could handle the job ever.\u201d In fact, Trump\u2019s tendency to be economical with the truth is a much-studied phenomenon. By mid-October, the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker column said Trump had made \u201c13,435 false or misleading claims over 993 days\u201d in power. Tuesday saw the publication of With All Due Respect, a carefully crafted memoir that many people see as an attempt to set up the former South Carolina governor for a return to national political life, even a White House run in 2024. Haley, who left the Trump administration last year, has denied rumours she could replace Mike Pence as Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick next year. On Monday night, Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, hit back at Haley\u2019s claim in the book that he worked to undermine aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda in an effort to \u201csave the country\u201d. \u201cDuring my service to our country as the secretary of state, at no time did I, nor to my direct knowledge did anyone else serving along with me, take any actions to undermine the president,\u201d Tillerson said in a statement. \u201cOnce the president made a decision, we at the state department undertook our best efforts to implement that decision.\u201d Tillerson was responding to Haley\u2019s claim that he and the former White House chief of staff John Kelly invited her to join their attempts to subvert the president on several contentious issues, including pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, and moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. In his statement, Tillerson said Haley \u201cwas rarely a participant in my many meetings and is not in a position to know what I may or may not have said to the president\u201d. In her book, Haley claims the two advisers \u201cconfided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren\u2019t being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country\u201d. She also reveals the depth of animosity between advisers surrounding Trump. Tillerson, she writes, \u201cwas dismissive of my opinions, and he didn\u2019t make any secret about the fact that he believed his views carried more weight\u201d. Haley reiterated her accusations on Tuesday, telling NBC what Tillerson and Kelly did was \u201cdangerous\u201d and describing Tillerson as \u201carrogant and condescending\u201d. \u201cTo undermine a president because you think you know better than him is wrong,\u201d Haley said. \u201cIf you disagree with getting out of the Iran nuclear arms deal, if you disagree with moving our embassy or getting out of the Paris climate agreement, go tell the president. If you still don\u2019t like it, quit.\u201d In his own response to Haley\u2019s claims, Kelly said that if providing the president \u201cwith the best and most open, legal and ethical staffing advice from across the [government] so he could make an informed decision is \u2018working against Trump\u2019, then guilty as charged.\u201d Haley also hit out at the impeachment inquiry, into Trump\u2019s conduct regarding Ukraine, which will bring public hearings on Wednesday. \u201cImpeachment is serious,\u201d she said, after saying Trump may not have acted appropriately but had not merited impeachment and possible removal. \u201cThe other side of this is we are less than a year away from the election. Instead, let the people decide. Let them hear the testimony, that\u2019s fine, but let them decide.\u201d",

The end for Spicer, who had shown substandard skills on the floor and bizarre choices in the costume department, came after he and partner Jenna Johnson tangoed to Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s Bills, Bills, Bills and foxtrotted to One Direction\u2019s Story of My Life. From his first performance in a lime-green ruffled shirt to the Spice Girls\u2019 Spice Up Your Life, to his elimination in the quarter-finals, Spicer proved a controversial choice. Many fans of the show complained about such an overtly political figure being offered a shot at rehabilitation. Spicer\u2019s persistence despite being a weak performer gave critics a sense of deja vu, based on Spicer\u2019s short and stormy tenure as Donald Trump\u2019s first presidential press secretary. He lost the trust of many journalists on his first day in January 2017, when he angrily lambasted the gathered media in the press room for pointing out the small crowds at Trump\u2019s inauguration. Spicer raised his voice and falsely said: \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2013 period.\u201d Spicer lasted six months. He endured a devastating parody of him on Saturday Night Live by Melissa McCarthy. Judges on Dancing With the Stars had complained that Spicer repeatedly escaped expulsion from the contest despite being below-par. \u201cWe keep throwing you out the boat and the viewers keep throwing a life preserver,\u201d Len Goodman complained. The secret to Spicer\u2019s longevity, Variety reported, is that the DWTS ratings are still relatively strong in red-state America. Spicer\u2019s former political colleagues offered their support, including Sarah Sanders, who replaced him as White House press spokesperson. She said she and her family were \u201cfully behind him\u201d. Donald Trump Jr, urged fans to vote for Spicer to frustrate \u201cHollywood\u201d and \u201cliberals\u201d. After Spicer\u2019s expulsion, Donald Trump, who had urged viewers to vote for Spicer, sent his congratulations but deleted a mid-show tweet that had encouraged viewers to vote for his hapless former spokesman. \u201cA great try by seanspicer. We are all proud of you!\u201d Trump wrote. In the end, Spicer bowed out with some measure of grace that escaped him on the dance floor. \u201cTo everyone who has voted and supported me over the past nine weeks on Dancing ABC. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I made it to the quarter-finals because of your votes. I had a blast,\u201d he tweeted.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a big news week for McDonald\u2019s. Just as the fast food outlet launched its festive Millionaire\u2019s menu, some of its UK workers have organised a McStrike in protest against low wages and job insecurity. There is a certain irony in telling customers they can \u201cLive like a millionaire\u201d (that is the campaign slogan) as the people on the tills are being paid as little as \u00a38.80 an hour. I joined the queue to see if the Christmas coffee and doughnut live up to the hype.</p> <p>I took the lid off my Millionaire\u2019s latte and was hit by something sticky that felt more solid than airborne. I had to peer into the cup to see it, though. The in-store poster featured a tall red cup with piped chocolate cream coiled well above the rim, a bit like the poo emoji, but mine had melted into the hot drink. Of course it had. (Did you know commercial food photographers use shaving cream to emulate whipped cream?)</p> <p>The doughnut looked like a toffee-coated dalek, its surface bejewelled with lots of chewy shortbread bits. I marvelled at how puffy and unsweet it was as I took my third bite and I was suddenly squirting gloopy caramel everywhere. It is a filled doughnut. I am a certified sugar fiend, though, so I felt golden right then.</p> <p>A couple of things I noticed on my second visit (I forgot to take photographs first time around) and then on my third (I spilled the second coffee and the cashier mistakenly gave me a plain doughnut). Table service is possible if you eat in. And you can customise the latte with added cream (?!) which takes the whole order over 500 calories (FIVE HUNDRED?!).</p> <p>I clearly caught the staff\u2019s attention, as the woman making my final latte whispered: \u201cIt\u2019s the same customer\u201d to her colleague at the till. \u201cYup, I\u2019m beginning to recognise you guys, too,\u201d I thought, because that was my third order and I received neither the pretty red cup with the perfect mound of chocolate cream promised by the advert nor the large cup size I paid extra for three times in a row. But I don\u2019t blame them for any of it, because their salaries and the advert are more than a joke \u2013 they\u2019re an insult.</p> <p>After that, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to eat or drink any more. The first purchase stuck in my gut like a bad secret. And that was when I realised: that probably is what being a millionaire feels like, at least the extravagant side of having more money than any one person could ever need. That first bite might be a total high, but it\u2019s all downhill from there, and the only person waiting for you at the bottom of the hill is your own damn self.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a big news week for McDonald\u2019s. Just as the fast food outlet launched its festive Millionaire\u2019s menu, some of its UK workers have organised a McStrike in protest against low wages and job insecurity. There is a certain irony in telling customers they can \u201cLive like a millionaire\u201d (that is the campaign slogan) as the people on the tills are being paid as little as \u00a38.80 an hour. I joined the queue to see if the Christmas coffee and doughnut live up to the hype. I took the lid off my Millionaire\u2019s latte and was hit by something sticky that felt more solid than airborne. I had to peer into the cup to see it, though. The in-store poster featured a tall red cup with piped chocolate cream coiled well above the rim, a bit like the poo emoji, but mine had melted into the hot drink. Of course it had. (Did you know commercial food photographers use shaving cream to emulate whipped cream?) The doughnut looked like a toffee-coated dalek, its surface bejewelled with lots of chewy shortbread bits. I marvelled at how puffy and unsweet it was as I took my third bite and I was suddenly squirting gloopy caramel everywhere. It is a filled doughnut. I am a certified sugar fiend, though, so I felt golden right then. A couple of things I noticed on my second visit (I forgot to take photographs first time around) and then on my third (I spilled the second coffee and the cashier mistakenly gave me a plain doughnut). Table service is possible if you eat in. And you can customise the latte with added cream (?!) which takes the whole order over 500 calories (FIVE HUNDRED?!). I clearly caught the staff\u2019s attention, as the woman making my final latte whispered: \u201cIt\u2019s the same customer\u201d to her colleague at the till. \u201cYup, I\u2019m beginning to recognise you guys, too,\u201d I thought, because that was my third order and I received neither the pretty red cup with the perfect mound of chocolate cream promised by the advert nor the large cup size I paid extra for three times in a row. But I don\u2019t blame them for any of it, because their salaries and the advert are more than a joke \u2013 they\u2019re an insult. After that, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to eat or drink any more. The first purchase stuck in my gut like a bad secret. And that was when I realised: that probably is what being a millionaire feels like, at least the extravagant side of having more money than any one person could ever need. That first bite might be a total high, but it\u2019s all downhill from there, and the only person waiting for you at the bottom of the hill is your own damn self.",

Emails from Miller to a former Breitbart writer, sent before and after he joined the Trump campaign, show Miller obsessively focused on injecting white nationalist-style talking points on race and crime, Confederate monuments, and Islam into the far-right website\u2019s campaign coverage, the SPLC report says. Miller, one of the few surviving initial appointees in the administration, has been credited with orchestrating Trump\u2019s restrictionist immigration policies.

Miller\u2019s emails had a \u201cstrikingly narrow\u201d focus on race and immigration, according to the SPLC report. At various times, the SPLC reports, Miller recommendations for McHugh included the white nationalist website, VDare; Camp of the Saints, a racist novel focused on a \u201creplacement\u201d of European whites by mass third-world immigration; conspiracy site Infowars; and Refugee Resettlement Watch, a fringe anti-immigrant site whose tagline is \u201cThey are changing America by changing the people\u201d. McHugh also says that in a phone call, Miller suggested that she promote an analysis of race and crime featured on the website of a white nationalist organization, American Renaissance. The American Renaissance article he mentioned was the subject of significant interest on the far right in 2015. In the two weeks following the murder of nine people at a church in Charleston by the white supremacist Dylann Roof as Americans demanded the removal of Confederate statues and flags, Miller encouraged McHugh to turn the narrative back on leftists and Latinos. \u201cShould the cross be removed from immigrant communities, in light of the history of Spanish conquest?\u201d he asked in one email on 24 June. \u201cWhen will the left be made to apologize for the blood on their hands supporting every commie regime since Stalin?\u201d he asked in another the following day. When another mass shooting happened in Oregon in October 2015, Miller wrote that the killer, Chris Harper-Mercer \u201cis described as \u2018mixed race\u2019 and born in England.

In 2017, the transfer of 1.6m patient records at the Royal Free hospital in London to the company\u2019s artificial intelligence arm DeepMind Health was found to have an \u201cinappropriate legal basis\u201d by the UK\u2019s watchdog on data. The ambition of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet is to develop new AI tools that can help predict health patterns and improve treatment. Google recently announced plans to buy Fitbit for $2.1bn, aiming to enter the wearables market and invest in digital health. Google and Ascension have released statements in the wake of the disclosure of Project Nightingale, insisting it conforms with HIPAA and all federal health laws. They said that patient data was protected. Google Cloud told the Wall Street Journal that the aim was \u201cultimately improving outcomes, reducing costs, and saving lives\u201d. In a statement, Ascension said: \u201cAll work related to Ascension\u2019s engagement with Google is HIPAA compliant and underpinned by a robust data security and protection effort and adherence to Ascension\u2019s strict requirements for data handling.\u201d In the video, the whistleblower begs to disagree. In annotations that run over the leaked documents, they suggest that in future Google might be able to sell or share the data with third parties, or create patient profiles against which they can advertise healthcare products. \u201cPatients haven\u2019t been told how Ascension is using their data and have not consented to their data being transferred to the cloud or being used by Google. At the very least patients should be told and be able to opt in or opt out,\u201d the whistleblower writes.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/new-look\">New Look</a> has blamed a steep fall in sales on weak consumer spending and mild autumn weather, which knocked demand for its winter clothing ranges.</p> <p>The chief operating officer, Nigel Oddy, said the 7.4% drop in first-half like-for-like sales reflected ongoing consumer uncertainty and seasonal volatility.</p> <p>Sales picked up over the summer months but fell in September due to the \u201cunseasonably warm weather\u201d, which also dented demand at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/25/next-brexit-risks-sales-shares-no-deal\">Next</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>.</p> <p>Oddy is working with the executive chairman, Alistair McGeorge, on a turnaround of the private equity backed business in which half year losses narrowed from \u00a342m to \u00a311m on sales of \u00a3524m in the six months to the end of September. McGeorge returned to the helm in 2017, having successfully led a previous revamp.</p> <p>Last year New Look used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/07/new-look-considers-shutting-60-stores-across-the-uk\">a company voluntary arrangement</a> \u2013 a form of insolvency \u2013 to close 102 stores and slash its rent bill. The turnaround team said the retailer had alienated its core customers by selling clothes that were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/12/new-look-fashion-chain-slumps-to-massive-annual-loss\">too young and edgy</a> </p> <p>To rectify that New Look said only 2% of this year\u2019s winter clothing range was the \u201ctrend\u201d product that accounted for 75% of the 2018 ranges. It had also cut the size of the range by a quarter and decreased the \u201cclothing lead times\u201d \u2013 the time it takes from the beginning of the design process to a product reaching stores \u2013 by 12 days so it could repeat successful products.</p> <p>\u201cWe have reviewed our entire product range,\u201d Oddy said. \u201cOur offer is now much improved as we focus on buying into successful trends quickly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the GlobalData retail analyst Sofie Willmott said that after two years there was little evidence the turnaround was bearing fruit and suggested there was a risk New Look could lose the shoppers wanting to buy low-cost, on-trend pieces.</p> <p>\u201cNew Look is at risk of going down the same road as M&amp;S by offering a range that is too safe,\u201d she said.</p> <p> Brait, the investment vehicle controlled by the South African billionaire Christo Wiese, paid \u00a3780m for a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/15/new-look-deal-south-african-tycoon\"> majority stake in New Look in 2015</a>. However, its holding was diluted as part of this year\u2019s debt restructuring, which reduced the debt it was carrying from \u00a31.35bn to \u00a3350m.

      "bodyText": "New Look has blamed a steep fall in sales on weak consumer spending and mild autumn weather, which knocked demand for its winter clothing ranges. The chief operating officer, Nigel Oddy, said the 7.4% drop in first-half like-for-like sales reflected ongoing consumer uncertainty and seasonal volatility. Sales picked up over the summer months but fell in September due to the \u201cunseasonably warm weather\u201d, which also dented demand at Next and Marks &amp; Spencer. Oddy is working with the executive chairman, Alistair McGeorge, on a turnaround of the private equity backed business in which half year losses narrowed from \u00a342m to \u00a311m on sales of \u00a3524m in the six months to the end of September. McGeorge returned to the helm in 2017, having successfully led a previous revamp. Last year New Look used a company voluntary arrangement \u2013 a form of insolvency \u2013 to close 102 stores and slash its rent bill. The turnaround team said the retailer had alienated its core customers by selling clothes that were too young and edgy To rectify that New Look said only 2% of this year\u2019s winter clothing range was the \u201ctrend\u201d product that accounted for 75% of the 2018 ranges. It had also cut the size of the range by a quarter and decreased the \u201cclothing lead times\u201d \u2013 the time it takes from the beginning of the design process to a product reaching stores \u2013 by 12 days so it could repeat successful products. \u201cWe have reviewed our entire product range,\u201d Oddy said. \u201cOur offer is now much improved as we focus on buying into successful trends quickly.\u201d However, the GlobalData retail analyst Sofie Willmott said that after two years there was little evidence the turnaround was bearing fruit and suggested there was a risk New Look could lose the shoppers wanting to buy low-cost, on-trend pieces. \u201cNew Look is at risk of going down the same road as M&amp;S by offering a range that is too safe,\u201d she said. Brait, the investment vehicle controlled by the South African billionaire Christo Wiese, paid \u00a3780m for a majority stake in New Look in 2015. However, its holding was diluted as part of this year\u2019s debt restructuring, which reduced the debt it was carrying from \u00a31.35bn to \u00a3350m. Brait remains the biggest shareholder with an 18% stake.",

      "body": "<p>On 12 December the country faces its fourth election in a little under five years and, with the stakes so high, the opinion polls are the subject of a great deal of scrutiny and speculation. It is fair to say that pollsters have not covered themselves in glory recently, with failures of varying magnitudes in the last three national elections. So can we trust the polls in 2019, and what are some of the issues that poll watchers should look out for?</p> <p>In broad terms, the answer to the question of whether the polls can be trusted is a qualified yes. Will Jennings, professor of political science and public policy at the University of Southampton, has constructed <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00822-2_14\" title=\"\">a database of polls</a> from the final week of every UK election since 1945. This shows that, on average, the polls have come within around two percentage points of the actual vote share for each main party. Given the technical difficulty of accurately estimating vote shares, that\u2019s a pretty impressive record.</p> <p>However, two important caveats are in order. First, this is a long-run average and in some elections, such as 1992 and 2015, the error was larger. Second, the average error on the difference between the two main parties is larger at four points, and this is the more important number for predicting which party will form the government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even if the polls get the national vote share correct, there is no guarantee they will be a good guide to which party (or parties) form the next government</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Underneath these long-run averages, there\u2019s also the confusing phenomenon of different polls giving very divergent readings. Last week, for example, we had YouGov giving the Tories a 14-point lead over Labour while ICM estimated a lead of just <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-election-poll/pm-johnsons-conservatives-have-seven-point-lead-over-labour-icm-idUKKBN1XE1M5\" title=\"\">seven points</a>, even though both polls were conducted on the same day. How can this be? Well, partly it is just the random variability that we should expect to see across different samples. Indeed, random sampling variability is the very reason that we should not put too much interpretive weight on any single poll as it could be an outlier or statistical oddity.</p> <p>But it is also to do with the different ways pollsters collect their samples and the decisions they have to make about factors such as predicted levels of turnout, and how to treat undecided voters. Ideally, there would be some way of figuring out now which are the good and the bad polls.

      "bodyText": "On 12 December the country faces its fourth election in a little under five years and, with the stakes so high, the opinion polls are the subject of a great deal of scrutiny and speculation. It is fair to say that pollsters have not covered themselves in glory recently, with failures of varying magnitudes in the last three national elections. So can we trust the polls in 2019, and what are some of the issues that poll watchers should look out for? In broad terms, the answer to the question of whether the polls can be trusted is a qualified yes. Will Jennings, professor of political science and public policy at the University of Southampton, has constructed a database of polls from the final week of every UK election since 1945. This shows that, on average, the polls have come within around two percentage points of the actual vote share for each main party. Given the technical difficulty of accurately estimating vote shares, that\u2019s a pretty impressive record. However, two important caveats are in order. First, this is a long-run average and in some elections, such as 1992 and 2015, the error was larger. Second, the average error on the difference between the two main parties is larger at four points, and this is the more important number for predicting which party will form the government. Underneath these long-run averages, there\u2019s also the confusing phenomenon of different polls giving very divergent readings. Last week, for example, we had YouGov giving the Tories a 14-point lead over Labour while ICM estimated a lead of just seven points, even though both polls were conducted on the same day. How can this be? Well, partly it is just the random variability that we should expect to see across different samples. Indeed, random sampling variability is the very reason that we should not put too much interpretive weight on any single poll as it could be an outlier or statistical oddity. But it is also to do with the different ways pollsters collect their samples and the decisions they have to make about factors such as predicted levels of turnout, and how to treat undecided voters. Ideally, there would be some way of figuring out now which are the good and the bad polls. But that would require some other more accurate measure of the future election result; and if we had that, we wouldn\u2019t need polls. The primary methodological challenge for pollsters is to produce samples that are representative of the population of voters, without knowing exactly what that population looks like. The failure to produce representative samples was what led to the 2015 polling disaster, when the polls all predicted a hung parliament but the Conservatives won a clear majority. The basic problem then was that the polls contained too many Labour voters and not enough Conservatives. Pollsters try to make their samples representative by applying statistical weights, adjusting the sample so that it looks like the voting population in terms of age, sex, education and so on. Most polls are also weighted to the vote share at the last election, which makes sense if the primary objective is to make the sample as politically representative as possible. However, past-vote weighting can be problematic in situations where many voters have switched parties and new parties have emerged since the previous election. This is, of course, exactly the situation we find ourselves in now. And, even if the polls get the national vote share correct, there is no guarantee they will be a good guide to which party (or parties) form the next government. The high rate of tactical voting, switching between parties and uneven geographical spread of party support across the country mean that translating national vote shares into seats using uniform national swing \u2013 which assumes the direction and magnitude of change in party support at the national level will be consistent across all constituencies \u2013 is likely to produce inaccurate results. The difficulty of translating national vote shares into seats is one of the reasons that poll commissioners are increasingly turning to MRP (multilevel regression and post-stratification).

      "bodyText": "More than half of the Italians surveyed in a recent poll have said that racist acts were either sometimes or always \u201cjustifiable\u201d, a finding that comes after a series of high-profile racist and antisemitic incidents across the country. The polling firm, SWG, questioned a sample of 1,500 people of whom 10% said racist acts were always justified and a further 45% who said racist acts could be acceptable depending on the situation. The remaining 45% said racist acts of any kind were completely unacceptable. SWG conducts the same survey once a year and for the first time in a decade the majority of those questioned did not condemn racism outright. \u201cWhat this means is that there has been a relaxation in attitudes towards racism \u2013 not necessarily that people have become racist, more that they are becoming more accepting of racist acts and do not consider them so scandalous,\u201d said Enzo Risso, scientific director at SWG. He added that the change in attitude was partly due to the proliferation of online hate speech. \u201cWe can say anything about anyone and are becoming more used to it,\u201d said Risso. \u201cThis is a bad sign from a civic point of view. It\u2019s not only in Italy \u2026 what we\u2019re seeing in other countries too is a sort of adaptation towards the worst.\u201d On Monday night, thousands of Italians converged in the rain at Milan\u2019s central station in support of Liliana Segre, a Holocaust survivor who was last week assigned a police escort after a surge in the number of online threats, many against her life, she receives from far-right extremists. Segre, a senator for life, gets an average 200 online threats a day and the situation worsened after her proposal to establish a commission to combat racism, antisemitism and incitement to hatred was passed by the government. All parties backed the proposal apart from the far-right League, its smaller ally, Brothers of Italy, and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia. Segre was 13 when on 30 January 1944, along with several other family members, she was deported to Auschwitz from platform 21 at Milan\u2019s central station. Racist chanting also continues to blight Italian football at all levels, with Mario Balotelli a target during a recent Serie A game between his team, Brescia, and Verona. The League and Brothers of Italy continuously campaign on an \u201cItalians first\u201d platform, never publicly condemn racist acts and, on occasion, sue people who accuse them of being racist for defamation. Matteo Salvini, the former interior minister and leader of the League, last year filed a case against the black former senator C\u00e9cile Kyenge, who has suffered several racist attacks from League politicians. Polling at 34.5%, the League is the biggest party in Italy, while support for Brothers of Italy is on the rise. Last week two Brothers of Italy members toured a council housing block in Bologna to show the number of foreigners living there in an attempt to highlight their belief that Italians were being penalised in the housing system. \u201cThey will say that we are violating privacy, but we do not care,\u201d the pair said in a live video on Facebook.",

The best advice for Pessina and KKR is surely to lie down until the feeling goes away.",

Three sources said Newsquest, the UK\u2019s second-biggest regional newspaper group, which publishes 200 titles including the Argus, in Brighton, and Glasgow\u2019s Evening Times, was considered the frontrunner to seal a deal for JPI\u2019s extensive regional newspaper portfolio. The publicly listed Reach, which owns national and regional titles including the Mirror, the Daily Express and the Manchester Evening News, is the only bidder to publicly admit it is in talks with JPI, formerly Johnston Press, which collapsed last year and re-emerged under new ownership as JPI. Reach had been considered to be the frontrunner to seal a deal. The sources said Reach was still involved in the process, having tabled a bid thought to be valued at about \u00a350m, but that Newsquest was considered the preferred bidder, having tabled a more substantial offer. Newsquest looked to buy JPI\u2019s regional portfolio last year \u2013 but not national newspaper the i \u2013 when the publisher launched an 11th-hour attempt to sell itself and crown jewel assets to try to pay debts of more than \u00a3220m. At the time, Newsquest made a cash offer valuing the regional business at between \u00a396m and \u00a3120m, with no pension deficit obligation. JPI rejected all the offers made for its assets and instead chose to enter administration, a day later agreeing a rescue and restructuring plan tabled by its biggest lenders. When JPI\u2019s owners moved to put the business up for sale again this summer, Newsquest once again became involved in the auction process. However, the takeover of Newsquest\u2019s US parent, Gannett, the owner of USA Today, by GateHouse Media put a temporary hold on moving forward with a formal bid. While the takeover of JPI would create a regional newspaper powerhouse, Newsquest will face a competition investigation if it manages to complete a deal. Scotland poses a significant potential issue as Newsquest owns titles including the Herald, the Evening Times and the National, while JPI owns a portfolio including the Scotsman, Scotland on Sunday and the Edinburgh Evening News. It is understood Newsquest would seek to operate the Scotsman portfolio in a \u201chold separate\u201d agreement, with an independent management team to run the business until regulatory scrutiny was complete. Reach did this with the Daily Express, the Sunday Express, the Daily Star and the Daily Star Sunday after acquiring the Northern &amp; Shell business from Richard Desmond in a \u00a3200m deal last year. In August, Reach replaced its chief executive, Simon Fox, with the former Ladbrokes Coral chief and News UK executive Jim Mullen. The Guardian revealed in September that Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, the owner of the Daily Mail, had entered exclusive talks to buy the i newspaper from JPI for about \u00a350m.",

Smith\u2019s first play, titled The Wife of Willesden, was announced on Tuesday as a highlight of the programme next year when Brent in north-west London becomes the capital\u2019s second borough of culture. Lois Stonock, the artistic director of Brent 2020, said they had contacted Smith in New York at an early stage in the planning. \u201cShe got back straight away and said, \u2018I really love my borough, it is really important to me\u2019 and she said yes, she would get involved.\u201d She said the piece would raise questions about the place of women in society and aim to capture the voice of Brent. \u201cZadie talks about the Brent accent. She reckons she can identify it anywhere in the world and I think she might be on to something. There is a way of talking that is very Brent.\u201d The piece, a monologue, will be staged at the Kiln Theatre, which staged an adaptation of Smith\u2019s novel White Teeth as part of its opening season after its refurbishment and transformation from Tricycle. Brent is following Waltham Forest as a London borough of culture, a scheme initiated by Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, and based on the success of the first of the UK\u2019s European capitals of culture \u2013 Glasgow and Liverpool \u2013 and the UK cities of culture \u2013 Derry, Hull and, in 2021, Coventry. Other highlights of the year will include a mile-long summer street party on London\u2019s oldest and longest road, Kilburn High Road; a weekend-long reggae takeover of Harlesden\u2019s high street; and the return of the Mobo awards to Brent, 25 years after they were dreamed up by Kanya King in the bedroom of her Kilburn home. In July, a new anthem for London will be performed at Wembley Arena, created by the singer-songwriter Rahel Debebe-Dessalegne and the poet Momtaza Mehri. The year will kick off on 18 January with an opening celebration spanning the length of Olympic Way to Wembley Park. It will, said Stonock, be Brent\u2019s version of the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony. Carolyn Downs, the council\u2019s chief executive, said Brent was the most diverse borough in London and that would be reflected in the programme. \u201cDiversity is our strength and our greatest asset,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will celebrate migration, which has formed the bedrock of our communities and this borough for generations, at a time of great uncertainty and hostility to people who come to this country.

However, fire chiefs have warned that despite cooler conditions expected on Wednesday and Thursday, dangerous fire conditions will return late in the week. At least 170 houses have been razed in fires across New South Wales and Queensland, but no further lives were lost on Tuesday, predicted by fire chiefs to be the most dangerous bushfire conditions the nation had ever seen. Three people died in out-of-control bushfires at the weekend, two of them apparently trying to flee fast-moving fire fronts in cars. In one of Australia\u2019s largest peacetime military mobilisations, the army is expected to be deployed \u2013 including an unprecedented compulsory call-up of reserve soldiers \u2013 to assist in the firefighting and clean-up from widespread fires, some of which have burned for weeks over more than 1m hectares (2.5m acres). On Tuesday, hundreds of schools were closed, and entire towns evacuated, as temperatures in the high 30s and gusty winds fanned dozens of existing fires across NSW and Queensland. An extreme and persistent drought has left much of the two states tinder-dry, with forests, grasslands, and farmland vulnerable to dry lightning strikes or accidental blazes. NSW had declared an unprecedented \u201ccatastrophic\u201d rating for Sydney and surrounding regions for Tuesday, when firefighting conditions were at their worst.

There are more than 70 fires burning across the state, and more than 40 of them are out of control. There are suspicions a fire in the northern Sydney suburb of Turramurra may have been started deliberately. In Queensland 50 fires are burning, according to state authorities. Before Tuesday\u2019s catastrophic conditions, as thousands of people evacuated their homes and whole towns in the path of fires were emptied, Fitzsimmons warned that those who chose to stay to defend their homes might be stranded, and that firefighters could not save everyone. \u201cWe cannot guarantee a fire truck at every home,\u201d Fitzsimmons said. \u201cWe cannot guarantee that someone will knock on your door and give you a warning.\u201d A cooling southerly change is expected to sweep north through NSW into Queensland overnight, but while that will lower temperatures, it might also swing fires back towards settlements that were previously out of the path of the fires.

After Morrison offered \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to those who had lost family and homes, but refused to answer questions on climate change, critics compared his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to those offered by the NRA after mass shootings in the US, as a substitute for discussion on gun control.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap, from our economics editor Larry Elliott, on today\u2019s jobs data: Employment in the UK has fallen at its fastest rate in four years amid growing evidence that a slowing economy is taking its toll on the labour market. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that pay growth had fallen back in the three months to September, leading to speculation that the jobs market is past its peak. Publishing data that may increase the chances of a cut in interest rates from the Bank of England, the ONS said employment had fallen by 58,000 during the third quarter of 2019. It was the biggest fall since May 2015. The drop in employment was smaller than the 102,000 fall the financial markets had been expecting but job vacancies continued to be scarcer and saw their biggest annual fall since late 2009. Strong growth in employment has been a feature of the economy in recent years but a slowdown in growth and heightened Brexit uncertainty made businesses more cautious about hiring during the summer. The fall in employment was accompanied by an easing of annual earnings growth to 3.6% on both the measures used by the ONS \u2013 including and excluding bonuses.... Professor Costas Milas Liverpool University has also crunched today\u2019s data, and reckons that the unemployment rate (now just 3.8%) probably won\u2019t fall any further. He explains: I have plotted a measure of the UK output gap (UK GDP relative to \u2018trend output; the latter based on the average of three standard trend measures: quadratic trend, Hodrick-Prescott trend and Christiano-Fitzgerald trend) together with the UK unemployment rate and annual changes in the UK unemployment rate. As the economy expands, unemployment drops. It now appears that the economy has settled to around 0.9% below par which means that a further drop in the unemployment rate (from its current values 3.8%-3.9%) does not look likely. Unless, of course, there is a surge in demand..... This looks unlikely in the current climate of Brexit-related uncertainty. Unless, of course, the BoE cuts the policy rate\u2026.Which, MPC might want to do because, as the plot shows, the very fact that output is below equilibrium implies a low risk of inflation! Back in the markets, eurozone stocks are still higher today as investors await Donald Trump\u2019s speech at the New York economic club at 5pm UK time. Ben White of Politico has heard that the president will make encouraging noises about a trade deal with China. He writes: There will be plenty of cheerleading about the low jobless rate, wage growth, stock market gains and the extension of the longest economic recovery in history. Perhaps even some stuff about the \u201cgreatest economy ever.\u201d But the most interesting section will be on China. Investors around the world will be looking for signals about whether a \u201cPhase One\u201d deal where tariffs on both sides are reduced and the further levies on consumer goods imported from China expected to go into effect in December disappear, at least for now. MM is told by a source familiar with Trump\u2019s remarks that there will a \u201cconstructive statement on China.\u201d Such comments could boost Wall Street. However, the futures market is predicting a flat open, ahead of Trump\u2019s comments. Here\u2019s a handy thread on today\u2019s jobs data, from Chris Giles of the Financial Times: The drop in part-time workers, and in younger workers, is a worrying sign, according to the Resolution Foundation: Their economic analyst Nye Cominetti explains why it could herald a downturn: \u201cUntil now the jobs market has seemed immune to wider economic conditions, and the uncertainty that is dragging on UK growth. But falling employment, fewer vacancies and slowing pay growth suggest this may no longer be the case. \u201cThe recent drop in female employment and slight uptick in youth unemployment are worrying symptoms, as these groups are often first to feel the effects of falling employment. \u201cToday\u2019s signals should give all political parties on the campaign trail pause for thought. This year may have seen record levels of employment, but the next government needs to be prepared for the consequences of a rockier road ahead.\u201d Over in Germany, economic confidence has bounced back from its recent slump - an encouraging signal. The ZEW Institute\u2019s sentiment index has come in at -1, up from -23.5 in October. Although still in negative territory, it suggests investors are less gloomy. ZEW reckons that the prospect of a Brexit deal and a breakthrough in the US-China rade war have boosted German investor sentiment. ZEW president Achim Wambach said: \u201cHope is growing that the political and economic environment will improve in the near future.\u201d Simon French, chief executive of Panmure Gordon, has a balanced take on today\u2019s jobs report: The drop in part-time workers has hit women workers harder than men (as they are more likely to be working part-time, jugging work and family commitments). The ONS says: The number of part-time workers fell by 164,000 to 8.54 million in Quarter 3 2019, while the number of full-time workers increased by 106,000 to 24.21 million. The decline in part-time workers was driven by women (down 106,000 in the quarter) and the increase in full-time employment by men (up by 93,000 in the quarter). Young people and part time workers are bearing the brunt of the UK jobs slowdown, as these charts from ING show: James Smith, ING\u2019s Developed Markets Economist, says: The recent fall in employment has been predominantly driven by 18-24 year-olds, and once that group is stripped out, jobs growth is still positive. A large chunk of the fall has also been led by part-time employees. It\u2019s not clear whether these two factors are linked, but both can be reasonably volatile parts of the jobs data. But with forward-looking hiring indicators deteriorating, and given the risk that Brexit uncertainty persists into 2020, there\u2019s a clear risk the jobs market deteriorates further over coming months.\u201d Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, has spotted that the number of part-time workers has fallen very sharply over the summer. More than 100,000 more workers were employed full-time over the latest three-month period than in the previous quarter. This increase is roughly evenly split between employees and self-employed workers. Set against this good news, however, is a very large decline in numbers of part-time workers \u2013 a fall of 160,000 in total. Overall, therefore, the number of people in employment has fallen. This is accompanied by a rise in the numbers of people who are economically inactive \u2013 especially amongst 18-24 year olds. Meanwhile, unemployment has fallen by some 23,000 and the unemployment rate is back down to 3.8%. Britain\u2019s bosses are worried that the UK jobs market is under strain Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, says some firms are putting projects on hold due to political and economic uncertainty (thanks to Brexit and the general election). Others are struggling to find qualified staff, he says. \u201cWith so many in work there has been a lift to household incomes, which has supported the economy through a challenging period. However, businesses are now finding it harder to access the talent needed to fill openings, so jobs growth is expected to slow further. Many firms are also putting recruitment plans on ice as wider projects and investments are bottled up by uncertainty. Vacancies are likely to continue falling. The IoD also argues that wages will come under pressure: \u201cThe pick-up in wage growth earlier this year has been a plus, but there is clearly a limit to how high pay packets can go. With many firms facing elevated costs and difficulties raising their productivity game, the margins to raise pay are eroding. A further acceleration in wages now looks unlikely. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is disappointed that wage growth has slowed in the last quarter. Although wages (+3.6%) are rising faster than inflation (+1.7%), this doesn\u2019t make up for falling real wages in recent years (see figure 4, here). \u201cWorking families are thousands of pounds out of pocket after a decade of dismal pay growth. That is not right. \u201cThe Conservatives have presided over the longest wage squeeze since Napoleonic times. They have nothing to boast about. The TUC has calculated that the median employee is \u00a314,278 worse off today than they would be had wages kept pace with inflation since 2008. In the same period, unsecured household debt has risen by a third to a record high of \u00a314,177. Here\u2019s the Office for National Statistics\u2019s take on today\u2019s data: \u201cThe employment rate is higher than a year ago, though broadly unchanged in recent months. \u201cVacancies have seen their biggest annual fall since late 2009, but remain high by historical standards. The number of EU nationals in work was very little changed on the year, with almost all the growth in overseas workers coming from non-EU nationals.\u201d Britain\u2019s employment rate has dropped to 76%, from 76.1%, in the last quarter as the number of people in work fell by 58,000. That\u2019s still close to a record high, following a steady recovery since the financial crisis But at 3.8%, the unemployment rate has dropped back to its lowest since the mid-1970s. That\u2019s because more people have become economically inactive - neither working nor looking for a job. Wage growth has also reversed its recent gains, with average basic pay rising by 3.6%, down from 3.8% a month ago. That means real earnings, adjusted for inflation, are also rising at a slower rate. This should also set alarm bells ringing: More bad news. The number of vacancies in the UK economy has fallen by 14,000 in the last quarter. That\u2019s the biggest quarterly decline since 2009, according to the ONS. There are now 800,000 jobs waiting to be filled, down from 814,000 a month ago. This further suggests the jobs market is cooling. Vacancies hit a record high of 861,000 at the start of this year, but have been falling since. In a blow to workers, wage growth has slowed. Average earnings rose by 3.6% per annum in the July-September quarter, the Office for National Statistics reports (both including and excluding bonuses). That\u2019s down from 3.8% per year a month ago for basic pay, and 3.7% for total pay. Newsflash: The number of people in work across the UK has fallen, in a sign that Britain\u2019s labour market may be weakening. The employment total fell by 58,000 in the three months to September, according to the latest Labour Market statistics. According to Reuters data this is the biggest drop in employment in four years, taking the employment total down to 32,753m. That follows a 56,000 fall in employment reported a month ago. However, the unemployment total has also fallen by 23,000 to 1.306m in the July-September quarter, which drags the jobless rate down to 3.8%. This suggests that more people have dropped out of the labour market, and stopped looking for work More to follow! Nearly 30% of European car exports go to the US at present, so the industry would obviously be relieved if Trump delays imposing a new 20% tariff. But... pushing the decision back by six months also creates uncertainty, and another cliff edge dilemma next May. Garry White of investment managers Charles Stanley calls it a \u2018sword of Damocles\u2019, which could drop unpleasantly on the industry... Land Securities, which owns the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, has slumped to a first-half loss, hit by a raft of store closures as retailers struggle against weaker consumer spending and a shift to online shopping. The property firm posted a \u00a3147m loss for the six months to September, against a \u00a342m profit a year earlier. Rental income at its retail division fell by \u00a32m or 1.5% while offices fared better, up \u00a33m or 2.5%. Shopping centres outside London are struggling in particular, where footfall was down 1.8%. About 3.6% of the firm\u2019s retail space stood empty, a slight improvement on the 4% recorded at the end of March, but there were more units in administration (1.4% against 0.9% in March). The most recent high street failure is Mothercare, which is shutting all its UK shops after going into administration last week. Chief executive Robert Noel said the rise in Company Voluntary Arrangements, which allow retailers to ditch under-performing stores, has hurt profits: \u201cThe retail market continues to be challenged as retailers adapt to structural change, rising costs and a more cautious consumer \u2026 Limited demand for space and poor investor sentiment is impacting rental and capital values. We have seen further high-profile CVAs and administrations in the period, notably Debenhams and Arcadia. Clearly, we are not immune from these trends but, where we have been hit by CVAs, our assets remain popular with occupiers and customers. And where stores have closed, we have had reasonable re-letting success - with more than half of units re-let or in solicitors\u2019 hands as at 30 September.\u201d Premier Foods shares are up 7.7% to 35.9p in early trading. The company has enjoyed a boost to its profits from the relaunch of its classic range of Mr Kipling cakes. The new offerings are somewhat more upmarket -- After Dinner Mint Fancies; Apple, Pear &amp; Custard Crumble Tarts and Chocolate, Caramel &amp; Pecan slices Premier also reported strong sales of Nissin noodles, and has launched a new plant-based range of snacks, called Plantastic, made from grains, fruit and vegetables, to tap into the trend for healthier eating. Premier Foods, which makes a host of well-known brands such as Bisto gravy, Ambrosia puddings and Oxo cubes, posted a 5% rise in adjusted pretax profit to \u00a331.7m for the six months to 28 September. It has also reduced its debt, by nearly \u00a339m to \u00a3470.7m. Broadcaster ITV is the best-performing FTSE 100 share, up almost 3%, after it reported a rise in advertising revenue in the last quarter. England\u2019s rugby team can take some of the credit - their run to the World Cup final helped ITV to pull in more viewers (even if the final didn\u2019t go as many hoped). This morning\u2019s trade war optimism is helping to lift European markets. Most of the main indices are higher, led by Germany\u2019s DAX (+0.4%). Car makers, industrial groups and tech firms are all rallying. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are bracing for Donald Trump\u2019s speech tonight: All eyes will on Donald Trump after markets close in Europe as the president is due to deliver a speech at the New York Economic Club later, expected at 17:00 GMT. This poses all kinds of risks - on everything from China and trade to the Fed and impeachment. Markets will be on tenterhooks. The president\u2019s speeches are akin to throwing a dart blindfolded. We may get an update on planned US tariffs on EU autos, which are expected to be delayed for six months. The deadline for the president to kick this into the long grass is tomorrow. Shares in European carmakers are rising in early trading. Daimler (+1.25%), BMW (+1%) and Volkswagen (+0.7%) are all among the top risers in Frankfurt. European Union officials are also quietly optimistic that Trump will resist triggering the car tariffs this week. One told Reuters: \u201cWe have a solid indication from the administration that there will not be tariffs on us this week.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fighting a war on multiple fronts is never easy -- you risk losing focus, fighting the wrong battles, and creating too many foes to tackle at once. So it\u2019s understandable that the US may be swaying away from escalating its trade dispute with Europe, as it tried to secure a win against China. According to multiple sources, Donald Trump is reportedly planning to delay a planned hike on EU car imports. He has to decide by Wednesday whether to impose a 20% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts, or kick the decision down the road for another six months. These tariffs were first threatened a year ago, as the two sides began a tit-for-tat trade spat which hit European steel and American peanut butter, whiskey and motorcycles. Trump has already delayed these tariffs once. One source told Politico that the president is planning to announce another six-month delay: That would avoid a new bruising dispute with one of the United States\u2019 biggest trading partners, just as Trump is trying to put out another trade fire by striking an initial deal with China. But it would also set the stage for Trump to revisit the controversial trade issue in the throes of next year\u2019s presidential campaign. The person with familiar the decision cautioned there is always uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s final determination when it comes to trades and tariffs. But barring some unforeseen development, the president is expected to announce another six-month delay, the person said. Outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is also hopeful that Trump will resist escalating tensions between Washington and Brussels. He told Germany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung late last week: \u201cTrump is going to make some criticism, but there won\u2019t be any auto tariffs. He won\u2019t do it. ... You are speaking to a fully informed man.\u201d Such a move would obviously boost European car makers, who have already been hurt by trade tensions and weakening demand in China. It could also reassure markets, where investors are disappointed that the US-China negotiations over a Phase One trade deal are dragging on. But predicting the president\u2019s next move is often tricky. Donald Trump is due to speak at the Economic Club of New York later today, so we may hear more clues about his trade war strategy. Also coming up today Yesterday we learned that UK growth has fallen to a 10-year low, as Brexit uncertainty continues to hit investment and the global economy weakens. Today we get the latest labour market report, which is expected to show that the UK employment total fell by around 94,000 in the last quarter. That would reinforce concerns that the jobs market is cooling. Economists also predict that the unemployment rate will remain at 3.9%, close to a four-decades low, with wage growth pegged at 3.8%. There may be drama at the High Court too, as the Royal Mail tries to block a planned strike that could disrupt Christmas deliveries and postal votes in next month\u2019s general election. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK unemployment data for July-September 10am GMT: ZEW survey of eurozone economic confidence 5pm GMT: President Donald Trump speaks at Economic Club of New York",

The implication, confusingly enough, is that a modern novel is a postmodern one, since Fowles names both a leading postmodernist (Barthes) and a thinker credited with pointing the way towards it (Robbe-Grillet). The latter\u2019s big contention, when he wrote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pour_un_nouveau_roman\">Towards </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pour_un_nouveau_roman\">a New Novel</a> in 1963, was that the novel is a form that must constantly evolve.

But The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman is still characterised as a postmodern exercise. What could be more postmodern than interrupting your narrative to disavow postmodernism? </p> <p>However, Fowles\u2019s thoughts on his own writing make his process seem less self-conscious than subconscious. He is most concerned with his characters\u2019 independence; they will not do as he \u201corders\u201d, instead acting \u201cgratuitously\u201d and with \u201cautonomy\u201d. He denies that his interruptions break the \u201cillusion\u201d of their reality because \u201cmy characters still exist\u201d.</p> <p>Fowles expanded on this idea in an essay published in Harper\u2019s Magazine in 1968, called Notes on an Unfinished Novel. There, he wrote that The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman started not with an intellectual idea, but an image: \u201cA woman stands at the end of a deserted quay and stares out to sea. That was all.\u201d</p> <p>The quay became \u201cspecific\u201d to him, as he could see the famous Lyme Regis Cobb from the bottom of his garden. The woman \u201cseemed\u201d Victorian, but since she was standing \u201cwith her back turned\u201d, she struck him as a \u201creproach\u201d to the age. And so the novel began to build. \u201cFollow the accident, fear the fixed plan \u2013 that is the rule,\u201d says Fowles. \u201cWriting is like eating or making love: a natural process, not an artificial one.\u201d</p> <p>Fowles relied on his imagination; he even claimed to have been writing \u201cscience fiction\u201d at certain points because no \u201crespectable\u201d (the scare quotes are his) Victorian novelist had ever described a couple in bed, leaving him with no guide when he came to write such a scene himself.</p> <p>One place where Fowles did have good precedents was in authorial interventions. He quotes Thackeray at length, who clambered over the fourth wall to chat away to his readers and make them question who the narrative \u201cI\u201d was. (Thackeray carried out all kinds of tricks it would be tempting to call postmodern, if we didn\u2019t know better.) So it is with Fowles, who claimed that his \u201cI\u201d doesn\u2019t break the illusion of his story \u2013 rather, he is an emotionally involved part of it. Late on in the Harper\u2019s essay, as the book nears publication, he says he hates the day the book goes to press because it is the day \u201cthe people one has loved die\u201d.</p> <p>So much for the thesis. It hasn\u2019t been a \u201ccrossword puzzle\u201d at all, he tells us. Writing the novel has been a mysterious process. He has been guided by emotion and instinct as much as intellect. And perhaps that\u2019s why this book remains so engaging to read 50 years after its publication and 150 years after its setting. It comes from the heart as much as the head.</p>",

However, Fowles\u2019s thoughts on his own writing make his process seem less self-conscious than subconscious. He is most concerned with his characters\u2019 independence; they will not do as he \u201corders\u201d, instead acting \u201cgratuitously\u201d and with \u201cautonomy\u201d. He denies that his interruptions break the \u201cillusion\u201d of their reality because \u201cmy characters still exist\u201d. Fowles expanded on this idea in an essay published in Harper\u2019s Magazine in 1968, called Notes on an Unfinished Novel. There, he wrote that The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman started not with an intellectual idea, but an image: \u201cA woman stands at the end of a deserted quay and stares out to sea. That was all.\u201d The quay became \u201cspecific\u201d to him, as he could see the famous Lyme Regis Cobb from the bottom of his garden. The woman \u201cseemed\u201d Victorian, but since she was standing \u201cwith her back turned\u201d, she struck him as a \u201creproach\u201d to the age. And so the novel began to build. \u201cFollow the accident, fear the fixed plan \u2013 that is the rule,\u201d says Fowles. \u201cWriting is like eating or making love: a natural process, not an artificial one.\u201d Fowles relied on his imagination; he even claimed to have been writing \u201cscience fiction\u201d at certain points because no \u201crespectable\u201d (the scare quotes are his) Victorian novelist had ever described a couple in bed, leaving him with no guide when he came to write such a scene himself. One place where Fowles did have good precedents was in authorial interventions. He quotes Thackeray at length, who clambered over the fourth wall to chat away to his readers and make them question who the narrative \u201cI\u201d was. (Thackeray carried out all kinds of tricks it would be tempting to call postmodern, if we didn\u2019t know better.) So it is with Fowles, who claimed that his \u201cI\u201d doesn\u2019t break the illusion of his story \u2013 rather, he is an emotionally involved part of it. Late on in the Harper\u2019s essay, as the book nears publication, he says he hates the day the book goes to press because it is the day \u201cthe people one has loved die\u201d. So much for the thesis. It hasn\u2019t been a \u201ccrossword puzzle\u201d at all, he tells us. Writing the novel has been a mysterious process. He has been guided by emotion and instinct as much as intellect. And perhaps that\u2019s why this book remains so engaging to read 50 years after its publication and 150 years after its setting. It comes from the heart as much as the head.",

We could stumble further down the path of authoritarian rightwing populism. Or we could have a chance to cure the defining injustices of our time \u2013 the cuts to public services, social security and living standards that have precipitated the present crisis. The Labour party, and its leaders, are not without faults. But they are incomparable with the evils of the governing party. And yet the odds are stacked in favour of the Tories, whose historic mission is to defend the powerful vested interests that have brought us to this point.</p> <p>For anyone with the ability to fight back, there is only one question: if not now, then when?</p>",

They were on the losing side of the Labour civil wars of the 1980s as the party lurched to the right, but their perspective was one I inherited: the \u201cworst\u201d Labour government was always better than the \u201cbest\u201d Tory one; that so long as Labour and the trade unions were institutionally wedded, the party had an organic link to working-class people that made it worth supporting; that you should stand and fight within the party for what you believed in, however hopeless it seemed; and that the responsibility of a socialist was to be involved in mass movements and struggles, not to stand aside. To the dismay (sometimes fury) of many on the left, this philosophy led me to campaign for Labour under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and to travel the country organising mass canvasses for Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour in 2015. This is a far more seismic election than any of those \u2013 a fork in the road for Britain that can be compared only to Thatcher\u2019s assumption of power in 1979. On the one hand is a party committed to a hard Brexit as a blunt instrument to introduce Thatcherism on speed, led by a shameless liar who seizes any chance to bait Muslims, with a cabinet containing more ministers who voted against LGBTQ rights than it does LGBTQ people (zero). On the other is a party offering an escape from a tortuous Brexit, a redistribution of wealth and power, and an end to the failed era of market fundamentalism and ruinous austerity. The political differences I have with Jeremy Corbyn might be smaller than with those of his predecessors, but they still exist. The lack of a consistent pro-migrant case after the referendum was cowardly. The shift away from \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d on Brexit was too slow. The leadership should have been swifter and more decisive in dealing with antisemitism on the left\u2019s fringes. There has been a lack of courage in challenging the failed war on drugs and our punitive justice system. But just look at the stakes. Look at the abyss this country hurtles towards. In this election, the Tories have certain key advantages. They have the financial support of tycoons and hedge fund managers and, more importantly, the active and partisan support of most of the British press. Labour\u2019s principal counterweights are a huge grassroots army and the organising power of social media. So for the next five weeks, I will be travelling the country to encourage Labour members and supporters to knock on doors in key constituencies, and using Facebook and Twitter to spread the word. Many of the canvassers I\u2019ve met are young and have never knocked on doors for a political party before: for some, interest in politics is altogether new. They don\u2019t agree on everything with each other, let alone with Labour. They are aware that this is the fight of their lives \u2013 and they don\u2019t want to regret failing to act in the face of looming catastrophe. For some, this raises a question about the demarcation between journalism and activism. As a columnist \u2013 rather than, say, a news reporter \u2013 my job is to express my opinions. In this regard, all columnists are activists to the extent that they use their platform to persuade others of their political views. The tradition of the politically engaged journalist is a long one, of course. The legendary leftwing muckraker Paul Foot \u2013 after whom our most prestigious investigative journalism award is named \u2013 stood for office several times as a socialist candidate. George Orwell didn\u2019t merely campaign for a political party: he took up arms for one, in the Spanish civil war. Meanwhile, the pages of the Telegraph \u2013 Johnson\u2019s former employer \u2013 as well as the Sun, the Daily Mail, the Express and the Times, are increasingly filled with propaganda straight from the Tory party distributed to millions of households on a daily basis. (Have a look at last weekend\u2019s Sunday Telegraph, Mail on Sunday and Sunday Times \u2013 all leading with the same fake Labour spending figures cooked up by the Conservative research department.) The left\u2019s activists write a few opinion columns; the right\u2019s activists write the front pages. In just over a month, voters will determine the shape of Britain for a generation. We could stumble further down the path of authoritarian rightwing populism. Or we could have a chance to cure the defining injustices of our time \u2013 the cuts to public services, social security and living standards that have precipitated the present crisis. The Labour party, and its leaders, are not without faults. But they are incomparable with the evils of the governing party. And yet the odds are stacked in favour of the Tories, whose historic mission is to defend the powerful vested interests that have brought us to this point. For anyone with the ability to fight back, there is only one question: if not now, then when?",

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s ruling socialist party has reached a preliminary coalition deal with the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos to try to form a government after the country\u2019s second inconclusive election in seven months. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the acting prime minister and leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE), announced the agreement following a meeting with the Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, on Tuesday afternoon. The move comes less than 48 hours after the PSOE won Spain\u2019s fourth general election in as many years but once again fell short of a majority. Sunday\u2019s election was triggered after the PSOE failed to find viable support for a new administration after its victory in April. The socialists and Unidas Podemos were unable to reach an agreement afterwards, while the centre-right Citizens party flatly refused to do anything to facilitate S\u00e1nchez\u2019s return to office. S\u00e1nchez \u2013 who said only two months ago that he would have trouble sleeping if he had Podemos ministers in his government \u2013 said the disagreements of the past no longer mattered. \u201cThe Spanish people have spoken and now it is time for its political leaders to implement that will and to overcome the deadlock that Spain has suffered in recent times,\u201d he said. Iglesias said the newly minted alliance needed to concentrate on the challenges of the present, including the resurgent crisis over Catalan independence and the threat posed by the far-right Vox party, which finished third on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a preliminary agreement to form a progressive coalition government in Spain, a progressive coalition government that combines the PSOE\u2019s experience with the courage of Unidas Podemos. A government that works towards dialogue when it comes to the territorial crisis and for social justice as the best vaccine against the far right,\u201d he said. The PSOE won 120 seats on Sunday, three fewer than in the previous, inconclusive election. The conservative People\u2019s party (PP) won 88 seats, followed by Vox, which more than doubled its number of seats from 24 to 52. Unidas Podemos came fourth with 35 seats, followed by the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left, with 13 seats. Citizens slumped to sixth place, as the 57 seats it picked up seven months ago dwindled to 10. The party\u2019s leader, Albert Rivera, resigned on Monday. Despite the agreement, the arithmetic will still be difficult as 176 seats are needed for a majority in the 350-seat congress of deputies. Between them, the PSOE and Unidas Podemos have 155, to which they can probably add the three won by M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds, a new leftwing party led by \u00cd\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, one of the founders of Podemos. However, they will still need the support of some of Spain\u2019s smaller parties, including Basque and Catalan nationalists, which will doubtless be seized on by both the PP and Vox. Spain\u2019s rightwing parties have repeatedly accused S\u00e1nchez of being too soft on the resurgent Catalan independence movement and of being too beholden to the Catalan separatist parties who helped him into office last year by backing his successful motion of no confidence against the previous PP government. The new coalition may be able to win office by persuading opposition parties to abstain: in the second round of an investiture debate only a simple majority \u2013 more votes for than against \u2013 is needed. The PP leader, Pablo Casado, accused S\u00e1nchez and Iglesias of forming \u201ca radical government, which is the last thing Spain needs at the moment\u201d. Vox\u2019s leader, Santiago Abascal, accused the PSOE of embracing \u201cVenezuelan-style communism\u201d, adding that Unidas Podemos were complicit in what he termed the ongoing \u201ccoup\u201d in Catalonia. Citizens, meanwhile, refused to support the proposed coalition, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s awful and runs counter to the interests of the majority of Spaniards.\u201d News of the deal was greeted more warmly on the left. \u201cAn agreement has been reached for a coalition government between Unidas Podemos and the Socialists,\u201d tweeted Alberto Garz\u00f3n, the leader of Podemos\u2019s partners, United Left. \u201cToday is a day for celebration.\u201d Errej\u00f3n tweeted: \u201cThe Spanish people have provided a second opportunity for a progressive government that can bring about a fairer country. That mandate must be fulfilled.\u201d",

In the weeks before the general election, we will be putting the parties\u2019 online campaigns under the microscope, looking at how they are setting out their stalls, which voters, constituencies and issues they are focusing on, and what is (and isn\u2019t) cutting through with the public. Conservatives: digital campaign targets 30 marginals Although it\u2019s early days, the Conservative party has tested adverts on specific demographics and geographies, giving an early indication of how its digital campaign could evolve. Its most successful advert \u2013 active since Monday costing just shy of \u00a310,000 and garnering more than 800,000 impressions \u2013 carries an image of an uncharacteristically kempt Boris Johnson targeting the over-55s and featuring generic plinky-plonky music. The prime minister hits all the key messages: \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, \u201cget parliament working\u201d alongside references to the NHS, schools and \u201csafer streets\u201d. Another, costing \u00a37,000 to \u00a38,000 and featuring an 80s-themed neon font and a tune that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place on Knight Rider, contains a similarly generic message that is instead aimed at men aged 18-34. In the first week of the election campaign, between \u00a330,000 and \u00a350,000 was also spent on adverts targeting marginal constituencies the Tories appear to consider winnable, based on 2017 margins and pro-Brexit sentiment. Thirty constituencies, chiefly in the Midlands and north of England, received Facebook adverts outlining exactly how many votes the Tories would need to bridge the gap. The ads, which are now inactive, contained identical text reading: \u201cYour vote in [constituency] will be the difference between a majority government that will get Brexit done and another hung parliament.\u201d In at least one instance, however, the copy-and-paste job underpinning the campaign appears to have misfired, with ads apparently confusing voters in Wrexham with those in Blackpool South. Labour: focus on NHS and transforming Britain Labour\u2019s most widely viewed advert in the opening days of the campaign, with more than 6m impressions, links to a Guardian article and warns of \u201cskyrocketing costs for life-saving medicines\u201d on the NHS after a trade deal between Donald Trump and Johnson. A further 1 million people have seen adverts from Labour warning that \u201ca vote for the Lib Dems gets you Brexit\u201d due to the risk of splitting the progressive vote. Smaller parties: Lib Dems lock in on Brexit and Brexit party checks out The Liberal Democrats hammered only one message in their first seven days: stopping Brexit and campaigning to remain in the EU. \u201cIf you want to stop Brexit, be a Liberal Democrat voter,\u201d reads the most widely viewed, seen by 3.5 million people. \u201cThe two old parties have failed Britain. The Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit and build a brighter future,\u201d promises another. The party has since launched a second wave of ads pitching the Lib Dems as the \u201cbiggest, strongest party of remain\u201d. Meanwhile, the Brexit party spent nothing in the first week \u2013 but later paid about \u00a317,000 for a series of adverts attacking Johnson\u2019s proposed deal with the EU.

Labour has spent more than \u00a388,393 in the same period, with the Liberal Democrats shelling out \u00a356,732. The Brexit party has spent \u00a317,000, according to Facebook\u2019s ad library. It\u2019s early days and these figures are likely to soar in the coming weeks. Video views: Labour takes an early lead Labour is winning the video campaign battle, receiving more than double the Conservatives\u2019 view count, according to a Guardian analysis of Facebook posts. Since 29 October, Labour videos have received more than 19m views compared with 7m for the Conservatives. Labour\u2019s greatest hits came from the Momentum campaign group, which has several videos with more than 1m views. Many of the most popular across the political spectrum are short clips of TV interviews.

      "body": "<p>The chants start early. Barely a moment after support act <a href=\"https://dmasdmas.com/\">DMA\u2019s</a> have left the stage, they ricochet off the girders crisscrossing the ceiling: \u201cLiam! Liam! Liam!\u201d By the time the final on-stage checks have been completed, the crowd is losing its collective mind as the Stone Roses\u2019 I Am the Resurrection thunders from the PA. And if anyone can capitalise on such an atmosphere, it\u2019s Liam Gallagher.</p> <p>Loping on from the wings as Oasis instrumental <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC__5_3dK7Q\">Fuckin\u2019 In the Bushes</a> roars, he does precisely that. Opener Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Star is the perfect encapsulation of the younger Gallagher\u2019s snotty charm \u2013 cocky, aspirational, and capable of delivering the euphoria of its premise in real time \u2013 and as he nails its chorus the room comes unglued. Coat on, and with hands inevitably clasped behind his back, he eyeballs the front row with aggro cool, accruing a set\u2019s worth of momentum in five minutes.</p> <p>But, without ever entirely losing sight of that benchmark, the pace is then frequently allowed to drop. Gallagher\u2019s vocals are strong, mainlining that bullish rasp even in the show\u2019s quietest stretches, and his band are well-drilled, but the core issue is not one that can be remedied on the fly. The tug of war at the heart of his solo career is between his workmanlike new material and his willingness to return to the well of Oasis. As a result, tonight\u2019s running order is dotted with era-defining rock songs written by his estranged brother Noel that loudly undermine solid selections from his own albums <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/05/liam-gallagher-as-you-were-review\">As You Were</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/19/liam-gallagher-why-me-why-not-review\">Why Me?

Liam Gallagher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russ Leggatt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rousing singalong that greets For What It\u2019s Worth elevates it from saccharine single to communal outpouring, but it is upstaged when Gallagher introduces Oasis guitarist Paul \u201cBonehead\u201d Arthurs for a resplendent charge through Morning Glory. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdJc7-ZEuT0\">Wall of Glass</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjN-32sLVT0\">Be Still</a>, two examples of Liam\u2019s patented \u201cchin-out music\u201d, aren\u2019t able to make the desired headway thanks to a muddy mix. The crowd\u2019s flashes of rebellion \u2013 pints thrown, fags smoked, flares lit \u2013 are scattered, adding to the feeling that this occasion is not as dangerous or edgy as it initially purported to be.</p> <p>It is the vocalist\u2019s privilege to rarely find themselves stranded following the dissolution of their band. But, equally, the ready availability of former glories must be weighed against the need to move on.

      "bodyText": "The chants start early. Barely a moment after support act DMA\u2019s have left the stage, they ricochet off the girders crisscrossing the ceiling: \u201cLiam! Liam! Liam!\u201d By the time the final on-stage checks have been completed, the crowd is losing its collective mind as the Stone Roses\u2019 I Am the Resurrection thunders from the PA. And if anyone can capitalise on such an atmosphere, it\u2019s Liam Gallagher. Loping on from the wings as Oasis instrumental Fuckin\u2019 In the Bushes roars, he does precisely that. Opener Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Star is the perfect encapsulation of the younger Gallagher\u2019s snotty charm \u2013 cocky, aspirational, and capable of delivering the euphoria of its premise in real time \u2013 and as he nails its chorus the room comes unglued. Coat on, and with hands inevitably clasped behind his back, he eyeballs the front row with aggro cool, accruing a set\u2019s worth of momentum in five minutes. But, without ever entirely losing sight of that benchmark, the pace is then frequently allowed to drop. Gallagher\u2019s vocals are strong, mainlining that bullish rasp even in the show\u2019s quietest stretches, and his band are well-drilled, but the core issue is not one that can be remedied on the fly. The tug of war at the heart of his solo career is between his workmanlike new material and his willingness to return to the well of Oasis. As a result, tonight\u2019s running order is dotted with era-defining rock songs written by his estranged brother Noel that loudly undermine solid selections from his own albums As You Were and Why Me? Why Not. The rousing singalong that greets For What It\u2019s Worth elevates it from saccharine single to communal outpouring, but it is upstaged when Gallagher introduces Oasis guitarist Paul \u201cBonehead\u201d Arthurs for a resplendent charge through Morning Glory. Similarly, Wall of Glass and Be Still, two examples of Liam\u2019s patented \u201cchin-out music\u201d, aren\u2019t able to make the desired headway thanks to a muddy mix. The crowd\u2019s flashes of rebellion \u2013 pints thrown, fags smoked, flares lit \u2013 are scattered, adding to the feeling that this occasion is not as dangerous or edgy as it initially purported to be. It is the vocalist\u2019s privilege to rarely find themselves stranded following the dissolution of their band. But, equally, the ready availability of former glories must be weighed against the need to move on. In that sense, this tour is unusual as both artist and crowd would probably prefer to be doing something different with their time: Gallagher fronting Oasis, and the fans watching Oasis. It\u2019s unlikely that any solo work, no matter its quality, could emerge unscathed from such a challenging environment. The maudlin Once seems to accept that, and there is insight to match the power in its thudding second verse: \u201cI think it\u2019s true what they say, that the dream is borrowed / You give it back tomorrow, minus the sorrow.\u201d Intriguingly, there are few concessions to Gallagher\u2019s beef with his brother. One is a bait-and-switch that finds Liam\u2019s son, Gene, introduced to play percussion with the line: \u201cTwo Gallaghers for the price of one, our kid on the bongos.\u201d Another arrives with the first song of the encore. The Oasis B-side Acquiesce is a vanishingly rare recorded example of the brothers sharing lead vocals, and in the space where Noel\u2019s soaring chorus is supposed to hit, the crowd picks up the slack at Liam\u2019s request. \u201cI\u2019ve got loads of brothers and sisters down there,\u201d he says in a telling, surprisingly emotional, aside. \u2022 On UK and Ireland tour until 29 November.",

At least \u2014 and this is the key \u2014 by the comically partisan media. This was the battle for years, an obsession. Not that they ever came to blows, or even close. Often it was a game. Ramos summed it up when he responded to one Piqu\u00e9 remark by saying: \u201cComing from Iniesta, it would annoy you, but it\u2019s Piqu\u00e9 and we all know it\u2019s part of the show with him.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/12/joe-gomez-scratch-right-eye-raheem-sterling-clash\">Joe Gomez left with scratch below right eye after clash with Raheem Sterling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After one game Piqu\u00e9 claimed: \u201cIn the directors\u2019 box at the Bernab\u00e9u sit the people who pull the strings in this country.\u201d To which Ramos replied: \u201cThey have more to answer there than us.\u201d When Ramos was sent off in a <em>cl\u00e1sico</em>, he walked past Piqu\u00e9 and said: \u201cGo on, keep talking.\u201d Afterwards the Catalan insisted it was a \u201cclear red, but they\u2019re so used to referees letting them get away with it\u201d. Very different characters, if perhaps not quite as different as they would like to think, they were actually a brilliant partnership and they got on better than many people liked to imagine.

Ljungberg got to his feet and grabbed the central defender by his throat before Daniel Andersson moved in to separate them. It ended with all of them falling to the ground. After the incident Mellberg said: \u201cOf course I regret it. You can\u2019t put a positive spin on what I did. It is nothing to be proud about. It was stupid.\u201d Years later one of the two coaches, Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck, said that there were two cliques in the dressing room. He said: \u201cIt is no secret that we had two groups.

      "bodyText": "Labour has responded to a backlash among voters of Indian heritage in the UK by shifting its stance on the Kashmir dispute and insisting it is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan in which Labour will not interfere. The clarification has been made in a letter sent by the Labour party chairman, Ian Lavery, in which he admits an emergency motion on Kashmir passed by Labour at its annual conference had caused offence to some British Indians and India itself. The motion said there was a humanitarian crisis in the disputed territory and that the people of Kashmir should be given the right of self-determination. It also called for international monitors to be allowed into the region. The motion has led some Indian groups in the UK to call on their community to vote Conservative. More than 100 Indian groups wrote to Jeremy Corbyn in protest, and more recently the criticism of Labour has spread to social media. There have also been complaints that only one candidate of Indian heritage has been selected in a safe Labour seat, and none in a target seat. In his letter Lavery promises \u201cthe Labour party will not take a pro-Indian or pro-Pakistan stance on Kashmir\u201d. The latest controversy follows India\u2019s decision in August to revoke the special status of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, bringing it under direct rule from Delhi. India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir, but control only parts of it. Since August political activity in Indian-administered Kashmir has been repressed, journalists have been refused free access, and NGOs have reported human rights abuses, claims denied by India. The former UK national security adviser Mark Lyall Grant has predicted rising extremism in the UK unless the issue is settled. Lyall Grant told a meeting at the security thinktank Chatham House, organised by strategic advisory firm CTD Advisors, that India\u2019s decision to revoke Kashmir\u2019s special status was likely to lead to greater extremism in the region. He said the temptation for the Pakistan intelligence services would be once again to support cross-border militancy, even if the Pakistan civilian authorities opposed such a move. He said greater extremism in Kashmir would have a direct impact on the UK, adding that 60-70% of British Pakistanis had origins in the Mirpur district in Kashmir. \u201cTherefore there is a risk of radicalisation in this country of British Kashmiris. We all know that diasporas tend to be more radical than communities left behind and I do not see why this should be any different.\u201d In his letter Lavery wrote: \u201cWe are adamant that the deeply felt and genuinely held differences on the issue of Kashmir must not be allowed to divide communities against each other here in the UK. \u201cKashmir is a bilateral matter for India and Pakistan to resolve together by means of a peaceful solution, which protects the human rights of the Kashmiri people and respects their right to have a say in their own future.\u201d Attention will now turn to how Labour words its election manifesto on this issue. In a sign of the controversy the issue creates inside Labour, the former foreign secretary Jack Straw called on Pakistan to withdraw its claim to Kashmir. Speaking at the same Chatham House event as Lyall Grant, Straw said he was \u201cextremely sympathetic\u201d to the plight of Muslim people in Jammu and Kashmir, and said the actions of India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, in revoking the state\u2019s special status were \u201coutrageous, preposterous, a complete breach of human rights and without any strategy attached\u201d. But he continued: \u201cThe thing I am clearest about is the way in which the whole of Pakistan\u2019s politics and economics has become distorted in this vain search or attempt to redraw the boundaries of Kashmir and to take Jammu Kashmir into the Pakistan Republic. \u201cThat is completely unobtainable, impossible, but that goal has led to Pakistan sponsoring terrorism across the line of control \u2013 without any question, we all know that \u2013 and it has also led to a bloated defence spending and disproportionate power to the defence forces of Pakistan.\u201d He said Pakistan needed to reflect on why its economy had not grown at the same rate as India\u2019s, adding that Pakistan\u2019s state sponsoring of terrorism reduced the country\u2019s diplomatic traction. He added: \u201cIf the ISI [Pakistan\u2019s intelligence services] think the answer to the situation is a bit more terrorism they will be gravely mistaken.\u201d Under the new arrangement, Jammu and Kashmir is designated one territory, and Ladakh, which borders China, is separate. Almost 98% of the state\u2019s population will be in the territory of Jammu and Kashmir, comprising two regions \u2013 the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley, which has about 8 million people, and the Hindu-majority Jammu, which has about 6 million.",

      "bodyText": "White House officials are reportedly drafting plans to make US foreign aid conditional on how countries treat their religious minorities, in an effort that is seen as a sop to Christian evangelicals in Donald Trump\u2019s base. The move, which threatens to impose further constraints on a US foreign aid policy already heavily restricted under the Trump administration, was first reported by Politico after briefings from White House aides. The aides suggested the US Commission on International Religious Freedom listings could be used for identifying which countries should have their aid withheld. According to the report, the proposal could also be extended to include US military assistance with a potential impact on countries from Iraq to Vietnam and India. The commission\u2019s \u201cTier 1\u201d designated countries \u2013 regarded as the most serious offenders \u2013 include US partners such as Saudi Arabia as well as adversaries like Iran. Critics point out that a number of key regional partners of the US, including Iraq and India, have been accused of restricting religious minority rights leading to the suspicion that any new restrictions are likely to be used selectively. Two White House officials told Politico that the idea was in its infancy while an executive order was being drafted, adding that imposing sanctions was being considered as a method of achieving the same aims. The move follows commitments by Trump on religious freedom. During his UN general assembly speech in September, Trump signalled that his administration would continue prioritising the issue. \u201cHard to believe, but 80% of the world\u2019s population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or even completely outlawed,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAmericans will never tire in our effort to defend and promote freedom of worship and religion.\u201d \u201cOh man, there\u2019s so many ways that could go wrong,\u201d Jeremy Konyndyk, a former senior aid official in the Obama administration, told Politico. He said that, depending on how strictly the administration interprets the idea of \u201creligious freedom,\u201d it is likely to hit national security concerns about protecting certain allies. Egypt and India, for example, arguably have religious freedom issues, he noted, but both receive US aid. Since Trump\u2019s election, his administration has long sought to cut some US foreign aid programmes either for political reasons \u2013 like the US defunding of its donations to UNRWA, the main agency for Palestinian refugees \u2013 or because it argues that agencies are wasteful or inefficient. Trump has also suggested at times that foreign aid should be contingent on countries backing US interests. The White House backed away from its latest effort to cut billions of dollars in foreign aid in the summer, after an outcry in Congress over what was seen as an attempt to sidestep lawmakers\u2019 authority over government spending. The latest moves follow reports by Propublica that the office of the vice-president, Mike Pence, had put pressure on the US Agency for International Development to direct its Middle East funding to preferred Christian groups in Iraq, citing internal emails and interviews with dozens of current and former US officials and aid professionals.",

A leaked draft of the report shows that chairman Douglas Oakervee has endorsed the scheme, despite revising down the expected economic benefits. But his deputy and co-author Lord Berkeley, a prominent critic of HS2, said he would refuse to sign off the conclusions and was considering writing his own report. Oakervee, a former HS2 chairman was commissioned by the government in August to review the line\u2019s costs, suggest savings and produce a \u201cgo or no-go\u201d conclusion. His review now suggests running fewer trains an hour but says all sections of the line should be built, according to a draft seen by the Times. The economic benefit that the line is expected to generate is now in a range of \u00a31.30 to \u00a31-50 for every \u00a31 spent, compared with previous claims of \u00a32.30. The review found that building only the first phase, from London to Birmingham, would provide even less value for money, and said the full network should be built. But Oakervee said the pure economic case did not include the potential of HS2 to deliver new homes and jobs. However, Berkeley whose inclusion as deputy review chair was cited by ministers as demonstrating balance, said the draft still overestimated the benefit-cost ratio. He said the report excluded evidence that put the final budget at \u00a3103bn rather than the current \u00a388bn. Until this summer, HS2 was expected to cost \u00a356bn. The original budget was \u00a334bn. Berkeley also claimed the sums were calculated on the costs and revenue of running 18 trains an hour in each direction, even though the report now suggested running 14 is more feasible. The draft was shown to Berkeley and members of the advisory panel at the Department for Transport last Thursday after the start of the purdah period before the general election, which prevents publication of the review. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, had initially promised to publish the review immediately, after a recent report admitted to delays of five to seven years. According to the department, Oakervee had yet to finalise the report, and no copy had been given to the DfT. It said any views ahead of its delivery to a new government were speculation.

I think it has been written by officials with his supervision,\u201d Berkeley said. The DfT said Oakervee had written the entire report. Berkeley said that the report \u201ccould easily change in the next few weeks\u201d, and added: \u201cThe shit will hit the fan at some stage and ministers will have to make a decision.\u201d Boris Johnson, told reporters on Friday he had yet to see the report and that HS2\u2019s future would be decided after the election. According to the report of the leaked draft, Oakervee has ruled out some proposals, including making the new Old Oak Common station the London terminus rather than Euston.

      "bodyText": "French police have used batons and pepper spray to clear Catalan independence activists who have been blocking the motorway between France and Spain in the hope of bringing the Spanish government to the negotiating table. Gendarmes moved in on hundreds of protesters gathered around La Jonquera crossing early on Tuesday as officers from the Catalan regional force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, ordered the demonstrators to remove their vehicles and leave the area. The police operation led to scuffles and some protesters could be seen crying from the effects of the spray. Officers then began towing away vehicles and debris with the aim of reopening the road to traffic. The protest, which had been due to last three days, was called by Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, the anonymous pro-independence group that co-ordinated the blockade of Barcelona-El Prat airport last month. The group, which says it is committed to non-violent action, began its protests in mid-October after the Spanish supreme court jailed nine Catalan separatist leaders for sedition over their role in the failed push for regional independence two years ago. In a statement released later on Tuesday morning, Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic urged its followers to block the border at Behobia in the Basque country from 6pm. The group said the actions, conducted under the slogan \u201cSpain, sit and talk\u201d, were intended to bring about a self-determination referendum in Catalonia. Although the north-eastern Spanish region remains evenly divided over the issue of secession, successive pro-independence Catalan government have tried to push ahead with the split, putting them on a collision course with the Spanish state. The supreme court\u2019s decision last month was greeted with anger by many Catalans, and violent unrest broke out in Barcelona and elsewhere. On Tuesday, a top adviser at the EU\u2019s highest court said the European parliament should decide whether one of those jailed for sedition \u2013 the former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras \u2013 should qualify for immunity because he had been elected an MEP. In a non-binding opinion, the European court of justice\u2019s advocate general said Junqeras\u2019s election in May meant that Spain could not suspend his mandate. The advocate general, Maciej Szpunar, said he considered that \u201cthe European parliament should pronounce on whether to suspend or maintain the immunity of one if its members\u201d. The case was referred to the European court of justice by Spain\u2019s supreme court, which had sentenced Junqueras to 13 years for sedition and misuse of public funds, barring him from taking up his seat. Szpunar\u2019s opinion came as the Catalan parliament once again defied Spain\u2019s constitutional court by approving a proposal \u201cto express its will to exercise the right to self-determination in a concrete manner\u201d. The motion was passed by MPs from the three regional pro-independence parties. MPs from unionist parties \u2013 the conservative People\u2019s party, the Catalan Socialist party and the centre-right Citizens party \u2013 protested by boycotting the vote. Spain\u2019s constitution, drawn up following the country\u2019s return to democracy after the Franco dictatorship, is based on \u201cthe indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards\u201d.",

Nichols was criticised by the inquiry\u2019s lead counsel, Brian Altman QC, for delaying church reforms and for defending the Vatican\u2019s refusal to cooperate with investigators.</p> <p>The lawyers, Richard Scorer of Slater and Gordon, and David Enright of Howe and Co, have acted for almost 50 victims and survivors at the IICSA hearings into the Catholic church.</p> <p>They say evidence taken by the inquiry shows the church is failing in both safeguarding and support for survivors. \u201cThese failings have their roots in cultural and structural features of the Catholic church. However, the attitude and performance of individual church leaders cannot be ignored.\u201d</p> <p>Nichols has been at the centre of the Catholic church\u2019s response to the abuse scandal since 2001, they say. The inquiry heard last week of evidence of \u201ca shocking mindset in the diocese of disdain for survivors. On all these failings, the buck has to stop with Cardinal Nichols.\u201d</p> <p>Their letter concludes: \u201cThe charge sheet against Cardinal Nichols is a long one.

      "bodyText": "Lawyers acting for child abuse survivors have called for the resignation of Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the highest-ranking Catholic cleric in England and Wales, saying the church has treated survivors with disdain. In a letter to the Catholic weekly, The Tablet, the lawyers say Nichols, who is the archbishop of Westminster and was formerly the archbishop of Birmingham, \u201ccannot credibly lead the Catholic church on these issues in the future\u201d. Nichols has given evidence in person twice in the past year to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), first on his period as archbishop of Birmingham and last week on safeguarding and support for survivors in the archdiocese of Westminster. In its report on the archdiocese of Birmingham, published in June, the inquiry concluded that Nichols had defended the reputation of the church rather than protecting children amid allegations of sexual abuse. The cardinal \u201cfocused too much on the reputation of the church during his tenure, rather than the welfare of children and the impacts of child sexual abuse on victims and survivors\u201d, the report says. \u201cChildren could have been saved from abuse if the church had not been so determined to protect its own reputation above all else.\u201d Thirteen people had been convicted of serious child abuse offences in the archdiocese of Birmingham, the biggest in the country, but \u201cthe true scale of offending and the number of children who were abused is likely to be far greater\u201d, the IICSA said. Last week, at a hearing of the inquiry, witnesses described safeguarding in Westminster as \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d. Nichols was criticised by the inquiry\u2019s lead counsel, Brian Altman QC, for delaying church reforms and for defending the Vatican\u2019s refusal to cooperate with investigators. The lawyers, Richard Scorer of Slater and Gordon, and David Enright of Howe and Co, have acted for almost 50 victims and survivors at the IICSA hearings into the Catholic church. They say evidence taken by the inquiry shows the church is failing in both safeguarding and support for survivors. \u201cThese failings have their roots in cultural and structural features of the Catholic church. However, the attitude and performance of individual church leaders cannot be ignored.\u201d Nichols has been at the centre of the Catholic church\u2019s response to the abuse scandal since 2001, they say. The inquiry heard last week of evidence of \u201ca shocking mindset in the diocese of disdain for survivors. On all these failings, the buck has to stop with Cardinal Nichols.\u201d Their letter concludes: \u201cThe charge sheet against Cardinal Nichols is a long one. Having failed in his leadership roles in both Birmingham and Westminster, he cannot credibly lead the Catholic church on these issues in the future. \u201cThe systemic problems in the Catholic church in relation to safeguarding are not capable of resolution by a single individual. But the church needs leaders who command respect on these issues; Cardinal Nichols does not. It is clear to us, and those we represent, that the time has come for him to step down.\u201d Responding to the lawyers\u2019 letter, Nuala O\u2019Loan, chair of the Catholic council to the inquiry, said it was \u201cwholly inappropriate to comment publicly\u201d before the IICSA had published its final report on the Catholic church, and that the letter sought to \u201cprevent and undermine\u201d the process of the inquiry\u2019s considerations. She added: \u201cThe cardinal and [the Catholic council] remain fully engaged and committed to working and supporting the work of the inquiry.\u201d",

The list included Hunter Biden, the son of the former vice-president; the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment inquiry; and a former contractor for a company that during the 2016 campaign paid for research focusing on Trump\u2019s activities in Russia. \u201cYour failure to fulfil Minority witness requests shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process,\u201d Nunes wrote to the committee chairman, Adam Schiff. Schiff replied that the identity of the whistleblower would be protected and that the committee would consider the other witness requests. With cable networks including Fox News planning to carry the impeachment hearings live, Trump himself seems likely to tune in. He may well tweet, but his participation is otherwise expected to be limited. Lawyers for the president are not permitted at the intelligence committee hearings but would be able to appear if the process moves to the next stage, the drafting of articles of impeachment before a full House vote. Public support for the impeachment inquiry has slackened a bit to 48% in the three weeks since it crested at 50%, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s tracker. But support for the impeachment of Richard Nixon climbed quickly, Pew Research has noted, after the process landed on television and many Americans encountered the case against the president for the first time. Corey Brettschneider, author of The Oath and the Office: A Guide to the Constitution for Future Presidents and a professor of constitutional law at Brown University, said public support for Trump\u2019s impeachment has materialized much more quickly than it did for Nixon. \u201cHere, I think public opinion is moving even more swiftly to suggest that the inquiry is warranted,\u201d Brettschneider said. \u201cThe more public opinion moves here, as was the case with Nixon, that\u2019s when I think we\u2019re going to start to see these Republican defections that everybody\u2019s waiting for.\u201d In conversation with Pfeiffer on Pod Save America, former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau said polling indicating most people have made up their minds about Trump means Democrats shouldn\u2019t get their hopes too high. \u201cThe ability to persuade, I think, is fairly limited,\u201d he said, \u201cand that should both give the Democrats hope that there\u2019s not going to be some backlash, but also temper our hopes that there\u2019s going to be some huge swing towards us because of impeachment. This very well could be a wash in the end.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Pentagon official\u2019s testimony revealed as TV hearings loom With televised impeachment hearings set to start on Wednesday, the Democrats leading the inquiry have released a transcript of a closed-door session in which a national security official claimed the Pentagon had expressed concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s freeze on military aid to Ukraine. Laura Cooper, the US deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine, said national security chiefs had been \u201cunified \u2026 in their view that this assistance was essential\u201d. Public phase. The televised hearings give Democrats an opportunity to make the case against Trump directly to the American people, writes Tom McCarthy. But they also fear Republicans will turn the process into a circus. Evo Morales flees Bolivia to claim asylum in Mexico The ousted Bolivian president Evo Morales has flown to Mexico, where he has been granted asylum following his shock resignation on Sunday, leaving his own country in a state of confusion and chaos. His exit was precipitated by unrest over the disputed results of a recent presidential election. At the weekend, the Bolivian army withdrew its support for Morales and urged him to step down. Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said he had granted Morales asylum because \u201chis life and safety are at risk\u201d in Bolivia. Power vacuum. Morales tweeted a farewell to Bolivia, which now faces the troubling prospect of a power vacuum, but vowed: \u201cSoon I will return with greater strength and energy.\u201d Iranian uranium: particles detected at undeclared site The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has detected unenriched uranium particles at a site in Iran that was not previously declared to the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog. The revelation appears in an IAEA report, which also confirms that Tehran has increased its uranium enrichment in defiance of the crumbling 2015 Iran nuclear accord, with its stockpile reaching the equivalent of 551kg, well beyond the 300kg limit agreed in the deal. 2015 deal. Trump pulled the US out of the Iran deal in 2018 and there is domestic pressure on Tehran to do the same. The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain are to meet in Paris soon to discuss the revelations in the report. Alaskans fight for the Tongass, US\u2019s largest national forest Environmentalists, fishermen and Alaskan tribal leaders will appear before Congress on Wednesday to argue on behalf of America\u2019s biggest national forest, which they say is at risk from the Trump administration\u2019s rampant anti-environmentalism. One of the world\u2019s last intact temperate rainforests, the Tongass helps fight the climate crisis by sequestering atmospheric CO2, but Alaska\u2019s GOP-led state government is seeking an exemption from the \u201croadless rule\u201d, which would put the pristine forest at risk of logging. Roadless rule. The Clinton-era regulation protects millions of acres by preventing mass clear-cutting of trees in undeveloped forested areas. It is considered one of the most widely supported environmental protections in the US. Cheat sheet The 95-year-old former US president Jimmy Carter has been admitted to hospital in Atlanta, ahead of a procedure scheduled for Tuesday morning to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding due to his recent falls. Boeing says its fleet of 737 Max jets may be flying again by January following safety checks on its software, which has been blamed for two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The chief of San Francisco\u2019s Bart commuter train system has apologised to a black rider who was detained for eating a sandwich on a rail platform, leading to accusations that the transit system\u2019s enforcement of its no-food rule was racist. A turban-style hat made from byssus, or \u201csea silk\u201d \u2013 an extremely rare material produced by the Mediterranean mollusk, Pinna nobilis \u2013 is to be auctioned in New York on Wednesday, in what is thought to be the first sale of such an item since 1767. Must-reads Is 2019 the worst year for movie trailers? The promo for the forthcoming Sonic the Hedgehog movie proved so unpopular that its creators literally went back to the drawing board to redesign the character. Movie trailers seem to be getting worse, says Ellen E Jones \u2013 and yet, if they get everyone talking, they might actually be good for business. Could analysing the data of history help save the future? In 2010, a letter published in the scientific journal Nature warned of global political instability ahead. Its writer, the biologist Peter Turchin, had used data analysis to predict patterns in the natural world \u2013 and then applied the same maths to human history. Laura Spinney asks whether his predictions could help prevent a looming crisis. Doom creator on the problem with modern shooter games John Romero, the founder of id software, helped invent the first-person shooter with Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. He tells Edwin Evans-Thirlwell what\u2019s wrong with their modern descendants: too many guns. \u201cThe more weapons you throw in there, the more you\u2019re playing an inventory game.\u201d Seven times Donald Trump Jr has out-snowflaked the left The president\u2019s eldest son fled a book promotion event at the weekend when he was heckled by his father\u2019s supporters. Despite writing a book about the over-sensitivity of the left, Don Jr seems remarkably susceptible to triggers himself, as Poppy Noor reports. Opinion On Tuesday the supreme court will begin its deliberations on the future of Daca, the Obama-era program that allowed young immigrants to join US society without fear of deportation. It was the most successful integration policy in recent history, say Roberto G Gonzales and Kristina Brant \u2013 until Trump canned it. If the supreme court rules that Trump illegally ended Daca, these young beneficiaries will continue to thrive and build on their successes. If the supreme court rules in favor of Trump, however, its beneficiaries will be stripped of their new-found rights, and much of their progress will be reversed. Sport The 49ers\u2019 2019 winning streak was broken at last on Monday night, with a 24-27 defeat to their NFC West rivals, the Seattle Seahawks, at the Levi\u2019s Stadium in San Francisco. After a run of Premier League defeats, might Pep Guardiola be considering an exit from Manchester City?

Great home supports, and no doubt plenty of young fans going home delighted after meeting their heroes in both Sydney and Adelaide.</p> <p>All in all - you\u2019d say the two-match series against Chile was a success? A raft of late injuries gave Ante Milicic limited opportunities to experiment in game one, but he was able to shuffle his pack a little more in Adelaide.</p> <p>Chile did strike the crossbar twice, but the clear cut chances were few and far between - one outstanding save from Williams aside, when Zamora really should have hit the net from a delightful set piece delivery from Lara.</p> <p>Australia with the lion\u2019s share of possession and a host of half-chances, but likewise nothing too much that was clear cut. Sam Kerr missed a golden chance to score from the spot in the shadow of half-time, but despite registering seven shots on target none were really clear cut opportunities, on a night that a valiant Chilean rearguard scrambled superbly.</p> <p>Ante Milicic may not have been delighted with some of what he saw, but it\u2019s hard to be too tough on the group at this stage. January is when it really matters, with five games looming in February to book a ticket to the Tokyo Olympics.</p> <p>Thanks for your company - always a pleasure taking in the Matildas on home soil.

      "bodyText": "Two games, two wins, an assured debut in game one at centre back, and no significant injuries. Great home supports, and no doubt plenty of young fans going home delighted after meeting their heroes in both Sydney and Adelaide. All in all - you\u2019d say the two-match series against Chile was a success? A raft of late injuries gave Ante Milicic limited opportunities to experiment in game one, but he was able to shuffle his pack a little more in Adelaide. Chile did strike the crossbar twice, but the clear cut chances were few and far between - one outstanding save from Williams aside, when Zamora really should have hit the net from a delightful set piece delivery from Lara. Australia with the lion\u2019s share of possession and a host of half-chances, but likewise nothing too much that was clear cut. Sam Kerr missed a golden chance to score from the spot in the shadow of half-time, but despite registering seven shots on target none were really clear cut opportunities, on a night that a valiant Chilean rearguard scrambled superbly. Ante Milicic may not have been delighted with some of what he saw, but it\u2019s hard to be too tough on the group at this stage. January is when it really matters, with five games looming in February to book a ticket to the Tokyo Olympics. Thanks for your company - always a pleasure taking in the Matildas on home soil. Stay safe, east coast Australia! And if you missed any of the action, here\u2019s the match report: \u201cIt\u2019s good to have the group back together post World Cup. These were two good games to build up, but there\u2019s still plenty to improve upon.\u201d She\u2019s never not anything but straight as a die, Ellie Carpenter. The fullback is happy to see more depth in the backline with Jenna McCormick and Emma Checker coming into the squad. It was an area of the pitch that came into question during the World Cup with the late injury to Laura Alleway. Good to see some fresh faces slotting in with aplomb. Alanna Kennedy was happy with the play overall, but would have liked to see a little more tempo in the second match, especially during the buildup phase. Great to see her in action, despite a busted hand from what she described as \u201can intense high-five\u201d during a training ground warm up (!) Move over Trent Sainsbury\u2019s sprinkler injury. A more measured Sam Kerr post-match. She was disappointed by the performance after game one, noting the failure to secure a clean sheet, but she said she was pleased with the dual results and happy to blow out some cobwebs, pointing out that \u201cthe girls would be raring come January\u201d for when they start their Olympic qualifying campaign. China, Thailand and Chinese Taipei are the group opponents then for Australia to book their ticket to Japan 2020. There\u2019s the whistle, and it is the Matildas who emerge victorious, in the end by the most slender of margins. A first clean sheet in eight matches against a competitive, combative, and hard-working Chilean side. Plenty to admire, plenty to admonish, you\u2019d imagine. But the home fans in Adelaide sound happy enough with their night\u2019s entertainment. 90 + 2 min: Kerr with the faintest of flicks on a cross from Catley - how close was she there to a second? In the end it didn\u2019t trouble Campos, but it was another \u201cclose, but no cigar\u201d moment. Carpenter bombs on down the right - she\u2019s got an engine for days, the teenager - and she looks for Kerr centrally, but Chile cut it out. 90 + 1 min: We have five minutes added on. Can the Matildas fashion a late buffer goal? Raso looks to fly down the left, but the Chilean centre back Guerrero matches her well. They\u2019ve been brilliant at the back, the club duo of Guerrero and Saez. Rayo Vallecano in Spain would be delighted to have these two, you\u2019d imagine. 89 min: A break in play, but hopefully not a break for Hayley Raso, who washes some blood off her face, after a whack to the nose. She\u2019s made of tough stuff though, the former Roar flyer. 86 min: Luik tries to drive from outside the box, but she doesn\u2019t get the purchase on it to worry Campos. That\u2019s their 15th shot at goal, with almost half of those on target, but it remains the slimmest of margins that separates this game on the scoreboard. 83 min: Logarzo arrives late in the box and almost gets on the end of a fine move from van Egmond! Again though this has been resolute stuff from Chile defensively, who scramble clear. Van Egmond then tries a first time volley from the edge of the box, but it\u2019s deflected wide for a corner. 81 min: Campos slumps to the ground, a possible knock from one of the Matildas players charging in to contest a cross. She\u2019s done very well today in Endler\u2019s absence, the Spanish-based \u2018keeper - numerous saves and she\u2019s come well for crosses on corners. Not to mention that penalty save from Kerr. 79 min: Chile with another long range attempt to catch Williams out. Is this a conscious tactic, or is it only that they\u2019re finding the opportunities from outside the box? (Quite possibly, both). At the other end, Kerr stretches but can\u2019t quite connect. As is so often the case, this one is opening up a little. There could be another late goal, like we saw in Sydney. 76 min: Kennedy carries the ill effect of that challenge and she might have to make way shortly for Emma Checker. And from nothing, almost an incredible equaliser! It\u2019s a long-range drive from midfield that clips the head of Kerr, and loops bizarrely over Lydia Williams in the Matildas\u2019 goal, but hits the crossbar! She possibly had it covered, the veteran custodian, but wow. Imagine if that would have been the equaliser. 74 min: Owie. A huge kick to the heel of Lara from Kennedy. No intent to hurt, but the Chilean got a foot in blindside as the defender looked to hoof that clear. Luik comes on for Yallop, again another like-for-like change at the base of midfield. 71 min: Raso with a driven ball, but it\u2019s well defended once again. Logarzo has to watch herself - she\u2019s just come together with two players in the lead up, she is carrying that early yellow card, you\u2019ll remember. Spiky stuff. 68 min: Melee! It\u2019s a set piece for Australia that Kennedy almost lashes home off the ground, before the ball pinballs around and is eventually cleared. They\u2019re riding their luck at times, Chile - how did they escape then? 66 min: A quick throw from Kerr releases Foord, but she backtracks with no support centrally. A yellow card for Lopez - what a battle she\u2019s been having with Logarzo all game. Finally, they\u2019re a booking each. Both combative characters you\u2019d fancy. 63 min: Foord looks to fly down the left, but she\u2019s called for offside belatedly. No Lisa de Vanna in the reduced squad, you\u2019ll recall, so they\u2019re a little light in the flying left wing position. Amy Harrison makes way, and Emily van Egmond comes on. She looks to adopt a position ahead of Yallop, which is a subtle variation from previous Milicic arrangements. 60 min: Kennedy intervenes well and her clearance falls nicely to Kerr. She faces backwards and the Matildas build possession patiently. Harrison flashes a cross across the front of goal, but it evades her teammates. Gielnik comes off for Raso - another like-for-like change at right forward. 57 min: Yallop with a heavy body check, and it affords Chile a rare attacking opportunity from the set piece. Huge save! Zamora is found brilliantly from Lara, unmarked in the box, but she thumps it straight at Williams - and the Matildas\u2019 custodian makes herself big and saves well! And for all the Matildas\u2019 possession, we could have been 1-1. 55 min: Toro in heavily on Gielnik, but it\u2019s a ball-and-all sliding tackle. The recent Frauen Bundesliga recruit gets gingerly to her feet. She recovers well enough to execute a fine one-two with Kerr, that almost finds her star striker free in the box, but again Chile scramble. 53 min: Kerr penalised for a physical challenge on one of the Chilean midfielders. For a game that\u2019s nominally designated as a friendly you have to say there\u2019s a little bit of niggle out there. It\u2019s been a notably more aggressive approach from Chile from game one, and some of the Matildas players are responding too positively to the increased physicality. 51 min: Possible merit to that handball shout from Carpenter. No VAR in this match - which, look. You\u2019d probably pass up a 50/50 pen shout rather than put up with the saga of it all - even as a Matildas fans, wouldn\u2019t you? 49 min: A bright start to the second stanza, as first Foord, then Harrison go down in the box under some pressure, and with a goalmouth scramble looming they almost send an own-goal into their net, Chile! And now Foord fires a shot from range, and Carpenter claims for a handball as her shot is blocked! This is a frenetic start to the second half - Chile all hands to the pump early on! 47 min: Crossbar! Kerr sent through one-on-one from a terrific curling ball from Catley. She jinks inside defender and fires past Campos - but it clatters back off the crossbar! Do you reckon she\u2019s keen to make amends for that penalty miss? Great stuff from Kerr, just a whisker away. Second half! 45 min: One change at the break as Jenna McCormick comes on into the centre defence Polkinghorne. A like-for-like change, presumably to see how the new Matilda combines with both presumptive first-starters, Kennedy and Polkinghorne. So - your impressions of that first 45? Who has impressed, where has it been won and lost so far? Fire us your musing, thoughts and quips on this one - via email or Twitter, we remain as always your humble servant here at Guardian liveblogs. Who needs Christine Endler! Chile\u2019s backup goalie Natalia Campos, nearly the villain, but ending as the star, as she denies one of the world\u2019s most lethal strikers from the spot. A dramatic ending to the first forty five in Adelaide. A rueful smile from Kerr, who did miss a crucial penalty at the World Cup. And this one remains right in the balance for the second half. 45 + 2 min: Penalty saved! That\u2019s brilliant from Campos! She picks Kerr\u2019s shot, and throws herself right and flips it round the post and wide. A small shake of the head from Kerr - but that\u2019s all about the \u2018keeper. Well done, Campos - that\u2019s a strong right hand to clear. 45 min: Penalty! And it is that combination of Foord and Kerr that strikes just before the break! It\u2019s a terrific turn and slide pass from Foord to send Kerr through one-on-one. Campos does brilliantly with the initial save, racing out to block, but Kerr keeps it within her feet, and the skipper is fouled at the second attempt. What a blow for the visitors - can Australia make it two? 43 min: Foord with a sublime dummy to release Logarzo down the left, but she\u2019s well marshalled wide. She\u2019s an underrated playmaker, Foord - given her historical versatility (playing fullback at a World Cup and taking care of Marta) and her prodigious energy and work-rate that has led to her playing in wide positions for a lot of her career. 40 min: The Matildas with a nudge over 60% possession, as Carpenter almost finds Foord from a deflected cross, but again the last line of defence scrambles clear. They have to be careful, Chile. You can rely on spectacular last-ditch clearances here and there, but one will go awry, and like the opener in game one, when there\u2019s a goal poacher like Sam Kerr lurking, you just can\u2019t present too many opportunities like that. 38 min: Solid claim from the \u2018keeper, and the danger in averted. A slight lull in play after a frenetic few minutes. Australia again with patient possession - it\u2019s very much another cat-and-mouse contest like we saw in Sydney a few days ago. 36 min: A moment\u2019s concern as Chile get bodies in the box centrally, but Carpenter defends well and sparks a tremendous counter-attack. A few \u201clusty\u201d tackles from Chile trying to prevent the fast transition, but Kerr skips clear of one, and it ends with a deflected drive from deep by Yallop! Corner, Matildas. 33 min: Calm at the back from Polkinghorne who looks to initiate something from deep. Ante Milicic is at the touchline barking instructions - hard to know if he\u2019s more impressed with this performance thus far. It has appeared a little static at times again. 31 min: A lovely drive from deep from Harrison - she sees a gap and pins the ears before firing off a shot that just flies to the righthand side of Campos\u2019 goal. 30 min: Great work-rate from Carpenter, who has to recover as Chile looks to get in behind the advanced fullback, but she\u2019s got both the pace and the fitness to do so, and snuff out a possible attack. 28 min: What can Chile come up with now? The game plan would have no doubt been to stay compact and then look to become more aggressive as the game went on - but with that early-ish goal, will they look to come out of their shells a little? 25 min: Almost two in as many minutes, as Ellie Carpenter leans back over a shot - but she blazes high! The home crowd loving this - it\u2019s been a dominant few minutes from the Matildas. And there\u2019s the opener! It\u2019s a fine throughball from Sam Kerr who drops deep to receive the ball - she lays it out to Gielnik and she\u2019s left with only a fine acute angle to aim at. So unfortunate for the stand-in \u2018keeper Campos - the shot takes a tiny deflection and flicks past her hands at the near post. 22 min: Kennedy looks to release Catley with a raking long ball forward, and the Chilean backline again scrambles to prevent the ball into Kerr. Foord with a good turn in the lead up but she can\u2019t find her partner in crime. 18 min: A bit of tugging in back play as Chloe Logarzo is shown a yellow card for a coming together in back play with Lopez. A curious one, it did appear the Chilean midfielder initiated that foul, but it was the Matilda who perhaps threw an arm to get free. A bit both ways, in truth. 16 min: Skipper for the night, Araya, fires an effort goalwards from long range, but she drags her shot well passed William\u2019s righthand post. A good opportunity, and she throws her head back in disappointment. 15 min: Gielnik lashes an effort goalwards off a Catley cross, but she\u2019s skied the difficult effort. Again, a warning sign - when she\u2019s in a mood she\u2019s a very tricky customer, the Bayern Munich forward. What a few seasons she\u2019s had. 12 min: Chile pressing a bit higher, putting pressure on the Matildas\u2019 back four and \u2018keeper, which sees Williams encouraged into a trickier ball that Carpenter miscontrols. It\u2019s a good strategy, just a question of how long they can keep it up against a very fit Matildas outfit. 9 min: Araya with a cheeky chipped effort from 30m out. Worth a look with Williams off her line, but she doesn\u2019t quite find the range. That\u2019s the threat that Chile pose - they\u2019re technically very proficient, and as we say at the World Cup, accomplished defenders, who will look to hit quickly on the counter-attack. 8 min: Strong work from Yallop who rides a tackle to release Carpenter. The right back feeds Gielnik who fires in a tricky cross that is deflected closer past her own sticks than the Chilean defender Saez would have liked! Corner Australia, but it\u2019s well defended. 6 min: Catley looks for Kerr with a right-footed cross from the left, but the last line of defence just prevents it from finding the goalscoring machine. A warning sign for Chile, if they needed one, as to her danger. 4 min: It\u2019s Tameka Yallop screening the back four at the base of midfield - a new role for the hugely gifted and versatile midfielder who normally plays a little further forward. No Elise Kellond-Knight in this squad, and Aivi Luik rested from the game a few days ago. 3 min: Carpenter again the attacking threat down the right, and she earns a corner. No! Our NZ whistleblower says no, to the surprise of the Matildas. It did appear Chile got a last touch. A first touch for Lydia Williams in goal, as Chile look to go long, but the veteran \u2018keeper sweeps, and sweeps well. 1 min: It\u2019s another flying start from the Matildas, and no surprise they look for the flying Ellie Carpenter early on, but the Chilean defence anticipates the danger and cuts out her cross. Our players are out the tunnel, on the pitch and we\u2019re ready for anthems. A decent Chilean contingent in the stadium tonight - let\u2019s hope they find something to cheer about tonight amid a difficult political climate back home. A lovely rendition of Advance Australia Fair, and the Matildas peel off much needed jackets amid a brisk atmosphere in Adelaide. Interesting also will be to see how Caitlin Foord and Sam Kerr combine again up front tonight. The almost telepathic duo had their radar a little awry in Sydney. It didn\u2019t stop the skipper still banging a brace, but it was one of the areas Ante Milicic would have liked no doubt to have worked on between games. Australia, for all their obvious attacking talent were looking a little predictable at times, can Foord be the X-factor tonight? A decent crowd trickling in at Coopers Stadium in Adelaide - a first time in over a dozen years the people of South Australia have had a chance to watch the Matildas in person. What a bumper year football in SA is already having, what with a heroic FFA Cup run for Adelaide United. A big game for Amy Harrison - the talented youngster who burst through at Sydney FC only to undergo a horrific run of injuries, including the odd ACL. She\u2019s still just 23 (which is almost veteran status compared to some of her teammates) but you really sense a huge maturation in her game in recent years, especially since her NWSL debut season. Straight to team news: Australia: Four changes to the lineup a few days ago - Alanna Kennedy returns in the centre of defence, Amy Harrison makes a rare start in midfield, Tameka Yallop comes in for Emily van Egmond and Emily Gielnik gets the nod ahead of Hayley Raso. Williams (GK), Carpenter, Kennedy, Polkinghorne, Catley; Harrison, Yallop, Logarzo; Gielnik, Kerr (c), Foord Katrina Gorry and Karly Roestbakken also return to a bench that\u2019s a little deeper than it was in Sydney. Chile: The big news is no Christiane Endler, Chile\u2019s talis(wo)manic skipper in goals; she\u2019s had to dash back to France for a crucial match for her domestic club Paris Saint Germain. Eight-cap understudy Natalia Campos comes in for her - a big night for her. Hi all! A cordial greeting to you and yours, from wherever you\u2019re following our coverage tonight. A big shoutout to our east coast followers - our thoughts are with you during this unprecedented bushfire threat, stay safe and be considerate to each other in your communities. Tonight is however about the Matildas, and we\u2019re in Adelaide to see if sam Kerr and pals can repeat the treat against Chile. It\u2019s a last competitive match of 2019 for one of Australia\u2019s most beloved teams. After a huge year, on and off the field, the Alen Stajcic saga and a mixed performance under huge expectations at the 2019 World Cup threatened to engulf the Matildas, but as they have so often, the team themselves have quietly pulled through - emerging with a landmark pay agreement to continue to fly the flag for women\u2019s aspiration around the world. It\u2019s a second clash in three days against Chile - a team that showed in Sydney that they\u2019re no slouches, despite South America\u2019s notorious underfunding of the women\u2019s game, and a misrepresentative world ranking. Will Ante Milicic ring the changes? Or will he try and embed new processes ahead of next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics? We\u2019ll find out shortly.",

This was indicative: in that first period he often took wickets but was frequently expensive, so it was not until 1976 that he cemented his place in the national side. Two years later, he took 10 wickets in the match as New Zealand beat England for the first time and then, in 1980, he shortened his run-up to protect his fitness.</p> <p>This development was not universally well-received: opening bowlers were meant to be scary, their screeching pace and snorting incandescence prompting batsmen to contemplate the flavour of their own teeth. But Hadlee was different. Striding where once he had steamed, he became very much less scary to become very much more scary, an arrow in human form whose every fibre focused on taking wickets. There were no threats, sledging or histrionics; rather, he calmly calculated what each batsman least wanted to face then forced them to face it repeatedly, the only thing more economical than his figures his disbursement of bonhomie. He revolutionised the game simply by being brilliant at playing it.</p> <p>Hadlee\u2019s stock ball was a leg-cutter \u2013 delivered from close to the stumps to land close to the stumps, on a length and on the seam \u2013 that usually did a bit and occasionally didn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "These days, everything has to be arranged and everything has to be ranked, particularly in sport. This is not all bad \u2013 in different times, Justin Langer might never have taught us the importance of \u201celite professionalism, elite learning, elite mateship and elite humility\u201d \u2013 but for that, there is a quid pro quo. Naturally, much of the blame for this moral slippage lies with the Indian Premier League, as a result of whose draft enemies become friends and post-match patter turns into performative clich\u00e9. Whatever happened to good, honest, old-fashioned aloofness? Richard Hadlee \u2013 star of New Zealand-England series past \u2013 epitomised such virtue, solely consumed by hitting the red thing with the wooden thing and chucking the red thing at the wooden things. When an expert such as Gordon Greenidge proclaims your belligerence, you know you\u2019re on to something. A fast-bowling all-rounder, Hadlee took a hat-trick on his debut first-class appearance in 1971, then made his bow for New Zealand in 1973; his first ball, a full toss, was duly hit for four. This was indicative: in that first period he often took wickets but was frequently expensive, so it was not until 1976 that he cemented his place in the national side. Two years later, he took 10 wickets in the match as New Zealand beat England for the first time and then, in 1980, he shortened his run-up to protect his fitness. This development was not universally well-received: opening bowlers were meant to be scary, their screeching pace and snorting incandescence prompting batsmen to contemplate the flavour of their own teeth. But Hadlee was different. Striding where once he had steamed, he became very much less scary to become very much more scary, an arrow in human form whose every fibre focused on taking wickets. There were no threats, sledging or histrionics; rather, he calmly calculated what each batsman least wanted to face then forced them to face it repeatedly, the only thing more economical than his figures his disbursement of bonhomie. He revolutionised the game simply by being brilliant at playing it. Hadlee\u2019s stock ball was a leg-cutter \u2013 delivered from close to the stumps to land close to the stumps, on a length and on the seam \u2013 that usually did a bit and occasionally didn\u2019t. Then, around that, he deployed various variations whose nuances only he could fathom, pinning batsmen on the crease before ejecting them from it. For that reason, his most obvious contemporary comparator is James Anderson \u2013 not because of how he approached the wicket but because of how he approached his craft, appraising opponents and adjusting to conditions, then picking grip, action and angle accordingly. This method worked particularly well on Hadlee\u2019s home track in Christchurch \u2013 against England in 1984, Hadlee first made 99 off 81 balls, then took three wickets and five wickets as the visitors were dismissed for 82 and 93. So good was Hadlee that even Steve Waugh \u2013 not usually one for lavishing praise or admitting fallibility \u2013 was forced into rhapsody after being bowled by a \u201cperfect delivery\u201d at Wellington in 1990. \u201cIt pitched middle then deviated past my technically correct forward defence,\u201d Waugh wrote, \u201cand took the top of off-stump, leaving me without an intact set of bails and a pose worthy of a bronze statue. It was one of very few times I felt utterly helpless to defend myself; quite simply, he was too good for me.\u201d Perhaps most phenomenal of Hadlee\u2019s phenomenal list of phenomenal attributes was his phenomenal level of consistency in a team that relied upon him to phenomenal extent. Unlike most other greats, he could not usually rely on scoreboard pressure or pressure from the other end, nor could he relax in the knowledge that if he didn\u2019t deliver, someone else probably would.

      "bodyText": "A new trailer for the Sonic the Hedgehog movie has been released, after the film\u2019s director assured fans of the game that the character would be redesigned after a tide of criticism greeted the first release. The initial trailer was released in April, featuring star Jim Carrey as Dr Eggman alongside the CGI-animated hedgehog, but was met with considerable derision. The Guardian\u2019s Keith Stuart described it as \u201ca 200mph slap in the face\u201d and said the central character \u201cresembles a cheap knock-off Sonic toy your child might win at a fairground stand and then be terrified of\u201d. The character\u2019s human-style teeth drew particular flak on social media. Jeff Fowler, the film\u2019s director, later tweeted: \u201cThe message is loud and clear... you aren\u2019t happy with the design &amp; you want changes. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Sonic the Hedgehog has been in development as a movie since Hollywood studio Sony acquired the adaptation rights in 2013. However, it failed to get a project off the ground, and the rights passed to Paramount in 2017. The film is due for release in February 2020.",

My school counselor shared with the risk assessment team that I\u2019d harmed myself and had suicidal thoughts earlier in the year, something which my school\u2019s decision-makers apparently felt put me at greater risk for hurting others, because I\u2019d shown I was capable of violence.</p> <p>I struggled deciding how honest to be in the pages of psychological evaluation forms I had to fill out, assuming anything perceived as abnormal would be used as grounds to keep me away from my friends. It felt as if no one was interested in getting me help, nor did anyone appear concerned that a teenager struggling with depression might be more likely to take her own life after nearly a week of being cut off from social interaction and left at the mercy of a swirling rumor mill at school.</p> <p>When I was finally cleared to return to school four days later, I was relieved and grateful for the friends, teachers and my parents who had stepped in on my behalf. A required meeting with the principal made me late to my first class, and the resulting scene was out of a movie. Students were getting ready for an all-day class field trip, and when I walked in the door, someone yelled, \u201cRachel\u2019s back!\u201d Some of my classmates applauded. I spent the day playing games outside with friends and satisfying their morbid curiosity about what Seattle public schools\u2019 psychological evaluations looked like.</p> <p>I was lucky that my suspension played out without massive social consequences. It showed me I had many friends and adults who would stand by me. But it also reinforced that much of that support was conditional on me being \u201cnormal\u201d, a realization which did little to help me manage depression as a young teen. I had solidified a belief that can be deadly for mentally ill young people: counselors and adult authority figures aren\u2019t there to help, and speaking honestly about your struggles or problems at school will only get you in trouble.</p> <p>I shudder now to think how the process might have played out had I not been a well-off white student with two supportive parents who were able to attend meeting after meeting to advocate for me. The leniency regularly granted to white students like me over our black peers was visible daily in the halls of the diverse urban schools I attended, and is clearly visible in data about suspension and expulsion in nearly every school district in America.</p> <p>Zero tolerance is less en vogue now, but with school shootings a regular topic of discussion, there\u2019s renewed interest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/school-student-surveillance-bark-gaggle\">monitoring what kids are saying</a> in private and their mental illnesses as a preventive measure. Lost in that discussion is how crucial trust and connection are for teens still figuring out their place in an increasingly polarized and complicated world. If teens don\u2019t feel they can speak honestly about their struggles without triggering an investigation, they won\u2019t ask adults for help when they truly need it \u2013 and that\u2019s far more deadly.</p>",

As the risk assessment process unfolded, some of the most painful moments of my life came under a microscope. My school counselor shared with the risk assessment team that I\u2019d harmed myself and had suicidal thoughts earlier in the year, something which my school\u2019s decision-makers apparently felt put me at greater risk for hurting others, because I\u2019d shown I was capable of violence. I struggled deciding how honest to be in the pages of psychological evaluation forms I had to fill out, assuming anything perceived as abnormal would be used as grounds to keep me away from my friends. It felt as if no one was interested in getting me help, nor did anyone appear concerned that a teenager struggling with depression might be more likely to take her own life after nearly a week of being cut off from social interaction and left at the mercy of a swirling rumor mill at school. When I was finally cleared to return to school four days later, I was relieved and grateful for the friends, teachers and my parents who had stepped in on my behalf. A required meeting with the principal made me late to my first class, and the resulting scene was out of a movie. Students were getting ready for an all-day class field trip, and when I walked in the door, someone yelled, \u201cRachel\u2019s back!\u201d Some of my classmates applauded. I spent the day playing games outside with friends and satisfying their morbid curiosity about what Seattle public schools\u2019 psychological evaluations looked like. I was lucky that my suspension played out without massive social consequences. It showed me I had many friends and adults who would stand by me. But it also reinforced that much of that support was conditional on me being \u201cnormal\u201d, a realization which did little to help me manage depression as a young teen. I had solidified a belief that can be deadly for mentally ill young people: counselors and adult authority figures aren\u2019t there to help, and speaking honestly about your struggles or problems at school will only get you in trouble. I shudder now to think how the process might have played out had I not been a well-off white student with two supportive parents who were able to attend meeting after meeting to advocate for me. The leniency regularly granted to white students like me over our black peers was visible daily in the halls of the diverse urban schools I attended, and is clearly visible in data about suspension and expulsion in nearly every school district in America. Zero tolerance is less en vogue now, but with school shootings a regular topic of discussion, there\u2019s renewed interest in monitoring what kids are saying in private and their mental illnesses as a preventive measure. Lost in that discussion is how crucial trust and connection are for teens still figuring out their place in an increasingly polarized and complicated world. If teens don\u2019t feel they can speak honestly about their struggles without triggering an investigation, they won\u2019t ask adults for help when they truly need it \u2013 and that\u2019s far more deadly.",

Currently there are over 70 fires and half of those are out of control. There are nine fires at emergency alert level. They are:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Liberation Trail fire in Clarence Valley</li> \n   <li>Myall Creek Rd, Bora Ridge</li> \n   <li>Stockyard East, near Port Macquarie</li> \n   <li>Washpool State Forest</li> \n   <li>Gospers Mountain, in the Lithgow LGA</li> \n   <li>Hillville Rd, Hillville on the mid-north coast</li> \n   <li>Reserve Rd, Mares Run on the mid-north coast</li> \n   <li>Rumba Dump, mid-coast</li> \n   <li>Thunderbolts Way, Bretti, mid-coast. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Eight fires are at watch and act level.</p> \n  <p>A southerly change has led to a drop in the temperature in Sydney, but the Rural Fire Service fears that as the southerly travels north to more fire-affected areas, it could cause more headaches for firefighters trying to get the fires there under control. The cooler temperature hasn\u2019t made it any less dry.</p> \n  <p>At least a dozen homes have been damaged or destroyed, and some firefighters have been injured, but none of the injuries have been life-threatening. </p> \n  <p>In Queensland, there are over 60 active fires, and conditions are expected to worsen on Wednesday with strong winds and temperatures in the mid-30s.

He was hopeful the village will be able to be protected,\u201d she said.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt will depend what the southerly wind does that\u2019s forecast for 2 o\u2019clock in the morning.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI know there\u2019s been people very concerned about what is happening, but for those of us who are here we are calm and trying to make sure everything is alright.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Jarra Hicks</strong> is also from Elands and is one of the residents who chose to leave after the village was door-knocked last night. She is 16 weeks pregnant and left behind her husband, father-in-law and a house they had just finished renovating to go to Newcastle where she has friends. <br></p> \n  <p>Communication in and out of Elands has been challenging for days because power and the mobile phone tower has been down since the Bobin fires hit on Friday. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cMost people were able to leave the village. The fire has now hit and unfortunately it\u2019s hitting on three sides at once,\u201d Hicks said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe just have one very small volunteer fire brigade fighting the fires.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She said other community members had gone to Wingham, but they were now heading for Taree because Wingham had been evacuated now as well.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a game of hopscotch to wherever the fires are not,\u201d she says. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had very limited ability to communicate and because the resources of the RFS have been so stretched, we\u2019ve had very little information at all.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s highly uncertain. I expect if our home survives we will be extremely lucky because we\u2019re a small community. There\u2019s around 200-300 people. There\u2019s only one volunteer fire brigade of six people.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-12T08:36:56.849Z\">at 8.36am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dca6b388f08be4a102e77c2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-12T08:20:46.293Z\">8.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There\u2019s a lot of smoke over Sydney right now. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f95e0e2ca23c8f6c56036813fb815be4d1838c88\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f95e0e2ca23c8f6c56036813fb815be4d1838c88/0_0_1117_1600/698.jpg\" alt=\"Smoke shrouds the Sydney Opera House as bushfires rage across parts of New South Wales\" width=\"698\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smoke shrouds the Sydney Opera House as bushfires rage across parts of New South Wales.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen de Jode/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-12T08:24:34.614Z\">at 8.24am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dca6a6c8f08be4a102e77bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helen-davidson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-12T08:17:35.960Z\">8.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Cynthia Lus</strong><strong>h</strong> was home alone in her house across the street from the South Turrumurra bushfire.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe got a phone call about half an hour [after it started], on the home phones.

Here\u2019s the latest as of 10pm AEDT: There have been over 300 new fires across New South Wales on Tuesday. Currently there are over 70 fires and half of those are out of control. There are nine fires at emergency alert level. They are: Liberation Trail fire in Clarence Valley Myall Creek Rd, Bora Ridge Stockyard East, near Port Macquarie Washpool State Forest Gospers Mountain, in the Lithgow LGA Hillville Rd, Hillville on the mid-north coast Reserve Rd, Mares Run on the mid-north coast Rumba Dump, mid-coast Thunderbolts Way, Bretti, mid-coast. Eight fires are at watch and act level. A southerly change has led to a drop in the temperature in Sydney, but the Rural Fire Service fears that as the southerly travels north to more fire-affected areas, it could cause more headaches for firefighters trying to get the fires there under control. The cooler temperature hasn\u2019t made it any less dry. At least a dozen homes have been damaged or destroyed, and some firefighters have been injured, but none of the injuries have been life-threatening. In Queensland, there are over 60 active fires, and conditions are expected to worsen on Wednesday with strong winds and temperatures in the mid-30s. The focus for fire fighters in the state has been on preparing for tomorrow. Thank you for following the updates during the day, and please stay safe if you are in the affected areas. You can find up-to-date information on the NSW fires here, and the Queensland fires here. If you wish to donate to support those affected, you can find information on that here. The auditorium of the Tuncurry Bowling Club is filling up with air mattresses. \u201cKmart sent them down, we just got a whole other load of them,\u201d Lauren Whitty told me earlier. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got plenty, but they\u2019ve told us to expect more people later. I don\u2019t know, to be honest I don\u2019t know what most of these people have been through. We\u2019re just trying to make them comfortable. At the moment, there\u2019s about 80 people from around the southern end of the mid-north coast who have found their way here tonight. John and Lucy Van Hoof live in a caravan park on the outskirts of Tuncurry. They were told to leave at about 4pm this afternoon. \u201cThere was smoke everywhere, we could see it all coming up over the hill,\u201d Lucy told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here 23 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, when they told us to leave I thought \u2018I\u2019d rather leave now than wait\u2019.\u201d Whitty, together with a group of friends, helped organise the evacuation centre at the club through a Facebook page. \u201cWe just put out a call for help and we\u2019ve had people from Sydney, Newcastle and some of the locals wanting to donate things. For a while we were like, \u2018oh, we don\u2019t know where to send everything\u2019,\u201d she said. As we sit here more people are filing in, most of them elderly. An RFS organiser told us they\u2019re expecting more to come after 10pm, once the wind picks up. I take that back, the latest update has moved it back up to nine emergency alert level fires: Liberation Trail fire in Clarence Valley Myall Creek Rd, Bora Ridge Stockyard East, near Port Macquarie Washpool State Forest Gospers Mountain Hillville Mares Run Rumba Dump Thunderbolts Way, Bretti. In the latest update from the RFS, they\u2019ve downgraded six of the fires, meaning there are now four emergency alert level fires. Those are: Liberation Trail fire in Clarence Valley Myall Creek Rd, Bora Ridge Stockyard East, near Port Macquarie Washpool State Forest. There are still more than 70 fires burning across the state, and half of those are out of control. There\u2019s still concern about the southerly travelling north and what impact it could have on the fires. A cool change has hit Sydney thanks to the arrival of the southerly, with the temperature dropping 11 degrees in 11 minutes. The southerly should also help clear some of the smoke, according to Bom. Fitzsimmons says there are still 11 fires burning at emergency warning level. He said the Liberation Trail fire north west of Coffs Harbour was 150,000 hectares in size now, and getting close to the communities of Nana Glen and Koramba. The Carrai East fire is 77,000 hectares and burning to the west of Kempsey. The Gospers Mountain fire is now 35,000 hectares. Fitzsimmons said it was going to be a long way to go before NSW RFS was satisfied with the state of the fires. \u201cThey\u2019re consuming an area of more than a million hectares. A fire of 100,000 hectares typically has a perimeter of around 1,000km. The enormity of the task to bring these fires properly under control, to consolidate them, to get around them and mop them up is enormous.\u201d Part of the issue is the southerly change won\u2019t hit some of the fires until around midnight, AEDT. He said fire had spread late at night or early in the morning in the past, when conditions should have been easing. Fitzsimmons said none of the injuries sustained by firefighters so far were life-threatening. This is the latest from the 8pm NSW RFS briefing from RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. He says there were 300 new fires across New South Wales today. It\u2019s estimated that up to a dozen homes have been damaged or destroyed today, but there could be more with fires still going. The southerly change was also still moving up the coast. \u201cAll these fires that we have got north of Sydney up the north coast are still subject to the influence of this strong southerly change that\u2019s moving across the fire ground which will impact and influence fire behaviour, create the volatile and potentially dangerous circumstances and shift the fire in a different direction than what it\u2019s been doing for most of today,\u201d he said. In the tiny village of Bungwahl, just south of Forster on the Myall Lake, Joseph Schuelein was filling up water for his gutters. The road through the town is thick with smoke from the dozens of fires lining the mid-north coast, but Schuelein said he had no intention of leaving. \u201cYeah, the bloke from the local fire brigade did come down and say we should think about moving, but where are we gonna go?\u201d he told me earlier. \u201cOur place is pretty well protected and we\u2019ve got dad\u2019s boat on the lake if things got really bad.\u201d A little earlier, down on the Pacific Highway, a line of trucks snaked back for a few hundred metres. The highway is closed at the town of Bulahdelah, and the Rural Fire Service is only letting residents up the Lakes Way. In any case, most of the trucks are too large to handle the winding curves of the only other road up to Forster, the Lakes Way. Frustrated truck drivers congregated around a service station and said things I probably can\u2019t print here. A woman and her husband, from Wagga Wagga, were hanging out in their camper van. They\u2019d been headed for a holiday in Port Macquarie, but couldn\u2019t get any further. \u201cWe\u2019re probably just going to cook dinner and go to bed,\u201d she said. Greg Christensen, the mayor of Scenic Rim in Queensland was on ABC\u2019s 7.30 program. He said residents were used to fires, but not anything like those over the past few days. \u201cNot on this level of volatility. The speed of running - the level of the burn - I\u2019ve seen fire burning across open ground as though it was a kerosene pool. \u201cThat is the type of fire we are experiencing. This is something that is unprecedented in my lifetime of involvement here and, certainly, from the memories I have from my father\u2019s storytelling as well.\u201d Chemical fire retardant was dropped on to the Sydney suburb of Turramurra, casting a pink hue over streets and houses. Residents in Upper Lansdowne, Elands, Bobin, Marlee and areas NW of Wingham are being told to seek shelter because the Rumba dump fire has breached containment lines. An update from the small rural community of Elands in northern NSW where there has been an emergency warning from the Rumba Dump fire. Nearby Bobin was devastated by bushfires over the weekend. Most residents of Elands were evacuated from their homes on Monday night but a few chose to stay and defend and have congregated at the one point in town where they can get phone reception. Susie Russell is one those residents. She said extreme winds that had been forecast had so far not eventuated. \u201cThe local fire captain was here just now. He was hopeful the village will be able to be protected,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will depend what the southerly wind does that\u2019s forecast for 2 o\u2019clock in the morning. \u201cI know there\u2019s been people very concerned about what is happening, but for those of us who are here we are calm and trying to make sure everything is alright.\u201d Jarra Hicks is also from Elands and is one of the residents who chose to leave after the village was door-knocked last night. She is 16 weeks pregnant and left behind her husband, father-in-law and a house they had just finished renovating to go to Newcastle where she has friends. Communication in and out of Elands has been challenging for days because power and the mobile phone tower has been down since the Bobin fires hit on Friday. \u201cMost people were able to leave the village. The fire has now hit and unfortunately it\u2019s hitting on three sides at once,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cWe just have one very small volunteer fire brigade fighting the fires.\u201d She said other community members had gone to Wingham, but they were now heading for Taree because Wingham had been evacuated now as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a game of hopscotch to wherever the fires are not,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had very limited ability to communicate and because the resources of the RFS have been so stretched, we\u2019ve had very little information at all. \u201cIt\u2019s highly uncertain. I expect if our home survives we will be extremely lucky because we\u2019re a small community. There\u2019s around 200-300 people. There\u2019s only one volunteer fire brigade of six people.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of smoke over Sydney right now. Cynthia Lush was home alone in her house across the street from the South Turrumurra bushfire. \u201cWe got a phone call about half an hour [after it started], on the home phones. It was way into the half an hour. I could hear the sirens, that\u2019s what alerted me, then I popped my heard out and they said no get inside.\u201d Brian Wilson wasn\u2019t remotely worried. The Guardian found him sitting in an outdoor chair in front of his garage, looking across the road where his neighbours\u2019 houses were drenched in bright pink fire retardant. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple, but everybody wants to run around. I\u2019m quite happy to just sit here and watch them do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on the wrong side of the hill, it blows the embers over us. Everybody panics, there\u2019s no point.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty surreal scene at the South Turramurra fire, where a suspiciously-lit, fast-moving bushfire came perilously close to properties in the affluent Sydney suburb. Helicopters have hit the fire - and some nearby mansions - with a pink retardant, coating roofs, gardens, and bitumen in a thick layer of pink. Multiple fires began mid-afternoon in bushland around Turramurra, including at Canoon Road and Field of Mars Avenue, where flames came within metres of homes. Residents reported towering flames and embers dropping well ahead of the fire front, starting their own fires in the dried out bushland. Geoff Bird lives on Canoon Road, near where one of the fires ripped through bushland on Tuesday afternoon. His children\u2019s school had been closed in anticipation of fires like this, and he was well prepared. When Bird saw the fire closest to his house, he immediately packed up, got his wife and kids out, and stayed to monitor the situation. \u201cI was in my backyard and saw the first plume of smoke and all the firies coming down the road. So I knew something had happened,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWithin half an hour of that I was inside watching the news, keeping an eye on things, and then could smell the smoke and came out to see where it is. \u201cFrom there it was a matter of packing up valuable things, we activated our fire plan, so we were ready to go, evacuated my wife and children, and then I stayed and kept a close eye on things.\u201d Police were on scene quickly and have confirmed they are now treating the fire as suspicious. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get on top of this shit,\u201d an angry Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce told Karl Stefanovic on 2GB regarding the supposed \u201cred tape\u201d around land clearing, that he has blamed on the Greens. These claims are, as we reported today, \u201cwithout foundation\u201d according to experts. Also it bears repeating, his party has been in government in NSW since 2011, and federally since 2013. Here comes the southerly. The Myall Creek Rd fire has crossed the Pacific Highway at New Italy and is moving quickly, according to the RFS. There are still 13 fires at emergency warning level, and 7 fires at watch and act. The southerly change is expected in Sydney in the next hour or so. Good news for Greta residents. This is a video provided to us from volunteer firefighter Dan Boswood taken at Lake Mary, west of Yeppoon. More than 150 schools and over a dozen Tafe campuses in New South Wales will be closed tomorrow, again. You can find a list of the schools affected here. An update on the insurance situation, via my colleague Ben Butler: The Insurance Council of Australia says that as of 3pm insurers had received 360 claims for fires in the NSW mid-north coast - 80 of which are suspected total losses. Initial losses are estimated at $40m, but this figure is likely to rise once people get access to their properties and assess the damage. The ICA has declared the mid-north coast fires a catastrophe, a technical term in the insurance industry that allows insurers to claim against specialised reinsurance policies, and more areas may follow as the fires across NSW and Queensland continue. It will issue another update tomorrow, a spokesman said. The Liberation Trial fire, which was already at an emergency alert level, has breached containment lines and is threatening Yarracooma, Paddys Plain, Cradle Creek and Lowanna. Firefighters are getting the upper hand on the fire at Wine Country Drive. There are 13 emergency warnings in place. Meanwhile, prime minister Scott Morrison has told his fellow politicians to \u201ctake it down a few notches\u201d after the ongoing fight between Nationals MPs Barnaby Joyce, Michael McCormack, and Greens MP Adam Bandt while NSW and Queensland are on fire. Via AAP: \u201cThere have been a lot of provocative comments made over the last few days from all sides of the debate and I find it very unhelpful,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Canberra. \u201cThe last thing that people in an urgent crisis need at the moment is hearing politicians shout at each other. \u201cThere is a time and a place to debate controversial issues and important issues, right now it\u2019s important to focus on the needs of Australians who need our help.\u201d There are concerns about the coming southerly change, according to this report from AAP. More than a dozen emergency bushfires are raging across NSW as millions of residents face \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fire danger with a southerly wind change expected to make matters even worse. \u201cWe are still concerned with the movement of the southerly change as it heads through NSW over the coming hours,\u201d Rural Fire Service NSW commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. Fitzsimmons said the southerly change would reach Sydney by 7pm and hit the north of the state late on Tuesday or early Wednesday morning. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t rest easy at this stage. We\u2019ve got many hours left yet of prevailing, hot, dry, windy conditions,\u201d he said. Fitzsimmons said the day was unfolding as predicted with a million hectares burning. Bureau of Meteorology state manager Ann Farrell says as the southerly change moves up NSW \u201cthe fires will be fanned in a different direction\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ll be very gusty and quite unpredictable at times - so that will make fire conditions much more dangerous,\u201d she told reporters in Sydney. Josh Taylor back at the helm for the latest update from NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons for 5.30pm AEDT. There are 85 fires across NSW, and 46 are not contained. There are 14 fires at emergency alert level, and 17 at the watch and act level. There\u2019s a small fire in Katoomba in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney but that fire has been contained. A firefighter at Turramurra has suffered suspected fractured arm and ribs. The earlier report of a cardiac arrest of a firefighter at North Rothbury was thankfully not the case when emergency services arrived. Fitzsimmons said suspicious activity had not been ruled out in any of the fires, and investigations would take place in due course. The 14 emergency warning fires are: Gulf Rd fire, south west of Tenterfield Washpool state forest Myall Creek Liberation Trail north-west of Coffs Harbour Kian Rd fire Carrai East fire, west of Kempsey Carrai Creek fire Stockyard East fire Reserves Rd Thunderbolts Way Rumba Dump fire, all north of Wingham and Taree Hillville Rd, south of Taree Greta fire, near Maitland Gospers Mountain fire, towards Putty Rd. Fitzsimmons said people needed to stay vigilant. \u201cWe still have many hours yet of these strong dry winds to dominate and influence weather and fire behaviour. We\u2019ve still got the southerly change expected to move through later tonight, across the fire grounds still burning up in northern New South Wales.\u201d There\u2019s no indication of catastrophic conditions tomorrow, but the statewide fire ban will remain in place. \u201cWe do need to be mindful that we\u2019re expecting a return to hot and dry and windy conditions again towards the end of this week, certainly as we head to Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, we can expect to see elevated fire dangers again. I don\u2019t have anything in the signal to suggest catastrophic at this stage, but severe and above is likely.\u201d Some good news for Sydney residents: the NSW Rural Fire Service has just downgraded the South Turramurra fire from an emergency warning to advice level. The ABC reporter Nick Dole is on the ground in the Sydney suburb where he says the blaze crept up quickly. \u201cSome of the neighbours told me here they saw some smoke and before they knew it the blaze was basically up against their backyard,\u201d he said on ABC News. A number of homes came under ember attack, he said. \u201cWe just spoke to the neighbour and he says there are a number of spotfires that went through his yard. Fortunately some of his neighbours managed to help him and put out the spotting and the house has been saved.\u201d The federal government\u2019s aviation authority has labelled the use of personal drones over fire grounds \u201csheer stupidity\u201d that risks lives after an incident on Monday night, AAP reports. Crews on Sydney\u2019s north shore were responding to reports of smoke when they spotted a civilian drone hovering over the area. Although no fire was found, the drone could have seriously hampered firefighting efforts, the Killara rural fire brigade said in a post on Facebook. \u201cIf a fire was confirmed at the location we would not be able to request any aerial assistance due to the sighting of a drone near the fire,\u201d the brigade posted in a statement on Facebook. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said flying a drone near a bushfire was illegal. The act could attract fines of up to $10,500 and prosecution may be sought where people are put at risk, Gibson said in a statement on Tuesday. A watch and act alert has been issued for a fire at Cliff Drive, Katoomba, in the Blue Mountains. More images are coming in of brightly coloured fire retardant being dropped on homes in South Turramurra, in Sydney\u2019s north. The NSW Rural Fire Service has just issued an emergency alert for the Carrai Creek fire, near Armidale. It is now too late to leave if you\u2019re in the area west of Kempsey. Residents are advised to seek shelter as the fire approaches. Vision of the South Turramurra fire on Sydney\u2019s north shore clearly shows the bushfire is threatening properties. Firefighters are battling to save homes using aerial firefighting units dropping retardant onto the flames. This is precisely the situation NSW firefighters were hoping to avoid. Fires are now hitting areas of dense population. This fire is the subject of an emergency warning. Firefighters are advising people to seek shelter, saying it is now too late to leave. It\u2019s Christopher Knaus here again, taking over our coverage temporarily from Josh Taylor. Bushfires are now spreading to Sydney\u2019s north shore. ABC vision shows a blaze burning through grassland and bush at South Turramurra, on Sydney\u2019s north shore. The fire is in the area of Canoon Road and is spreading quickly. Nearby residents have been warned it is now too late to leave. They are advised to take shelter as the fire approaches. Here\u2019s what we know following the latest update from the Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons. There are 78 fires burning across NSW with 47 of those not contained. There are 12 fires at emergency warning level and eight fires at watch and act level. The 12 emergency alert fires were: Gulf Road, Tenterfield Washpool Myall Creek, west of Woodburn Liberation Trail, west of Coffs Harbour Kian Road, south-west of Macksville Reserves Road, north of Gloucester Thunderbolts Way, north of Gloucester Rumba Dump near Elands, Bobin and Marlee Hillville Road, south of Taree Greta near Cessnock Wine Country Road in North Rothbury Gosford Road, north of Sydney in the Hawkesbury area Fitzsimmons said multiple homes were damaged at the North Rothbury fire. This fire has since been downgraded to watch and act. He said firefighters had been able to keep on top of fires in the Sydney basin area but the strong southerly coming through in the next few hours was a cause for concern. This would occur around 7pm or 8pm in the Sydney region, and then north later in the evening. There are some reported firefighter injuries, and one cardiac arrest in the Hunter, he said. The Fire Near Me app has been downloaded 376,000 times in the past few days, he said. An emergency warning has been issued for Gospers Mountain in the Lithgow local government area. There\u2019s also an updated fire weather warning from the Bureau of Meteorology. Catastrophic fire danger remains in place in the greater Sydney, greater Hunter and Illawarra/Shoalhaven regions. It is extreme fire danger for the north coast, southern ranges, central ranges, New England, northern slopes and north-western regions. It is severe fire danger for the far north coast, the far south coast and Monaro Alpine districts. It is very high fire danger for the upper central west plains, lower central west plains and southern slopes. Residents of Harper Street in Greta are being advised to seek shelter as firefighters battle a fast-moving grassfire. The Public Service Association is blaming the NSW government for a 35% decline in the number of fire-trained rangers at the National Parks and Wildlife Service. In 2011, when the Liberal government came to power, there were 289 rangers, of which there were 28 senior rangers, according to the provided figures. Now there are just 193 rangers and no senior rangers, representing a 35% cut to fire-trained staff. The PSA acting general secretary, Troy Wright, attributes the job losses to millions of dollars in cuts and forced restructures: If the origins of these catastrophic fires across the state are in national parks then it is the National Party and part of the Berejiklian government that are responsible for the lack of preparedness. It is the complete absence of proper funding, not some mercurial green movement as the Nationals allege. Overall, there has been a 35 percent cut to fire-trained positions in National Parks. The loss of expertise is irreplaceable \u2013 area managers with 30 years\u2019 experience have left roles and not been replaced. As a horror fire season arrives rather than recruiting more rangers to help prevent fires the head of NPWS announced a go slow on recruitment. Parks are being managed by NPWS which is operating on a skeleton staff. That will always be a risky proposition, but on days like today it can be lethal. An emergency warning has been issued for Myall Creek Road, Bora Ridge in the Richmond Valley local government area. It is too late to leave, and the Rural Fire Service is advising people to seek shelter. This brings the total of emergency warnings to 11. Terry Green, who runs the Tuncurry bowling club, says they\u2019ve got quite a mix of evacuees at the moment. \u201cWe\u2019ve got kids and dogs and birds and cats, and we\u2019ve even got a goldfish here,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit of a menagerie at the moment and it looks a bit like Noah\u2019s Ark out the back.\u201d There are around 100 people at the centre, which has been an evacuation centre since last week. \u201cWe\u2019re looking after them and providing a safe environment for them. We\u2019ve been inundated with food and clothes and that sort of thing, with help from Salvos,\u201d Green says. (The club\u2019s Facebook post asks people to donate money to the Red Cross now, if they\u2019d like to help out.) They\u2019re expecting up to 800 people tonight from Nabiac, Pacific Palms, Red Head, Black Head and around the Taree district. \u201cThey\u2019re all in good spirits even though it\u2019s an emotional time, a worrying time,\u201d says Green. \u201cBut they\u2019re supporting each other\u2026 We\u2019ve got quiet areas where people who are showing signs of emotion can go and talk with counsellors from the Salvation Army.\u201d Josh Taylor here covering the ongoing fire crises on the live blog this afternoon and into the evening. Thanks to my colleagues Naaman Zhou and Chris Knaus for their coverage so far. There is a total fire ban in New South Wales today, and the police are taking that very seriously. The NSW police say they\u2019ve taken action against three men for breaching the ban, and a child for committing an act of arson. Yesterday afternoon, a 27-year-old man in Wallacia allegedly lit a camp fire to boil water for a cup of tea. Police issued him with a $2,200 on-the-spot fine. Then in the evening, a 35-year-old man in Prestons was issued with an infringement notice for allegedly burning fence palings in a barbecue, which caused a secondary blaze. A 46-year-old man allegedly lit a fire in a small coal barbecue at Lalor Park. He was arrested for failing to comply with the ban, and for a breach of bail. A 9-year-old boy has been issued with a warning after starting a small grassfire using a blowtorch in Worrigee this morning. \u201cA total fire ban means no fires out in the open. This helps limit the potential of fires developing,\u201d NSW police said. \u201cDuring a total fire ban you cannot light, maintain or use a fire in the open, or carry out any activity in the open that causes, or is likely to cause, a fire.\u201d Bill Ludwig, mayor of Livingston Shire, has just been speaking about the fire in Yeppoon in central Queensland, which destroyed eight homes. Ludwig previously said he had never seen a fire in the region that started so fast, moved so quickly, and put so many people under threat. He told the ABC on Monday that the climate was clearly changing and it was having \u201cdramatic consequences that were unfolding every year and appear to be escalating\u201d. Ludwig spoke to reporters again on Tuesday and said affected residents were now looking to return to their homes. He has urged the general public to stay off the roads near the fire grounds, even if they have been reopened. \u201cWe do not need sightseers, we have a live situation in place and we want people to do the right thing so the firefighters can effectively respond to the fire and the recovery, including the inspections that are happening to make sure areas are safe,\u201d Ludwig told reporters in Queensland. Plesman has lived on the property in Nymboida on and off since she was born. She said in the past decade, the weather had become increasingly unpredictable in terms of both fires and drought. Storms that used to occur of an evening in summer and fill up the dams had become less reliable. \u201cPeople who are struggling to survive want everyone to know this is a climate emergency,\u201d she said. \u201cAll my family were well set up. Sprinkler systems. Fire systems. What we\u2019re seeing is that nothing can withstand the catastrophic nature of these fires. \u201cPeople know that living in the bush, there is fire. But they want people to know we\u2019ve never experienced anything like this.\u201d A before and after of Gemma Plesman\u2019s home: \u201cWe had four houses on the property,\u201d Gemma Plesman says. \u201cThree were burnt completely. My mum and two of my aunties lost their homes. It\u2019s really horrific, they\u2019re completely gone.\u201d Plesman is from Brisbane but grew up in Nymboida, a rural town in northern NSW, about 45 minutes from Grafton. Over the weekend, fire tore through the rural property, which Plesman\u2019s mother and her mother\u2019s siblings had purchased four decades ago. Three of the four houses they had built on the land were completely destroyed. The remaining house was partially burnt. \u201cThe heartbreaking thing \u2013 everybody has built them themselves,\u201d Plesman says. \u201cThey\u2019re not your typical kit house. \u201cMudbricks they made by hand. Beautiful rocks they\u2019d picked up at the creek and put into the walls. That\u2019s all gone.\u201d Plesman says along the same stretch of road, several of her friends had lost their homes as well. \u201cIt\u2019s like a wasteland. It\u2019s completely desolate. I struggle to imagine what\u2019s happened to all the animals and birds,\u201d she says. An emergency warning for Wine Country Drive, in North Rothbury. This brings the total number of emergency warnings back up to 10. The climate rally outside NSW Parliament House earlier today has raised $4,500 for the Rural Fire Service. The rally called on the government to take action on the climate crisis and to better fund emergency services. The Whans Road fire has been downgraded from emergency to watch and act. \u201cThe fire has been downgraded due to improved conditions,\u201d the Rural Fire Service said. \u201cResidents in the area should continue to monitor the conditions and take advice from firefighters on the ground.\u201d This means there are now only nine emergency warnings currently in NSW. The latest highest wind speeds, from the Bureau of Meteorology. Nowra has experienced a top wind speed of 90km/h and Moss Vale 85km/h. Maitland airport is at 70km/h winds, Cessnock at 63km/h and Gosford at 61km/h. Coffs Harbour airport has recorded 54km/h, Glen Innes airport 63km/h and Taree airport 48km/h. In Sydney, Penrith has experienced 70km/h gusts. A 10th emergency warning for NSW. The Rumba Dump fire \u2013 burning in the area of Elands, Bobin and Marlee. The fire is near the Hillsville Road fire, which is also at emergency level. \u201cIf you are in the area of Elands, Bobin, Marlee and areas north-west of Wingham, seek shelter,\u201d the Rural Fire Service says. There is now also an emergency warning in Western Australia, as a fire on the north-east fringes of Perth is posing a possible risk to lives and homes. An emergency warning has just been issued for the western part of Bullsbrook in the City of Swan. \u201cHomes near Ellenbrook Road are under threat by fire now. You are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. There is a threat to lives and homes.\u201d The blaze started near Ellenbrook Road and is moving in a westerly direction. Melinda Pavey is the NSW member for Oxley. She\u2019s at the Kempsey Showground, which is acting as an evacuation centre for people affected by a number of fires in the area, including the emergency level Carrai East fire. \u201cWe\u2019re just hearing and listening to people and their stories,\u201d Pavey says. \u201cOne family from up at Bellbrook went down to the Kempsey races and they came home and the house was gone.\u201d Pavey tells me they\u2019ve had about 600 people register at the showground, and she\u2019s just come from the Macksville evacuation centre which was \u201cfull of volunteers getting ready for people to come in\u201d. \u201cHere we\u2019ve got tables and tables laden with donated food and clothes and toys, for people who have lost everything,\u201d she says, adding that local businesses and charities had donated food, fans and games consoles for the kids to stay entertained. \u201cIt\u2019s typical of Kempsey and Macksville, helping the community. There\u2019s a tremendous spirit but also a feeling of trepidation, everyone is on tenterhooks about the heat and the wind and what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Pavey says her own home is not in danger but she\u2019s worried about others. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Bellingen tonight with the southerly. I\u2019m just worried. I don\u2019t want people to go through the pain.\u201d The ninth emergency warning. The fire near Kian Road has breached containment lines and is burning towards Macksville. \u201cIf you\u2019re near Talarm, Macksville, Allgomera Creek, seek shelter,\u201d the Rural Fire Service says. More from the Bureau of Meteorology, which has warned that conditions will become \u201cincreasingly dangerous throughout the afternoon\u201d. The bureau\u2019s state manager, Ann Farrell, told AAP a low-pressure system would bring \u201cstrengthening, hot, dry winds\u201d that will make firefighters\u2019 job much harder. Earlier the Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said that the worst winds would not sweep through until midnight. Stuart Ellis from the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council also told ABC TV that: \u201cThis event will develop late in the day, particularly for Sydney, the Hunter and the Illawarra.\u201d Fitzsimmons stresses that all the fires are \u201cgetting closer to population centres\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why we invested very much in the predictive maps earlier today,\u201d he says. \u201cTo show that these fires are getting closer to population centres.\u201d There are currently eight emergency warnings around NSW. There are 71 fires across the state, 40 uncontained. Eight are at emergency warning level and 10 are at watch and act. Fitzsimmons says all eight fires are near population centres. The eight fires are: The Myall Creek fire near Woodburn. The Liberation Trail fire west of Coffs Harbour. The Thunderbolts Way fire, north of Gloucester. The Gulf Road fire near Tenterfield. The Hillville Road fire near Nabiac, south of Taree. The Whans Road fire in Llangothlin. The Carrai fire west of Kempsey. The Reserves Road fire, north of Gloucester. The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, says that winds are up to 80km/h across the greater Hunter and 70km/h in the Blue Mountains. \u201cThis will only worsen through the afternoon as the weather conditions continue to deteriorate,\u201d he says. \u201cThose winds will only get stronger in the afternoon.\u201d He says three properties have been impacted, and potentially destroyed, by the Hillville fire near Taree. \u201cThe conditions have still got a way to go before they reach the potential of the forecast,\u201d he says. Naaman Zhou here, taking over the blog again. Thanks to my colleague Chris Knaus. We are expecting another update from the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner in a few minutes. Let\u2019s take a moment to recap the day, as NSW battles unprecedented fire danger. The main concern continues to be around bushfires on the mid-north coast of NSW, but we\u2019re also seeing significant fire danger in Queensland and South Australia. The NSW Rural Fire Service has issued eight emergency warnings for bushfires across the state, including for fires at Hillville Road (near Nabiac and Failford), Llangothlin (near Armidale), Thunderbolts Way (north of the Gloucester), Gulf Road (south-west of Tenterfield), and Reserves Road.. There are more than 50 fires burning in NSW, most of them uncontrolled. A total fire ban remains in place. Authorities in NSW are warning conditions will continue to worsen throughout the day with strengthening winds and higher temperatures. Fire danger is still rated as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d in the greater Sydney, greater Hunter and Illawarra/Shoalhaven regions. Changing winds moving north up the NSW east coast this evening are expected to create significant danger, potentially switching the direction of the fire front and intensifying winds. Nine schools in north-west NSW and the Upper Hunter have been evacuated as a precaution. That\u2019s on top of hundreds of schools and Tafes already closed by the state government. A state of fire emergency has been declared across 42 local government areas in Queensland. The main concern is in the state\u2019s south-east, and conditions are expected to worsen into the afternoon. The bushfires have led to a significant worsening of air quality as smoke haze drifts across NSW and south-eastern Queensland. Residents near Baryulgil are being warned to seek shelter as the Washpool state forest fire approaches. It is now too late to leave. The NSW Rural Fire Service has issued an emergency warning for the fire, the seventh such warning for fires across the state today. A sixth emergency warning has just been issued by the NSW Rural Fire Service. This one is for the Liberation Trail fire, near Clarence Valley. The fire has breached containment lines. Authorities are advising residents in the areas of Nana Glen and Coramba that they should leave immediately towards Coffs Harbour. Conditions are expected to worsen significantly this afternoon as a wind change moves through NSW. Meteorologists are expecting the change to bring southerly winds up the coast, reaching Wollongong between 5pm and 6pm, Sydney at 7pm, Newcastle between 8pm and 9pm, and Port Macquarie about midnight. That change complicates the fires significantly. It not only changes the direction of the fire front, but intensifies winds. Stronger winds will carry embers well ahead of the fire front and spread fires with greater speed. This is a time of particular fire danger. Just a little more on those school evacuations in north-west NSW and the Upper Hunter. We\u2019ve heard from the education minister, Sarah Mitchell, who said the number of schools now evacuated is nine. The schools were evacuated as a precautionary measure and on the advice of the Rural Fire Service, she said. \u201cSafety comes first \u2013 we need to take precaution and evacuate to get children out of there,\u201d Mitchell told the ABC. The schools evacuated were around Gloucester, Stratford and Stroud, north of Newcastle, and Moonbi and Bendemeer, north of Tamworth. Eight of the schools were primary schools and one was a high school. \u201cThis is unfolding as we speak so we\u2019re just doing what we need to to get them into safe areas,\u201d she said. A fire at Carrai East, north-west of Port Macquarie, has burst containment lines and is spreading quickly. The NSW Rural Fire Service has just issued an emergency warning for the fire, saying residents west of Kempsey are at risk and should not now leave their homes. They have been told to seek shelter as the fire front approaches. It is the fifth emergency warning to be issued by the NSW RFS today. Bushfires have reportedly forced the evacuation of eight schools in NSW\u2019s north-west and Upper Hunter regions. The NSW education department had already announced more than 575 school closures. Here\u2019s another view of that smoke haze, this time from satellite imagery. This is from the Weatherzone meteorologist Ben Domensino. We just mentioned the significant drops in air quality in NSW and south-east Queensland. This vision shows the thickness of the smoke haze drifting across parts of the east coast. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services has separately advised residents near Mount Alphen and Double Top, Tarome, and Clumber and Moogerah to prepare to leave. The NSW Rural Fire Service has just issued an emergency warning for Whans Road, Llangothlin, north of Armidale and south of Glen Innes. A fire is now burning there and spreading quickly. The RFS has advised anyone in the area of Llangothlin and its surrounds that it is now too late to leave. It has advised those in the area to seek shelter as the fire approaches. This is the fourth emergency warning issued by the NSW RFS today. It\u2019s Christopher Knaus here taking over our live coverage of the bushfire emergency from Naaman Zhou. The bushfires have caused significant deteriorations to air quality across NSW and south-east Queensland. Much of Sydney and the Hunter regions have been advised to \u201cstay inside as much as possible\u201d as winds push smoke from the devastating mid-north coast bushfires down the state\u2019s east coast. A drop in air quality is also hitting the Illawarra region, south of Sydney. Residents in south-east Queensland are also being urged to limit their time outdoors due to air quality concerns. My colleague Michael McGowan has filed a full report on air quality across NSW and Queensland here. Earlier today, before the three emergency warnings and updates from the NSW Rural Fire Service, the Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce claimed that two people who died over the weekend were \u201cmost likely\u201d Greens voters, as the political stoush over the fires continues. The current deputy PM, Michael McCormack, had said yesterday that any link between climate change and the worsening bushfires was \u201cwoke capital-city greenies ravings\u201d and \u201ccheap political point scoring\u201d. Joyce then said the Greens were to blame because their influence meant fire services had not conducted sufficient hazard reduction burns. He then told Sky News this morning: \u201cI acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party\u201d but said he did not want to attack them or the Greens but focus on the policy mix. The full interview and transcript is here in our politics liveblog. Journalist Kieran Gilbert asks: The New South Wales deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said earlier that hazard reductions have gone on each and every year, each year we get as much done as we would like ...do they have enough resources to get it done? Joyce: I just think that it, here, in the first instance, they may need more resources, but they also need legislation, regulations, to allow them to get in there and do it in a more substantial way. And that the crazy thing there, and I acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party, so I am not going to start attacking them. That\u2019s the last thing I want to do. What I wanted to concentrate on is the policies that we can mitigate these tragedies happening again in the future. That\u2019s where I\u2019m going to focus. Queensland\u2019s acting fire commissioner says there are 55 fires still burning in the state, managed by more than 1,000 personnel. He says they have 40 aircraft either ready or in use, and he is \u201ccomfortable with where we are at today and how we are set in terms of our readiness\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable in terms of the work done. In saying that, with the severe conditions in the south-east this afternoon and into tonight, and tomorrow into central Queensland, those containment lines, where we\u2019ve got them, will be tested. \u201c[But] we have got resources ready for any new outbreaks.\u201d Palaszczuk said air quality particle ratings were 10 times higher than usual today, stretching from Brisbane to Ipswich and the Gold Coast. A meteorologist from the weather bureau adds there is no significant rainfall on the horizon for Queensland. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has just given a press conference thanking the state\u2019s firefighters, the defence force and the extra 110 firefighters from Tasmania, Victoria, the Northern Territory and New Zealand. She confirms that 12 homes have been destroyed. Fitzsimmons concludes by saying that the worst is yet to come, and the blazes will continue through the night with \u201cno reprieve\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a long night ahead of us because this southerly is going to continue through, and those strong winds are not going to get to northern NSW until near midnight,\u201d he says. \u201cUnfortunately there is no reprieve, there is no rainfall in this change.\u201d He adds that conditions will stay incredibly dangerous next week, and for the rest of the season. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a cyclical pattern of increasing hot temperatures as we head into next week. It\u2019s going to be a long difficult fire season, and we have got the worst of our conditions typically ahead of us.\u201d The next NSW update will be at 2pm AEDT. Thankfully, there are still no new fires in the catastrophic warning areas, Shane Fitzsimmons says. He says the weather forecast is \u201cunfolding as was predicted\u201d. \u201cThe forecast indicated across the ranges, we\u2019re going to be seeing average wind strengths across the ranges of 40 to 60km/h, gusting 70 to 90km/h throughout the afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing winds up around that 40 to 50km/h and gusting over 70km/h. So they\u2019ll continue to strengthen and build ahead of the passage of the cold front that\u2019s moving across the state. \u201cAnd late on today, we\u2019re expecting the southerly to start influencing and driving, a southerly buster up the coastal strip, and across the ranges and further inland.\u201d There are several hundreds of homes in these areas, he says, but many have already left early. He says firefighters have been in the area, sharing advice and \u201cguiding people about leaving and leaving early.\u201d For the Gulf Road fire, his message to Emmerville and Stanton is: \u201cIt\u2019s too late to leave and they will need to seek shelter as the fire approaches.\u201d For the Hillville Road fire: \u201cIt\u2019s getting closer to the Pacific Highway north of Nabiac, and the police and authorities are in the process of closing the Pacific Highway.\u201d Three fires are now at emergency warning, Shane Fitzsimmons says. They are: the Thunderbolts Way fire (north of the Gloucester), the Gulf Road fire (south-west of Tenterfield), and the Hillville Road fire (south-west of Taree). They are all existing fires in north-eastern NSW, which have been upgraded today. The NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, is speaking again in Sydney now. Moments earlier, the RFS sent out a second emergency warning for Gulf Road, Torrington. \u201cThe fire has breached containment lines and is spreading quickly. If you are in Emmaville or Stannum, seek shelter. If you are in Deepwater, monitor conditions.\u201d At the same time, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is also giving a press conference. A southerly change is heading up the coast, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. That has the potential to cause fires to change direction, adding more uncertainty and potential spread. Port Macquarie resident Patrick Rudd says now is the time to talk about climate change, as fires edge closer to his hometown. The 15-year old high school student told AAP: \u201cIf now is not the time to talk about climate change, then when is?\u201d Rudd\u2019s school was closed on Monday, and he said today that smoke was so thick in town \u201cyou can taste it\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely very scary,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to see it affecting my town and me personally, it feels very threatening. It feels almost like our first look at what might lie ahead. If now is not the time to talk about climate change, then when is? \u201cIt\u2019s not the \u2018greenies\u2019 who are politicising [the bushfires], it\u2019s actually the firefighters and emergency services.\u201d Rudd was one of the local organisers of a climate strike at his school. The first emergency warning of the day has just been issued. A fire is burning and spreading quickly in the area of Thunderbolts Way and Nowendoc Road on the mid north coast of NSW. \u201cThe fire is spreading quickly,\u201d the RFS says. \u201cIf you are in the path of the fire, you are at risk. \u201cIf you are in the Nowendoc and Mount George area, you at risk. It is too late to leave.\u201d Power outages have struck homes in Sydney\u2019s north, according to AusGrid. The affected suburbs are Ryde, Gladesville, Putney and Tennyson Point. It seems to be business as usual in the Blue Mountains town of Katoomba this morning. Guardian Australia spoke to a number of business operators who said everything was fairly calm along the main street, despite the forecast catastrophic conditions. The cafes are full and the historic local hotel, the Carrington, is bustling. Tourists, however, may find their days plans derailed: the Blue Mountains city council has warned the community to avoid entering bushland areas, including walking tracks, lookouts and similar, \u201cgiven that any fire that starts will be uncontrollable and will spread quickly\u201d. Campgrounds at Old Ford reserve Megalong Valley, Blackheath Glen Megalong Valley, Mount York and Cathedral of Ferns Mount Wilson are closed, as is the Blue Mountains national park until at least Thursday. Temperatures are now above 30C in many parts of the state that are covered by the catastrophic danger warning. In the Hunter, it is above 30C at: Cessnock airport, Gosford, Lake Macquarie \u2013 Cooranbong, Maitland airport, Mangrove Mountain, Merriwa and Williamtown. In the Illawarra: Albion Park, Bellambi, Nowra and Jervis Bay Airfield. In Sydney, it is above 30C at all current Bureau of Meteorology observation stations. It\u2019s nearly 34C in Penrith and 30C on Sydney Harbour. Northern Territory firefighters have just announced that they will be travelling to Queensland today to help with the effort as well. Precise details are still to come. A senior Queensland fire chief has said the state is struggling with a lack of resources, AAP reports. An assistant commissioner of the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, Tony Johnstone, told ABC Radio: \u201cWe\u2019re having a problem with resources. We need to admit that.\u201d While he has 40 aircraft on standby, he said more firefighters were needed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got significant aircraft for Queensland on standby to use. But aircraft don\u2019t put fires out, aircraft help contain fires while firefighters get in.\u201d Queensland has called in firefighters from interstate and New Zealand. The acting commissioner of QFES, Mike Wassing, said: \u201cThis is a marathon for us with several sprints. We\u2019ve been at this since August when the fire season normally starts.\u201d A NSW Ambulance spokesman also adds that since 5am, they have seen \u201ca slightly elevated workload across the state\u201d. He says there were 31 instances of respiratory conditions \u2013 17 within greater Sydney, nine in the north of NSW and five in the south. \u201cOne of those conditions was directly related to a patient who no longer had their asthma reliever medication with them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very, very important that we get this message out very clearly \u2013 to fail to make a plan if you have an asthma condition or respiratory condition and not have reliever medications, this could be a deadly condition for you. \u201cMake a plan and get medical aid as soon as possible.\u201d That concludes the 11am press conference. Around the state, there is also \u201cgreater spread potential for many of our fires\u201d, Fitzsimmons says. This means that many of the predictions from last night of fire spread are being exceeded. Earlier we saw fires near Port Macquarie were growing. \u201cAcross many of the 50 fires burning in north-east New South Wales, the predictions are generally showing a greater spread potential for the fires,\u201d Fitzsimmons says. \u201cThat\u2019s based on the conditions and the current fire behaviour.\u201d On the Gosper Mountain fire and the St Albans area, Fitzsimmons says: \u201cYou\u2019re talking a very large bushfire, burning through forested country. You\u2019re talking about relatively isolated settlements along and up the Putty Road, the communities of Mellong, and Howes Swamp. \u201cThe decision now is to leave now. We know the fire is building. If you haven\u2019t already done so, now is the safest time to go.\u201d \u201cThe edge of the fire that\u2019s burning is being driven by the hot, dry winds coming down the ranges and influencing the fire behaviour.\u201d Shane Fitzsimmons is speaking in Sydney now. The NSW RFS commissioner says: \u201cWe are certainly starting to see an increase in fire activity \u2026 Up north, we\u2019ve got a couple of the fires particularly that are starting to develop.\u201d There are gusts exceeding 70km/h in many parts of the ranges. Closer to Sydney, the Mount Gosper fire in the Hawkesbury is likely to impact the communities of Howes Swamp and Mellong. Later today it could spread to St Albans, Upper MacDonald and areas north of Wisemans Ferry. The Sydney protest also heard a message from Sian, a schoolgirl on the north coast, who lost her home and said the fires were unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before. \u201cThe fire was unstoppable,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from those who stayed, of walls of flame 40 metres high. It was catastrophic. \u201cFor many of us, this is where we have lived our entire lives. Our only home has been ravaged by a firestorm. This is not normal. Never have I heard of so many houses burning down in one night. Australia is on fire, we need desperate climate action.\u201d Fiona and her husband Aaron lost their family home \u2013 that they built themselves \u2013 on the north coast. \u201cFor me there has never been a better time to talk about climate change,\u201d Fiona said. Aaron said the communication in fire-affected areas was poor. With power out and mobile towers affected, people weren\u2019t able to get information about the fire situation around them. \u201cThere are people now today whose lives are at risk, and we\u2019re talking about thoughts and prayers.\u201d About 1,000 protesters gathered outside Sydney\u2019s Parliament House on Macquarie Street for a hastily convened demonstration demanding urgent climate action this morning. Protesters carried signs reading: \u201cScientists were wrong: it is much worse\u201d and \u201cIf now is not the time to talk about the climate emergency, when the hell is?\u201d Simon Clough, the former deputy mayor of Lismore, said fires had threatened his property for weeks and remain burning on a ridge 5km from his house. \u201cI\u2019m a country person, perhaps the leader of the National party would like to know that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I stand with you \u2018loony lefties\u2019 or whatever it is, because climate change is real. And we are experiencing it at this moment.\u201d Speeches were interrupted with cheers of \u201cUp the Fireys\u201d and sustained cheers for the Rural Fire Service. A report from the ABC says an army training exercise may in fact be the cause of a Gold Coast hinterland fire on Saturday that destroyed homes. The Australian defence force declined to answer questions from the ABC, but a colonel from the Kokoda barracks conceded in a message to the local rural fire brigade that the army may be responsible. In a Facebook message to the Lower Beechmont Rural Fire Brigade page, Colonel Arran Hassel said: \u201cWe have not formally investigated the cause of the fire, but I am conscious that we had an army unit conducting training in the east of the training area the week when the fire started. \u201cAs a part of their training a small fire was started, burnt out an area of 3m by 3m, but we believed we had extinguished it. \u201cIt is entirely possible that this fire reignited on Sunday 27 Oct and has led to the current fire.\u201d The defence force has been mobilised to provide assistance to all bushfire affected areas. The NSW education minister, Sarah Mitchell, has confirmed that some schools were damaged by fires yesterday. She told Sky News that in the catastrophic fire danger areas: \u201cAll schools that might be close to bushland, close to nature reserves, they are automatically shut. Areas where there is high risk, we would much rather keep students out of harm\u2019s way ... we want to take that cautious approach.\u201d The commissioner of the RFS, Shane Fitzsimmons, will be giving regular updates today \u2013 on average every two hours, but more frequently during peak times. We brought you the 9am update live, when he said no new fires had started in catastrophic areas. The next one is in 15 minutes. The updates are scheduled for: 11am, 12pm, 2pm, 4pm, 5.30pm, 8pm \u2013 all AEDT. Vision from Port Macquarie. Here\u2019s a new prediction map for the north coast. There is some significant spreading predicted around Port Macquarie, compared with last night\u2019s expectations. A printable pdf version here. The latest weather observations from the Bureau of Meteorology in some of the catastrophic areas: Merriwa and Maitland airport in the Hunter are already at 30C with gusts of 32km/h and 20km/h respectively. Nowra in the Illawarra is also above 30C, with gusts of up to 43km/h. Full NSW observations are here. Here\u2019s the latest on air quality. On the table below, PM2.5 particles are the one to watch out for. Readings have surged past 300 at Newcastle and Armidale over the past 24 hours. The fires have also forced the Coffs Harbour-based Rally of Australia car race, part of the World Rally Championship, to shorten what would have been a title-deciding race. The route will be shortened from 324.53km to 94.37km, with that stage used repeatedly, according to Reuters. According to GoFundMe, more than $250,000 has been raised in the past 72 hours for bushfire victims and firefighters. Donations have come from more than 30 countries. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has responded to claims from the fire brigade union that its budget has been slashed. She said claims $13m was cut from the urban firefighting budget was false, AAP reports. Fire Brigade Employees\u2019 Union state secretary, Leighton Drury, said Fire and Rescue NSW had its budget cut by $12.9m. The Rural Fire Service usually handles NSW bushfire-fighting efforts, but Drury said the cuts were harming the overall community response to fires. Berejiklian told ABC Radio that this was not true. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m updated at RFS, the fireys, all the agencies, are working together more closely than I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she said. A spokesman for the emergency services minister, David Elliott, said the $13m had been part of fire and rescue\u2019s capital expenditure budget and was not part of recurrent FRNSW funding. This morning a snap rally was held outside NSW parliament calling for increased emergency funding to fire services and action on the climate crisis. Some newer figures: 57 fires, 28 uncontained. The weather is still on track for the predicted conditions. There are 54 fires burning in NSW, 26 of them uncontained, 13 of them at watch and act. \u201cFor the rest of the day, we really need people to stay alert, stay informed, and stay safe and act in accordance with your plan and the advice that might be given out throughout the day,\u201d Shane Fitzsimmons says. There are no new fires yet in any of the catastrophic areas, Shane Fitzsimmons says. \u201cWe still have, though, these fires burning up in northern NSW, which are starting to increase in activity, and we\u2019re getting reports of some fire spread particularly in the fires further up in the northern areas of NSW,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s been a number of tactical backburning operations.\u201d The NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, is speaking in Sydney now. \u201cWe are starting to see an increase in the wind speeds, especially in the ranges,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are expecting those to continue to strengthen from 10 to 11 o\u2019clock late morning.\u201d \u201cNow is the time to exercise those decisions to leave, leave early and go to safer locations, safer towns or safer places in your community such as shopping centres.\u201d Here is a map of those more than 100 existing fires that Stuart Ellis was mentioning. The chief executive of the peak body for fire services, Stuart Ellis, has told Radio National today his main advice is to \u201cget out\u201d of fire-prone areas. He said today was especially worrying because there are already existing, \u201csignificant\u201d fires, even before the catastrophic conditions developed. \u201cWe knew [Black Saturday] was coming and the potential impact of that day, and we know now that this is coming,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not faced many days like this and the concerning thing about today in NSW in particular and also in Queensland, is that there is already significant fire in the landscape. \u201cOn Black Saturday there was a small number of fires in Victoria. A large number of fires developed. In NSW today there are already a large number of fires. \u201cThe only safe place to be is somewhere else. I\u2019m an ex-SAS officer, I\u2019m pretty capable, but I would not consider staying at my home today because under these circumstances it is not viable. It is not safe to do so.\u201d The Taree Show Society has opened its grounds to people who want to camp with their dogs and horses. \u201cWe have put some 113 horses in stables and we have set up sites for people in caravans, trucks and tents,\u201d said the society\u2019s Rhonda Crisp. \u201cWe have been feeding more than 100 people in our tea rooms every night with donated food. We have showers and toilets, if you are in trouble we are more than happy to help. Though of course people are very stressed and upset.\u201d Casey Miller from Old Bar has been living between a borrowed truck, horse float and car in the showgrounds with her friend, their four dogs and two horses for four days: \u201cWe are OK, it is just that we\u2019ve had to adjust and put life on pause. We don\u2019t know when we are going home. It is going to depend [on what] is coming with hot temperatures and bad winds, it all depends on that.\u201d Scores of people leaving farms and acreages are paying for accommodation in motels and hotels. Glennis Cochicho, who manages Taree\u2019s Crescent Motel, turned away between 200 to 300 people at the weekend. \u201cThe phone has been ringing off the hook,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to repeatedly disappoint people who I know are stranded, and it\u2019s an awful situation.\u201d From a correspondent, Christine Tondorf, in Taree: There are queues at petrol stations, schools are closed and Mid-Coast council has suspended non-essential services as fires continue to burn in the region. At the day\u2019s start, there were no fires at emergency levels, but the Hillville Road fire, just south of Taree, is at a watch and act level. Tuesday\u2019s forecast is 36C and the town is covered in a haze of smoke. Many of the 100 evacuees sheltering at the local returned services club were able to check on their homes on Monday with the reopening of key roads, including the Pacific Highway. Not all evacuees wanted to see their properties. Linda Ross, who lives at the Purfleet caravan park, has had word that her van is not damaged but she is fearful of going home ahead of the catastrophic conditions. \u201cI am now just so terribly, terribly tired and, if my van burns down, I\u2019ll get another one.\u201d For people on farms and acreages, Monday was also the day for deciding \u2013 stay or go. Many women, children and pets (dogs and horses) moved into town, while men chose to stay and defend. A woman from the Hillville area, who declined to be named, arrived at the Taree showground with her two horses. \u201cMy husband is still up at the house and is going to keep an eye on everything,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will try to protect it, if the fire comes through. He\u2019s just like a lot of other men there.\u201d More on air quality \u2013 a reading for the state shows metropolitan Sydney is as high as 125 on the air quality index, which is deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups. It\u2019s 161 in Newcastle, which is unhealthy for all, and 174 in Armidale. Twenty-five is the World Health Organisation\u2019s recommended safe level. In Queensland, there are now 55 fires blazing this morning, but none at emergency level. There\u2019s a severe fire danger warning for the south-east coast \u2013 which includes Brisbane and the Gold and Sunshine coasts \u2013 and the Darling Downs and Granite Belt region. Firefighters from interstate will arrive today, as well as 10 elite firefighters from New Zealand. A reminder of what those conditions mean: We are expecting 37C temperatures all across the state, with wind gusts of up to 70km/h. The fire perimeter is roughly 1000km as of this morning Embers can jump 20km to 30km in front of a fire front, starting spot fires More than 1m hectares have already burnt this fire season so far, the equivalent of the last three seasons put together We are still on track for today\u2019s catastrophic forecast, as of 8.16am AEDT. It may be calm in some parts of the state, but the weather is still set to make this one of the most dangerous days the state has seen, the RFS says. Four updates from Queensland this morning. Four fires remain at prepare to leave: Tarome; Clumber and Moogerah (south of Boonah); Mount Alphen and Double Top; Rosevale (south west of Ipswich). These Tarome, Clumber and Moogerah and Rosevale fires are \u201cnot directly impacting properties\u201d, but Queensland RFS say this \u201ccould change quickly and those who haven\u2019t already left, should be ready to leave\u201d. The Mount Alphen and Double Top fire is likely to have an impact on the Cunningham Highway. Yesterday the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said that drawing the link between climate change and bushfires was \u201cwoke capital-city greenies ravings\u201d and \u201ccheap political point scoring\u201d. Adam Bandt responded, saying that former fire chiefs had warned the government that pollution and climate change would make bushfires worse. \u201cThey have ignored some pretty clear warnings and attempts to meet from former fire chiefs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about saving lives and Michael McCormack can call me whatever names he likes. The first duty of government should be to protect its people and do everything it can to minimise the risk of loss of life and Michael McCormack and Scott Morrison are failing at that.\u201d Find full audio here. Today\u2019s Australian, meanwhile, has taken aim at the Greens by repeating senior Nationals talking points, and referencing the supposed hazard reduction issue. Also on the site\u2019s front page is a story headlined \u201cEven Nimbin hippies blame greenies\u201d. Only one person is quoted in the story actually blaming the Greens: Michael Balderstone, a \u201chemp candidate, deep environmentalist and leading figure in the Nimbin community\u201d. The Greens MP, Adam Bandt, has been on Radio National this morning, responding to claims from senior Nationals MPs that the Greens are to blame for the fires owing to their opposition to hazard reduction burns. Bandt rubbished the claims, saying this was a matter for the NSW government. \u201cCan I say to Barnaby Joyce, the Greens are not in power in the NSW government,\u201d he told RN Breakfast. \u201cWe support hazard reduction burns. That\u2019s in our policy, available there in black and white. We support effective and sustainable backburning strategies guided by the fire authorities. We will listen to what the fire authorities say.\u201d Air quality readings for Greater Sydney, the Central Coast, the Northern Tablelands and the Hunter range from \u201cvery poor\u201d to \u201chazardous\u201d this morning. In Sydney, there are particle readings between 150 and 199, with over 200 in the tablelands. Yesterday NSW Health put out out an alert that people with asthma, emphysema and angina should be careful. People affected should avoid outdoor physical activity and stay indoors, with doors and windows shut. Haze is already hanging over Sydney this morning. Even more schools have closed since yesterday evening, when the list was at more than than 575 closures. As of 6.10am AEDT, there are now more than 600 schools closed. The full list can be found here. Welcome to our continuing coverage of the bushfire crisis across New South Wales and Queensland. Today, there are catastrophic fire danger conditions across the Illawarra and Shoalhaven, the Greater Hunter and Greater Sydney. The catastrophic rating is equivalent to the conditions of Victoria\u2019s Black Saturday bushfires of February 2009. For those in fire-affected areas, please stay tuned to your local emergency broadcaster, have a bushfire plan in place, follow instructions from fire crews and avoid bushland areas. Full alerts from the Rural Fire Service can be found here for NSW, and here for Queensland. Those on the north coast should also note this map. \u201cFires will spread quickly,\u201d the NSW RFS says. And it\u2019s important to remember that it is still extreme fire danger forecasts or the Central Ranges, North Western, North Coast, New England, Southern Ranges and Northern Slopes. In Queensland, fire danger will increase to severe in the Darling Downs and Granite belt today. As of 7am: There are 54 fires already burning in NSW, 25 uncontained. There is a statewide total fire ban in effect More than 575 schools are closed and aged care homes are on high alert Some regional coach and rail services are cancelled The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has declared a state of emergency, lasting seven days",

      "bodyText": "The shy bookseller played by Audrey Hepburn in 1957\u2019s Funny Face wears couture versions of ballet pumps. The actor had been a dancer, and the movie\u2019s couture costumes, designed by Hubert de Givenchy, climax in a wedding dress (for Hepburn\u2019s marriage to a fashion photographer played by an elderly Fred Astaire) with a full ballerina skirt. So beautiful were the designs that they sprang out of the film and inspired style on the street. Everybody could afford a pair of pumps, even if they didn\u2019t look like Hepburn while wearing them. The opening sequence from Sex and the City also drew inspiration from ballet. Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s swirl of tulle was both a homage to dance and a copiable fashion statement. That simple tutu conjured a world of romance located in the historic iconography of ballet \u2013 and was speedily undercut when a New York City bus steered into a puddle, splashing our heroine. Dior\u2019s creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, brought dance and fashion together in her 2019 spring/summer ready-to-wear collection. The show was trailed by a video of a performance created by the Israeli hotshot choreographer Sharon Eyal with the caption \u201cthe story comes from inside the body\u201d. The unveiling of the collection was accompanied by famous quotations about dance, including Isadora Duncan\u2019s contention that \u201cDance is the movement of the universe concentrated in an individual.\u201d But it is hip-hop and street dance and its high and low brand aesthetic that has arguably influenced general culture more than any other dance trend since the thrilling arrival of Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes in Paris in 1910 sparked a sensation. Stars such as Nijinsky and Tamara Karsavina transformed ballet into a thrilling vehicle for transmitting avant-garde ideas, and the lavish, exotic designs of Alexander Benois, Leon Bakst and Natalia Goncharova offered an entry into a more exciting world. \u201cThey brought colours and fabrics from Russia that people didn\u2019t know,\u201d says Madelief Hoh\u00e9, curator of Let\u2019s Dance, an exhibition on fashion in dance \u201cfrom tutus to sneakers\u201d at the Kunstmuseum in The Hague. \u201cEverybody was wearing grey and beige and pink, and then Goncharova arrives with costumes in golds and dark blues and turquoises in striking combinations that just hadn\u2019t been used before.\u201d Goncharova\u2019s involvement in Ballets Russes was part of Diaghilev\u2019s cultivation of innovation in all aspects of the company\u2019s work, from the music to the choreography to the design.

With Crawley walking off upon reaching 103 from 137, and Rory Burns the only genuine wicket to fall for 23, England finished 283 for three.</p> <p>While Crawley was deputising for the injured Joe Denly ahead of his expected return for Friday\u2019s three-day first-class match against New Zealand A \u2013 leaving Jonny Bairstow on the bench in this 13-a-side match \u2013 his partner in a stand of 154 is inked in for debut in Mount Maunganui.</p> <p>Both spoke after play, with Crawley describing it as \u201cgreat fun\u201d (while recognising his place behind Denly in the queue) and Sibley outlining his intention to take a \u201cfearless\u201d approach into international cricket.</p> <p>That word might suggest a departure from the approach that got him this far \u2013 1,324 runs in Division One last summer while soaking up 1,009 more balls than the next most adhesive batsman \u2013 but should not be misconstrued.</p> <p>It instead refers to a change in crucial change in mindset by a player who, back in 2013 aged 18, became the youngest batsman to score a double century in the County Championship but stalled thereafter. It needed a move from Surrey to Warwickshire two years ago to become the run-hungry opener he is today.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t live up to the early hype,\u201d said Sibley. \u201cAt times I played the bowler too much.

      "bodyText": "Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley could scarcely have wished to make a better first impression on their first day for England, compiling promising centuries such that their captain, Joe Root, spent a good chunk of it waiting in the pavilion. England\u2019s plan in Test cricket under their new head coach, Chris Silverwood, sees Root back at No 4 and it is hoped that a top three reinforced by the obdurate Sibley can stop \u2013 or at least significantly reduce \u2013 his early arrivals at the crease. And so the batting day of this initial warm-up against a New Zealand XI in Whangarei made a satisfying early run-out ahead of next week\u2019s first Test, even if the opposition and the occasion were considerably more low key. After a rain-delayed 2.30pm start, Root did not emerge until the final session, when Sibley had retired on 100 from 161 balls, before making a sprightly 42 not out. With Crawley walking off upon reaching 103 from 137, and Rory Burns the only genuine wicket to fall for 23, England finished 283 for three. While Crawley was deputising for the injured Joe Denly ahead of his expected return for Friday\u2019s three-day first-class match against New Zealand A \u2013 leaving Jonny Bairstow on the bench in this 13-a-side match \u2013 his partner in a stand of 154 is inked in for debut in Mount Maunganui. Both spoke after play, with Crawley describing it as \u201cgreat fun\u201d (while recognising his place behind Denly in the queue) and Sibley outlining his intention to take a \u201cfearless\u201d approach into international cricket. That word might suggest a departure from the approach that got him this far \u2013 1,324 runs in Division One last summer while soaking up 1,009 more balls than the next most adhesive batsman \u2013 but should not be misconstrued. It instead refers to a change in crucial change in mindset by a player who, back in 2013 aged 18, became the youngest batsman to score a double century in the County Championship but stalled thereafter. It needed a move from Surrey to Warwickshire two years ago to become the run-hungry opener he is today. \u201cI didn\u2019t live up to the early hype,\u201d said Sibley. \u201cAt times I played the bowler too much. I played against guys with big reputations and didn\u2019t back myself. Moving away from my family and growing up made a big difference. I don\u2019t really fear too many people now, I just try to back myself and know that if I get through a tough time it always gets easier at some stage.\u201d Asked if he would take this approach into facing the likes of Trent Boult and Tim Southee next week, Sibley replied: \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to respect these guys and look what they\u2019re trying to do and analyse how they\u2019re going to try to get you out. But at the same time don\u2019t fear them.\u201d Such respect was afforded to less decorated opposition at Cobham Oval. Sibley, who bats front on and is a physical presence at the crease, saw off 22 successive dot balls against the seamers early on, waited for his 60th ball before driving his first four and reached 50 from 109 with a tucked single. The right-hander\u2019s one six, struck straight off the left-arm spin of Theo van Woerkom, was still a percentage shot with the field up. And while he picked up the pace to reach three-figures later on, this was a controlled, chanceless and hugely encouraging display. Crawley, who at 6ft 5in is fractionally taller than Sibley and wirier with it, was similarly patient at first. The Kent right-hander took 16 balls to get off the mark and though he offered one chance to short leg on 11 \u2013 and brought up his half-century with a streaky four past slip \u2013 there was a touch of class too.

I\u2019d seen saxophones, but this looked weird,\u201d says Angel Bat Dawid, who was told she could play one in her school band. \u201cI went to the library to work out what it sounded like, and everything I could find was Benny Goodman. I was like: damn, this corny-looking instrument with this corny-looking white dude.\u201d</p> <p>Thirty years later, Bat Dawid has hauled the clarinet out of corny white dude territory and hurled it into the cosmos. <a href=\"https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/jazz/angel-bat-dawid/\">She appears at this month\u2019s London </a><a href=\"https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/jazz/angel-bat-dawid/\">jazz festival</a> and her debut album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/01/angel-bat-dawid-the-oracle-review\">The Oracle</a> is one of the year\u2019s best releases in any genre, where swelling vocals, warm organ chords and lilting and freaked-out clarinet lines combine in a profoundly affecting whole. It was recorded on the voice notes app of her iPhone, and takes its name from her own nickname, a character in the Matrix: \u201cA powerful black woman, and when everyone is acting crazy, she\u2019s chilling in her kitchen and dropping so much wisdom. I aspire to be a woman such as that.\u201d</p> <p>Bat Dawid is often a hoot down the phone from Chicago\u2019s South Side, her voice cracking into hilarious high-pitched incredulity, but she jolts me out of the mirth with calm, sad ruminations on life in the US. \u201cI\u2019m a black woman \u2013 there\u2019s no turning that off,\u201d she says. \u201cI look at the totality of the black experience. I don\u2019t see my sister who has a crack addiction for 40 years as not being successful. Because of the lineage she\u2019s coming from, this is the best she can do.

I didn\u2019t know that with a clarinet, you can rip on it, and so then I really fell in love with the sound.\u201d</p> <p>As the daughter of Christian missionaries, she had spent four years of her late childhood in Kenya and found it hard to adjust to life back in the US as a teenager. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t understand me, kids bullied me. Music and the arts kept me sane through all those weird adolescent years.\u201d She eventually went to college to study classical music. \u201cWhen you go into the classical realm, there\u2019s less and less diversity, fewer and fewer black people. I experienced a lot of micro-aggression.\u201d A professor expressed surprise at her skill in a conducting class. \u201cWhy? Is it because I\u2019m black? \u2018Yeah!\u2019 He blatantly said it! People meet me and I say I\u2019m a musician, and it\u2019s: \u2018Oh, do you sing?\u2019 Because that\u2019s all a black woman can do. There\u2019s no way she can be a multi-instrumentalist and composer. I\u2019m this rebellious spirit, so it drove me deeper into getting better at my craft.\u201d</p> <p>But the micro-aggressions stacked up into disenchantment, compounded by a brain tumour in her third year. \u201cI had all these medical bills. It was a lot. So I just started working.\u201d She recovered and ended up with a well-paid job in a high-end lingerie boutique, where she worked for seven years. While she enjoyed helping women with different body types, the consumerist environment chafed. \u201cLooking at boobs all day was not my passion.\u201d She \u201cretired\u201d, cashing out her pension and putting it towards a year\u2019s rent to allow her to focus on music. \u201cMy whole premise was saying yes to the things I would normally say no to, because I had to work.

The way that men do jazz, no shade, it turns into a sport. It was kind of intimidating.\u201d Saxophonist David Boykin, who hosted a Sunday jam session called Sonic Healing Ministries, calmed her nerves. \u201cHe said: \u2018play anything!\u2019 I said: \u2018We can just do that?\u2019 Free jazz freed me \u2013 my ears, my ability.\u201d</p> <p>She discovered the rich history of improvised music in the city: units such as the Art Ensemble of Chicago and the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). \u201cI was like: what?\u201d Her voice bunny-hops up an octave. \u201cThere\u2019s this black experimental collective who live on the South Side, right down the block from me?\u201d She met with AACM members, including co-founder Muhal Richard Abrams. \u201cHe looked at me straight in the eye and said, \u2018if you take care of the music, it will take care of you\u2019. I\u2019m like, whuuuut? I bow to the sensei right now!\u201d She took on shifts at a record shop to boost her income, but has managed to quit that, too. \u201cBeing a musician full-time, people are like, how are you getting paid? I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t. When I had my full-time job, I was always broke. Now I\u2019m freelancing, taking gigs, and for whatever reason it just keeps working out. It goes back to what Muhal was saying: take care of the music and it will take care of you.\u201d</p> <p>Her music has since taken her all over the world, with portions of The Oracle recorded in London and South Africa. It wasn\u2019t intended to be an album at all \u2013 the phone recordings were guidance notes Bat Dawid made for an ensemble where some of the players couldn\u2019t read music, later arranged into full tracks at the behest of local experimental label International Anthem. She used online videos to learn production and mastering techniques. \u201cYouTube \u2013 that\u2019s my university,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d been in the studio before, and there was always some white guy who knows nothing about black people and black music who wants to tell me how it\u2019s supposed to sound because he went to university and he\u2019s looking at numbers on a screen. Uh uh.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiaVJp1ZISs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hiaVJp1ZISs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One of The Oracle\u2019s most powerful moments is a choral take on a 1963 poem by Margaret Burroughs, <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/146263/what-shall-i-tell-my-children-who-are-black-reflections-of-an-african-american-mother\">What Shall I Tell My Children Who Are Black</a>, about \u201cwhat it means to be a captive in this dark skin\u201d. By performing it in 2019, Bat Dawid announces that black people are still captive. \u201cI hate that poem,\u201d Bat Dawid says bitterly. \u201cI hate the song, too. I know Margaret Burroughs hated writing it. It\u2019s ridiculous that over 50 years later we still singing it.\u201d</p> <p>Bat Dawid says her melancholic music is a way to vent the pain that racism rends. \u201cTears are a survival mechanism for us to release our emotional pain, and blues and spirituals were the technologies that we used to activate that sympathetic system, so that we can survive trauma,\u201d she says, acknowledging a theory from jazz drummer Milford Graves. \u201cWe are in a traumatic state of being, as black people. We aren\u2019t free \u2013 this is just a 2019 version of the 1619 situation. Back then you would have to put chains on people\u2019s hands to keep them in bondage, but if you do this oppressive shit for over 400 years, you don\u2019t need chains any more.\u201d She sees ongoing oppression take form in the disproportionate incarceration of black men, in police brutality, in the version of black beauty that western culture permits. \u201cI\u2019m a genetic representation of our ancient African mothers. They look like me \u2013 but it\u2019s not whatever magazines say is beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Even cash is oppressive. \u201cIn order for any of us in this country to buy something, we have to look at people who owned slaves. George Washington, Abraham Lincoln \u2013 all these people were evil men. They did not think I was human. These things, they never stop, but in a white world, they want to think things have changed.\u201d After hostile, \u201coutright but subtle\u201d looks her band faced in an Amsterdam airport, \u201csome of my white friends were like, \u2018We\u2019re so shocked, we thought Amsterdam was \u2026\u2019 \u2013 the fact that you\u2019re shocked is racist. Because you really think this stuff ended. I\u2019m not a politician, but I got a horn, and I know how to read and write music, and I\u2019m going to do that until this thing is done. I can\u2019t live in this world any more, this is ridiculous. I get mad every day. We do not have live in a world like this.\u201d She sounds so tired as she separates every word: \u201cWe do not have to do it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/01/angel-bat-dawid-the-oracle-review\">Angel Bat Dawid: The Oracle review \u2013 reverb-drenched messages from a future afterlife</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But she finds joy in her work, in \u201cfeeling heard, to be able to express all the pain and suffering you go through as a black person\u201d, and even if she\u2019s not a politician, she is lifting up black lives.

I experienced a lot of micro-aggression.\u201d A professor expressed surprise at her skill in a conducting class. \u201cWhy? Is it because I\u2019m black? \u2018Yeah!\u2019 He blatantly said it! People meet me and I say I\u2019m a musician, and it\u2019s: \u2018Oh, do you sing?\u2019 Because that\u2019s all a black woman can do. There\u2019s no way she can be a multi-instrumentalist and composer. I\u2019m this rebellious spirit, so it drove me deeper into getting better at my craft.\u201d But the micro-aggressions stacked up into disenchantment, compounded by a brain tumour in her third year. \u201cI had all these medical bills. It was a lot. So I just started working.\u201d She recovered and ended up with a well-paid job in a high-end lingerie boutique, where she worked for seven years. While she enjoyed helping women with different body types, the consumerist environment chafed. \u201cLooking at boobs all day was not my passion.\u201d She \u201cretired\u201d, cashing out her pension and putting it towards a year\u2019s rent to allow her to focus on music. \u201cMy whole premise was saying yes to the things I would normally say no to, because I had to work. As soon as I started saying yes, wild shit started opening up.\u201d She\u2019d been making experimental rap beats on the side, and started jamming with a jazz collective, Participatory Music Coalition. \u201cI was nervous about jazz in general. The way that men do jazz, no shade, it turns into a sport. It was kind of intimidating.\u201d Saxophonist David Boykin, who hosted a Sunday jam session called Sonic Healing Ministries, calmed her nerves. \u201cHe said: \u2018play anything!\u2019 I said: \u2018We can just do that?\u2019 Free jazz freed me \u2013 my ears, my ability.\u201d She discovered the rich history of improvised music in the city: units such as the Art Ensemble of Chicago and the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). \u201cI was like: what?\u201d Her voice bunny-hops up an octave. \u201cThere\u2019s this black experimental collective who live on the South Side, right down the block from me?\u201d She met with AACM members, including co-founder Muhal Richard Abrams. \u201cHe looked at me straight in the eye and said, \u2018if you take care of the music, it will take care of you\u2019. I\u2019m like, whuuuut? I bow to the sensei right now!\u201d She took on shifts at a record shop to boost her income, but has managed to quit that, too. \u201cBeing a musician full-time, people are like, how are you getting paid? I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t. When I had my full-time job, I was always broke. Now I\u2019m freelancing, taking gigs, and for whatever reason it just keeps working out. It goes back to what Muhal was saying: take care of the music and it will take care of you.\u201d Her music has since taken her all over the world, with portions of The Oracle recorded in London and South Africa. It wasn\u2019t intended to be an album at all \u2013 the phone recordings were guidance notes Bat Dawid made for an ensemble where some of the players couldn\u2019t read music, later arranged into full tracks at the behest of local experimental label International Anthem. She used online videos to learn production and mastering techniques. \u201cYouTube \u2013 that\u2019s my university,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d been in the studio before, and there was always some white guy who knows nothing about black people and black music who wants to tell me how it\u2019s supposed to sound because he went to university and he\u2019s looking at numbers on a screen. Uh uh.\u201d One of The Oracle\u2019s most powerful moments is a choral take on a 1963 poem by Margaret Burroughs, What Shall I Tell My Children Who Are Black, about \u201cwhat it means to be a captive in this dark skin\u201d. By performing it in 2019, Bat Dawid announces that black people are still captive. \u201cI hate that poem,\u201d Bat Dawid says bitterly. \u201cI hate the song, too. I know Margaret Burroughs hated writing it. It\u2019s ridiculous that over 50 years later we still singing it.\u201d Bat Dawid says her melancholic music is a way to vent the pain that racism rends. \u201cTears are a survival mechanism for us to release our emotional pain, and blues and spirituals were the technologies that we used to activate that sympathetic system, so that we can survive trauma,\u201d she says, acknowledging a theory from jazz drummer Milford Graves. \u201cWe are in a traumatic state of being, as black people. We aren\u2019t free \u2013 this is just a 2019 version of the 1619 situation. Back then you would have to put chains on people\u2019s hands to keep them in bondage, but if you do this oppressive shit for over 400 years, you don\u2019t need chains any more.\u201d She sees ongoing oppression take form in the disproportionate incarceration of black men, in police brutality, in the version of black beauty that western culture permits. \u201cI\u2019m a genetic representation of our ancient African mothers. They look like me \u2013 but it\u2019s not whatever magazines say is beautiful.\u201d Even cash is oppressive. \u201cIn order for any of us in this country to buy something, we have to look at people who owned slaves. George Washington, Abraham Lincoln \u2013 all these people were evil men. They did not think I was human. These things, they never stop, but in a white world, they want to think things have changed.\u201d After hostile, \u201coutright but subtle\u201d looks her band faced in an Amsterdam airport, \u201csome of my white friends were like, \u2018We\u2019re so shocked, we thought Amsterdam was \u2026\u2019 \u2013 the fact that you\u2019re shocked is racist. Because you really think this stuff ended. I\u2019m not a politician, but I got a horn, and I know how to read and write music, and I\u2019m going to do that until this thing is done. I can\u2019t live in this world any more, this is ridiculous. I get mad every day. We do not have live in a world like this.\u201d She sounds so tired as she separates every word: \u201cWe do not have to do it.\u201d But she finds joy in her work, in \u201cfeeling heard, to be able to express all the pain and suffering you go through as a black person\u201d, and even if she\u2019s not a politician, she is lifting up black lives. A recent new work, Requiem for Jazz, was performed by an all-black ensemble, including a 12-year-old clarinet student Bat Dawid is teaching. \u201cThey cut all the arts programmes, she ain\u2019t got no band. If she lived on the [prosperous and predominantly white] North Side, she could be in bands; in the South Side, they got guns but they ain\u2019t got no instruments. But now she got a black woman who composed a whole piece of music, and she can see all these black people playing it.\u201d No more corny white dudes for role models, then. \u2022 Angel Bat Dawid performs at Kings Place, London, on 16 November, as part of the London jazz festival.",

      "bodyText": "Afghanistan\u2019s president says he has ordered the release of three Taliban fighters in an effort to persuade the insurgent group to free a kidnapped American and Australian professor. Timothy Weekes, an English teacher from Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, and Kevin King, from Pennsylvania, were abducted three years ago from outside American University of Afghanistan in Kabul by fighters in military uniform. Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, said in a televised address on Tuesday that the three prisoners, from the Taliban-linked Haqqani network, would be released \u201cconditionally in exchange\u201d for the academics. \u201cWe have decided to release these three Taliban prisoners who were arrested outside of Afghanistan,\u201d Ghani said, adding that it was meant \u201cto facilitate direct peace negotiations\u201d. If successful, the prisoner swap would be the first sign of diplomatic progress between the Taliban, the US-backed government of Afghanistan and the Trump administration since the US president abruptly cancelled peace talks in September \u2013 hours before he claimed Taliban leaders would be leaving for Camp David to finalise a deal. By Tuesday evening in Kabul, there had been no confirmation the three Taliban figures had been freed, and if so, whether they were still in the country or had been flown overseas, possibly to Qatar, where the Taliban maintains a political office. Neither the Taliban nor the Haqqani network had confirmed whether the western pair had been or would be released. Weekes, 50, and King, 63, were seized at gunpoint from a car in August 2016. US Navy Seals conducted a raid to free them days later, descending on a militant hideout in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan, but the men had been moved hours earlier, according to reports. The pair appeared looking gaunt and weathered in a video released in January 2017 begging their parents to ask the US government to negotiate for their release. They appeared in a second video later that year, setting a June 2017 deadline for their release, and the Taliban released a statement in October of that year claiming King was suffering from a \u201cdangerous heart and kidney disease\u201d. \u201cWe have tried to treat him from time to time, but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,\u201d the Taliban statement said. A Taliban commander in eastern Afghanistan previously told the Guardian the group considered teachers at the American University dangerous as they \u201cchange the minds of society\u201d. Ghani said he made the \u201cvery hard but necessary\u201d decision to release the Taliban prisoners, including Anas Haqqani \u2013 the brother of the Taliban\u2019s deputy leader, \u2013 and a senior Haqqani leader, Hafiz Rashid. The Haqqani group predates the Taliban but has become integrated into its structure, and is suspected of having carried out some of the most brutal and indiscriminate attacks over the course of the nearly two decades of war that have followed the 2001 US-led invasion. Anas Haqqani was arrested in Bahrain in 2014 and charged with raising funds \u201cfrom individuals from Arab countries\u201d and recruitment through social media. He was sentenced to death and his release has long been demanded by the Taliban. Rashid was the Haqqani network commander for south-eastern Afghanistan and accused of being in charge of selecting targets and providing equipment for suicide bombers. The third prisoner, Haji Mali Khan, was also a senior commander of the Haqqani network. In a statement, the American University of Afghanistan said it welcomed the development and was \u201cencouraged to hear reports of the possible release of our two colleagues, Kevin King and Timothy Weeks\u201d. The statement added that while the university was not part of any negotiations or discussions, it continues \u201cto urge the immediate and safe return of our faculty members who have been held in captivity, away from their friends and families, for more than three years\u201d. The US and the Taliban were close to completing a deal to end the 18-year conflict until Trump scuttled the deal in a tweet in September. Most of the terms of the provisional peace agreement were classified but they included the withdrawal of 5,000 American soldiers from five bases across Afghanistan by 2020. The Taliban would have agreed to renounce al-Qaida, fight the Islamic State group and stop jihadists from using the south Asian country as a safe haven. The FBI last year announced a $1m reward for information leading to the release of King and Paul Edwin Overby, 76, an American writer thought to have been kidnapped in Afghanistan or Pakistan in 2014.",

      "body": "<p>Tales of wicked stepmothers may be common in storybooks, but they are often a far cry from reality. Despite the potential challenges with step-parenting, many children develop close bonds with their mum or dad\u2019s new partner. The actor Dakota Johnson, now 30, is still on great terms with her stepfather, Antonio Banderas, who divorced her mother, Melanie Griffith, in 2014. At the Hollywood Film awards this month, the Spanish actor revealed just how close they still are. \u201cShe calls me Papi, and I love that, you have no idea.\u201d The Fifty Shades of Grey star described her childhood growing up with him as \u201cthe most fun a kid could have\u201d.</p> <p>They may present a contrast to the evil step-parent stereotype we see depicted in movies, but they certainly aren\u2019t alone. Since divorcing her husband six years ago, Frances Rose has maintained a close friendship with his daughter, Louise. \u201cI first met her in 2003 when she and her siblings were very young,\u201d she says. \u201cHer mum handled the breakup extremely well with a lot of maturity, which made it easier to get to know her children.\u201d</p> <p>Aged five at the time, Louise didn\u2019t realise there was anything unusual about her situation. \u201cWe would go to Frances\u2019s house with Dad and it felt normal to me. I grew up having two houses, two support systems and a more varied upbringing.\u201d She quickly formed a strong relationship with her new stepmother, and the family was close.</p> <p>When Frances\u2019s marriage broke down 10 years later, she was devastated at the prospect of losing the connection with her stepchildren. \u201cYou\u2019re not biologically related, so you don\u2019t have any rights,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have my own children, and they really felt like my family. After we split up, I had no idea what was going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>She needn\u2019t have worried because maintaining that relationship was equally important for Louise. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for any couple splitting up to put children first. Dad was supportive of my decision to stay in touch with Frances, which made the divorce easier. Knowing I could see her whenever I wanted without anyone being upset was great.\u201d</p> <p>After the breakup, Louise\u2019s mother regularly took her to see Frances before she got her driving licence. \u201cShe knew how important she was to me. I am very close to my mum and feel really lucky to have two incredibly strong female influences in my life.\u201d</p> <p>In the past few years, she has been on regular trips to festivals and galleries with her former stepmother, where they bond over their shared love of music and fashion. For her 18th birthday three years ago, Louise was treated to a trip to Thailand with her mum, followed by a break to New York with Frances. \u201cEver since I was young, both sides of the family have made an effort to do things with us. It\u2019s almost like my family time gets doubled.\u201d Frances also stays in touch with Louise\u2019s younger brother and sister, but says she never wants to force a bond with her stepchildren. \u201cI\u2019m always here and available for them if they want me.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s something that resonates with Andy, who split up with his wife in 2003 after a 10-year relationship. Although Andy was close to his stepdaughter Helen (not their real names), he was reluctant to push their relationship too hard after the divorce. \u201cWhen my ex-partner and I got together, Helen was 16 and quite grown up,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s a wonderful person, so laid-back and respectful. We got on very well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77fbb2cbb53d59b7f4a2829c0ba7b2635b1d42d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77fbb2cbb53d59b7f4a2829c0ba7b2635b1d42d1/0_47_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dakota Johnson (far left) with her stepfather, Antonio Banderas, and mother, Melanie Griffith, in 1998.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dakota Johnson (far left) with her stepfather, Antonio Banderas, and mother, Melanie Griffith, in 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The couple had been living in South Africa, but Helen was based in the UK when they separated. \u201cI was really disappointed at the thought of not being able to spend time with her again, but I didn\u2019t want to risk coming between her and her mum or damaging that relationship.\u201d However, Helen was keen to reach out to her stepfather. A few years after the split, she visited Durban to see him. \u201cShe made a point of coming to see me, which was wonderful,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so happy to spend time with her and properly reconnect.\u201d</p> <p>The visit wasn\u2019t long after the death of Helen\u2019s father, who Andy had been friends with throughout his marriage. \u201cYears earlier, I had lent her dad some money. After he died, Helen not only reimbursed me, but also gave me some extra money from her inheritance. She didn\u2019t have to give me anything and it wasn\u2019t something I was ever expecting.\u201d They now chat regularly on WhatsApp, and Helen goes to visit Andy whenever she is in South Africa. \u201cShe is just a fantastic person to be around,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For stepfamilies, making the choice to stay in contact after a breakup is important. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t speak to my ex-husband, Louise and I have formed a better friendship on our own terms since we split up,\u201d says Frances. \u201cShe is such a go-getter, and really career focused. We may not be related but I see parts of myself in her.\u201d</p> <p>While they were always close, Louise believes that the lack of pressure to spend time together has helped their relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would be as close as we are now if she hadn\u2019t split up with my dad. I am grateful to her for supporting me and making me feel like I can be independent and strong.\u201d When Frances remarried in 2017, all three of her former stepchildren joined the celebrations. \u201cIt was really nice to have them there with me. I\u2019ve now got two adult stepchildren with my new partner and I get on well with them, too.\u201d</p> <p>Like Frances, Amanda Kane loves spending time with her stepson Daniel, despite splitting up with his father in 2011. \u201cThe first time I met Dan, he travelled with us from his home in Ipswich to his dad\u2019s house in Preston. He was only six at the time, so it must have been a bit daunting.\u201d As soon as they were introduced, she invested time in their relationship, taking him on walks and trips to the cinema.</p> <p>\u201cI remember being really excited to go up north,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I first got to know Amanda, we did lots of fun activities together. I really appreciate the effort she made with me while I was growing up because it benefited me so much.\u201d</p> <p>As Daniel got older, the couple moved to Norwich so they could spend more time with him. Over the years, their bond continued to develop, and he became closer to Amanda than his biological dad. By the time the couple split up, Daniel was in his early 20s. \u201cThere was never any doubt that I would carry on seeing Amanda. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve grown up with two mums, and I am really close to them both. My mum offers me lots of emotional support and Amanda has always helped to drive me to succeed in what I do.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/may/14/step-by-step-how-to-become-a-good-parent-to-someone-elses-child\">Step by step: how to become a good parent \u2013 to someone else\u2019s child</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although she was initially worried about not seeing Daniel and his grandparents, Amanda has kept in touch. Since the divorce, she has enjoyed plenty of nights out with her stepson, and even took him to his first Download festival. Eight years on, Daniel has a child of his own, and she and her new partner regularly go for meals with his family. \u201cWe treat him and his partner to dinner and go to see his son. I am really proud of him. He\u2019s such a lovely dad.\u201d</p> <p>Many people who form close bonds with their stepchildren say that amicable relationships with their biological parents are important. \u201cI was lucky because Daniel\u2019s mum was always amazing,\u201d says Amanda. \u201cShe made me feel included in his life, and we could talk through anything. I will never take him away from her, but I do see him as my son, too.\u201d</p> <p>For her, positive stepfamily relationships can only enrich a child\u2019s life. \u201cI think more people should be forward-thinking about step-relationships after marriages fall apart. The more people there are in a child\u2019s life to love and care about them the better.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 A caption in this article was amended on 19 November 2019 to correct a misidentification of Dakota Johnson.</p>",

For stepfamilies, making the choice to stay in contact after a breakup is important. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t speak to my ex-husband, Louise and I have formed a better friendship on our own terms since we split up,\u201d says Frances. \u201cShe is such a go-getter, and really career focused. We may not be related but I see parts of myself in her.\u201d While they were always close, Louise believes that the lack of pressure to spend time together has helped their relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would be as close as we are now if she hadn\u2019t split up with my dad. I am grateful to her for supporting me and making me feel like I can be independent and strong.\u201d When Frances remarried in 2017, all three of her former stepchildren joined the celebrations. \u201cIt was really nice to have them there with me. I\u2019ve now got two adult stepchildren with my new partner and I get on well with them, too.\u201d Like Frances, Amanda Kane loves spending time with her stepson Daniel, despite splitting up with his father in 2011. \u201cThe first time I met Dan, he travelled with us from his home in Ipswich to his dad\u2019s house in Preston. He was only six at the time, so it must have been a bit daunting.\u201d As soon as they were introduced, she invested time in their relationship, taking him on walks and trips to the cinema. \u201cI remember being really excited to go up north,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I first got to know Amanda, we did lots of fun activities together. I really appreciate the effort she made with me while I was growing up because it benefited me so much.\u201d As Daniel got older, the couple moved to Norwich so they could spend more time with him. Over the years, their bond continued to develop, and he became closer to Amanda than his biological dad. By the time the couple split up, Daniel was in his early 20s. \u201cThere was never any doubt that I would carry on seeing Amanda. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve grown up with two mums, and I am really close to them both. My mum offers me lots of emotional support and Amanda has always helped to drive me to succeed in what I do.\u201d Although she was initially worried about not seeing Daniel and his grandparents, Amanda has kept in touch. Since the divorce, she has enjoyed plenty of nights out with her stepson, and even took him to his first Download festival. Eight years on, Daniel has a child of his own, and she and her new partner regularly go for meals with his family. \u201cWe treat him and his partner to dinner and go to see his son. I am really proud of him. He\u2019s such a lovely dad.\u201d Many people who form close bonds with their stepchildren say that amicable relationships with their biological parents are important. \u201cI was lucky because Daniel\u2019s mum was always amazing,\u201d says Amanda. \u201cShe made me feel included in his life, and we could talk through anything. I will never take him away from her, but I do see him as my son, too.\u201d For her, positive stepfamily relationships can only enrich a child\u2019s life. \u201cI think more people should be forward-thinking about step-relationships after marriages fall apart. The more people there are in a child\u2019s life to love and care about them the better.\u201d \u2022 A caption in this article was amended on 19 November 2019 to correct a misidentification of Dakota Johnson.",

After presiding over one of the most febrile British parliaments in years, he announced this summer that he would be standing down as Speaker and MP. His prominence during the Brexit debate split European media. The Daily Mail once called him an \u201cegotistical preening popinjay [who] has shamelessly put his anti-Brexit bias before the national interest \u2013 and is a disgrace to his office\u201d, but the press in Europe reveled in his behaviour. The Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant once wrote that \u201cno one on the British island can call \u2018order, order\u2019 more beautifully than John Bercow\u201d, while Radio France Internationale named him its <a href=\"http://www.rfi.fr/emission/20190113-john-bercow-le-speaker-chambre-communes\">\u201cEuropean of the week\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI am delighted that Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson has agreed to publish my account of a life in politics,\u201d said Bercow. \u201cI made friends and enemies alike, but from start to finish I sought to do the right, rather than the convenient, thing and to be a decent public servant. The story of a rewarding and fortunate career is told in my own words, and readers can make their own assessment of a journey that I enjoyed and they will judge.\u201d</p> <p>Weidenfeld chairman Alan Samson, who acquired the memoir from Andrew Gordon of David Higham Associates, said the memoirs were \u201cboth a grippingly candid narrative of a truly eventful political life, and also a wonderfully vivid tale of how the nation has reached this point in its history\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn the last decade John has made sure that Parliament has been able to stand up to the executive by putting MPs before ministers. Whether it is by accepting urgent questions or working hard to determine that the role of parliament is more widely understood by the public, he has played a vital activist role in the government being held to account,\u201d said Samson. \u201cHis book will be a hugely entertaining primer for anyone trying to understand the nature of our democracy and the processes of modern politics in this country.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement of Bercow\u2019s book deal comes a week after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50265137\">he furiously denied claims</a> that he had demanded \u00a31m to appear on reality TV show I\u2019m a Celebrity, which he described as \u201cutterly trashy\u201d. Bercow has previously written books including Incoming Assets: Why Tories Should Change Policy on Immigration and Asylum, which was published in 2005, and Tennis Maestros: the 20 Greatest Male Tennis Players of All Time, which was published five years ago.</p>",

His prominence during the Brexit debate split European media. The Daily Mail once called him an \u201cegotistical preening popinjay [who] has shamelessly put his anti-Brexit bias before the national interest \u2013 and is a disgrace to his office\u201d, but the press in Europe reveled in his behaviour. The Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant once wrote that \u201cno one on the British island can call \u2018order, order\u2019 more beautifully than John Bercow\u201d, while Radio France Internationale named him its \u201cEuropean of the week\u201d. \u201cI am delighted that Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson has agreed to publish my account of a life in politics,\u201d said Bercow. \u201cI made friends and enemies alike, but from start to finish I sought to do the right, rather than the convenient, thing and to be a decent public servant. The story of a rewarding and fortunate career is told in my own words, and readers can make their own assessment of a journey that I enjoyed and they will judge.\u201d Weidenfeld chairman Alan Samson, who acquired the memoir from Andrew Gordon of David Higham Associates, said the memoirs were \u201cboth a grippingly candid narrative of a truly eventful political life, and also a wonderfully vivid tale of how the nation has reached this point in its history\u201d. \u201cIn the last decade John has made sure that Parliament has been able to stand up to the executive by putting MPs before ministers. Whether it is by accepting urgent questions or working hard to determine that the role of parliament is more widely understood by the public, he has played a vital activist role in the government being held to account,\u201d said Samson. \u201cHis book will be a hugely entertaining primer for anyone trying to understand the nature of our democracy and the processes of modern politics in this country.\u201d The announcement of Bercow\u2019s book deal comes a week after he furiously denied claims that he had demanded \u00a31m to appear on reality TV show I\u2019m a Celebrity, which he described as \u201cutterly trashy\u201d. Bercow has previously written books including Incoming Assets: Why Tories Should Change Policy on Immigration and Asylum, which was published in 2005, and Tennis Maestros: the 20 Greatest Male Tennis Players of All Time, which was published five years ago.",

I don\u2019t think I have ever seen an organisation go to such lengths to try to belittle its own work and the contribution of some of its staff. Central to the BBC\u2019s case was that Newswatch, the programme Ahmed presents on the news channel and BBC One, could not truly be compared with Points of View, another \u201cvoice of the viewer\u201d show hosted by the well-known broadcaster and presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/30/bbc-mounts-defence-in-samira-ahmed-equal-pay-case\" title=\"\">Jeremy Vine</a>, which in fact plays to a smaller overall audience and has been filmed in corridors, unlike the studio-based Newswatch.</p> <p>Counsel for the BBC argued that a Points of View presenter was like a \u201cconcert pianist in a concert hall\u201d, whereas the Newswatch presenter was, in comparison, more like \u201csomeone playing piano to a ballet class of 10 children\u201d. Given that Newswatch was launched in the wake of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3437315.stm\" title=\"\">Hutton inquiry</a> to ensure the BBC was regularly held to account, this felt like insouciance of a high order.</p> <p>But the barrister was not out of line, she was dutifully reflecting her client\u2019s wishes and perhaps its attitude towards the proceedings, as revealed by other pieces of evidence presented at the tribunal. For example, the senior managers who had been responsible for and involved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/07/bbc-deliberately-failed-to-call-key-witnesses-in-samira-ahmed-dispute\" title=\"\">discussing pay for Vine</a> \u2013 whom Ahmed says was paid nearly seven times more than her for equal work \u2013 did not speak at the hearings. Instead, other, sometimes more junior, managers had been volunteered to give evidence \u2013 some of which consisted of emails that appeared to have been sent long after relevant discussions had taken place. At one point the cut and pasted Wikipedia entry for Vine was produced as a source on the presenter the BBC saw fit to rely on. It didn\u2019t appear to possess more suitable records of its own.</p> <p>It all left me wondering if this is simply what happens to managers in big organisations as they rise up the career ladder. Do they necessarily become less sympathetic to their colleagues \u2013 less humane? That surely does not have to be the case. Of course tough things will happen where there are competitive and ambitious people striving to do well. But you\u2019d hope that in an organisation such as the BBC \u2013 \u201cWe respect each other and celebrate our diversity\u201d, another core value \u2013 this ability to be straight and deal with colleagues in a civilised manner comes with the territory.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this tribunal has revealed weaknesses in some parts of BBC management. Like dozens of other women at the BBC, Ahmed has been seeking to receive equal pay for work of equal value as that carried out by male colleagues. That is, after all, the law, established in 1970.</p> <p>At one point Ahmed\u2019s barrister tried to determine what Vine\u2019s employment status was. The tribunal was told that Vine was \u201cemployed for tax purposes but not employed for employment purposes\u201d. Whatever the purpose, Vine got \u00a33,000 per 15-minute episode, while Ahmed got \u00a3440 for presenting a programme of similar length and content. \u201cWe take pride in delivering quality and value for money\u201d \u2013 another core BBC value.</p> <p>Speaking at an HR conference in Manchester last week, the BBC\u2019s outgoing HR director, Valerie Hughes-D\u2019Aeth, said of the people management business: \u201cWe tend to have been very good at people skills: empathy, compassion.\u201d After a few days at the tribunal I can\u2019t honestly say I spotted where the empathy and compassion elements came in.</p> <p>Sometimes it feels as though the BBC has never really got over the shock of losing its former director general, Greg Dyke, in the row that followed the publication of Lord Hutton\u2019s report. His resignation following the results of the inquiry caused huge upset among staff at the time, prompting more than 1,000 employees to stage a walkout. Many pleaded with him not to leave. Can an organisation suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder? The BBC has been menaced by politicians, threatened with severe financial cutbacks, instructed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/26/boris-johnson-bbc-cough-up-tv-licences-over-75s\" title=\"\">fund free TV licences</a> for the over-75s, and then told by the outgoing culture secretary that the licence fee itself may be abolished. These are not easy times for the broadcaster. And yet the absence of firm and confident leadership has left the organisation vulnerable and floundering. These are the conditions in which dubious editorial decisions, bad management behaviour and toxic work culture can proliferate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/03/election-broadcasting-rules-balance-social-media-campaigning\">Elections are changing, but broadcasting rules are stuck in the last century | Paul Chadwick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Employment tribunals are rarely pleasant. You are only there because a dispute has proved impossible to resolve, for one reason or another. The cards are often stacked in the employer\u2019s favour. And yet there was a simple and elegant truth to the closing words spoken by Ahmed\u2019s barrister, Claire Darwin: \u201cThe claimant is here today because she wants equal pay for equal work, and I would invite the employment tribunal to uphold her right to it.\u201d</p> <p>The tribunal\u2019s judgment will be published just before or after Christmas. Whatever the outcome, as shown by the support Ahmed has received from colleagues such as the BBC\u2019s Naga Munchetty and broadcaster Sandi Toksvig, one thing has become clear: great things can happen when we work together.</p> <p>\u2022 Stefan Stern is co-author of Myths of Management and the former director of the High Pay Centre</p>",

Instead, other, sometimes more junior, managers had been volunteered to give evidence \u2013 some of which consisted of emails that appeared to have been sent long after relevant discussions had taken place. At one point the cut and pasted Wikipedia entry for Vine was produced as a source on the presenter the BBC saw fit to rely on. It didn\u2019t appear to possess more suitable records of its own. It all left me wondering if this is simply what happens to managers in big organisations as they rise up the career ladder. Do they necessarily become less sympathetic to their colleagues \u2013 less humane? That surely does not have to be the case. Of course tough things will happen where there are competitive and ambitious people striving to do well. But you\u2019d hope that in an organisation such as the BBC \u2013 \u201cWe respect each other and celebrate our diversity\u201d, another core value \u2013 this ability to be straight and deal with colleagues in a civilised manner comes with the territory. Unfortunately, this tribunal has revealed weaknesses in some parts of BBC management. Like dozens of other women at the BBC, Ahmed has been seeking to receive equal pay for work of equal value as that carried out by male colleagues. That is, after all, the law, established in 1970. At one point Ahmed\u2019s barrister tried to determine what Vine\u2019s employment status was. The tribunal was told that Vine was \u201cemployed for tax purposes but not employed for employment purposes\u201d. Whatever the purpose, Vine got \u00a33,000 per 15-minute episode, while Ahmed got \u00a3440 for presenting a programme of similar length and content. \u201cWe take pride in delivering quality and value for money\u201d \u2013 another core BBC value. Speaking at an HR conference in Manchester last week, the BBC\u2019s outgoing HR director, Valerie Hughes-D\u2019Aeth, said of the people management business: \u201cWe tend to have been very good at people skills: empathy, compassion.\u201d After a few days at the tribunal I can\u2019t honestly say I spotted where the empathy and compassion elements came in. Sometimes it feels as though the BBC has never really got over the shock of losing its former director general, Greg Dyke, in the row that followed the publication of Lord Hutton\u2019s report. His resignation following the results of the inquiry caused huge upset among staff at the time, prompting more than 1,000 employees to stage a walkout. Many pleaded with him not to leave. Can an organisation suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder? The BBC has been menaced by politicians, threatened with severe financial cutbacks, instructed to fund free TV licences for the over-75s, and then told by the outgoing culture secretary that the licence fee itself may be abolished. These are not easy times for the broadcaster. And yet the absence of firm and confident leadership has left the organisation vulnerable and floundering. These are the conditions in which dubious editorial decisions, bad management behaviour and toxic work culture can proliferate. Employment tribunals are rarely pleasant. You are only there because a dispute has proved impossible to resolve, for one reason or another. The cards are often stacked in the employer\u2019s favour. And yet there was a simple and elegant truth to the closing words spoken by Ahmed\u2019s barrister, Claire Darwin: \u201cThe claimant is here today because she wants equal pay for equal work, and I would invite the employment tribunal to uphold her right to it.\u201d The tribunal\u2019s judgment will be published just before or after Christmas. Whatever the outcome, as shown by the support Ahmed has received from colleagues such as the BBC\u2019s Naga Munchetty and broadcaster Sandi Toksvig, one thing has become clear: great things can happen when we work together. \u2022 Stefan Stern is co-author of Myths of Management and the former director of the High Pay Centre",

The past will keep poking through. When, for instance, he draws a \u201cbuggering bunion\u201d that has developed on his foot, you can\u2019t help but think of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/11/raymond-briggs-my-writing-day\" title=\"\">Fungus the Bogeyman</a></em> and his taste for corns and ear wax.</p> <p>Equally, when he remembers how his wife, Jean, asked him if she was going to die (she died from leukaemia in 1973, when she was just 43), you picture immediately Hilda Bloggs in <em>When the Wind Blows</em>, her hair falling out as she succumbs to the effects of radiation. And then, of course, there are his parents, Ethel and Ernest, whose story he told in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/dec/15/features.review3\" title=\"\">bestselling biography</a> of 1998. They are everywhere here, just as they\u2019re everywhere in his life, even now. Briggs still uses their old breadboard and knife and in his book he includes a sketch of both that is so serenely exquisite that it might as well be by Morandi.</p> <p>Oh, but it\u2019s a disorienting and plangent thing to read a book like this by Briggs. If you grew up with <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/father-christmas-9780241351536.html\" title=\"\">Father Christmas</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/gentleman-jim-9780224085243.html\" title=\"\">Gentleman Jim</a></em>, as I did, he will always have been a bit of a self-styled old git in your mind\u2019s eye (therein lay some of the pleasure of his books for a child: the fact that they were neither easy nor nice). All the same, it is painful to register the indignity and fear that border these pages, like the black band on a Victorian mourning card.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4846d40a8ae6fadaecaac2b153745e0a092e72ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4846d40a8ae6fadaecaac2b153745e0a092e72ed/67_80_2320_2927/793.jpg\" alt=\"Time for Lights Out: \u2018it is painful to register the indignity and fear that border these pages\u2019\" width=\"793\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Time for Lights Out: \u2018it is painful to register the indignity and fear that border these pages\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: mmckay/from publishers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Briggs is predictably wry about such things as his deafness and the way that, these days, his eyebrows grow faster than a beanstalk. But he won\u2019t even try to make a joke of the anxiety, the dark thoughts, the invisibility and the growing forgetfulness that attend him now. They are, after all, the opposite of funny, though I was glad to see him reproduce a fan letter from a little girl that I saw in his loo when I interviewed him many years ago: \u201cMichelle keeps on saying you\u2019re dead,\u201d it reads.</p> <p>And then there is the past, the way the years concertina. What is it about old age \u2013 he is now 85 \u2013 that has a man thinking of his childhood when so much has happened since? Again, he traces the stories: here are his maiden aunts, who were so kind to him; here is his father, who kept a box of Rennies by his bed. You sense his weariness. <em>Time for Lights Out</em> is far heavier on words than on pictures; where once there would have been a cartoon strip, there are now little half-poems, sometimes even photographs. Thanks to this, it can feel effortful.</p> <p>But there is a certain clemency here, too: a self-forgiveness. Above a quotation from DH Lawrence about how hard it is to die \u2013 \u201cBe careful, then, and be gentle about death\u201d \u2013 Briggs has drawn two doors on a landing, one closed and the other slightly ajar. Over the second, there falls a shadow: a beloved genius of storytelling and illustration, his hand not quite on its handle, but very close.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Time for Lights Out </em>by Raymond Briggs is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a318.99).

And then, of course, there are his parents, Ethel and Ernest, whose story he told in a bestselling biography of 1998. They are everywhere here, just as they\u2019re everywhere in his life, even now. Briggs still uses their old breadboard and knife and in his book he includes a sketch of both that is so serenely exquisite that it might as well be by Morandi. Oh, but it\u2019s a disorienting and plangent thing to read a book like this by Briggs. If you grew up with Father Christmas and Gentleman Jim, as I did, he will always have been a bit of a self-styled old git in your mind\u2019s eye (therein lay some of the pleasure of his books for a child: the fact that they were neither easy nor nice). All the same, it is painful to register the indignity and fear that border these pages, like the black band on a Victorian mourning card. Briggs is predictably wry about such things as his deafness and the way that, these days, his eyebrows grow faster than a beanstalk. But he won\u2019t even try to make a joke of the anxiety, the dark thoughts, the invisibility and the growing forgetfulness that attend him now. They are, after all, the opposite of funny, though I was glad to see him reproduce a fan letter from a little girl that I saw in his loo when I interviewed him many years ago: \u201cMichelle keeps on saying you\u2019re dead,\u201d it reads. And then there is the past, the way the years concertina. What is it about old age \u2013 he is now 85 \u2013 that has a man thinking of his childhood when so much has happened since? Again, he traces the stories: here are his maiden aunts, who were so kind to him; here is his father, who kept a box of Rennies by his bed. You sense his weariness. Time for Lights Out is far heavier on words than on pictures; where once there would have been a cartoon strip, there are now little half-poems, sometimes even photographs. Thanks to this, it can feel effortful. But there is a certain clemency here, too: a self-forgiveness. Above a quotation from DH Lawrence about how hard it is to die \u2013 \u201cBe careful, then, and be gentle about death\u201d \u2013 Briggs has drawn two doors on a landing, one closed and the other slightly ajar. Over the second, there falls a shadow: a beloved genius of storytelling and illustration, his hand not quite on its handle, but very close. \u2022 Time for Lights Out by Raymond Briggs is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a318.99).

Rosanna O\u2019Connor, director of drugs, alcohol, tobacco and justice at PHE, said: \u201cWe continue to keep the evidence under review, including all safety and health concerns reported to the e-cigarette regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). \u201cHowever, smoking kills half of life-long smokers and accounts for almost 220 deaths in England every day. \u201cOur advice remains that while not completely risk free, UK regulated e-cigarettes carry a fraction of the risk of smoked tobacco. \u201cThis view is held by many across the world, including the Royal College of Physicians, Cancer Research UK, the British Medical Association and the National Academy of Sciences in the US.\u201d",

They sang together from aged 10, pulling influences from the western jazz, rock and soul thanks to their mother, who brought them whatever records she could find by artists such as Elvis Presley, Ella Fitzgerald, the Beatles and Cliff Richard. As a result, they said, when it came to genre, \u201cwe did not limit ourselves\u201d. They began working as session vocalists, then released Iya Mi Jowo after they had gone into the studio and demanded a session of their own.

      "bodyText": "Melissa Lucashenko\u2019s novel Too Much Lip has scooped up the top prize at this year\u2019s Queensland Premier\u2019s Literary Awards. The Goorie author can now add the $25,000 Queensland Premier\u2019s award for a work of state significance to her accolades, following her Miles Franklin win in June this year. The award was announced along with 15 others at a ceremony at the State Library of Queensland on Tuesday night. Too Much Lip follows protagonist Kerry Salter as she heads to her home town in rural New South Wales on a stolen motorbike to see her grandfather before he dies. Judges described the novel as \u201can original, contemporary and ambitious work\u201d that \u201ccrackles with energy\u201d. \u201cWritten with insight and humour this is gritty and clever storytelling which tackles serious issues and gives voice to those often silenced and marginalised,\u201d they said. Lucashenko told Guardian Australia in July that the novel was \u201crisky\u201d as it \u201cspeak[s] truth to power\u201d in its portrayal of the working class \u2013 particularly the Indigenous working class. Too Much Lip was shortlisted alongside Trent Dalton\u2019s bestselling debut Boy Swallows Universe, Wintering by Krissy Kneen, Meditations with Passing Water by Jake Goetz and The Night Dragon by Matthew Condon. Although Lucashenko\u2019s novel won the top prize for a \u201cwork of State Significance\u201d, it came second to Carrie Tiffany\u2019s Exploded View in the prize for fiction. Judges said Tiffany\u2019s work was \u201can exquisite yet devastating rendering of a broken family\u201d in which \u201cevery word is searing and honest.\u201d Other shortlisted novels were Bodies of Men by Nigel Featherstone, Daughter of Bad Times by Rohan Wilson, and Kristina Olsson\u2019s imaginative reworking of the construction of the Sydney Opera House, Shell. Mary Hoban\u2019s \u201cgripping\u201d biography of the life of colonial-era Tasmanian woman Julia Sorell Arnold, An Unconventional Wife, won both the award for non-fiction and the award for history, worth $15,000 and $10,000 each. Adani, Following Its Dirty Footsteps: A Personal Story by Lindsay Simpson took out the people\u2019s choice award.

Van Neerven won the David Unaipon award for unpublished Indigenous writers as part of the Queensland literary awards in 2013, the Indigenous writers prize in the NSW premier\u2019s literary awards in 2016 and was shortlisted for the Stella prize in 2015. Meanwhile, Jeffery was described as having \u201ca sharp ear for the musicality of language\u201d. Three of the 15 winners announced on Tuesday were Indigenous writers, with Alison Whittaker\u2019s collection, Blakwork, taking out the prize for poetry. Prizes for digital literature, children\u2019s and young adult literature, and emerging writers were also awarded. State librarian and CEO Vicki McDonald said in a statement on Tuesday that the calibre of entries was \u201cextremely high\u201d. The awards offered a total prize pool of $253,500 and have been supported by the Queensland government since 2015, after being controversially scrapped by premier Campbell Newman in 2012 and kept aloft by a coalition of literary figures in the Queensland community.",

An estimates spillover hearing on Monday heard his department had prepared a draft that did not include the highly inflated figures and the minister representing him at the hearing refused to answer questions about where they came from. Taylor, the minister for energy and emissions reduction, will also be under pressure over the grasslands saga as new answers to questions on notice revealed the department had not been contacted by the unnamed Yass farmer that Taylor says prompted him to seek meetings with the environment department over the grasslands listing. Parliament resumes on 25 November. A special estimates hearing on Monday heard that the minister\u2019s department provided a draft letter to the minister\u2019s office responding to a letter from Clover Moore, the lord mayor of Sydney, which she sent in July. \u201cThe draft letter is very different to the final letter to the lord mayor. The department\u2019s draft letter provided to the minister\u2019s office contained no reference to the City of Sydney\u2019s travel expenditure,\u201d said Mark Butler, the opposition\u2019s energy spokesman. \u201cThe department confirmed that after it provided this draft response, Angus Taylor\u2019s office did not request any further information or drafts. It was also confirmed that the department was not asked to verify any additional information in the version of the letter signed by Angus Taylor which contained the doctored figures.\u201d Labor senator Kristina Keneally repeatedly asked Simon Birmingham, who was representing Taylor, where the figures had come from and whether the prime minister\u2019s office had been involved. In response, Birmingham repeatedly read out Taylor\u2019s statement to parliament which claimed there were different versions of the document on the City of Sydney\u2019s website. This appears to refer to the two documents online \u2013 the PDF and word versions \u2013 which show minor formatting differences but do not contain the different figures. Keneally said the National Library\u2019s Trove archive of websites showed that in April 2019 the same version of both documents was online as is present today. \u201cOnly Minister Taylor has seen this version on the City of Sydney\u2019s website,\u201d she said, adding that Taylor\u2019s explanation amounted to saying that the website had been changed and then changed back. \u201cDid Godwin Grech bring it to him? Fairies from the bottom of the garden?\u201d she said referring to an incident of forged documents which tripped up former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. \u201cAngus Taylor needs to come clean about exactly how these doctored figures turned up in a letter signed by him because we have yet to see a public document that confirms his version of events,\u201d Butler said. Meanwhile the environment department replied to questions on notice that it was never contacted by a farmer near Yass about the listing of critically endangered grasslands that are at the centre of an investigation into a company part-owned by Taylor. Taylor has repeatedly stated he sought a March 2017 meeting with the department to discuss the critically endangered listing of the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands after concerns about the listing were raised with him by farmers in his electorate of Hume. At the time of the meeting, Jam Land Pty Ltd, a company part owned by Taylor and his relatives, was under investigation for the alleged illegal clearing of about 30 hectares of those same grasslands on a property in the NSW Monaro region. In a statement to parliament in July, Taylor said farmers raised concerns about the listing with him in late 2016 and early 2017 and, specifically, that he sought a briefing after he had a conversation with a farmer near Yass on 21 February 2017. The environment department was asked, via written questions to a senate committee investigating Australia\u2019s fauna extinction crisis, if it had ever had any contact with the farmer near Yass in relation to the listing. In responses published this week, it said, \u201cNo.\u201d Asked if any other private farmers had made representations in relation to the grasslands listing, the department said it had received \u201cdetailed questions\u201d from one farmer in 2018, a director of Monaro Farming Systems. Monaro Farming Systems is an organisation that works with the Monaro grazing industry. Until recently, its chair was Richard Taylor \u2013 Angus Taylor\u2019s brother and a director of Jam Land Pty Ltd \u2013 and he is still a director on the board. John Murdoch, the new chairman, said he wrote to the department to ask questions about the grassland listing but he had done so in his capacity as an individual landholder and grazier in the Monaro region. He said the grasslands are not found on his property. \u201cThat was my individual enquiries about interpreting the (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation) Act and the implementation of the actual EPBC listing,\u201d Murdoch said. \u201cI was trying to ask how I would implement it on my land holding.\u201d Murdoch said he had been frustrated because conservation planning had not focused on the \u201cconsiderable threat of weeds\u201d such as African lovegrass. \u201cNo one at state or federal level would acknowledge weeds as a threat in their conservation policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe objectives they were trying to achieve were great. But in trying to achieve it they regulated everything.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It is weird how the little mermaid is called Ariel, isn\u2019t it? She has access to water and a bit of land, but definitely not the sky. No wonder she is frustrated. I have many thoughts like this as I hang upside down, blood rushing to my brain. Despite the fact I am wrapped in and suspended by the thinnest material, I feel safe and my mind is free to roam. Such is the paradox of aerial yoga (Flying Fantastic, three classes for \u00a345,<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.flyingfantastic.co.uk/buy-credits/\" title=\"\">flyingfantastic.co.uk/buy-credits</a>). Restorative and beginner-friendly, it is suitable for people with mobility issues, and also me; it would not be unfair to describe this as yoga in hammocks.</p> <p>Iyengar yoga has long made use of slings to push positions further, but aerial yoga is different \u2013 derived as much from the circus as the subcontinent. Tutor Edel Wigan shows us how to wrap ourselves in large loops of fabric suspended from a rig, and trust them with our weight. It is a bit like trapeze. (Wigan devised her company, Flying Fantastic, with her husband, Chris, when they lived in Argentina \u2013 where circus schools are 10 a penny.) The class starts gently, leaning on ropes, swaying in circles to learn to trust them with our weight. We jump inside and expand the cloth. Farcically, my fabric keeps swinging around so I am facing the back of the class. I have to crane my neck to see the teacher, flailing to spin back around. I look like a buffoon. But I feel incredible.</p> <p>The loops of red fabric act as a hanging seat, hammock and harness, offering the chance to swing, spin or fly. It\u2019s exhilarating. As well as freedom, there is a security to aerialism. Whether looped around one\u2019s arms, or enveloping us completely, the fabric \u201chas always got you\u201d, as Wigan says. One can do yoga poses that would be too challenging for a novice in another setting, pulling oneself up into a vertical sit-up, or being gathered into an assisted toe-touch, or back-bend. A weightless shoulder-stand is relatively easy, especially with one\u2019s entire body supported. It feels glorious, too, akin to being a silkworm in its cocoon. Isn\u2019t this what we all want? A chance to let go of adult cares and simply pupate? When we come to the shavasana, lying horizontal and completely enveloped in material, it is the most peaceful floating experience imaginable outside of a Trainspotting heroin sequence.</p> <p>Speaking of which, my experience isn\u2019t all nirvana. After the class, I feel ropey. I mumble an excuse and make my way downstairs, past people I barely see. My brain is on rollerskates. I kneel down at the nearest bin and vomit copiously. A roaring rain dance of half-digested banana, in front of a waiting class of trapeze students. As I upchuck my guts, one of the students sadly remarks: \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday.\u201d I attempt to wish her the best, but all that leaves my moaning hole is a fleck of quiche.</p> <p>I can\u2019t really blame the class. Taking pictures for this column requires me to swing around upside down for inadvisably large amounts of time. (In the class, everyone works to their ability, taking breaks whenever needed.) I didn\u2019t eat a proper breakfast, and am still recovering from a cold. I also hate to get up before 7am. And to be honest, my pants were too tight. So: the media, physical frailty and bad pants. It\u2019s a perfect storm.</p> <p>Recovering at home, I stop thinking about the tsunami of vomit and remember the joy of the silken cocoon. The class was thrilling: a way of moving I had never known, or known I could try. (UK circus schools are geared to professional qualifications more than recreation, which seems ironic.) For me, the yoga element was neither here nor there. And anyone of delicate constitution should swing with caution. But how often do our bodies get to experience a different relationship to gravity? I felt sick watching the film Gravity, too, but it was still an amazing experience. I feel leaden on the ground \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s time to fly again. Darling, it is better, flying unfettered! But I might eat two bananas next time.</p> <h2><strong>Birthday blues. And yellows</strong></h2> <p>Apologies to the student whose joyeux anniversaire I ruined. Given a choice, I\u2019d rather have vomited in the recycling bin \u2013 proof we don\u2019t always get what we want.</p> <h2><strong>Wellness or hellness?</strong><br></h2> <p>Wellness, hellness, wellness again? Swings and roundabouts. <strong>4/5</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "It is weird how the little mermaid is called Ariel, isn\u2019t it? She has access to water and a bit of land, but definitely not the sky. No wonder she is frustrated. I have many thoughts like this as I hang upside down, blood rushing to my brain. Despite the fact I am wrapped in and suspended by the thinnest material, I feel safe and my mind is free to roam. Such is the paradox of aerial yoga (Flying Fantastic, three classes for \u00a345, flyingfantastic.co.uk/buy-credits). Restorative and beginner-friendly, it is suitable for people with mobility issues, and also me; it would not be unfair to describe this as yoga in hammocks. Iyengar yoga has long made use of slings to push positions further, but aerial yoga is different \u2013 derived as much from the circus as the subcontinent. Tutor Edel Wigan shows us how to wrap ourselves in large loops of fabric suspended from a rig, and trust them with our weight. It is a bit like trapeze. (Wigan devised her company, Flying Fantastic, with her husband, Chris, when they lived in Argentina \u2013 where circus schools are 10 a penny.) The class starts gently, leaning on ropes, swaying in circles to learn to trust them with our weight. We jump inside and expand the cloth. Farcically, my fabric keeps swinging around so I am facing the back of the class. I have to crane my neck to see the teacher, flailing to spin back around. I look like a buffoon. But I feel incredible. The loops of red fabric act as a hanging seat, hammock and harness, offering the chance to swing, spin or fly. It\u2019s exhilarating. As well as freedom, there is a security to aerialism. Whether looped around one\u2019s arms, or enveloping us completely, the fabric \u201chas always got you\u201d, as Wigan says. One can do yoga poses that would be too challenging for a novice in another setting, pulling oneself up into a vertical sit-up, or being gathered into an assisted toe-touch, or back-bend. A weightless shoulder-stand is relatively easy, especially with one\u2019s entire body supported. It feels glorious, too, akin to being a silkworm in its cocoon. Isn\u2019t this what we all want? A chance to let go of adult cares and simply pupate? When we come to the shavasana, lying horizontal and completely enveloped in material, it is the most peaceful floating experience imaginable outside of a Trainspotting heroin sequence. Speaking of which, my experience isn\u2019t all nirvana. After the class, I feel ropey. I mumble an excuse and make my way downstairs, past people I barely see. My brain is on rollerskates. I kneel down at the nearest bin and vomit copiously. A roaring rain dance of half-digested banana, in front of a waiting class of trapeze students. As I upchuck my guts, one of the students sadly remarks: \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday.\u201d I attempt to wish her the best, but all that leaves my moaning hole is a fleck of quiche. I can\u2019t really blame the class. Taking pictures for this column requires me to swing around upside down for inadvisably large amounts of time. (In the class, everyone works to their ability, taking breaks whenever needed.) I didn\u2019t eat a proper breakfast, and am still recovering from a cold. I also hate to get up before 7am. And to be honest, my pants were too tight. So: the media, physical frailty and bad pants. It\u2019s a perfect storm. Recovering at home, I stop thinking about the tsunami of vomit and remember the joy of the silken cocoon. The class was thrilling: a way of moving I had never known, or known I could try. (UK circus schools are geared to professional qualifications more than recreation, which seems ironic.) For me, the yoga element was neither here nor there. And anyone of delicate constitution should swing with caution. But how often do our bodies get to experience a different relationship to gravity? I felt sick watching the film Gravity, too, but it was still an amazing experience. I feel leaden on the ground \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s time to fly again. Darling, it is better, flying unfettered! But I might eat two bananas next time. Birthday blues. And yellows Apologies to the student whose joyeux anniversaire I ruined. Given a choice, I\u2019d rather have vomited in the recycling bin \u2013 proof we don\u2019t always get what we want. Wellness or hellness? Wellness, hellness, wellness again? Swings and roundabouts. 4/5",

Romero himself has been somewhat estranged from shooters since releasing the widely panned Daikatana in 2000.

His eyes brighten when I start talking about demons and power-ups.</p> <p>Modern shooters are too close to fantasy role-playing games in how they shower you with new weapons from battle to battle, Romero suggests. This abundance of loot \u2013 which reflects how blockbuster games generally have become Netflix-style services, defined by an unrelenting roll-out of \u201ccontent\u201d \u2013 means you spend as much time comparing guns in menus as savouring their capabilities. It encourages you to think of each gun as essentially disposable, like an obsolete make of smartphone. \u201cThe more weapons you throw in there, the more you\u2019re playing an inventory game.\u201d</p> <p>Romero contrasts this to the sparing design of the original Doom, which launched in 1993 with a grand total of eight guns. \u201cFor Doom, it was really important that every time you got a new weapon, it never made any previous weapons useless. That was a critical design characteristic. We\u2019re going to add a new thing that can\u2019t negate anything that came before. So how do you get the chaingun and not cancel out the pistol? It\u2019s to do with how much ammo it eats, and how inaccurate it is over distance \u2013 the pistol eats less ammo and is extremely accurate at a distance.\u201d</p> <p>Doom is also a game that knows how to keep a secret. It isn\u2019t just a firefight simulator but a treacherous, vaguely avant-garde work of 3D architecture. Its levels are mazes of hidden rooms and camouflaged doors that screech open behind you \u2013 sometimes revealing a pile of ammunition, sometimes disgorging enemies into areas you\u2019ve cleared. Today\u2019s shooters set less store by secret spaces, Romero says, because they cost so much to make. Where Wolfenstein 3D was created by a dozen people in a matter of months, the likes of this year\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is the work of hundreds, and cost tens of millions of dollars. This expense discourages designers from adding anything that isn\u2019t absolutely essential.</p> <p>Romero noticed this trend while designing 1996\u2019s Quake, which featured more elaborate, polygon-based environments than Doom with richer, naturalistic lighting. \u201cDoom was easy to make secret rooms for. You just drew a few lines and put a door there. It\u2019s not even a minute. With Quake, it was a lot more work, because in Quake, every single room was made up of six planes \u2013 you have to put the floor in, the back wall, the ceiling. You have to add the light in and make sure it\u2019s the right brightness, that it hits each corner of the room. It took a lot more work to build Quake levels, and it\u2019s got worse from there. And because it takes so much longer, people just don\u2019t want to do secret areas, because how many people are going to see them?\u201d</p> <p>Financial pressures aside, the decline of secret rooms in shooters also reflects the growing popularity of realistic settings where such spatial intrigues might look out of place. Even when set in make-believe places, today\u2019s shooters favour a gritty, grounded aesthetic that leaves less room for experimental design. \u201cEvery shooter takes place in the world somewhere,\u201d Romero says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing crazy, it\u2019s not like going to Xen in Half-Life. They always look really nice, but the abstract level style \u2013 I don\u2019t see that around as much.\u201d</p> <p>In setting their sights on realism, shooters have opened themselves up like never before to criticism of the politics of their representations. Doom was reviled in the press for glamorising violence, but its cartoon gore seems harmless alongside the apparent <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-28-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-accused-of-rewriting-history-to-blame-russia-for-controversial-us-attacks\">historical revisionism</a> of Call of Duty in particular. The shooter will always be gaming\u2019s most controversial genre, Romero comments. \u201cIt\u2019s all about guns, and guns are the things that are killing everybody in the United States. It\u2019s definitely the hot button genre. Other games like League of Legends or strategy sims, they\u2019ll never be as controversial, because it\u2019s not the same feeling. You\u2019re not shooting people dead in first-person.\u201d</p> <p>If big budget game design has drifted away from Doom, the game\u2019s many modders have kept the old id Software spirit alive. Fans have released thousands of custom Doom levels since 1993, ranging from unlicensed Batman adaptations to The Adventures of Square, which swaps Doom\u2019s squalor for eye-popping rainbow hues. Romero has contributed a few mods of his own. Earlier this year he released Sigil, an unofficial Doom epilogue which ranks among his finest creations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e05e29b140a68cc8152a52f3b9e72cab4040507d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e05e29b140a68cc8152a52f3b9e72cab4040507d/129_0_1791_1075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sigil \u2013 John Romero\u2019s epilogue to Doom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sigil ...

The Eye is now a switch \u2013 you can shoot it to activate mechanisms such as secret doors and sunken bridges. As you move from level to level, the Eye becomes harder and harder to discover: finding it often means resisting Romero\u2019s sneaky efforts to lure you in a particular direction. This encourages you to think about Sigil not just as a player, but as a fellow game designer.</p> <p>For Romero, Sigil demonstrates that the shooters of the 90s aren\u2019t just worth returning to, but worth building on \u2013 an idea borne out by recent, retro-themed shooters like DUSK and Amid Evil, which offer up their own, devilish twists on Doom and Quake. \u201cStuff that could have been done 25 years ago but was never thought of, I did with Sigil.

      "body": "<p>Sandi Toksvig\u2019s activism began early. At her Catholic primary school in Denmark, the nuns decreed that during bad weather, only the boys were allowed to play outside. Outraged, six-year-old Toksvig led a strike; the girls made posters and refused to go to lessons until they were allowed equal access to the playground. Faced with such militancy, the mother superior burst into tears, but the girls got their way. \u201cI was filled with fury,\u201d Toksvig relates, \u201ca fury about any injustice which has never really left me.\u201d</p> <p>The celebrity memoir is a format that requires constant reinvention these days, often appearing in the guise of a self-help book or A-Z rather than the usual chronological series of anecdotes and Toksvig, who balks at the idea of \u201ccelebrity\u201d, has found a fittingly idiosyncratic vehicle for her reflections on her life and career. Quite literally: it\u2019s the number 12 bus, which winds through London from her family home in Dulwich to her professional home of Broadcasting House at Oxford Circus, and she uses the journey and the vignettes of London life it offers as a jumping-off point for stories \u2013 her own and those of forgotten characters such as Lucy Wanmer, the \u201cLittle Woman of Peckham\u201d, a 0.76-metre (2ft 6in) schoolmistress who was exhibited as a curiosity (as a short woman constantly having to navigate a world designed for tall men, Toksvig feels some affinity) or Una Marson, a Jamaican writer and activist who was the first black female programmer at the BBC.</p> <p>\u201cI love passion perhaps more than anything,\u201d she says, in praise of a man who has set up a website to commemorate <a href=\"http://www.routebus537.veryold.net/kennedystribute.html\" title=\"\">Kennedy\u2019s sausages,</a> once a great export of Peckham: \u201cEven if it\u2019s just for sausages it is a fine thing.\u201d Toksvig comes across as a passionate enthusiast for many things: the theatre (early jobs included sweeping the stage and working on the electrics crew just to be in the building), for history, for her beloved father and for equality. She recalls recording a pilot episode as a potential host of <em>Have I Got News for You</em> in 1990. Angus Deayton also recorded one and afterwards she was told: \u201cWe preferred yours, Sandi, but everyone has agreed you can\u2019t have a woman in charge of making fun of the news.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/dec/23/sandi-toksvig-radar-cultural-highlights-sondheim-hygge\">On my radar: Sandi Toksvig\u2019s cultural highlights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If such overt prejudice seems shocking now, it\u2019s nothing compared with what she had to endure when the <em>Mail</em> decided to \u201cout\u201d her in 1994 as living with her partner and raising the three children that they had by donor. Toksvig took control of the narrative by writing a pre-emptive piece for a rival paper, but the campaign of hate mail and death threats that followed meant the family had to go into hiding and the stress contributed to the end of the relationship.</p> <p>It seems extraordinary that a TV personality\u2019s sexuality could have been regarded as such a scandal a mere 25 years ago and Toksvig appears to have mixed feelings about discussing that part of her life, \u201cpossibly the least interesting thing about me\u201d. There\u2019s an understandable weariness about being \u201cdescribed as a \u2018lesbian broadcaster\u2019 when I\u2019m\u2026 making jokes about the European Union\u201d, but she also understands the importance of her visibility.</p> <p>She writes with candour about how \u201clost and frightened\u201d she felt as a young woman, first when she was almost thrown out of her Cambridge college for having her girlfriend to stay in her room, and later, when she was put on antidepressants after the end of her first relationship, when all she really needed was reassurance and the knowledge that she was not alone.</p> <p>No one who has heard Toksvig speak will be surprised to find a bedrock of compassion and righteous anger underpinning the book. She rails against the airbrushing of women from history and talks about her reasons for co-founding the <a href=\"https://www.womensequality.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s Equality party</a> and her optimism for change, despite occasionally despairing at the next generation of feminists. When she hears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lena-dunham\" title=\"\">Lena Dunham</a> say being wolf-whistled by a man sometimes makes her feel \u201cvalidated\u201d, Toksvig splutters: \u201cValidated? What are we? Car park tickets?\u201d</p> <p>But there are plenty of funny stories too, from behind-the-scenes <em>Bake Off</em> gossip to the time she spoke at a charity do in Downing Street and Samantha Cameron took her aside afterwards to say, kindly: \u201cYou speak very well. You should think about doing it for a living.\u201d</p> <p><em>Between </em><em>the Stops</em> is like browsing through a well-stocked museum of curiosities with a wise and kind guide; it\u2019s part celebration, part confession, part call to arms and wholly entertaining. Don\u2019t read it on the bus though \u2013 it will make you miss your stop.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Between the Stops: The View of My Life from the Top of the Number 12 Bus</em> by Sandi Toksvig is published by Virago (\u00a320).

Quite literally: it\u2019s the number 12 bus, which winds through London from her family home in Dulwich to her professional home of Broadcasting House at Oxford Circus, and she uses the journey and the vignettes of London life it offers as a jumping-off point for stories \u2013 her own and those of forgotten characters such as Lucy Wanmer, the \u201cLittle Woman of Peckham\u201d, a 0.76-metre (2ft 6in) schoolmistress who was exhibited as a curiosity (as a short woman constantly having to navigate a world designed for tall men, Toksvig feels some affinity) or Una Marson, a Jamaican writer and activist who was the first black female programmer at the BBC. \u201cI love passion perhaps more than anything,\u201d she says, in praise of a man who has set up a website to commemorate Kennedy\u2019s sausages, once a great export of Peckham: \u201cEven if it\u2019s just for sausages it is a fine thing.\u201d Toksvig comes across as a passionate enthusiast for many things: the theatre (early jobs included sweeping the stage and working on the electrics crew just to be in the building), for history, for her beloved father and for equality. She recalls recording a pilot episode as a potential host of Have I Got News for You in 1990. Angus Deayton also recorded one and afterwards she was told: \u201cWe preferred yours, Sandi, but everyone has agreed you can\u2019t have a woman in charge of making fun of the news.\u201d If such overt prejudice seems shocking now, it\u2019s nothing compared with what she had to endure when the Mail decided to \u201cout\u201d her in 1994 as living with her partner and raising the three children that they had by donor. Toksvig took control of the narrative by writing a pre-emptive piece for a rival paper, but the campaign of hate mail and death threats that followed meant the family had to go into hiding and the stress contributed to the end of the relationship. It seems extraordinary that a TV personality\u2019s sexuality could have been regarded as such a scandal a mere 25 years ago and Toksvig appears to have mixed feelings about discussing that part of her life, \u201cpossibly the least interesting thing about me\u201d. There\u2019s an understandable weariness about being \u201cdescribed as a \u2018lesbian broadcaster\u2019 when I\u2019m\u2026 making jokes about the European Union\u201d, but she also understands the importance of her visibility. She writes with candour about how \u201clost and frightened\u201d she felt as a young woman, first when she was almost thrown out of her Cambridge college for having her girlfriend to stay in her room, and later, when she was put on antidepressants after the end of her first relationship, when all she really needed was reassurance and the knowledge that she was not alone. No one who has heard Toksvig speak will be surprised to find a bedrock of compassion and righteous anger underpinning the book. She rails against the airbrushing of women from history and talks about her reasons for co-founding the Women\u2019s Equality party and her optimism for change, despite occasionally despairing at the next generation of feminists. When she hears Lena Dunham say being wolf-whistled by a man sometimes makes her feel \u201cvalidated\u201d, Toksvig splutters: \u201cValidated? What are we? Car park tickets?\u201d But there are plenty of funny stories too, from behind-the-scenes Bake Off gossip to the time she spoke at a charity do in Downing Street and Samantha Cameron took her aside afterwards to say, kindly: \u201cYou speak very well. You should think about doing it for a living.\u201d Between the Stops is like browsing through a well-stocked museum of curiosities with a wise and kind guide; it\u2019s part celebration, part confession, part call to arms and wholly entertaining. Don\u2019t read it on the bus though \u2013 it will make you miss your stop. \u2022 Between the Stops: The View of My Life from the Top of the Number 12 Bus by Sandi Toksvig is published by Virago (\u00a320).

One year away from a global deadline to widen access to modern forms of family planning, such services are accessible to less than half of the women that policy makers hoped to reach. The report by the Family Planning partnership was released ahead of a summit in Nairobi this week, where governments are expected to make further pledges on family planning, and other reproductive health spending. Around 314 million women and girls are now using modern contraception, according to the study, which is focused on 69 low-income countries and uses statistics from national surveys, health services and UN population data. The report found that 53 million women have begun using contraceptives since 2012 \u2013 far fewer than the 120 million women experts had hoped to reach by 2020. Jason Bremner, director of data and performance management for Family Planning 2020, said that whether or not such global targets are met is determined by the progress made in a handful of countries with high populations. \u201cThere are around 900 million women of reproductive age across the 69 countries, but those 900 million women are not evenly distributed across the 69 countries,\u201d he said.

Their requests for extensions were repeatedly denied.</p> <p>In June, Trump held a private meeting with Alaska\u2019s governor, Mike Dunleavy, on Air Force One.

      "bodyText": "Tribal leaders, fishermen and environmentalists from Alaska will testify before Congress on Wednesday in an effort to save America\u2019s biggest national forest \u2013 the latest battle against the Trump administration\u2019s assault on environmental protections. The Tongass national forest, one of the world\u2019s last intact temperate rainforests which plays a crucial role in fighting the climate crisis, is under threat of logging as Alaska seeks exemption from the Roadless Rule, which protects millions of acres of pristine forests across the US. The Tongass is considered the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of the national forest system, sequestering huge amounts of carbon dioxide to keep the greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere. The Roadless Rule prevents mass clearcutting of trees in undeveloped forested areas and is seen as one of the most broadly supported environmental protections in the US. Donald Trump has reportedly intervened in the Alaska case, raising fears that other states with strong extractive industry lobbying machines will seek to fast-track similar exemptions without properly consulting communities on the impact that felling trees in wilderness areas will have. \u201cThere are indications that many other states are watching to see what happens with Alaska, which has shown us how this administration is blindly following whatever industry, corporations and lobbyists want without thinking about future generations,\u201d said Blaine Miller-McFeeley, senior legislative representative at the legal not-for-profit Earthjustice. Wednesday\u2019s hearing by the natural resources subcommittee on national parks, forests and public land (NPFPL) will hear evidence on the potentially devastating consequences for the Tongass and its people. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here for thousands of years. These are our lands and we depend on the Tongass for food security,\u201d Joel Jackson, 63, president of the organized village of Kake, said. \u201cTribes everywhere are worried and watching very closely at what they\u2019re trying to do in Alaska,\u201d added Jackson, who will testify. \u201cTourism and commercial fishing run this region economically, not timber, which is a pathetically small sector,\u201d said Lance Preston, 47, a fisherman and board member of the Seafood Producers Cooperative in Sitka. \u201cThe salmon already faces challenges from ocean acidification and warming \u2026 A very small minority stands to gain economically by being very irresponsible.\u201d Stretching 16m acres over 500 miles, the Tongass is unique in its size and biodiversity, with thousands of islands, waterways, glacial fjords and green valleys flanked by rugged mountains and sprawling forests of old-growth cedar, spruce and hemlock trees. It is home to myriad species including wild Pacific salmon, brown bears, wolves, Sitka black-tailed deer and bald eagles, and attracts more than a million visitors annually. The Roadless Rule was adopted during the Clinton administration after an extensive public consultation, in which 96% of the 1 million participants nationwide supported protection for unspoiled forests. Since then Alaska has fought the regulation, but its efforts to roll back the protection have been repeatedly thwarted in Congress and the courts. Then, the state\u2019s petition for an exemption was granted by the Department of Agriculture in August 2018 without consulting any tribal nations. The state was given $2m in federal funds by the Forest Service (FS) to help facilitate dialogue about six potential outcomes ranging from no change to full exemption. At least 10% of this money was given to the Alaska Forest Association \u2013 a timber industry group \u2013 to aid their participation in the process, according to documents obtained by KTOO. The Angoon Cooperative Association, Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes, Hoonah Indian Association, Hydaburg Cooperative Association, organized village of Kake and organized village of Kasaan \u2013 which all have roots in the Tongass dating back thousands of years \u2013 were belatedly offered a seat at the table as \u201ccooperating agencies\u201d alongside the state in the review process. The tribes say they were not given any financial support leaving them scrambling to make sense of complex long document. Their requests for extensions were repeatedly denied. In June, Trump held a private meeting with Alaska\u2019s governor, Mike Dunleavy, on Air Force One. Shortly after, Trump instructed the agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, to grant a full exemption, according to the Washington Post. Last month, a full exemption, opening the door for the logging industry to bulldoze roads and clearcut trees over 9m acres, was recommended in the draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In response, tribal leaders wrote to Perdue condemning the federal government\u2019s rushed and unfair handling of the proposed exemption, which they said \u201crepresents the most controversial and potentially destructive assault on our way of life to date\u201d. In the Tongass, the tribes mostly live on isolated islands, relying on salmon fishing, deer, moose, grouse and berries. This traditional diet remains extremely important amid rising food prices and cuts to ferry services. \u201cAll communities deserve to have access to the resources they rely on for subsistence, but this administration has gone out of its way to change the rules for their friends who seek to profit off those resources,\u201d said the New Mexico congresswoman Deb Haaland, chair of the NPFPL. In May, fellow committee member and Arizona congressman Ruben Gallego, and the Washington senator Maria Cantwell, senior member of the Senate energy and natural resources committee, introduced legislation to codify the Roadless Rule in order to permanently protect millions of acres of pristine national forests. The 2019 Roadless Area Conservation Act would prevent state exemptions to the rule, which nationwide protects habitats for 1,600 threatened or endangered species, reduces wildfire risk and supplies clean drinking water to 60 million Americans and 350 communities across the US. \u201cThe administration continues to try to solve 21st-century problems with 19th-century thinking, trying to extract a relatively small amount from our few remaining pristine natural areas,\u201d said Cantwell. Nationally, public support for the Roadless Rule remains strong: a Pew poll in March of this year found three-quarters of respondents want protections to remain in place. Locally, the vast majority of south-east Alaska\u2019s 32 native and white communities also support the current roadless protection. But the Alaska congressman Don Young, the Republican leader of the NPFPL, believes the Roadless Rule has been a \u201cdisaster\u201d for his home state. He has been working closely with Trump, senior White House staff and the rest of the Alaska delegation to secure an exemption. \u201cCongressman Young believes an exemption is needed to not only boost the economy of south-east Alaska, but to bolster the long-term health of the Tongass national forest by promoting active resource management,\u201d a spokesperson said. The rule already allows for individual exemptions: in Alaska, every single request for the Tongass to date \u2013 more than 50 \u2013 for projects such as mines and dams has been approved. Dunleavy\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment, but has previously blamed the rule for destroying logging and thousands of jobs. The timber industry contributes less than 1% to the south-east Alaska economy, compared with 25% by the fishing and tourism industries combined. Tongass waterways produce 80% of the commercial salmon annually harvested from south-east Alaska, valued at $60m. The FS has lost almost $600m on Tongass timber sales over the last 20 years, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. The FS is legally obliged to take into account public opinion before making its final decision, which is expected in mid-2020. If it is fully repealed as Alaskan Republicans want, 5m acres of the Chugach national forest, which is second only to the Tongass in roadless acreage, could also be threatened, according to the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. In both forests, vital food sources and Native cultural and sacred sites are at risk. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have wild food to eat, we would be starving right now. We are living in virtual poverty because of the systems of government,\u201d said Wanda Culp, a Tlingit advocate for the Tongass in Hoonah. \u201cThe Roadless Rule is just the latest example of how we jump through hoops but get nowhere \u2013 there is no due process for indigenous communities. We are nuisance communities standing in the way of industry profits.\u201d",

Top stories Boris Johnson went on the attack after a string of Conservative gaffes overshadowed the start of his election campaign, declaring his intention to get his \u201coven-ready\u201d Brexit deal through parliament quickly.

The business minister Kwasi Kwarteng insisted later that the prime minister was correct, despite the deal apparently requiring customs declarations for all goods shipped from Northern Ireland to Britain. The Conservatives also came under heavy fire for doctoring footage of Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary,making it appear as if was unable to answer a question on Labour\u2019s Brexit position, when in reality he provided a lengthy answer. But the Tories received a big boost when Nigel Farage said his Brexit party would not contest 317 Tory-won seats to avoid splitting the leave vote after Johnson committed to exiting the EU by 2020 \u2013 see below \u2013 and pursuing a Canada-style trade deal. Many observers saw this as a possible gamechanger, although the polling guru Prof Sir John Curtice told the BBC its likely impact should not be exaggerated. It might, though, wipe out any potential Liberal Democrat advances from a Lib Dem, Plaid Cymru and Green pro-remain pact, Curtice said. More good news for the Tories came with the release of a study revealing that more than 1 million low-income, mainly leave-supporting voters who did not vote in 2017 are planning to do so this time, potentially affecting results in at least 40 seats.

And Labour promised \u201cmanaged migration\u201d for EU nationals in the event Brexit happened, without saying how it would manage it. What next But can Johnson take Britain out of the EU by the end of 2020? Lest anyone forget, what has happened thus far on Brexit is merely the exit deal: the hors d\u2019oeuvre. Assuming the agreement is eventually passed by parliament \u2013 a process that could take up more than a month \u2013 and the UK subsequently leaves the EU by 31 January, there remains a deal on the future relationship to be negotiated.

It is almost inconceivable that all this could be achieved by the end of 2020. Best of the rest UK avoids recession but Brexit uncertainty damages growth.

It\u2019s an obvious attempt to deflect the conversation away from climate change.\u201d</p> \n<p>A former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, Greg Mullins, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/this-is-not-normal-what-s-different-about-the-nsw-mega-fires-20191110-p5395e.html\">has written this week</a> that the hotter and drier conditions, and the higher fire danger ratings, were preventing agencies from carrying out prescribed burning.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cBlaming \u2018greenies\u2019 for stopping these important measures is a familiar, populist, but basically untrue claim.\u201d</p> \n<h2>What is hazard reduction?</h2> \n<p>Preparations for bushfire season are done outside the most dangerous periods using a suite of methods known as hazard reduction.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe fuel is the hazard, so it\u2019s about reducing that fuel load to diminish the intensity of a subsequent wildfire,\u201d Bradstock says.</p> \n<p>Methods include prescribed burning where authorities identify at-risk areas close to developments, or in areas known for being sites where large fires ignite, and \u201creduce the load\u201d with controlled burning.</p> \n<p>In some areas, hazard reduction is carried out by removing trees and vegetation.</p> \n<p>Another method is to create fuel breaks, also known as fire breaks, where trees are cleared to prevent the spread of a fire to protect developments and infrastructure. This is also done routinely around power lines.</p> \n<p>It is activities like this which Joyce claims are being suppressed by bureaucracy.</p> \n<h2>Is there a drop in hazard reduction?</h2> \n<p>A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment has told Guardian Australia that the National Parks and Wildlife Service carried out hazard reduction activities across more than 139,000ha in 2018 and 2019.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/12/this-is-our-new-normal-egional-mayors-on-bushfires-and-climate-change\">'This is our new normal': regional mayors on bushfires and climate change | Claire Pontin and Dominic King</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The NPWS had a hazard reduction target to treat 680,000ha of parks and reserves in the five years from 2011, which the spokesperson said it had exceeded.</p> \n<p>The spokesperson added: \u201cHazard reduction is just one way of preparing for bushfires \u2013 it doesn\u2019t remove the threat of fire.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bradstock says: \u201cIn New South Wales, hazard reduction work is governed by policies that are set by coordinating committee chaired by the Rural Fire Service. They bring together all players \u2013 with representatives from farmers, environment groups and governments.</p> \n<p>\u201cHazard reduction work has increased because of increased funding to the RFS and to national parks. There has been more carried out in recent years than in previous decades.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>What about cuts to </strong><strong>staff?</strong></h2> \n<p>The Public Service Association has also attacked the NSW government for what it said was a \u201c35% cut to fire-trained positions\u201d in national parks.</p> \n<p>Its acting general secretary, Troy Wright, said on Tuesday: \u201cIt is the Nationals who hold the purse string. Rather than funding the NPWS properly so that they can undertake strategic reductions they have crippled them with massive budget cuts and devastating restructures.\u201d</p> \n<p>The NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, told Guardian Australia that NPWS had 1,665 full time equivalent staff, a rise of 144 since 2017.

      "bodyText": "Large parts of New South Wales have been in the grip of catastrophic fire weather this week as firefighters desperately work to save homes, properties and lives. But as firefighters try and beat back the bushfires, a familiar blame game began with critics pointing fingers at \u201cgreenies\u201d, claiming they get in the way of hazard reduction efforts that might have reduced the size and scale of the disaster. \u201cThese are very tired and very old conspiracy theories that get a run after most major fires,\u201d says Prof Ross Bradstock, the director of the centre for environmental risk management of bushfires at the University of Wollongong, who has been researching bushfires for 40 years. \u201cThey\u2019ve been extensively dealt with in many inquiries.\u201d So what are the claims? The chief accuser is Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce who says \u201cgreens policy\u201d gets in the way \u201cof many of the practicalities of fighting a fire and managing it\u201d. Among Joyce\u2019s claims, made in several interviews this week, are that Greens policies have made hazard reduction activities more difficult. This claim, just to be clear, is about the policies of a party that has never been in government. Joyce also blamed the Greens for \u201cpaperwork\u201d that made it harder to carry out hazard reduction activities. \u201cIt\u2019s not burning because they burnt off, it\u2019s burning because they didn\u2019t burn off,\u201d Joyce told SkyNews. According to Bradstock, Joyce\u2019s claims are familiar but \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s simply conspiracy stuff. It\u2019s an obvious attempt to deflect the conversation away from climate change.\u201d A former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, Greg Mullins, has written this week that the hotter and drier conditions, and the higher fire danger ratings, were preventing agencies from carrying out prescribed burning. He said: \u201cBlaming \u2018greenies\u2019 for stopping these important measures is a familiar, populist, but basically untrue claim.\u201d What is hazard reduction? Preparations for bushfire season are done outside the most dangerous periods using a suite of methods known as hazard reduction. \u201cThe fuel is the hazard, so it\u2019s about reducing that fuel load to diminish the intensity of a subsequent wildfire,\u201d Bradstock says. Methods include prescribed burning where authorities identify at-risk areas close to developments, or in areas known for being sites where large fires ignite, and \u201creduce the load\u201d with controlled burning. In some areas, hazard reduction is carried out by removing trees and vegetation. Another method is to create fuel breaks, also known as fire breaks, where trees are cleared to prevent the spread of a fire to protect developments and infrastructure. This is also done routinely around power lines. It is activities like this which Joyce claims are being suppressed by bureaucracy. Is there a drop in hazard reduction? A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment has told Guardian Australia that the National Parks and Wildlife Service carried out hazard reduction activities across more than 139,000ha in 2018 and 2019. The NPWS had a hazard reduction target to treat 680,000ha of parks and reserves in the five years from 2011, which the spokesperson said it had exceeded. The spokesperson added: \u201cHazard reduction is just one way of preparing for bushfires \u2013 it doesn\u2019t remove the threat of fire.\u201d Bradstock says: \u201cIn New South Wales, hazard reduction work is governed by policies that are set by coordinating committee chaired by the Rural Fire Service. They bring together all players \u2013 with representatives from farmers, environment groups and governments. \u201cHazard reduction work has increased because of increased funding to the RFS and to national parks. There has been more carried out in recent years than in previous decades.\u201d What about cuts to staff? The Public Service Association has also attacked the NSW government for what it said was a \u201c35% cut to fire-trained positions\u201d in national parks. Its acting general secretary, Troy Wright, said on Tuesday: \u201cIt is the Nationals who hold the purse string. Rather than funding the NPWS properly so that they can undertake strategic reductions they have crippled them with massive budget cuts and devastating restructures.\u201d The NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, told Guardian Australia that NPWS had 1,665 full time equivalent staff, a rise of 144 since 2017. Since 2011, Kean said the NSW government had increased the number of NPWS firefighters from 1,050 to 1,226. Some 400 NPWS staff were out fighting fires. He says: \u201cThey are risking their lives to keep the community safe. Many are fighting fires that are not on park, but to protect people and property.\u201d He says NPWS undertakes 75% of all hazard reduction in the state, adding that last season, NPWS undertook 137,500 hectares of prescribed burns, which was above its target of 135,000 hectares. What can residents do? Bradstock says research \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d demonstrates that creating a 40- to 50-metre fuel break around a house can give it a much greater chance of surviving fires. He says property holders are largely free to carry out these activities themselves without needing to seek permits. \u201cThat vegetation clearance is one of the most effective things to do to mitigate risk.\u201d Bradstock says there is often confusion around the term \u201cbackburning\u201d which is only done while fires are burning and is not considered a hazard reduction activity. A separate fire is lit \u201cback against the wind\u201d to suppress the fuel load in the direction a bushfire is travelling, but firefighters are cautious as these fires can also get out of control when conditions are severe. Does hazard reduction have its limits? There will always be trade-offs between budgets, the amount of hazard reduction that can be carried out, and the environmental and social impacts of burning or removing trees and vegetation. Bradstock says that no fire authority has an infinite budget and he says that in NSW, the hazard reduction work had reached \u201cthe limits of its practical capacity\u201d. \u201cHazard reduction will play a role, but as the weather gets worse, our research shows its effectiveness diminishes and we will have to introduce other means \u2013 maybe more money to clear the edges around developments, but it comes back to return on investment.\u201d He says authorities are also now having to contend with another reality \u2013 that prescribed burning creates smoke, \u201cand we now know that bushfire smoke kills people\u201d. He says hazard reduction burns close to major cities such as Sydney had limits because \u201cwe end up doing fuel reduction to save lives, but it can also be taking lives\u201d though smoke inhalation. \u2022 Open thread: tell us how you\u2019re affected by the fires",

But I\u2019m hoping at least three things will warm this wintry West Country jaunt: cheese, cider and the scenery of Sanditon. Several scenes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/25/sanditon-review-every-period-drama-box-ticked\" title=\"\">ITV\u2019s adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s unfinished \u201cbeaches-and-ballgowns\u201d novel</a> were filmed in Somerset and, arriving on the sandy seafront in Weston-super-Mare, I recognise the green slopes of Brean Down, a regular backdrop.</p> <p>Brean beach, one of Sanditon\u2019s star locations, is a few miles south, and a <a href=\"http://www.breandownway.uk/\" title=\"\">cycle route from Weston opened in 2017</a>. Given the weather, I opt to hop on the <a href=\"https://travelwest.info/bus/services-information/x5-weston-super-mare-uwe\" title=\"\">X5 bus (\u00a37 Avonrider ticket)</a>, heading north to Clevedon, an elegant coastal town whose sea wall and marine lake also featured in the series. As I stroll by the sea, past the 150-year-old pier, rays of late-afternoon sunlight spill out of a rift in the clouds above Steep Holm, one of the distinctive islands in the Bristol Channel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"932dff16737a7ce892c07ec1e51d3872ba250589\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/932dff16737a7ce892c07ec1e51d3872ba250589/0_513_7697_4618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steep Holm Island, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steep Holm Island in the Bristol Channel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Porter Fine Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the way back to Weston, I stop off at Clevedon\u2019s time capsule-like <a href=\"https://www.curzon.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Curzon</a>. Opened in 1912, it is one of the world\u2019s oldest continually running cinemas: its layers of history include a shrapnel-scarred exterior, red-and-gold<strong> </strong>tin panelling and a vintage cafe. The early-19th-century Royal Hotel in Weston, where I\u2019m staying, also takes guests back in time, with wrought-iron balustrades, striped wallpaper and sunset-facing lounges. It was the first hotel built by Sanditon-style speculators when the town became a seaside resort. As I walk to the <a href=\"https://theoldthatchedcottage.com\" title=\"\">Old Thatched Cottage</a> for supper with a friend who lives locally, the wet beach glows in the setting sun like molten lava.</p> <p>Next morning, I catch the <a href=\"https://www.firstgroup.com/uploads/maps/Weston_Service_126_web.pdf\" title=\"\">126 bus</a> from Marine Parade through the misty Mendip hills to <a href=\"https://www.cheddargorge.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cheddar Gorge</a> (rover ticket \u00a37). The autumnal gorge is quieter than in tourist-choked summer. I walk beside the swollen River Yeo and, alone, through ancient, dripping caves (online adult ticket \u00a316.95, 5-15s \u00a312.70). In one cavern, huge cloth-bound rounds of cheese are maturing. Afterwards, I visit the <a href=\"https://www.cheddaronline.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cheddar Gorge Cheese company</a>, which made them (admission \u00a32), and watch the afternoon\u2019s whey-draining, curd-chopping and turning \u2013 \u201ccheddaring\u201d \u2013 before taking some strong cheese straws up the 274 steps of <a href=\"https://www.cheddargorge.co.uk/explorer/jacobs-ladder-and-lookout-tower\" title=\"\">Jacob\u2019s Ladder</a> for a picnic at Pulpit rock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22662b2a5c3b7c534af4e8c20ff430fd9f8b92ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22662b2a5c3b7c534af4e8c20ff430fd9f8b92ce/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selection of Cheddar Cheese on sale ina store in Cheddar Gorge Somerset England, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Selection of Cheddar cheeses on sale in a store at Cheddar Gorge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Cooper-Smith/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Time for cider. The bus back to Weston stops by the village of Sandford\u2019s gourmet <a href=\"http://www.therailwayinn.com/\" title=\"\">Railway Inn</a>, meeting point for <a href=\"http://www.thatcherscider.co.uk/visit-us/thatchers-tours/\" title=\"\">tours of Thatchers</a> (\u00a312pp). Fruit-bowed trees are casting long shadows in the orchard by the time we arrive; there are crisp, bittersweet apples, pungent oak barrels and the rumble of lorries unloading the harvest. The tour ends back in the pub for a tasting that takes us from single-variety ciders through toffee-appley Rascal to the heady flavours of 458, blending numerous varieties. The others all have to drive home; luckily, I only need to stagger over the road to the bus stop.</p> <p>Next day, I catch the train to Taunton, half an hour away. The <a href=\"https://swheritage.org.uk/museum-of-somerset/\" title=\"\">Museum of Somerset</a> (free) in the town\u2019s castle fuses 12th-century architecture and contemporary design with exceptional results. The museum\u2019s treasures (including fossil plesiosaur, Roman narrative mosaic and intricate bronze shields) are worth a trip and the displays (cooking pots on the ceiling, glass panels in the floor) force visitors to look at them afresh. The latest exhibition is a retrospective of paintings by Tristram Hillier, who lived in Somerset. Great cafe, too, with homemade soup (\u00a34.95) and cakes; I have avocado toast with goats\u2019 cheese (\u00a37.50).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b17d7ae0214422611d6b70687330a49f3f7218ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b17d7ae0214422611d6b70687330a49f3f7218ed/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taunton Castle, which houses the Museum of Somerset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taunton Castle, which houses the Museum of Somerset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the nearby bus station I catch the number 28 bus through the russet-draped Quantocks to medieval <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dunster-castle\" title=\"\">Dunster and explore the castle</a> and gardens (adult from \u00a39.50, child from \u00a34.70). Paths wind down through palms and lavender to a riverside jungle of redwoods and tree ferns with a working watermill at one end. In the evening I stroll round Dunster\u2019s evocative sights: the butter cross, dovecot, tithe barn, and Rapunzel-esque fort on wooded Conygar hill. Then, I retire to my antique four-poster in the Luttrell Arms Hotel, overlooking the 17th-century octagonal, timber-farmed Yarn Market, and am serenaded by church bells.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0c986f10890b82370668f476475fc29318d010c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0c986f10890b82370668f476475fc29318d010c/0_0_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dunster Castle, Somerset, England, United Kingdom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dunster Castle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Billy Stock/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With its log fires and antler-festooned bar, the Luttrell Arms is one of 14 pubs on an <a href=\"https://issuu.com/cornwallbykernow/docs/camra_guide_28\">ale-and-cider trail</a> recently devised by Buses of Somerset with the local branch of Camra. The inns are reachable by steam train or on the 28 bus (day rover \u00a312). England\u2019s longest heritage railway, the 20-mile <a href=\"https://www.west-somerset-railway.co.uk/\" title=\"\">West Somerset Railway</a>, seems a suitably old-fashioned way to pub crawl back towards Taunton. So, I follow a riverside path to the station next morning, after an unusually good breakfast, featuring fresh figs, flat mushrooms and Bumblee\u2019s strawberry jam.</p> <p>By the time I have to head home, I\u2019ve checked out five more pubs, including the creeper-covered <a href=\"http://www.exmoorpubs.co.uk/\" title=\"\">White Horse</a> near Cleeve Abbey in Washford and the snug, unmissable <a href=\"http://www.pebblestavern.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pebbles Tavern</a> in Watchet (Camra\u2019s regional cider pub of 2019). In Washford, where blue signs show walkers a safe route to the abbey (avoiding the pavementless road), I also pop into <a href=\"https://www.torrecider.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Torre Cider Farm</a> before looping back to the station via two miles of hilly footpaths with views of the coast. Watchet is packed with shops and museums; I stroll out to the lighthouse and, rounding the centuries-old harbour that inspired Coleridge, find a statue of the Ancient Mariner and his albatross. In Pebbles, I sample woody sulphite-free Wild Rabbit from <a href=\"https://secretorchardcider.com/\" title=\"\">Secret Orchard</a> in nearby Nettlecombe and bring in \u2013 as advised \u2013 food from the neighbouring chippy or <a href=\"http://www.visit-watchet.co.uk/Members_Pages/SamsDeli/index.htm\" title=\"\">Sam\u2019s deli</a> (my bespoke sarnie, \u00a34, involving ripe Somerset brie, goes well with the cider).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d00a8866d3d714df1fc514842ddc7c8d125ee7d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d00a8866d3d714df1fc514842ddc7c8d125ee7d5/0_305_4864_2918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White Horse, Washford, Somerset, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White Horse, Washford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phoebe Taplin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last stop on my pub crawl is <a href=\"https://www.quantockbrewery.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Quantock Brewery</a>\u2019s capacious taproom at Bishops Lydeard, a short bus ride from Taunton station.

But I\u2019m hoping at least three things will warm this wintry West Country jaunt: cheese, cider and the scenery of Sanditon. Several scenes in ITV\u2019s adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s unfinished \u201cbeaches-and-ballgowns\u201d novel were filmed in Somerset and, arriving on the sandy seafront in Weston-super-Mare, I recognise the green slopes of Brean Down, a regular backdrop. Brean beach, one of Sanditon\u2019s star locations, is a few miles south, and a cycle route from Weston opened in 2017. Given the weather, I opt to hop on the X5 bus (\u00a37 Avonrider ticket), heading north to Clevedon, an elegant coastal town whose sea wall and marine lake also featured in the series. As I stroll by the sea, past the 150-year-old pier, rays of late-afternoon sunlight spill out of a rift in the clouds above Steep Holm, one of the distinctive islands in the Bristol Channel. On the way back to Weston, I stop off at Clevedon\u2019s time capsule-like Curzon. Opened in 1912, it is one of the world\u2019s oldest continually running cinemas: its layers of history include a shrapnel-scarred exterior, red-and-gold tin panelling and a vintage cafe. The early-19th-century Royal Hotel in Weston, where I\u2019m staying, also takes guests back in time, with wrought-iron balustrades, striped wallpaper and sunset-facing lounges. It was the first hotel built by Sanditon-style speculators when the town became a seaside resort. As I walk to the Old Thatched Cottage for supper with a friend who lives locally, the wet beach glows in the setting sun like molten lava. Next morning, I catch the 126 bus from Marine Parade through the misty Mendip hills to Cheddar Gorge (rover ticket \u00a37). The autumnal gorge is quieter than in tourist-choked summer. I walk beside the swollen River Yeo and, alone, through ancient, dripping caves (online adult ticket \u00a316.95, 5-15s \u00a312.70). In one cavern, huge cloth-bound rounds of cheese are maturing. Afterwards, I visit the Cheddar Gorge Cheese company, which made them (admission \u00a32), and watch the afternoon\u2019s whey-draining, curd-chopping and turning \u2013 \u201ccheddaring\u201d \u2013 before taking some strong cheese straws up the 274 steps of Jacob\u2019s Ladder for a picnic at Pulpit rock. Time for cider. The bus back to Weston stops by the village of Sandford\u2019s gourmet Railway Inn, meeting point for tours of Thatchers (\u00a312pp). Fruit-bowed trees are casting long shadows in the orchard by the time we arrive; there are crisp, bittersweet apples, pungent oak barrels and the rumble of lorries unloading the harvest. The tour ends back in the pub for a tasting that takes us from single-variety ciders through toffee-appley Rascal to the heady flavours of 458, blending numerous varieties. The others all have to drive home; luckily, I only need to stagger over the road to the bus stop. Next day, I catch the train to Taunton, half an hour away. The Museum of Somerset (free) in the town\u2019s castle fuses 12th-century architecture and contemporary design with exceptional results. The museum\u2019s treasures (including fossil plesiosaur, Roman narrative mosaic and intricate bronze shields) are worth a trip and the displays (cooking pots on the ceiling, glass panels in the floor) force visitors to look at them afresh. The latest exhibition is a retrospective of paintings by Tristram Hillier, who lived in Somerset. Great cafe, too, with homemade soup (\u00a34.95) and cakes; I have avocado toast with goats\u2019 cheese (\u00a37.50). From the nearby bus station I catch the number 28 bus through the russet-draped Quantocks to medieval Dunster and explore the castle and gardens (adult from \u00a39.50, child from \u00a34.70). Paths wind down through palms and lavender to a riverside jungle of redwoods and tree ferns with a working watermill at one end. In the evening I stroll round Dunster\u2019s evocative sights: the butter cross, dovecot, tithe barn, and Rapunzel-esque fort on wooded Conygar hill. Then, I retire to my antique four-poster in the Luttrell Arms Hotel, overlooking the 17th-century octagonal, timber-farmed Yarn Market, and am serenaded by church bells. With its log fires and antler-festooned bar, the Luttrell Arms is one of 14 pubs on an ale-and-cider trail recently devised by Buses of Somerset with the local branch of Camra. The inns are reachable by steam train or on the 28 bus (day rover \u00a312). England\u2019s longest heritage railway, the 20-mile West Somerset Railway, seems a suitably old-fashioned way to pub crawl back towards Taunton. So, I follow a riverside path to the station next morning, after an unusually good breakfast, featuring fresh figs, flat mushrooms and Bumblee\u2019s strawberry jam. By the time I have to head home, I\u2019ve checked out five more pubs, including the creeper-covered White Horse near Cleeve Abbey in Washford and the snug, unmissable Pebbles Tavern in Watchet (Camra\u2019s regional cider pub of 2019). In Washford, where blue signs show walkers a safe route to the abbey (avoiding the pavementless road), I also pop into Torre Cider Farm before looping back to the station via two miles of hilly footpaths with views of the coast. Watchet is packed with shops and museums; I stroll out to the lighthouse and, rounding the centuries-old harbour that inspired Coleridge, find a statue of the Ancient Mariner and his albatross. In Pebbles, I sample woody sulphite-free Wild Rabbit from Secret Orchard in nearby Nettlecombe and bring in \u2013 as advised \u2013 food from the neighbouring chippy or Sam\u2019s deli (my bespoke sarnie, \u00a34, involving ripe Somerset brie, goes well with the cider). Last stop on my pub crawl is Quantock Brewery\u2019s capacious taproom at Bishops Lydeard, a short bus ride from Taunton station. Great Western Railway introduces new timetables in December, the biggest network change since the 1970s, with more and faster trains across the south-west. Good news for those of us hoping to make the journey on a regular basis. Sobering up with coffee as the train races Londonwards, I start planning a return trip. \u2022 Rail travel was provided by Great Western Railway (London Paddington to Weston-super-Mare from 2\u00bc hours, from \u00a317 single if booked in advance; Taunton to Paddington from 1\u00be hours, from \u00a319) and by West Somerset Railway (\u00a322 for a day rover; \u00a320.25 in advance). Accommodation provided by Royal Hotel (doubles from \u00a3100 B&amp;B) and Luttrell Arms Hotel (doubles from \u00a376.50 room-only).

      "bodyText": "Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s briefing. Nigel Farage has inserted himself front and centre into the news cycle with a promise that his Brexit party will not contest Conservative-held seats. You can follow all the day\u2019s developments at our politics live blog \u2013 but first let\u2019s dive into this morning\u2019s headlines. What\u2019s going on? The Brexit party leader\u2019s dramatic U-turn has given incumbent Conservatives clear air, but senior Conservatives are piling pressure on him to go further and stand down his candidates in Labour-held seats being targeted by Tories. Nigel Farage has conceded the Brexit party\u2019s continued presence in those contests could lead to a hung parliament and a second referendum \u2013 the stopping of which was the \u201cthe single most important thing in our country\u201d. He emailed supporters on Monday night pledging to \u201ccontest every seat held by Corbyn\u2019s remainer Labour party\u201d which he said had \u201copenly betrayed\u201d Labour leave voters. Farage\u2019s reversal has prompted claims from Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP that he has secretly struck a pact in favour of a hard Brexit \u2013 something both the Brexit party and Tories denied. He is due to announce on Friday which seats the party is contesting. Labour will focus on education today, pledging that every adult will be entitled to six years of free study in a radical expansion of lifelong learning. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, will announce the party would \u201cthrow open the doors\u201d to adult learners if it wins government, including any adult without A-level or equivalent qualifications being able to study for them for free at college, and grants for low-income earners. Fiona Millar writes that Labour should be sweeping the floor with the Tories who have \u201cbrought schools to their knees\u201d but even last week they were asking for education policy ideas. Week one of this campaign is barely done and racism has reared its ugly head, with one Lib Dem candidate resigning and a Tory refusing to do so. Kevin McNamara, who holds the marginal seat of Thurrock in Essex, has stepped down after a series of racist and homophobic tweets emerged. He has apologised and the party has opened an investigation. But the Tory candidate for South Cambridgeshire and former Johnson aide, Anthony Browne, has refused to stand aside over comments that blamed immigrants for bringing germs and HIV to the UK and accused Muslims of having divided loyalties. At a glance The Guardian has unearthed a video showing how Dominic Cummings honed his political strategies in 2004 as campaign strategist for North East Says No (Nesno) against a regional assembly. The advert pits people against politicians and says money should go into the NHS, not politics. Labour\u2019s MP until last week in Redcar (North Yorkshire), Anna Turley, is back in court today where she is suing the party\u2019s biggest backer, Unite, over an article published on the Skwawkbox blog related to an application she made for union membership. Unite\u2019s barrister has told the court Turley was unfit to be an MP. Australia\u2019s former top diplomat in the United Kingdom, Alexander Downer, has said Australia would need to \u201csubstantially reduce\u201d intelligence sharing with the UK in the event Jeremy Corbyn wins on 12 December. Downer said a Corbyn victory would imperil substantial Australian investments in Britain, and would trigger a reassessment of the \u201cvery intimate\u201d security relationship between Canberra and London. You can find out if the armed forces really have had a pay cut in our latest Fact Check (short answer: yes, in real terms since 2010). Don\u2019t forget, you can check in at the end of the day on all the political action with Andrew Sparrow\u2019s election briefing. In case you missed it, here is the first in the series. The day ahead Boris Johnson will chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee in response to the floods in the north. Jo Swinson will travel to flood-affected South Yorkshire. The Lib Dems are promising \u20ac5bn for investment in flood defences. Jeremy Corbyn will launch Labour\u2019s adult education and further education policy in Blackpool. Nicola Sturgeon will join SNP candidate Catriona MacDonald on the campaign trail in Edinburgh South. There will be a Brexit party rally in Westminster at 11am. Best of the rest &gt; Evo Morales, the former Bolivian president, has left the country for Mexico where he has been granted asylum after his disputed re-election led to national turmoil. Morales vowed he would soon \u201creturn with more strength and energy\u201d to Bolivia. His exit has created further uncertainty and stoked fears about a power vacuum. &gt; Hospital admissions for children with pneumonia have risen by more than 50% in England in a decade, figures suggest, with the situation worst in deprived areas. Unicef and Save the Children say it equates to six children being taken to hospital every hour. A health expert said parents should have their children immunised with the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines to reduce their risk of getting sick. &gt; An antique turban-style hat made from the world\u2019s most exclusive textile \u2013 sea silk \u2013 is to be auctioned this week in New York. Its threads come from a giant Mediterranean mollusc, Pinna nobilis, which roots itself to the seafloor with hundreds of fibres, known as byssus. Once extracted, cleaned and spun, the threads are a rich chestnut colour. It was once highly prized \u2013 Horatio Nelson wrote of his intention to send his lover, Emma Hamilton, a pair of gloves made from byssus \u2013 but fell out of favour among the synthetic fabrics of the 20th century. Today in Focus podcast: Is the NHS up for sale at the election? The NHS is one of the major battleground issues of the general election as parties debate the future of healthcare in the UK. Sarah Boseley and Denis Campbell discuss the extent of private company involvement in the NHS. Plus: Dan Collyns on the downfall of Evo Morales in Bolivia. Lunchtime read: History as a giant data set In 2010, a letter in the scientific journal Nature warned that a coming decade of dazzling technological progress risked being unravelled by mounting global political instability. This turmoil, the writer predicted, was due to peak in the US and western Europe around 2020. Human societies go through predictable periods of growth, during which the population increases and prosperity rises. Then come equally predictable periods of decline.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s former top diplomat in the United Kingdom, Alexander Downer, has intervened in the British election contest, declaring the Morrison government would need to \u201csubstantially reduce\u201d intelligence sharing with London in the event Jeremy Corbyn wins on 12 December. In an excoriating assessment of the Labour leader at the National Press Club in Canberra, Downer contended that a Corbyn victory would imperil substantial Australian investments in Britain, and would trigger a reassessment of the \u201cvery intimate\u201d security relationship between Canberra and London. Downer is a former leader of the Liberal party in Australia, and was foreign affairs minister in the Howard government for more than a decade. He was appointed after his retirement from politics as high commissioner in London by the Liberal government in Canberra. Downer on Tuesday rated Boris Johnson\u2019s prospect of victory at about 70%, but he warned if the Conservatives failed to win outright \u201cthen expect Jeremy Corbyn to be the prime minister\u201d. Downer said the result mattered to Australia because the UK was the second-largest offshore destination for Australian investment. \u201cIf the Corbyn government comes in with its extremely radical economic agenda, a kind of Venezuelan-style, Maduro-style economic agenda, very South American economic agenda, and unfamiliar to any of us here in Australia \u2013 I think you would expect a very substantial deterioration in the British economy, and as a result of that, that would put at risk the investments we have \u2026 made in the UK,\u201d Downer said. In relation to national security, he said the election of the leftwing Labour leader would disrupt the \u201cvery intimate and important relationship\u201d between Asis, MI6, Asio, GCHQ and the Australian Signal Directorate. \u201cGreat Britain is the second-most important country in security terms in the western alliance\u201d. \u201cUnder a Corbyn government, they will abandon the support for the western alliance and steer a completely different foreign policy and security policy direction to such an extent that I think we would be unwise to continue the intelligence-sharing relationship with a Corbyn-led Britain of the kind that we\u2019ve had \u2026 under Gordon Brown and Tony Blair and so on over the years. \u201cI think that would have to change. So I\u2019m hoping, unusually \u2026 you will be surprised to hear me say this, that Boris Johnson wins the election on the 12th of December.

These are people who are unsympathetic to and hostile to western interests, they have engaged as friends and allies of people like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Iranians, the Venezuelans and so on. \u201cThese are people who are totally hostile to the traditions of western security policy. The leadership of the British Labour party is something we have never seen in a major political party in this country. These are people way over to the very, very far left, and it would change the whole nature of our engagement with the UK if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister. Comment has been sought from Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne. Downer\u2019s appearance at Canberra\u2019s National Press Club on Tuesday was billed as a situation report on Brexit, but the former diplomat and foreign affairs minister faced sustained questioning about his participation in the Barr inquiry in the United States. Donald Trump has established the Barr inquiry to discredit the Mueller investigation. The Mueller investigation began after Downer was allegedly told by George Papadopoulos, then a Trump campaign aide, that Russia had obtained damaging information about Hillary Clinton from her emails. Downer then informed US authorities, which has led to accusations from Trump allies, such as the Senate judiciary committee chairman, Lindsey Graham, about the then high commissioner\u2019s \u201cdirected\u201d role in relaying information to US authorities about the Clinton emails. Australia has rejected those accusations. Downer refused to give direct answers to questions about the level of his participation in the Barr inquiry, or whether he now regretted his conversation in a London wine bar with Papadopoulos. He said he did not want to \u201cplay into the toxic politics of America\u201d or disrupt the orderly business of the inquiry by providing commentary, although he signalled without saying so directly that he had been interviewed, and was \u201cfully cooperating with the Australian government\u201d. Downer declined to answer a question about whether he had sought permission from Canberra before he relayed the insights from Papadopoulos to the American charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in London in July 2016. Guardian Australia revealed at the start of October that Downer had taken the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and senior colleagues by surprise when he shared politically sensitive information with his American counterpart in London. Downer has not previously contested that version of events, and didn\u2019t when asked if he wanted to set the record straight on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why you bother with it, I\u2019m not sure why you care. I don\u2019t want to set the record straight, I don\u2019t care what people are saying,\u201d he said. \u201cI retired from politics long ago, you can say what you like\u201d.",

The data reveals the rise to be primarily driven by a large rise in bronchiolitis, with small increases in other diagnoses including viral pneumonia and influenza with pneumonia. When the team scrutinised recent data, it found rates of hospital admissions of children were higher in more deprived areas of England. Kevin Watkins, the Save the Children chief executive, said: \u201cI would describe pneumonia as the ultimate disease of poverty, both in the UK and globally.\u201d While overall across England in 2018-19, just over 450 of every 100,000 children registered with GPs were admitted to hospital with pneumonia as an emergency, the rate was more than twice as high for NHS Scarborough and Ryedale clinical commissioning group, at 1,058 per 100,000.

Since 2006, as part of the childhood vaccination programme, children under the age of two in the UK have received a pneumococcal vaccine known as PCV, which protects against 13 different strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. These bacteria are a common cause of pneumonia, although it can also be caused by certain fungi and viruses. The data shows emergency child hospital admissions from bacterial pneumonia alone have fallen. However, PCV is among the childhood vaccines for which take-up has fallen across England in recent years, alarming experts who say children are being left unprotected against serious illnesses including measles. While the charities said the hospital figures largely appeared to be driven by a rise in the viral infection bronchiolitis \u2013 which is not protected against by PCV \u2013 experts urged parents to make sure their child had been vaccinated against both pneumonia and flu. Anthony Harnden, a professor of primary care at Oxford University, who was not involved with the work, stressed the need for prevention. \u201cWhile there may be multiple reasons why bronchiolitis in children is rising in the UK, such as lower thresholds for hospital referral and diagnosis, these figures only reinforce the need for parents to get their children immunised with the pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza vaccine to reduce their risk,\u201d he said. \u201cMoreover, there will be future vaccines to protect against respiratory syncytial virus, a major cause of bronchiolitis.\u201d",

Many of the locals had a soft spot for the bearded stranger with the laughter lines and exotic accent. Hamid chatted to his new friends about literature and science, spiritualism and martial arts, Iraq and war, pretty much anything. And then one day he was gone. Just as he had arrived unannounced, he disappeared. In February 2018, Hamid was taken ill and moved into emergency accommodation. He died there alone. Like two-thirds of homeless people, Hamid suffered with addiction. And like many people who die homeless, he looked far older than his 55 years.</p> \n<p>Harlow is one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/15/sterile-or-stirring-britains-love-hate-relationship-with-new-towns\" title=\"\">the new towns built after the second world war</a> to ease overcrowding in London. In its early years it had a thoroughly modern can-do feel to it, boasting Britain\u2019s first all-pedestrian shopping precinct and first modern high-rise residential tower block. But more recently it has fallen on tough times. This year, Harlow\u2019s Conservative MP, Robert Halfon, suggested the town had become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/16/is-harlow-being-used-to-socially-cleanse-london\" title=\"\">a dumping ground for London councils</a>, which have sent hundreds of \u201ctroubled families\u201d to live in converted office blocks in his constituency. The last census, in 2011, showed that Harlow had higher unemployment, less home ownership, lower educational qualifications and poorer health than the average for both Essex and England.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=5.3%25&amp;title=of%20Harlow\u2019s%20population%20is%20on%20the%20housing-needs%20register\" data-alt=\"5.3% of Harlow's population is on the housing-needs register\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=5.3%25&amp;title=of%20Harlow\u2019s%20population%20is%20on%20the%20housing-needs%20register\">5.3% of Harlow's population is on the housing-needs register</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In June, however, Halfon said things were looking up for the town. \u201cThe news that homelessness is at its lowest level since 2010 is a real step in the right direction,\u201d he declared. Halfon quoted the absurdly low figure of five homeless people, and was soon corrected by a local Labour councillor, Tony Edwards, who pointed out that the figure referred to rough sleeping not homelessness, and that in fact more than 4,500 people were on the housing-needs register in Harlow and about 400 people had made \u201chomeless\u201d applications in 2018/19. That paints a very different picture. It means that, with a population of 85,000, 5.3% of people in the town are waiting to have a housing need met.</p> \n<p>It is 18 months since Hamid died, and we meet Protheroe in the Tesco superstore cafe where he and Hamid would often get together for coffee and bacon sandwiches. Protheroe is business-like and comes straight to the point. He says he doesn\u2019t want us to get the wrong impression; he\u2019s not a do-gooder. He considered Hamid a friend rather than a charity case. \u201cI\u2019m not a selfish bastard, but I\u2019m not out to help everybody I can,\u201d he says. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019ll help animals more than I\u2019ll help people. I just got to know Hamid and we became mates.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a2f6530ea43fa575ecb72468b1b5f9379253ccf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a2f6530ea43fa575ecb72468b1b5f9379253ccf/0_902_4380_5007/875.jpg\" alt=\"In 1981, when he turned 19, Hamid was conscripted into the army to fight in the Iran-Iraq war\" width=\"875\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 1981, when he turned 19, Hamid was conscripted into the army to fight in the Iran-Iraq war</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>In 1981, when he turned 19, Hamid was conscripted into the army to fight in the Iran-Iraq war</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Hamid told Protheroe he had ended up homeless in 2017 after selling his pension in a dodgy deal and then running into money troubles. But even here there is a mystery. Unlike most people living on the streets, he still had savings in the bank. He camped in woodland close to Tesco until his tent was set alight. Protheroe says Hamid told him that teenagers were responsible, but he didn\u2019t like to talk about it.</p> \n<p>Soon after this a Harlow local gave Hamid the old Peugeot 206. He parked it by Tesco and moved in. The interior of his car-home was crammed with donated clothes and books \u2013 science books, spiritual self-help guides, novels, all sorts. The only space left for Hamid was the passenger seat. Protheroe thought his friend might be an eccentric hoarder.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>He was very educated. But something obviously went wrong somewhere along the line</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Chrissy Sorce</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Hamid told him he spoke seven languages, that he had a PhD in astrophysics and theoretical maths, and mentioned the job he almost got with the late Prof Hawking. He also talked about fighting in the Iran-Iraq war, showed him photographs of members of his platoon who had died, and told him he suffered from terrible flashbacks. That\u2019s why he drank, he said \u2013 to blot out the memories. Protheroe is surprised by how well they got to know each other in such a short period of time. He would find himself visiting Hamid at night to make sure he was OK.</p> \n<p>Although Hamid was a good deal older, 41-year-old Protheroe found himself playing a paternal role. He would often tick Hamid off about the state of his car-home. \u201cI\u2019d open up the car door and he\u2019d been smoking roll-ups in there. I said you\u2019ve got to sleep in there, and there\u2019s smoke billowing out. It wasn\u2019t the kind of car I would have liked to have slept in, if I\u2019m being honest. Hamid wasn\u2019t very tidy. I\u2019d have a go at him \u2013 \u2018Sort yourself out, you look like a sack of shit, you need to run a brush through your hair.\u2019 I\u2019d just have a dig at him and we\u2019d have a bit of back and forth. He\u2019d laugh at me, and take the piss.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Like Protheroe, Chrissy Sorce is almost apologetic about befriending Hamid. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I took to him. I don\u2019t go out and randomly do that to everybody. It\u2019s just something about him \u2013 he was likable.\u201d Sorce, who is 51, works at a car-rental firm based in the industrial park next to Tesco. \u201cHe parked the Peugeot behind our workplace, and I just started chatting to him on my fag breaks,\u201d she recalls.</p> \n<p>Sorce talks about his fondness for scratch cards \u2013 \u201cHe was always trying to win millions, bless him\u201d \u2013 and how she stored books for him in her daughter\u2019s shed to free up space in the Peugeot. \u201cThey were quite intellectual books. He was very educated. But something obviously went wrong somewhere along the line, which can happen, can\u2019t it?\u201d</p> \n<p>Hamid told Sorce many fascinating and funny stories. But for all that, there was a terrible vulnerability about him, she says. \u201cIt was all a fake, really, because at the end of the day he was still lying in that car and sleeping in the freezing cold.\u201d Sometimes when he was drunk he would weep and tell her he wished he was dead. Sorce says she told him not to be daft, and to take any opportunity that came along. But she admits, at this stage of his life, few opportunities were coming his way. \u201cI think the council could have housed him. He could have been put in a room a lot sooner, surely. They all knew where he was.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"010e5ac7e266690f66541c3156292945fd4cbd72\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/010e5ac7e266690f66541c3156292945fd4cbd72/61_0_838_503/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hamid with his Peugeot.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hamid with his Peugeot.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Protheroe</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Adam Protheroe says he often used to tell Hamid off about the state of his Peugeot home. Photograph: Adam Protheroe</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>What she most liked about Hamid is that he didn\u2019t want anything from her. \u201cHe never even asked me for a pound.\u201d She pauses and smiles. \u201cHe did ask me to go out for dinner, though, but I had to let him down and say no. I think he liked the women. He would go into Tesco and chat to them.\u201d She once did his washing for him, she says. \u201cI washed and ironed everything. I said to him: \u2018Do you want me to do any more?\u2019 But he never gave me any more to do. He was proud. After I did that, he went out and bought me washing powder to replace what I\u2019d done. I told him not to bother, but he did it anyway.\u201d</p> \n<p>She knows some people couldn\u2019t understand why she wanted to help him. They said it straight out to her. \u201cWhen I took home his washing \u2013 and yes, it really did stink \u2013 one of my managers said: \u2018Eeeeugh, how could you wash all his clothes?\u2019 I said: \u2018Easy, you just put them in the washing machine and take them out.\u2019\u201d Sorce says she couldn\u2019t help thinking it could just as easily have been her living in that car. \u201cWe\u2019re all one pay cheque away from being homeless. You never know what\u2019s going to bring you down, that\u2019s how I see it.\u201d</p> \n<p>At times, she says, Hamid seemed confused. She and Protheroe believe he had early-stage dementia. As for his stories, she didn\u2019t know what to make of them. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not, do you? You just go along with it.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Both Sorce and Protheroe were anxious that Hamid should take care of his appearance. They believed that this, coupled with sobriety, could be the difference between him getting a council home or not. That\u2019s why Protheroe ended up taking him to his barber\u2019s one day. \u201cHamid was attending an alcohol dependency therapy group in Harlow,\u201d says Protheroe. \u201cThe idea was that, if he demonstrated he could get off the booze, they would recommend that the council should give him somewhere to live. I was trying to sober him up and make him look a bit more respectable. So I took him to my barber. Hamid had this big old white Father Christmas beard and he took all that off, cut his hair and he looked like a different person.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was at the barber\u2019s that Protheroe began to suspect Hamid may have been telling the truth about his academic background. \u201cMy barber is a very intelligent guy, and him and Hamid were having conversations about string theory, this theory, that theory. It was really bizarre to hear Hamid coming out with these things.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hamid never did get council accommodation, but Protheroe says in some ways he was his own worst enemy. The Harlow homeless project Streets2Homes tried to find a place for Hamid to live. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018We\u2019ve got a room for you, but you can\u2019t drink or smoke in the room, and there are all these rules and regulations.\u2019 Hamid was like \u2018Nononono, I\u2019m not having that.\u2019 And he just wouldn\u2019t do it. If you want help, first of all you\u2019ve got to help yourself. Hamid was like: \u2018I\u2019d rather sit in my car and drink and smoke.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Protheroe admits he may be being tough on his friend \u2013 insisting that an alcoholic does not drink in his own home is a big ask. Hamid may well have benefited from the Housing First model, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/12/homelessness-radical-solution-homes-housing-first\" title=\"\">whereby homeless people are provided with a home</a> and then addiction issues are addressed with wraparound support. Streets2Homes declined to talk to us for this article.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"caba28675d1f55604b2a8098cdfd80a56737956f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caba28675d1f55604b2a8098cdfd80a56737956f/0_424_899_1015/886.jpg\" alt=\"Hamid Alamdari Farahi (left) with Adam Protheroe\" width=\"886\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hamid Alamdari Farahi (left) with Adam Protheroe</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Protheroe</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There was also something about the car-home that made Hamid special. He was well known to Tesco customers and became something of a local celebrity. Hamid and his Peugeot had become a landmark. Protheroe reckons Hamid had good reason to be wary of council accommodation. He tells us of the time Hamid was robbed while staying in a hostel. \u201cHe had his bloody pin number written on his bank card and whoever it was that stole it from the hostel emptied his bank, absolutely emptied his bank. So I was on the phone to his bank and tried to get it all sorted out. He had a couple of grand in the bank; that was what was left over from his pension.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sorce thinks Hamid declined offers of housing because they were not permanent, and he felt he would be even more exposed there. \u201cHe wanted to steer clear of people who were similar to him,\u201d she says. Hamid told her he was offered a place at Terminus House in Harlow, a grim-looking block of flats <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-47720887\" title=\"\">often described as a \u201chuman warehouse\u201d</a> where hundreds of residents, sent from councils across London, are crammed together in tiny flats. Halfon has referred to the practice of rehousing families from London in his constituency as \u201csocial cleansing\u201d. The building <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-49053544\" title=\"\">made headlines in July</a> because of a drugs network operating nearby, and police figures show that crime within a 500-metre radius of Terminus House rose 20% in the 10 months after it opened.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=400%20&amp;title=people%20made%20%E2%80%9Chomeless%E2%80%9D%20applications%20in%20Harlow%20in%202018%2F19\" data-alt=\"400 people made \u201chomeless\u201d applications in Harlow in 2018/19\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=400%20&amp;title=people%20made%20%E2%80%9Chomeless%E2%80%9D%20applications%20in%20Harlow%20in%202018%2F19\">400 people made \u201chomeless\u201d applications in Harlow in 2018/19</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Rather than accepting a place in Terminus House, Hamid returned to his silver Peugeot, carried on smoking and drinking, and continued to be berated by his good friend for his slovenliness. Protheroe says that somehow Hamid, for all his bad habits and obduracy, brought out an incredible generosity in the Harlow community. One day Hamid broke the key in the lock of the car door, and Protheroe posted a shout-out on Facebook for help. \u201cThis guy got in touch, came down, and sorted him with a key. It was normally a \u00a3200 job, but he did it as a gesture of goodwill.\u201d</p> \n<p>When the weather turned and Protheroe was worried Hamid might get hypothermia, he set up a GoFundMe page. \u201cA kind-hearted girl phoned me up around midnight, and said: \u2018I can\u2019t stop thinking about this guy. I want to come out and help him.\u2019 I said: \u2018Right, I\u2019ll get out of bed and come and meet you.\u2019 She and her husband drove down in a hundred grand Mercedes AMG Jeep. They paid 400 or 500 quid to put him up in the Park Inn for a week.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another woman turned up with a huge biscuit tin crammed with cigarettes. \u201cIt was filled to the brim. There must have been a couple of thousand roll-ups in it.\u201d And soon after it became apparent that there was no longer room for Hamid in the Peugeot, another miracle happened. \u201cA guy rocked up with an Audi estate car, which was like twice the size of his existing \u2018premises\u2019. He parked that up behind, and the Peugeot became a storage facility for all the junk while Hamid moved into the Audi.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"54b887d17e58b2b5fa591d01fb849bcac553058d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54b887d17e58b2b5fa591d01fb849bcac553058d/0_61_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mourners at the funeral of Hamid Farahi Alamdari at Harlow Crematorium in Harlow, Essex, on 4 May, 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mourners at the funeral of Hamid Farahi Alamdari at Harlow Crematorium in Harlow, Essex, on 4 May 2018</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martine Xerri/BPM Media</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"6f9be89567e9664d8611bf49a770c12521d652e9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f9be89567e9664d8611bf49a770c12521d652e9/0_134_4763_2858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The funeral of Hamid Farahi Alamdari at Harlow Crematorium in Harlow, Essex, on May 4, 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The funeral of Hamid Farahi Alamdari at Harlow Crematorium in Harlow, Essex, on 4 May 2018</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martine Xerri/BPM Media</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Family and friends at Hamid\u2019s funeral in Harlow, 4 May 2018. Photographs: Martine Xerri/BPM Media</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>It\u2019s a story deserving of a happy ending. But of course it didn\u2019t have one. Eventually, as he became ill, Hamid did accept help, and during a cold snap in February 2018 he was provided with emergency accommodation by Streets2Homes at the Oasis Hotel in Harlow. Nav Hussein, the hotel manager, checked on Hamid after receiving a concerned call over his whereabouts. When he went to his room, he saw two empty bottles of alcohol, and Hamid sitting upright on the bed. Hussein called out to him, but received no reply. He then noticed there was something different about the colour of Hamid\u2019s hands and realised he was dead.</p> \n<p>The autopsy revealed that Hamid had died of organ failure, but Protheroe is convinced he had simply lost the will to live. At the time, Hamid was on a complex cocktail of medication. \u201cI think that it had got to the point where he\u2019d just had enough, and he stopped taking his meds.\u201d</p> \n<p>A few weeks after his death, the <a href=\"https://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/funeral-held-much-loved-harlow-1534623\" title=\"\">council arranged a funeral for Hamid</a>. Protheroe was disappointed by the turnout. He was pleased that Hamid\u2019s family were there, but wondered where they had been when his friend needed them most. </p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Hamid Farahi Alamdari\u2019s Facebook was last updated in November 2015. It states he started a new job as an aircraft engineer in 2006, and that he worked as an aircraft maintenance engineer for British Airways World Cargo. Most of his \u201cfriends\u201d are beautiful young women from any number of countries, and a few are aviation engineers and fellow Iranians. His Facebook biography says he graduated from Bristol Aeronautical University in 1997. But there is no Bristol Aeronautical University. There is a renowned aerospace engineering department at Bristol University. However, Bristol University tells us Hamid never studied there. British Airways refuses to confirm that he worked there.</p> \n<p>At the bottom of the list of friends is a man called Ariane F Alamdari. Ariane is Hamid\u2019s nephew. Over the phone he tells us that his uncle could be a difficult man, particularly when he was drinking, but he did not believe he was a liar. \u201cOf all his personality traits, embellishing the truth or telling fibs was not one of the things that I knew him for.\u201d Ariane says the details of his uncle\u2019s life are a puzzle to him. He introduces us to his father, Hamid\u2019s older brother Saeed, who he says can tell us more.</p> \n<p>Saeed is a 64-year-old academic who lectures in engineering at Bradford College and lives in Roundhay, a well-to-do suburb of Leeds. We meet in Roundhay Park, one of Europe\u2019s largest city parks. Saeed is a short, slight man, who carries himself with an easy elegance. He has just completed the first half of his regular 10-mile walk around the lake. Saeed talks quietly and thoughtfully about Hamid and their parents, who came to Iran from Azerbaijan and spoke Turkish. He says that he was the lucky brother. Because he was eight years older than Hamid, he managed to leave Iran for the UK before the shah was overthrown and Ayatollah Khomeini established an Islamic republic in Iran. This was the main thing that set their lives apart, he says.</p> \n<p>Saeed does not pretend to know every detail of his brother\u2019s life. There were so many years they were apart. Like us, he has been trying to piece together a complex jigsaw since Hamid\u2019s death.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc730aa6f68ca8daa10795cd180528e0b8732936\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc730aa6f68ca8daa10795cd180528e0b8732936/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saeed Alamdari, says it was was obvious from early on that his brother was outstandingly gifted\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saeed Alamdari says it was was obvious from early on that his brother was outstandingly gifted</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Saeed Alamdari says it was was obvious from early on that his brother was outstandingly gifted. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Saeed and Hamid were two of four children born into a middle-class family in Tehran. Their parents were practising Muslims and their children grew up in a secular Iran. Their father had a good, stable job working in security for the ministry of health, while their mother brought up the children. Saeed says it was obvious from early on that young Hamid was outstandingly gifted. \u201cHe was good at all sorts of sports, but most of all he was academically brilliant.\u201d Both boys were drawn to the sciences, engineering and maths.</p> \n<p>There was something else that stood out about young Hamid \u2013 he loved to take risks. \u201cHe and his friends used to go on to the roof of mosques and jump off them, and the curator would chase them,\u201d recalls Saeed. \u201cHe liked getting chased. He wanted to be on the edge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Life changed for everybody after the revolution of 1979. By then Saeed had already established himself in the UK. He left Tehran in 1974, studied mechanical and aerospace engineering at Leeds University, did a masters degree in combustion and settled to a life in academia. Hamid was only 16 at the time of the revolution. In 1981, when he turned 19, he was conscripted into the army to fight in the Iran-Iraq war, which had begun the previous year. Because he was such a high achiever, he was drafted in as a lieutenant.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Astrophysics was a favourite subject of his.

However, Saeed thinks he was anything but at ease. Here was a young man responsible for the lives of so many other men who simply didn\u2019t want to be there. \u201cHe had a platoon under his control, and most of these soldiers were drafted from villages. Hamid told me that on the day they were leaving for the front, the soldiers\u2019 mothers got together and told him: \u2018We\u2019re leaving our sons in your hands.\u2019 And during the war he lost most of his platoon \u2013 he always blamed himself for that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Saeed says the war left Hamid with post-traumatic stress disorder. Hamid suffered a recurring nightmare \u2013 that Iraqi soldiers were coming towards him with their hands raised, but he shot them anyway. After leaving the army, he went to India to study physics and to try to heal himself. Hamid told Saeed he studied for a degree, then completed a PhD. He also said he spent much of the time meditating and reading the great 13th-century Persian poets Rumi and Shams Tabrizi. \u201cI think meditating and reading were coping mechanisms for him,\u201d Saeed says. But by now Hamid also had another coping mechanism: booze.</p> \n<p>After India, Hamid returned to Tehran, where he found himself in trouble. He could not cope with the oppressive regime or the alcohol ban. On one occasion, Hamid told Saeed, he and his friends were sentenced to 80 lashes after being caught drinking. \u201cBut one of his friends had a hump on his back, and Hamid said: \u2018You\u2019re not going to lash him.\u2019 He was asked: \u2018Well, do you want to take his punishment?\u2019 He said: \u2018I will\u2019, and he received 160 lashes. That\u2019s when he came to the conclusion that this was not the place for him.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa5ef5ef76c6ff314e255c1e01b20abd5254cd2e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa5ef5ef76c6ff314e255c1e01b20abd5254cd2e/0_10_899_539/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tributes left on Hamid\u2019s car following his death\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tributes left on Hamid\u2019s car following his death</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Protheroe</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Tributes left on Hamid\u2019s car following his death. Photograph: Adam Protheroe</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>In the mid-90s, Hamid came to the UK. He was in his early 30s and lived with his sister in Croydon while doing an admin job with the charity Age UK and studying English at Croydon College. According to Saeed, he won the college\u2019s student of the year award. From there he moved to Bristol, but Saeed says that, rather than studying at university, as suggested on his Facebook profile, Hamid attended Bristol College to get a diploma to enable him to work on planes. It was around this time that he made his application to become Stephen Hawking\u2019s assistant at the University of Cambridge. A letter dated 31 August 1997 confirms his application for the post, but there does not appear to be any correspondence about his shortlisting.</p> \n<p>Hamid didn\u2019t get the job as Hawking\u2019s assistant, but was employed as an aeronautical engineer in Bristol. He had a stable job, lived with a girlfriend and made a decent life for himself. Saeed says these were his happiest years in Britain. But even then his brother had noticed a change. He had always been a risk-taker, but now he was becoming positively reckless. Hamid told him of a time he had gone to a drug-dealer\u2019s house in Bristol to buy cannabis. \u201cHe said they had machetes and everything, and all the drugs were on the table. He and his friend took everything from the table and just ran away. For a few months he had to stay low. It\u2019s not that he needed the money. He did it for the high.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2008 Hamid lost his job, and went on a downward spiral. He moved to the market town of Great Dunmow in Essex and stayed with a friend for a while. By now it was obvious to Saeed that his brother was addicted to alcohol and cannabis and that his life was becoming increasingly chaotic.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/29/why-did-catherine-kenny-and-her-best-friend-die-in-the-same-doorway\">Why did Catherine Kenny and her best friend die in the same doorway?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At one point, Saeed paid for Hamid to go to Afghanistan for an interview for a job at a US air force base. Hamid also told Saeed that he went to Saudi Arabia to be interviewed for a post in avionics. But neither of these jobs materialised. Hamid would often phone Saeed at work, asking for money. Eventually, Saeed had to give an instruction not to put Hamid\u2019s calls through to him.</p> \n<p>Saeed had his own problems. He and his wife had separated and he was looking after his son, who has Asperger\u2019s.<strong> </strong>When Hamid came to stay in Leeds, he inevitably brought trouble. There was one terrible weekend in 2011 when, within 20 minutes of Hamid arriving, there was a knock on Saeed\u2019s door. It was Hamid\u2019s drug dealer. \u201cI was furious that he had arranged that. I told him, you come here whenever you want, Hamid, but no drugs. I\u2019ve a son living with me \u2013 no drugs, no alcohol.\u201d The next day they were walking back to Saeed\u2019s car. \u201cHe had fallen behind me, and I realised he was drinking from a bottle of whisky in a brown paper bag. His face was getting redder and redder. When he saw me looking at him, he put it in his pocket. I dragged it out and smashed it on the floor. I said: \u2018Didn\u2019t I tell you, if you\u2019re coming here, no alcohol.\u2019 I had my son with me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Saeed couldn\u2019t cope with his brother\u2019s behaviour. \u201cOn the Monday, I took him to the bus station. I shook hands with him and I said: \u2018I\u2019ll see you in another world.\u2019\u201d That was the last time the brothers saw each other. Hamid would occasionally phone \u2013 usually asking for money. \u201cThe last time he phoned was three in the morning. His speech was slurred. I said to him: \u2018Assume you have no brother.\u2019\u201d Saeed looks out on to the lake. He says he knows he was hard on Hamid, but he felt he had to choose between his brother and his son\u2019s welfare. \u201cI have my regrets,\u201d he says. \u201cPossibly I was asking too much from him.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4ae0104c7d96640a75083faae242a2317f190699\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ae0104c7d96640a75083faae242a2317f190699/41_208_767_1082/709.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial card from Hamid's funeral.\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>It was around five years later, in 2017, that Hamid sold his pension and ended up homeless. A year later he died. Hamid Farahi Alamdari \u2013 physicist, spiritualist, risk-taker, addict, war veteran. He may have fought his war in a faraway country for a remote regime, but in many ways he was typical of the thousands of British war veterans who are homeless \u2013 never shaking off the ghosts of the battlefield and left with lifelong PTSD. He might have told all the friends he made in that industrial park in Harlow about the beautiful and clever things in life, but ultimately it is his confessions about nightmares and the psychological scars left by war that left the strongest impression.</p> \n<p>As for the PhD and being shortlisted for the job with Hawking, who knows? All his friends are certain of is that he had exceptional ability, that he died a disappointed man, and that they miss him. Adam Protheroe and Chrissy Sorce knew him for less than a year, but he changed their lives. Sorce says she knows she helped Hamid, but she still thinks she let him down at the end. \u201cI felt a bit bad because he messaged me a few times and I was so busy with my own family that I didn\u2019t really respond back to him as much as I should have. I did feel something towards him. He had a nice nature. I have a plant here he bought me for Christmas. I called it Hamid.\u201d It\u2019s a large succulent, is thriving and sits on her windowsill at home.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/11/we-are-failing-children-in-care-and-they-are-dying-on-our-streets\">We are failing children in care \u2013 and they are dying on our streets</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At the cafe in Harlow, Protheroe says he can\u2019t drive past Tesco these days without thinking of his friend. He was \u201cgutted\u201d when he heard of Hamid\u2019s death. He mentions a book Hamid gave him as a present. \u201cIt\u2019s called The Prophet. It\u2019s only a thin book, and it was just inspirational stuff \u2013 live your life this way, do good, be the best person you can.\u201d It means a lot to him, he says.</p> \n<p>Back in Leeds, Saeed admits it was a shock when he discovered Hamid had been living in a car and died homeless. He says he can\u2019t express just how grateful he is to the people of Harlow for looking after Hamid when he had given up. \u201cWe were stunned by the number of books in the car, the clothes that people had given him, all the flowers at his funeral.\u201d He spends a lot of time reflecting on his brother\u2019s life, and says that these days he can remember the good times more easily. \u201cAstrophysics was a favourite subject of his. Parallel universes.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cIt was a waste of a good life. I\u2019m just hoping that in other universes, parallel universes, Hamid will be living a better life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Saeed and his sister decided not to tell their 90-year-old mother, who still lives in Iran, about Hamid\u2019s death because they thought it would break her heart. \u201cBut about a week after he died, she called my sister from Iran saying: \u2018I\u2019m getting these dreams \u2013 either Hamid is ill or he is dead, which is it?\u2019 And then my sister said: \u2018Yes, he has passed away.\u2019\u201d Saeed says that his mother was relieved Hamid is finally at peace.</p> \n<p>Saeed is getting ready for the second half of his walk around Roundhay Park. Sometimes he meets a man in the park who reminds him of his brother. \u201cSeven o\u2019clock in the morning he\u2019s feeding swans, and he\u2019s got a bottle of wine with him,\u201d Saeed says. \u201cThere will come a time when I will strike a conversation with him. \u2018Listen, I had a brother and he went right through what you\u2019re going through now.\u2019\u201d For now, Saeed just tells him to take care of himself.</p> \n<p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing <a href=\"mailto://jo@samaritans.org\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto://jo@samaritans.ie\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

      "bodyText": "Hamid Farahi Alamdari was full of stories. When he was living out of his car in a Tesco car park in Harlow, Essex, he told anyone who would listen about his exciting past as an avionics engineer, Iranian war veteran and physicist. Then there was his pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: the time he was shortlisted to be Stephen Hawking\u2019s assistant. \u201cI took it all with a pinch of salt at first because he was telling me all these stories and I could tell he was a drinker,\u201d says account manager Adam Protheroe. \u201cHe could have been anybody. He could have told me that he was the king of Iran and I wouldn\u2019t have known any better.\u201d Protheroe became close friends with Hamid in 2017. \u201cI\u2019d seen him around and he was living in a Peugeot 206 that was parked up just around the corner. I came back a couple of days later with a bag full of clothes and bits and pieces and socks. My wife cooked him a nice meal and I took it down to him in a little box and started talking to him from there.\u201d He would eat with him, take him to appointments and raised more than \u00a3700 to get Hamid accommodation in the winter that followed. Protheroe wasn\u2019t bothered whether he was telling the truth or not. He liked Hamid, and who wouldn\u2019t spin a yarn or two when life had dealt them such a bum deal? Protheroe was by no means the only one to fall for Hamid\u2019s raffish charm. Many of the locals had a soft spot for the bearded stranger with the laughter lines and exotic accent. Hamid chatted to his new friends about literature and science, spiritualism and martial arts, Iraq and war, pretty much anything. And then one day he was gone. Just as he had arrived unannounced, he disappeared. In February 2018, Hamid was taken ill and moved into emergency accommodation. He died there alone. Like two-thirds of homeless people, Hamid suffered with addiction. And like many people who die homeless, he looked far older than his 55 years. Harlow is one of the new towns built after the second world war to ease overcrowding in London. In its early years it had a thoroughly modern can-do feel to it, boasting Britain\u2019s first all-pedestrian shopping precinct and first modern high-rise residential tower block. But more recently it has fallen on tough times. This year, Harlow\u2019s Conservative MP, Robert Halfon, suggested the town had become a dumping ground for London councils, which have sent hundreds of \u201ctroubled families\u201d to live in converted office blocks in his constituency. The last census, in 2011, showed that Harlow had higher unemployment, less home ownership, lower educational qualifications and poorer health than the average for both Essex and England. In June, however, Halfon said things were looking up for the town. \u201cThe news that homelessness is at its lowest level since 2010 is a real step in the right direction,\u201d he declared. Halfon quoted the absurdly low figure of five homeless people, and was soon corrected by a local Labour councillor, Tony Edwards, who pointed out that the figure referred to rough sleeping not homelessness, and that in fact more than 4,500 people were on the housing-needs register in Harlow and about 400 people had made \u201chomeless\u201d applications in 2018/19. That paints a very different picture. It means that, with a population of 85,000, 5.3% of people in the town are waiting to have a housing need met. It is 18 months since Hamid died, and we meet Protheroe in the Tesco superstore cafe where he and Hamid would often get together for coffee and bacon sandwiches. Protheroe is business-like and comes straight to the point. He says he doesn\u2019t want us to get the wrong impression; he\u2019s not a do-gooder. He considered Hamid a friend rather than a charity case. \u201cI\u2019m not a selfish bastard, but I\u2019m not out to help everybody I can,\u201d he says. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019ll help animals more than I\u2019ll help people. I just got to know Hamid and we became mates.\u201d In 1981, when he turned 19, Hamid was conscripted into the army to fight in the Iran-Iraq war Hamid told Protheroe he had ended up homeless in 2017 after selling his pension in a dodgy deal and then running into money troubles. But even here there is a mystery. Unlike most people living on the streets, he still had savings in the bank. He camped in woodland close to Tesco until his tent was set alight. Protheroe says Hamid told him that teenagers were responsible, but he didn\u2019t like to talk about it. Soon after this a Harlow local gave Hamid the old Peugeot 206. He parked it by Tesco and moved in. The interior of his car-home was crammed with donated clothes and books \u2013 science books, spiritual self-help guides, novels, all sorts. The only space left for Hamid was the passenger seat. Protheroe thought his friend might be an eccentric hoarder. Hamid told him he spoke seven languages, that he had a PhD in astrophysics and theoretical maths, and mentioned the job he almost got with the late Prof Hawking. He also talked about fighting in the Iran-Iraq war, showed him photographs of members of his platoon who had died, and told him he suffered from terrible flashbacks. That\u2019s why he drank, he said \u2013 to blot out the memories. Protheroe is surprised by how well they got to know each other in such a short period of time. He would find himself visiting Hamid at night to make sure he was OK. Although Hamid was a good deal older, 41-year-old Protheroe found himself playing a paternal role. He would often tick Hamid off about the state of his car-home. \u201cI\u2019d open up the car door and he\u2019d been smoking roll-ups in there. I said you\u2019ve got to sleep in there, and there\u2019s smoke billowing out. It wasn\u2019t the kind of car I would have liked to have slept in, if I\u2019m being honest. Hamid wasn\u2019t very tidy. I\u2019d have a go at him \u2013 \u2018Sort yourself out, you look like a sack of shit, you need to run a brush through your hair.\u2019 I\u2019d just have a dig at him and we\u2019d have a bit of back and forth. He\u2019d laugh at me, and take the piss.\u201d * * * Like Protheroe, Chrissy Sorce is almost apologetic about befriending Hamid. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I took to him. I don\u2019t go out and randomly do that to everybody. It\u2019s just something about him \u2013 he was likable.\u201d Sorce, who is 51, works at a car-rental firm based in the industrial park next to Tesco. \u201cHe parked the Peugeot behind our workplace, and I just started chatting to him on my fag breaks,\u201d she recalls. Sorce talks about his fondness for scratch cards \u2013 \u201cHe was always trying to win millions, bless him\u201d \u2013 and how she stored books for him in her daughter\u2019s shed to free up space in the Peugeot. \u201cThey were quite intellectual books. He was very educated. But something obviously went wrong somewhere along the line, which can happen, can\u2019t it?\u201d Hamid told Sorce many fascinating and funny stories. But for all that, there was a terrible vulnerability about him, she says. \u201cIt was all a fake, really, because at the end of the day he was still lying in that car and sleeping in the freezing cold.\u201d Sometimes when he was drunk he would weep and tell her he wished he was dead. Sorce says she told him not to be daft, and to take any opportunity that came along. But she admits, at this stage of his life, few opportunities were coming his way. \u201cI think the council could have housed him. He could have been put in a room a lot sooner, surely. They all knew where he was.\u201d Adam Protheroe says he often used to tell Hamid off about the state of his Peugeot home. Photograph: Adam Protheroe What she most liked about Hamid is that he didn\u2019t want anything from her. \u201cHe never even asked me for a pound.\u201d She pauses and smiles. \u201cHe did ask me to go out for dinner, though, but I had to let him down and say no. I think he liked the women. He would go into Tesco and chat to them.\u201d She once did his washing for him, she says. \u201cI washed and ironed everything. I said to him: \u2018Do you want me to do any more?\u2019 But he never gave me any more to do. He was proud. After I did that, he went out and bought me washing powder to replace what I\u2019d done. I told him not to bother, but he did it anyway.\u201d She knows some people couldn\u2019t understand why she wanted to help him. They said it straight out to her. \u201cWhen I took home his washing \u2013 and yes, it really did stink \u2013 one of my managers said: \u2018Eeeeugh, how could you wash all his clothes?\u2019 I said: \u2018Easy, you just put them in the washing machine and take them out.\u2019\u201d Sorce says she couldn\u2019t help thinking it could just as easily have been her living in that car. \u201cWe\u2019re all one pay cheque away from being homeless. You never know what\u2019s going to bring you down, that\u2019s how I see it.\u201d At times, she says, Hamid seemed confused. She and Protheroe believe he had early-stage dementia. As for his stories, she didn\u2019t know what to make of them. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not, do you? You just go along with it.\u201d * * * Both Sorce and Protheroe were anxious that Hamid should take care of his appearance. They believed that this, coupled with sobriety, could be the difference between him getting a council home or not. That\u2019s why Protheroe ended up taking him to his barber\u2019s one day. \u201cHamid was attending an alcohol dependency therapy group in Harlow,\u201d says Protheroe. \u201cThe idea was that, if he demonstrated he could get off the booze, they would recommend that the council should give him somewhere to live. I was trying to sober him up and make him look a bit more respectable. So I took him to my barber. Hamid had this big old white Father Christmas beard and he took all that off, cut his hair and he looked like a different person.\u201d It was at the barber\u2019s that Protheroe began to suspect Hamid may have been telling the truth about his academic background. \u201cMy barber is a very intelligent guy, and him and Hamid were having conversations about string theory, this theory, that theory. It was really bizarre to hear Hamid coming out with these things.\u201d Hamid never did get council accommodation, but Protheroe says in some ways he was his own worst enemy. The Harlow homeless project Streets2Homes tried to find a place for Hamid to live. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018We\u2019ve got a room for you, but you can\u2019t drink or smoke in the room, and there are all these rules and regulations.\u2019 Hamid was like \u2018Nononono, I\u2019m not having that.\u2019 And he just wouldn\u2019t do it. If you want help, first of all you\u2019ve got to help yourself. Hamid was like: \u2018I\u2019d rather sit in my car and drink and smoke.\u2019\u201d Protheroe admits he may be being tough on his friend \u2013 insisting that an alcoholic does not drink in his own home is a big ask. Hamid may well have benefited from the Housing First model, whereby homeless people are provided with a home and then addiction issues are addressed with wraparound support. Streets2Homes declined to talk to us for this article. There was also something about the car-home that made Hamid special. He was well known to Tesco customers and became something of a local celebrity. Hamid and his Peugeot had become a landmark. Protheroe reckons Hamid had good reason to be wary of council accommodation. He tells us of the time Hamid was robbed while staying in a hostel. \u201cHe had his bloody pin number written on his bank card and whoever it was that stole it from the hostel emptied his bank, absolutely emptied his bank. So I was on the phone to his bank and tried to get it all sorted out. He had a couple of grand in the bank; that was what was left over from his pension.\u201d Sorce thinks Hamid declined offers of housing because they were not permanent, and he felt he would be even more exposed there. \u201cHe wanted to steer clear of people who were similar to him,\u201d she says. Hamid told her he was offered a place at Terminus House in Harlow, a grim-looking block of flats often described as a \u201chuman warehouse\u201d where hundreds of residents, sent from councils across London, are crammed together in tiny flats. Halfon has referred to the practice of rehousing families from London in his constituency as \u201csocial cleansing\u201d. The building made headlines in July because of a drugs network operating nearby, and police figures show that crime within a 500-metre radius of Terminus House rose 20% in the 10 months after it opened. Rather than accepting a place in Terminus House, Hamid returned to his silver Peugeot, carried on smoking and drinking, and continued to be berated by his good friend for his slovenliness. Protheroe says that somehow Hamid, for all his bad habits and obduracy, brought out an incredible generosity in the Harlow community. One day Hamid broke the key in the lock of the car door, and Protheroe posted a shout-out on Facebook for help. \u201cThis guy got in touch, came down, and sorted him with a key. It was normally a \u00a3200 job, but he did it as a gesture of goodwill.\u201d When the weather turned and Protheroe was worried Hamid might get hypothermia, he set up a GoFundMe page. \u201cA kind-hearted girl phoned me up around midnight, and said: \u2018I can\u2019t stop thinking about this guy. I want to come out and help him.\u2019 I said: \u2018Right, I\u2019ll get out of bed and come and meet you.\u2019 She and her husband drove down in a hundred grand Mercedes AMG Jeep. They paid 400 or 500 quid to put him up in the Park Inn for a week.\u201d Another woman turned up with a huge biscuit tin crammed with cigarettes. \u201cIt was filled to the brim. There must have been a couple of thousand roll-ups in it.\u201d And soon after it became apparent that there was no longer room for Hamid in the Peugeot, another miracle happened. \u201cA guy rocked up with an Audi estate car, which was like twice the size of his existing \u2018premises\u2019. He parked that up behind, and the Peugeot became a storage facility for all the junk while Hamid moved into the Audi.\u201d Family and friends at Hamid\u2019s funeral in Harlow, 4 May 2018. Photographs: Martine Xerri/BPM Media It\u2019s a story deserving of a happy ending. But of course it didn\u2019t have one. Eventually, as he became ill, Hamid did accept help, and during a cold snap in February 2018 he was provided with emergency accommodation by Streets2Homes at the Oasis Hotel in Harlow. Nav Hussein, the hotel manager, checked on Hamid after receiving a concerned call over his whereabouts. When he went to his room, he saw two empty bottles of alcohol, and Hamid sitting upright on the bed. Hussein called out to him, but received no reply. He then noticed there was something different about the colour of Hamid\u2019s hands and realised he was dead. The autopsy revealed that Hamid had died of organ failure, but Protheroe is convinced he had simply lost the will to live. At the time, Hamid was on a complex cocktail of medication. \u201cI think that it had got to the point where he\u2019d just had enough, and he stopped taking his meds.\u201d A few weeks after his death, the council arranged a funeral for Hamid. Protheroe was disappointed by the turnout. He was pleased that Hamid\u2019s family were there, but wondered where they had been when his friend needed them most. * * * Hamid Farahi Alamdari\u2019s Facebook was last updated in November 2015. It states he started a new job as an aircraft engineer in 2006, and that he worked as an aircraft maintenance engineer for British Airways World Cargo. Most of his \u201cfriends\u201d are beautiful young women from any number of countries, and a few are aviation engineers and fellow Iranians. His Facebook biography says he graduated from Bristol Aeronautical University in 1997. But there is no Bristol Aeronautical University. There is a renowned aerospace engineering department at Bristol University. However, Bristol University tells us Hamid never studied there. British Airways refuses to confirm that he worked there. At the bottom of the list of friends is a man called Ariane F Alamdari. Ariane is Hamid\u2019s nephew. Over the phone he tells us that his uncle could be a difficult man, particularly when he was drinking, but he did not believe he was a liar. \u201cOf all his personality traits, embellishing the truth or telling fibs was not one of the things that I knew him for.\u201d Ariane says the details of his uncle\u2019s life are a puzzle to him. He introduces us to his father, Hamid\u2019s older brother Saeed, who he says can tell us more. Saeed is a 64-year-old academic who lectures in engineering at Bradford College and lives in Roundhay, a well-to-do suburb of Leeds. We meet in Roundhay Park, one of Europe\u2019s largest city parks. Saeed is a short, slight man, who carries himself with an easy elegance. He has just completed the first half of his regular 10-mile walk around the lake. Saeed talks quietly and thoughtfully about Hamid and their parents, who came to Iran from Azerbaijan and spoke Turkish. He says that he was the lucky brother. Because he was eight years older than Hamid, he managed to leave Iran for the UK before the shah was overthrown and Ayatollah Khomeini established an Islamic republic in Iran. This was the main thing that set their lives apart, he says. Saeed does not pretend to know every detail of his brother\u2019s life. There were so many years they were apart. Like us, he has been trying to piece together a complex jigsaw since Hamid\u2019s death. Saeed Alamdari says it was was obvious from early on that his brother was outstandingly gifted. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian Saeed and Hamid were two of four children born into a middle-class family in Tehran. Their parents were practising Muslims and their children grew up in a secular Iran. Their father had a good, stable job working in security for the ministry of health, while their mother brought up the children. Saeed says it was obvious from early on that young Hamid was outstandingly gifted. \u201cHe was good at all sorts of sports, but most of all he was academically brilliant.\u201d Both boys were drawn to the sciences, engineering and maths. There was something else that stood out about young Hamid \u2013 he loved to take risks. \u201cHe and his friends used to go on to the roof of mosques and jump off them, and the curator would chase them,\u201d recalls Saeed. \u201cHe liked getting chased. He wanted to be on the edge.\u201d Life changed for everybody after the revolution of 1979. By then Saeed had already established himself in the UK. He left Tehran in 1974, studied mechanical and aerospace engineering at Leeds University, did a masters degree in combustion and settled to a life in academia. Hamid was only 16 at the time of the revolution. In 1981, when he turned 19, he was conscripted into the army to fight in the Iran-Iraq war, which had begun the previous year. Because he was such a high achiever, he was drafted in as a lieutenant. Saeed shows us a photo of a fresh-faced Hamid, standing at ease in an army uniform that looks a couple of sizes too big for him. However, Saeed thinks he was anything but at ease. Here was a young man responsible for the lives of so many other men who simply didn\u2019t want to be there. \u201cHe had a platoon under his control, and most of these soldiers were drafted from villages. Hamid told me that on the day they were leaving for the front, the soldiers\u2019 mothers got together and told him: \u2018We\u2019re leaving our sons in your hands.\u2019 And during the war he lost most of his platoon \u2013 he always blamed himself for that.\u201d Saeed says the war left Hamid with post-traumatic stress disorder. Hamid suffered a recurring nightmare \u2013 that Iraqi soldiers were coming towards him with their hands raised, but he shot them anyway. After leaving the army, he went to India to study physics and to try to heal himself. Hamid told Saeed he studied for a degree, then completed a PhD. He also said he spent much of the time meditating and reading the great 13th-century Persian poets Rumi and Shams Tabrizi. \u201cI think meditating and reading were coping mechanisms for him,\u201d Saeed says. But by now Hamid also had another coping mechanism: booze. After India, Hamid returned to Tehran, where he found himself in trouble. He could not cope with the oppressive regime or the alcohol ban. On one occasion, Hamid told Saeed, he and his friends were sentenced to 80 lashes after being caught drinking. \u201cBut one of his friends had a hump on his back, and Hamid said: \u2018You\u2019re not going to lash him.\u2019 He was asked: \u2018Well, do you want to take his punishment?\u2019 He said: \u2018I will\u2019, and he received 160 lashes. That\u2019s when he came to the conclusion that this was not the place for him.\u201d Tributes left on Hamid\u2019s car following his death. Photograph: Adam Protheroe In the mid-90s, Hamid came to the UK. He was in his early 30s and lived with his sister in Croydon while doing an admin job with the charity Age UK and studying English at Croydon College. According to Saeed, he won the college\u2019s student of the year award. From there he moved to Bristol, but Saeed says that, rather than studying at university, as suggested on his Facebook profile, Hamid attended Bristol College to get a diploma to enable him to work on planes. It was around this time that he made his application to become Stephen Hawking\u2019s assistant at the University of Cambridge. A letter dated 31 August 1997 confirms his application for the post, but there does not appear to be any correspondence about his shortlisting. Hamid didn\u2019t get the job as Hawking\u2019s assistant, but was employed as an aeronautical engineer in Bristol. He had a stable job, lived with a girlfriend and made a decent life for himself. Saeed says these were his happiest years in Britain. But even then his brother had noticed a change. He had always been a risk-taker, but now he was becoming positively reckless. Hamid told him of a time he had gone to a drug-dealer\u2019s house in Bristol to buy cannabis. \u201cHe said they had machetes and everything, and all the drugs were on the table. He and his friend took everything from the table and just ran away. For a few months he had to stay low. It\u2019s not that he needed the money. He did it for the high.\u201d In 2008 Hamid lost his job, and went on a downward spiral. He moved to the market town of Great Dunmow in Essex and stayed with a friend for a while. By now it was obvious to Saeed that his brother was addicted to alcohol and cannabis and that his life was becoming increasingly chaotic. At one point, Saeed paid for Hamid to go to Afghanistan for an interview for a job at a US air force base. Hamid also told Saeed that he went to Saudi Arabia to be interviewed for a post in avionics. But neither of these jobs materialised. Hamid would often phone Saeed at work, asking for money. Eventually, Saeed had to give an instruction not to put Hamid\u2019s calls through to him. Saeed had his own problems. He and his wife had separated and he was looking after his son, who has Asperger\u2019s. When Hamid came to stay in Leeds, he inevitably brought trouble. There was one terrible weekend in 2011 when, within 20 minutes of Hamid arriving, there was a knock on Saeed\u2019s door. It was Hamid\u2019s drug dealer. \u201cI was furious that he had arranged that. I told him, you come here whenever you want, Hamid, but no drugs. I\u2019ve a son living with me \u2013 no drugs, no alcohol.\u201d The next day they were walking back to Saeed\u2019s car. \u201cHe had fallen behind me, and I realised he was drinking from a bottle of whisky in a brown paper bag. His face was getting redder and redder. When he saw me looking at him, he put it in his pocket. I dragged it out and smashed it on the floor. I said: \u2018Didn\u2019t I tell you, if you\u2019re coming here, no alcohol.\u2019 I had my son with me.\u201d Saeed couldn\u2019t cope with his brother\u2019s behaviour. \u201cOn the Monday, I took him to the bus station. I shook hands with him and I said: \u2018I\u2019ll see you in another world.\u2019\u201d That was the last time the brothers saw each other. Hamid would occasionally phone \u2013 usually asking for money. \u201cThe last time he phoned was three in the morning. His speech was slurred. I said to him: \u2018Assume you have no brother.\u2019\u201d Saeed looks out on to the lake. He says he knows he was hard on Hamid, but he felt he had to choose between his brother and his son\u2019s welfare. \u201cI have my regrets,\u201d he says. \u201cPossibly I was asking too much from him.\u201d It was around five years later, in 2017, that Hamid sold his pension and ended up homeless. A year later he died. Hamid Farahi Alamdari \u2013 physicist, spiritualist, risk-taker, addict, war veteran. He may have fought his war in a faraway country for a remote regime, but in many ways he was typical of the thousands of British war veterans who are homeless \u2013 never shaking off the ghosts of the battlefield and left with lifelong PTSD. He might have told all the friends he made in that industrial park in Harlow about the beautiful and clever things in life, but ultimately it is his confessions about nightmares and the psychological scars left by war that left the strongest impression. As for the PhD and being shortlisted for the job with Hawking, who knows? All his friends are certain of is that he had exceptional ability, that he died a disappointed man, and that they miss him. Adam Protheroe and Chrissy Sorce knew him for less than a year, but he changed their lives. Sorce says she knows she helped Hamid, but she still thinks she let him down at the end. \u201cI felt a bit bad because he messaged me a few times and I was so busy with my own family that I didn\u2019t really respond back to him as much as I should have. I did feel something towards him. He had a nice nature. I have a plant here he bought me for Christmas. I called it Hamid.\u201d It\u2019s a large succulent, is thriving and sits on her windowsill at home. At the cafe in Harlow, Protheroe says he can\u2019t drive past Tesco these days without thinking of his friend. He was \u201cgutted\u201d when he heard of Hamid\u2019s death. He mentions a book Hamid gave him as a present. \u201cIt\u2019s called The Prophet. It\u2019s only a thin book, and it was just inspirational stuff \u2013 live your life this way, do good, be the best person you can.\u201d It means a lot to him, he says. Back in Leeds, Saeed admits it was a shock when he discovered Hamid had been living in a car and died homeless. He says he can\u2019t express just how grateful he is to the people of Harlow for looking after Hamid when he had given up. \u201cWe were stunned by the number of books in the car, the clothes that people had given him, all the flowers at his funeral.\u201d He spends a lot of time reflecting on his brother\u2019s life, and says that these days he can remember the good times more easily. \u201cAstrophysics was a favourite subject of his. Parallel universes.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cIt was a waste of a good life. I\u2019m just hoping that in other universes, parallel universes, Hamid will be living a better life.\u201d Saeed and his sister decided not to tell their 90-year-old mother, who still lives in Iran, about Hamid\u2019s death because they thought it would break her heart. \u201cBut about a week after he died, she called my sister from Iran saying: \u2018I\u2019m getting these dreams \u2013 either Hamid is ill or he is dead, which is it?\u2019 And then my sister said: \u2018Yes, he has passed away.\u2019\u201d Saeed says that his mother was relieved Hamid is finally at peace. Saeed is getting ready for the second half of his walk around Roundhay Park. Sometimes he meets a man in the park who reminds him of his brother. \u201cSeven o\u2019clock in the morning he\u2019s feeding swans, and he\u2019s got a bottle of wine with him,\u201d Saeed says. \u201cThere will come a time when I will strike a conversation with him. \u2018Listen, I had a brother and he went right through what you\u2019re going through now.\u2019\u201d For now, Saeed just tells him to take care of himself.

      "body": "<p>In its first issue of 2010, the scientific journal Nature looked forward to a dazzling decade of progress. By 2020, experimental devices connected to the internet would deduce our search queries by directly monitoring our brain signals. Crops would exist that doubled their biomass in three hours. Humanity would be well on the way to ending its dependency on fossil fuels.</p> <p>A few weeks later, a letter in the same journal cast a shadow over this bright future. It warned that all these advances could be derailed by mounting political instability, which was due to peak in the US and western Europe around 2020. Human societies go through predictable periods of growth, the letter explained, during which the population increases and prosperity rises. Then come equally predictable periods of decline. These \u201csecular cycles\u201d last two or three centuries and culminate in widespread unrest \u2013 from worker uprisings to revolution.</p> <p>In recent decades, the letter went on, a number of worrying social indicators \u2013 such as wealth inequality and public debt \u2013 had started to climb in western nations, indicating that these societies were approaching a period of upheaval. The letter-writer would go on to predict that the turmoil in the US in 2020 would be less severe than the American civil war, but worse than the violence of the late 1960s and early 70s, when the murder rate spiked, civil rights and anti-Vietnam war protests intensified and domestic terrorists carried out thousands of bombings across the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/28/history-as-a-giant-data-set-how-analysing-the-past-could-help-save-the-future\">History as a giant data set: how analysing the past could help save the future \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The author of this stark warning was not a historian, but a biologist. For the first few decades of his career, Peter Turchin had used sophisticated maths to show how the interactions of predators and prey produce oscillations in animal populations in the wild. He had published in the journals Nature and Science and become respected in his field, but by the late 1990s he had answered all the ecological questions that interested him. He found himself drawn to history instead: could the rise and fall of human societies also be captured by a handful of variables and some differential equations?</p> <p>Turchin set out to determine whether history, like physics, follows certain laws. In 2003, he published a book called Historical Dynamics, in which he discerned secular cycles in France and Russia from their origins to the end of the 18th century. That same year, he founded a new field of academic study, called cliodynamics, which seeks to discover the underlying reasons for these historical patterns, and to model them using mathematics, the way one might model changes to the planet\u2019s climate. Seven years later, he started the field\u2019s <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics\" title=\"\">first official journal</a> and co-founded a database of historical and archaeological information, which now contains data on more than 450 historical societies. The database can be used to compare societies across large stretches of time and space, as well as to make predictions about coming political instability. In 2017, Turchin founded a working group of historians, semioticians, physicists and others to help anticipate the future of human societies based on historical evidence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61dc31a449fabf45c51c22d740d1f2e59018aba6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61dc31a449fabf45c51c22d740d1f2e59018aba6/0_243_3206_1924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Turchin, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, anthropology and mathematics at the University of Connecticut.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Turchin, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, anthropology and mathematics at the University of Connecticut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Turchin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Turchin\u2019s approach to history, which uses software to find patterns in massive amounts of historical data, has only become possible recently, thanks to the growth in cheap computing power and the development of large historical datasets. This \u201cbig data\u201d approach is now becoming increasingly popular in historical disciplines. Tim Kohler, an archaeologist at Washington State University, believes we are living through \u201cthe glory days\u201d of his field, because scholars can pool their research findings with unprecedented ease and extract real knowledge from them. In the future, Turchin believes, historical theories will be tested against large databases, and the ones that do not fit \u2013 many of them long-cherished \u2013 will be discarded. Our understanding of the past will converge on something approaching an objective truth.</p> <p>To some, the prediction that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/463608a\" title=\"\">Turchin made</a> in Nature in 2010 now seems remarkably prescient. Barring any last-minute surprises, the search engine that decodes your brainwaves won\u2019t exist by 2020. Nor will crops that double their biomass in three hours, or an energy budget that is mostly supplied by renewables. But an imminent upheaval in the political order of the US or UK seems increasingly plausible. The <a href=\"https://fragilestatesindex.org/\" title=\"\">Fragile States Index</a>, calculated by the US non-profit The Fund for Peace, reveals a worsening trend toward instability in those two countries, in contrast to steady improvement in much of the rest of the world.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in an age of considerable turbulence, matched only by the great age of Atlantic revolutions,\u201d says George Lawson, who studies political conflict at the London School of Economics, referring to the period from the 1770s to the 1870s, when violent uprisings overthrew monarchies from France to the New World.</p> <p>Turchin sees his prediction for 2020 not just as a test of one controversial theory. It could also be a taste of things to come: a world in which scholars generate the equivalent of extreme weather warnings for the social and political conditions of the future \u2013 along with advice on how to survive them.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For most academics who study the past, explaining why something happened once is very different from predicting how and when it will happen again. \u201cWe cannot produce laws,\u201d says Timur Kuran, an economist and political scientist at Duke University.</p> <p>It is no accident that this view is being challenged by mathematicians and biologists such as Turchin. What their disciplines have in common is the science of complexity, which teaches that a system composed of even just a few moving parts can produce complex patterns of behaviour because of the different ways in which those parts interact. The sun, the Earth\u2019s surface and the Earth\u2019s atmosphere interact to produce weather, for example. Those interactions can be captured mathematically, in sets of equations, or laws, that predict the system\u2019s behaviour under different conditions. This is essentially what the weather forecast does.</p> <p>Complexity science had its origins in physics, in the study of the behaviour of elementary particles, but over the course of the past century it slowly spread to other disciplines. As late as the 1950s, few cell biologists would have conceded that cell division could be described mathematically; they assumed it was random. Now they take that fact for granted, and their mathematical models of cell division have led to better cancer treatments. In ecology, too, it is accepted that patterns exist in nature that can be described mathematically. Lemmings do not commit mass suicide, as Walt Disney would have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMZlr5Gf9yY\" title=\"\">had us believe</a>, but they do go through predictable four-year boom-and-bust cycles driven by their interactions with predators, and possibly also with their own food supply. In 2008, the Nobel-prize winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann declared it was only a matter of time before laws of history would be found, too. It would not happen, however, until all those who study the past \u2013 historians, demographers, economists and others \u2013 realised that working in their specialist siloes, while necessary, was not sufficient. \u201cWe have neglected the crucial supplementary discipline of taking a crude look at the whole,\u201d said Gell-Mann.</p> <p>Many historians consider this mathematical approach to history to be problematic. They tend to believe that lessons can be drawn from the past, but only in a very limited way \u2013 the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland might shed light on current tensions there, for example. These days, few historians search for general laws that apply across centuries and societies, or that can be used to predict the future in any meaningful way. That was the goal of the scientific historians of the 19th century, many of whom were inspired by social Darwinism, and it is an approach now regarded as deeply flawed, as well as fatally connected to narratives of empire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe as a community of modern social scientists have invested 60 years of concerted effort in stripping away the racism and sexism and general Eurocentrism inclusive in those narratives,\u201d says historian Jo Guldi of the Southern Methodist University in Texas, adding that there is a fear among historians that mathematical approaches will drag them backwards. There is also the old mistrust between the sciences and the humanities. When Guldi and Harvard historian David Armitage called for their discipline to embrace big data and take a longer view of the past, in their 2014 book The History Manifesto, they were slammed in the leading US journal in their field, The American Historical Review. \u201cIt was probably one of the bloodiest attacks of the last 30 years,\u201d says Guldi. There is a visceral feeling, not only among historians but also among many ordinary people, that humans cannot be reduced to data points and equations. How can an equation predict a Joan of Arc, or an Oliver Cromwell? \u201cHistory is not a science,\u201d says Diarmaid MacCulloch, a historian at the University of Oxford, summing up that view. \u201cAt the bottom of it is human behaviour, and that is terrifyingly unpredictable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis argument gets it exactly wrong,\u201d argues Turchin, who since the early 1990s has been a professor in the <a href=\"https://eeb.uconn.edu/faculty/#\" title=\"\">department of </a><a href=\"https://eeb.uconn.edu/faculty/#\" title=\"\">ecology and </a><a href=\"https://eeb.uconn.edu/faculty/#\" title=\"\">evolutionary </a><a href=\"https://eeb.uconn.edu/faculty/#\" title=\"\">biology</a> at the University of Connecticut, and is now also affiliated with the <a href=\"https://www.csh.ac.at/\" title=\"\">Complexity Science Hub</a> in Vienna. \u201cIt is because social systems are so complex that we need mathematical models.\u201d Importantly, the resulting laws are probabilistic, not deterministic, meaning that they accommodate the element of chance. But this does not mean they are hollow: if a weather forecast tells you there is an 80% chance of rain, you pack your umbrella. Peter J Richerson, a leading scholar of cultural evolution at the University of California in Davis, says that historical patterns such as secular cycles do exist, and that Turchin has \u201cthe only sensible causal account\u201d of them. (It is also, Richeson points out, the only such account for now; the field is young, and different theories may follow.)</p> <p>Other historians believe that Turchin\u2019s work \u2013 which incorporates not just history and maths, but also the research of economists, other social scientists, and environmental scientists \u2013 provides a much-needed corrective to decades of specialisation within these disciplines. \u201cWe in historical and social scientific fields desperately need this kind of overarching, cooperative, comparative effort,\u201d wrote Gary Feinman, an archaeologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, after a 2016 workshop with Turchin and his colleagues. Still, others are excited about the new insights that might emerge from studying human societies in the same way as complex biological systems. Several Silicon Valley executives have also taken a keen interest in Turchin\u2019s forecasting. \u201cThey get it,\u201d Turchin says. \u201cBut then they have two questions. How can they make money out of the situation? And when should they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/15/why-silicon-valley-billionaires-are-prepping-for-the-apocalypse-in-new-zealand\" title=\"\">buy their plot in New Zealand</a>?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Turchin began looking for mathematical descriptions of history in the late 1990s, he found that another scholar had laid much of the groundwork for him, two decades earlier. Jack Goldstone was a mathematician-turned-historian who, as a Harvard student, once used maths to codify Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s ideas about democracy. \u201cI tried to produce De Tocqueville\u2019s argument as a set of equations,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cI did not get a good grade.\u201d Goldstone went on to become the first person to apply complexity science to human history, and to conclude that political instability was cyclical. The result was a mathematical description of revolution \u2013 one half of a model of societal change that Turchin has gone on to complete.</p> <p>At the time Goldstone began his research, in the mid-70s, the prevailing view of revolution was best understood as a form of class conflict. But Goldstone made two observations that did not fit that view. First, individuals from the same classes, or even the same families, often ended up fighting on opposite sides. And second, revolutions had clustered in certain periods of history \u2013 the 14th and 17th centuries, the late 18th-to-early 19th centuries \u2013 but there was no obvious reason why class tensions should have boiled over in those periods and not in others. He suspected there were deeper forces at work, and he wanted to know what they were.</p> <p>Serendipitously, and because he was short of cash, Goldstone ended up working as a teaching assistant for a Harvard demographer named George Masnick, who showed him the deep social, political and economic impact of the baby boom in the US, following the second world war. That youth bulge was accompanied by new tensions in society, including pressure on the labour market and a hunger for radical ideologies. Goldstone wondered if booms such as this might have contributed to other societies\u2019 periods of upheaval, and in the 80s he began combing the archives for information on population growth in the decades prior to European revolutions.</p> <p>Only a few years earlier, the level of detail he needed would not have been available, but the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure in the UK, along with similar groups across Europe, had begun painstakingly reconstructing population histories based on sources such as parish records. Goldstone was also encouraged by the publication in 1978 of Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones\u2019s Atlas of World Population History, in which they highlighted an \u201castonishing synchronicity\u201d in population booms and busts across Eurasia over millennia. A few months into his number-crunching, he had his eureka moment: \u201cIt was astounding: there really was a three-generation surge in population growth before every major revolution or rebellion in history.\u201d</p> <p>In the 18th century, the Rev Thomas Malthus argued that a population eventually outgrows its resources, imploding in a toxic cloud of conflict and disease until, reduced once again to manageable proportions, it enters a new phase of growth. The theory Goldstone went on to construct borrowed from Malthus, but importantly, it removed the dismal inevitability of that cycle. It claimed that population growth exerts pressure on societies, which they channel in complex and idiosyncratic ways. The analogy he uses is that of an earthquake. Seismic forces accumulate beneath a plateau until it starts to shake, but whether the buildings on the plateau stand, fall or sustain some intermediate level of damage depends on how they were constructed. That is why revolutions cluster in history, but within a given period of turbulence not all societies succumb.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7efeabbf8e38d521f430b19fa6f4d2f043ff657b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7efeabbf8e38d521f430b19fa6f4d2f043ff657b/0_0_3385_2585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"belfast troubles northern ireland british army vehicle boys throwing rocks and bottles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"764\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Belfast during the Troubles: \u2018Many historians consider this mathematical approach to history to be problematic.

In other words, he was dealing with a complex system whose behaviour was best captured mathematically. His model of why revolutions occur consists of a set of equations, but a crude verbal description goes something like this: as the population grows there comes a point where it outstrips the ability of the land to support it. The standard of living of the masses falls, increasing their potential for violent mobilisation. The state tries to counteract this \u2013 for example, by capping rents \u2013 but such measures alienate the elite whose financial interests they hurt. Since the elite has also been expanding, and competing ever more fiercely for a finite pool of high-status jobs and trappings, the class as a whole is less willing to accept further losses. So the state must tap its own coffers to quell the masses, driving up national debt. The more indebted it becomes, the less flexibility it has to respond to further strains. Eventually, marginalised members of the elite side with the masses against the state, violence breaks out and the government is too weak to contain it.</p> <p>Goldstone suggested ways of measuring mass mobilisation potential, elite competition and state solvency, and defined something he called the political stress indicator (psi or \u03a8), which was the product of all three. He showed that \u03a8 spiked prior to the French Revolution, the English civil war and two other major 17th-century conflicts \u2013 the Ottoman crisis in Asia Minor, and the Ming-Qing transition in China. In each case, however, there had been one more factor in the mix: chance. Some tiny rupture \u2013 a harvest failure, say, or a foreign aggression \u2013 that in other circumstances might have been absorbed easily, against a backdrop of rising \u03a8 caused conflict to erupt. Although you could not predict the trigger \u2013 meaning you could not know precisely when the crisis would occur \u2013 you could measure the structural pressures and hence, the risk of such a crisis.</p> <p>It was a simple model, and Goldstone acknowledged as much. Although he could show that high \u03a8 predicted historical revolutions, he had no way of predicting what came next. That depended on the precise combination of the three components of \u03a8, and on how they interacted with a given society\u2019s institutions. Incomplete as they were, his efforts led him to see revolution in a depressing new light: not as a democratic correction to an inflexible and corrupt ancien regime, but as a response to an ecological crisis \u2013 the inability of a society to absorb rapid population growth \u2013 that rarely resolved that crisis.</p> <p>Nor were these patterns confined to the past. As Goldstone was putting the finishing touches to his magnum opus, Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World, the Soviet Union was unravelling. He pointed out that \u03a8 had risen dramatically across the Soviet bloc in the two decades prior to 1989, and that it was persistently high in developing countries. He also wrote that: \u201cIt is quite astonishing the degree to which the United States today is, in respect of its state finances and its elites\u2019 attitudes, following the path that led early modern states to crisis.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Goldstone\u2019s book came out in 1991, historians were scathing. The British historian Lawrence Stone, writing in The New York Review of Books, described Goldstone\u2019s work as \u201cfar too bold and vague in constructing a thing called a political stress indicator, which is about as real as a unicorn\u201d. Goldstone admits that it did not have the impact he had hoped. \u201cBoth the book and I fell a little bit between the cracks,\u201d he recalls. Then one day in 1997 he got a call from Peter Turchin.</p> <p>At the time, Turchin was going through what he jokingly calls his \u201cmid-life crisis\u201d \u2013 when, aged 40, he ditched biology and ran off with history. Part of what attracted him to the question of why societies implode is that he had personally witnessed one self-destruct. He was born in Russia, but his family defected to the US in 1978, and he did not return to Moscow until 1992. \u201cThat was the year things collapsed completely,\u201d he recalls. It was December \u2013 \u201cdark, horrible. There were drunk people lying everywhere.\u201d He and his wife passed a blown-up car on the way to the market and watched mafiosi extort cash from terrified stallholders while the police looked on. These were images that stayed with him.</p> <p>When Turchin came across Goldstone\u2019s book, he found it \u201cremarkable\u201d, he says. But the model was incomplete: \u201cHe described how societies got into crisis, not how they got out of it.\u201d So Turchin decided to complete the model, and to find out whether it applied to human societies over a much greater swathe of time and space. Goldstone had focused on the early modern period \u2013 roughly the four centuries from 1500; Turchin would push the survey\u2019s start date back nearly 8,000 years, to the Neolithic. That meant collecting vast quantities of data, and in this he was lucky: history\u2019s quantitative turn, which had begun with the plundering of those parish registers in the 1970s, had only accelerated in the decades since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"457b197ec0f73e6cf32310af7221e67298fafd81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/457b197ec0f73e6cf32310af7221e67298fafd81/0_0_1833_2333/786.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018How can an equation predict a Joan of Arc, or an Oliver Cromwell?\u2019\" width=\"786\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018How can an equation predict a Joan of Arc, or an Oliver Cromwell?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though the historical record remained fragmented and patchy, it was now possible to say novel things about how extinct people lived even when there was no written trace of them \u2013 and better still, from a mathematician\u2019s point of view, to put numbers on them. Ice cores from Greenland turn out to be an exquisite proxy for economic activity in Europe, for example, because the permafrost traps pollution and tracks its fluctuations over centuries. The size and construction of aristocrats\u2019 villas speak to elite competition, and coin hoards to anxieties about looming strife, while skeletal malformations reveal malnutrition \u2013 a proxy for standard of living. The informational value of these proxies had long been recognised, but now there was quantitative data on them spanning decades and sometimes centuries, meaning that you could discern trends over time. The more proxies you had for a given variable, the more accurate a picture of the past you could paint.</p> <p>In Historical Dynamics, in 2003, Turchin demonstrated a pattern of secular cycles in the societies that evolved into modern-day France and Russia from the first millennium BC until roughly 1800. He also showed that there were shorter oscillations in the stability of these societies, lasting about 50 years, which he called \u201cfathers-and-sons cycles\u201d: perceiving a social injustice, one generation set out to redress it violently, the next shrank from violence having grown up with its aftermath, the third started all over again.</p> <p>Many scholars were as sceptical of Turchin as they had been of Goldstone a dozen years before. \u201cSerious historians,\u201d Joseph Tainter, a historian and anthropologist at Utah State University, wrote in Nature, \u201chave long held cyclical theories in disrepute.\u201d But Turchin had only just got started. He poured his energy into data collection, and in 2010 \u2013 as a way of better organising those data to support comparison across societies \u2013 he and two anthropologists at the University of Oxford launched <a href=\"http://seshatdatabank.info/seshat-about-us/seshat-who-we-are/\" title=\"\">Seshat</a>, a database of historical and archaeological information named after the ancient Egyptian goddess of record-keeping.</p> <p>Seshat has come in for criticism of the kind that has been directed at big data more generally. Just because there is lots of it, critics say, does not mean that the data is more reliable. On the contrary, such a database risks amplifying the interpretative biases of those who initially recorded the information, while stripping it of its context. Seshat\u2019s founders counter that bias is a problem in history generally, and only the analysis of large quantities of data allows a signal \u2013 something approaching the truth \u2013 to detach itself from that noise.</p> <p>To date, Seshat\u2019s founders and their 90-odd \u201cexpert collaborators\u201d \u2013 including eminent historians, archaeologists and anthropologists \u2013 have gathered data on societies from the lowland Andes to the Cambodian basin and Iceland to Upper Egypt. Analysing these, Turchin showed that the same two interacting cycles \u2013 secular and fathers-and-sons \u2013 fit patterns of instability across Europe and Asia going back as far as the first farmers. They were there in ancient Egypt, China and Rome \u2013 in every pre-industrial society he looked at.</p> <p>The next question was obvious: were these cycles also at play in modern, industrial societies? Turchin updated \u03a8 to reflect the forces shaping a modern labour market, and chose new proxies appropriate to an industrialised world. These included real wages for the mobilisation potential of the masses; filibustering rates in the Senate and the cost of tuition at Yale for elite competition; and interest rates for state solvency. Then he calculated \u03a8 in the US from 1780 to the present day. It was low in the so-called Era of Good Feelings around 1820, high in the 1860s \u2013 around the American civil war \u2013 and low again in the years after the second world war. Since 1970 it had risen steadily. This did not mean we were doomed to crisis, though. Many societies had avoided disaster \u2013 and Turchin was building a model to find out how they had done it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the late 1980s, Turchin had travelled to the forests of Louisiana, where the timber industry funded his research into periodic and costly infestations of a pest called the southern pine beetle. At the time, the standard procedure for controlling the beetle was to spray pesticide at the site of an infestation. Turchin showed that this only prolonged an attack, because it killed off another beetle that was a natural predator of the pest. A better strategy was to fell and remove affected trees. More broadly, he had shown that it was possible to intervene in a complex ecological system to make its crises less severe and maximise its chances of recovery.</p> <p>Turchin hopes to discover similar strategies for easing crises in human societies. If the approach that he and Goldstone take to modelling history is right, it means that they can meaningfully ask not only what 2020 has in store for us, but also what the future holds stretching forward over centuries. We should not expect any prophecies from this new science of history, but it could help us to identify structural threats to our societies\u2019 stability and to act to mitigate them.</p> <p>While societies tend to enter crisis via the path that Goldstone charted, Turchin has found that they leave it via a range of possible trajectories, from rapid recovery to total collapse. That is because crisis renders a society exquisitely sensitive to external perturbation. If no other destabilising thing happens, it could recover \u2013 as England did after the almost bloodless Glorious Revolution of 1688. But one small extra shock could push it towards a worse outcome, even to collapse. The Soviet Union was already in decline before the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986, but Mikhail Gorbachev may not have been entirely wrong when he blamed its downfall on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/16/chernobyl-was-even-worse-than-tv-series-kim-willsher\" title=\"\">that event</a>.</p> <p>To understand this phase of the cycle better, Turchin and others plan to build computer-simulated societies composed of thousands or millions of individuals \u2013 so-called agent-based models \u2013 and programme them to behave according to the laws they have deduced from real societies. They can subject those simulated societies to stress, for example by injecting a virtual youth bulge, and observe the downstream effects on state, elites and masses. Once \u03a8 has reached dangerously high levels, they can add a shock \u2013 in the form of a foreign invasion, say \u2013 or increase resilience by strengthening the society\u2019s infrastructure, and see how it responds. They can ask such questions as: what does it take to nudge a society in crisis toward total collapse? What interventions would divert it towards a less bloody outcome? Why are some societies more resilient than others?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd7acf7f28e770acca1a01f648127c0b2e13a158\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd7acf7f28e770acca1a01f648127c0b2e13a158/335_277_7164_5268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Turchin points to the US New Deal of the 1930s, which he sees as a time when American elites consented to share their growing wealth more equitably ...\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Turchin points to the US New Deal of the 1930s, which he sees as a time when American elites consented to share their growing wealth more equitably ...\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Vachon/ Library of Congress/Courtesy of Taschen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, our experience with the climate crisis suggests that even if we can predict the future the way we can forecast the weather, and come up with a set of preventative measures to stave off social collapse, that does not mean we will be able to muster the political will to act on such recommendations. But while it is true that human societies have in general been far better at reconstruction after disasters than preventing them in the first place, there are exceptions. Turchin points to the US New Deal of the 1930s, which he sees as a time when American elites consented to share their growing wealth more equitably, in return for the implicit agreement that \u201cthe fundamentals of the political-economic system would not be challenged\u201d. This pact, Turchin argues, enabled American society to exit a potentially revolutionary situation.</p> <p>Goldstone continues to spread the message that such pacts can work again. Now a professor of public policy at George Mason University in Virginia, he advises the National Intelligence Council \u2013 the US intelligence body responsible for long-term strategy \u2013 but says his ideas have had little impact so far. At a workshop on societal collapse at Princeton University last April, someone asked him why historical societies had so often failed to act even when the signs of a looming crisis were impossible to ignore. He suggested it was because elites continue to live the high life for some time after things start falling apart, buffered from the upheaval by their wealth and privileges.</p> <p>Turchin believes that historians will soon embrace complexity science, just as biologists did half a century ago. They will come to realise that it allows them to see deeper and further, to discern patterns that are not visible to the human eye. In fact, it is already happening. In the last few years, a handful of institutions have been created, such as the <a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Centre for the Study of Existential Risk</a> at the University of Cambridge, whose goal is to encourage policymakers to think about the long-term lessons of history. The Princeton meeting was attended by a risk analyst employed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, who thinks about how to make the US more resilient to future threats by reference to the past.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/19/crisis-of-statistics-big-data-democracy\">How statistics lost their power \u2013 and why we should fear what comes next | William Davies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To Turchin, these are all encouraging developments, but 2020 is nearly upon us, and lawmaking institutions in both the US and the UK are now so divided along ideological lines that they can barely function.

      "bodyText": "In its first issue of 2010, the scientific journal Nature looked forward to a dazzling decade of progress. By 2020, experimental devices connected to the internet would deduce our search queries by directly monitoring our brain signals. Crops would exist that doubled their biomass in three hours. Humanity would be well on the way to ending its dependency on fossil fuels. A few weeks later, a letter in the same journal cast a shadow over this bright future. It warned that all these advances could be derailed by mounting political instability, which was due to peak in the US and western Europe around 2020. Human societies go through predictable periods of growth, the letter explained, during which the population increases and prosperity rises. Then come equally predictable periods of decline. These \u201csecular cycles\u201d last two or three centuries and culminate in widespread unrest \u2013 from worker uprisings to revolution. In recent decades, the letter went on, a number of worrying social indicators \u2013 such as wealth inequality and public debt \u2013 had started to climb in western nations, indicating that these societies were approaching a period of upheaval. The letter-writer would go on to predict that the turmoil in the US in 2020 would be less severe than the American civil war, but worse than the violence of the late 1960s and early 70s, when the murder rate spiked, civil rights and anti-Vietnam war protests intensified and domestic terrorists carried out thousands of bombings across the country. The author of this stark warning was not a historian, but a biologist. For the first few decades of his career, Peter Turchin had used sophisticated maths to show how the interactions of predators and prey produce oscillations in animal populations in the wild. He had published in the journals Nature and Science and become respected in his field, but by the late 1990s he had answered all the ecological questions that interested him. He found himself drawn to history instead: could the rise and fall of human societies also be captured by a handful of variables and some differential equations? Turchin set out to determine whether history, like physics, follows certain laws. In 2003, he published a book called Historical Dynamics, in which he discerned secular cycles in France and Russia from their origins to the end of the 18th century. That same year, he founded a new field of academic study, called cliodynamics, which seeks to discover the underlying reasons for these historical patterns, and to model them using mathematics, the way one might model changes to the planet\u2019s climate. Seven years later, he started the field\u2019s first official journal and co-founded a database of historical and archaeological information, which now contains data on more than 450 historical societies. The database can be used to compare societies across large stretches of time and space, as well as to make predictions about coming political instability. In 2017, Turchin founded a working group of historians, semioticians, physicists and others to help anticipate the future of human societies based on historical evidence. Turchin\u2019s approach to history, which uses software to find patterns in massive amounts of historical data, has only become possible recently, thanks to the growth in cheap computing power and the development of large historical datasets. This \u201cbig data\u201d approach is now becoming increasingly popular in historical disciplines. Tim Kohler, an archaeologist at Washington State University, believes we are living through \u201cthe glory days\u201d of his field, because scholars can pool their research findings with unprecedented ease and extract real knowledge from them. In the future, Turchin believes, historical theories will be tested against large databases, and the ones that do not fit \u2013 many of them long-cherished \u2013 will be discarded. Our understanding of the past will converge on something approaching an objective truth. To some, the prediction that Turchin made in Nature in 2010 now seems remarkably prescient. Barring any last-minute surprises, the search engine that decodes your brainwaves won\u2019t exist by 2020. Nor will crops that double their biomass in three hours, or an energy budget that is mostly supplied by renewables. But an imminent upheaval in the political order of the US or UK seems increasingly plausible. The Fragile States Index, calculated by the US non-profit The Fund for Peace, reveals a worsening trend toward instability in those two countries, in contrast to steady improvement in much of the rest of the world. \u201cWe are in an age of considerable turbulence, matched only by the great age of Atlantic revolutions,\u201d says George Lawson, who studies political conflict at the London School of Economics, referring to the period from the 1770s to the 1870s, when violent uprisings overthrew monarchies from France to the New World. Turchin sees his prediction for 2020 not just as a test of one controversial theory. It could also be a taste of things to come: a world in which scholars generate the equivalent of extreme weather warnings for the social and political conditions of the future \u2013 along with advice on how to survive them. * * * For most academics who study the past, explaining why something happened once is very different from predicting how and when it will happen again. \u201cWe cannot produce laws,\u201d says Timur Kuran, an economist and political scientist at Duke University. It is no accident that this view is being challenged by mathematicians and biologists such as Turchin. What their disciplines have in common is the science of complexity, which teaches that a system composed of even just a few moving parts can produce complex patterns of behaviour because of the different ways in which those parts interact. The sun, the Earth\u2019s surface and the Earth\u2019s atmosphere interact to produce weather, for example. Those interactions can be captured mathematically, in sets of equations, or laws, that predict the system\u2019s behaviour under different conditions. This is essentially what the weather forecast does. Complexity science had its origins in physics, in the study of the behaviour of elementary particles, but over the course of the past century it slowly spread to other disciplines. As late as the 1950s, few cell biologists would have conceded that cell division could be described mathematically; they assumed it was random. Now they take that fact for granted, and their mathematical models of cell division have led to better cancer treatments. In ecology, too, it is accepted that patterns exist in nature that can be described mathematically. Lemmings do not commit mass suicide, as Walt Disney would have had us believe, but they do go through predictable four-year boom-and-bust cycles driven by their interactions with predators, and possibly also with their own food supply. In 2008, the Nobel-prize winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann declared it was only a matter of time before laws of history would be found, too. It would not happen, however, until all those who study the past \u2013 historians, demographers, economists and others \u2013 realised that working in their specialist siloes, while necessary, was not sufficient. \u201cWe have neglected the crucial supplementary discipline of taking a crude look at the whole,\u201d said Gell-Mann. Many historians consider this mathematical approach to history to be problematic. They tend to believe that lessons can be drawn from the past, but only in a very limited way \u2013 the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland might shed light on current tensions there, for example. These days, few historians search for general laws that apply across centuries and societies, or that can be used to predict the future in any meaningful way. That was the goal of the scientific historians of the 19th century, many of whom were inspired by social Darwinism, and it is an approach now regarded as deeply flawed, as well as fatally connected to narratives of empire. \u201cWe as a community of modern social scientists have invested 60 years of concerted effort in stripping away the racism and sexism and general Eurocentrism inclusive in those narratives,\u201d says historian Jo Guldi of the Southern Methodist University in Texas, adding that there is a fear among historians that mathematical approaches will drag them backwards. There is also the old mistrust between the sciences and the humanities. When Guldi and Harvard historian David Armitage called for their discipline to embrace big data and take a longer view of the past, in their 2014 book The History Manifesto, they were slammed in the leading US journal in their field, The American Historical Review. \u201cIt was probably one of the bloodiest attacks of the last 30 years,\u201d says Guldi. There is a visceral feeling, not only among historians but also among many ordinary people, that humans cannot be reduced to data points and equations. How can an equation predict a Joan of Arc, or an Oliver Cromwell? \u201cHistory is not a science,\u201d says Diarmaid MacCulloch, a historian at the University of Oxford, summing up that view. \u201cAt the bottom of it is human behaviour, and that is terrifyingly unpredictable.\u201d \u201cThis argument gets it exactly wrong,\u201d argues Turchin, who since the early 1990s has been a professor in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut, and is now also affiliated with the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna. \u201cIt is because social systems are so complex that we need mathematical models.\u201d Importantly, the resulting laws are probabilistic, not deterministic, meaning that they accommodate the element of chance. But this does not mean they are hollow: if a weather forecast tells you there is an 80% chance of rain, you pack your umbrella. Peter J Richerson, a leading scholar of cultural evolution at the University of California in Davis, says that historical patterns such as secular cycles do exist, and that Turchin has \u201cthe only sensible causal account\u201d of them. (It is also, Richeson points out, the only such account for now; the field is young, and different theories may follow.) Other historians believe that Turchin\u2019s work \u2013 which incorporates not just history and maths, but also the research of economists, other social scientists, and environmental scientists \u2013 provides a much-needed corrective to decades of specialisation within these disciplines. \u201cWe in historical and social scientific fields desperately need this kind of overarching, cooperative, comparative effort,\u201d wrote Gary Feinman, an archaeologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, after a 2016 workshop with Turchin and his colleagues. Still, others are excited about the new insights that might emerge from studying human societies in the same way as complex biological systems. Several Silicon Valley executives have also taken a keen interest in Turchin\u2019s forecasting. \u201cThey get it,\u201d Turchin says. \u201cBut then they have two questions. How can they make money out of the situation? And when should they buy their plot in New Zealand?\u201d * * * When Turchin began looking for mathematical descriptions of history in the late 1990s, he found that another scholar had laid much of the groundwork for him, two decades earlier. Jack Goldstone was a mathematician-turned-historian who, as a Harvard student, once used maths to codify Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s ideas about democracy. \u201cI tried to produce De Tocqueville\u2019s argument as a set of equations,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cI did not get a good grade.\u201d Goldstone went on to become the first person to apply complexity science to human history, and to conclude that political instability was cyclical. The result was a mathematical description of revolution \u2013 one half of a model of societal change that Turchin has gone on to complete. At the time Goldstone began his research, in the mid-70s, the prevailing view of revolution was best understood as a form of class conflict. But Goldstone made two observations that did not fit that view. First, individuals from the same classes, or even the same families, often ended up fighting on opposite sides. And second, revolutions had clustered in certain periods of history \u2013 the 14th and 17th centuries, the late 18th-to-early 19th centuries \u2013 but there was no obvious reason why class tensions should have boiled over in those periods and not in others. He suspected there were deeper forces at work, and he wanted to know what they were. Serendipitously, and because he was short of cash, Goldstone ended up working as a teaching assistant for a Harvard demographer named George Masnick, who showed him the deep social, political and economic impact of the baby boom in the US, following the second world war. That youth bulge was accompanied by new tensions in society, including pressure on the labour market and a hunger for radical ideologies. Goldstone wondered if booms such as this might have contributed to other societies\u2019 periods of upheaval, and in the 80s he began combing the archives for information on population growth in the decades prior to European revolutions. Only a few years earlier, the level of detail he needed would not have been available, but the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure in the UK, along with similar groups across Europe, had begun painstakingly reconstructing population histories based on sources such as parish records. Goldstone was also encouraged by the publication in 1978 of Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones\u2019s Atlas of World Population History, in which they highlighted an \u201castonishing synchronicity\u201d in population booms and busts across Eurasia over millennia. A few months into his number-crunching, he had his eureka moment: \u201cIt was astounding: there really was a three-generation surge in population growth before every major revolution or rebellion in history.\u201d In the 18th century, the Rev Thomas Malthus argued that a population eventually outgrows its resources, imploding in a toxic cloud of conflict and disease until, reduced once again to manageable proportions, it enters a new phase of growth. The theory Goldstone went on to construct borrowed from Malthus, but importantly, it removed the dismal inevitability of that cycle. It claimed that population growth exerts pressure on societies, which they channel in complex and idiosyncratic ways. The analogy he uses is that of an earthquake. Seismic forces accumulate beneath a plateau until it starts to shake, but whether the buildings on the plateau stand, fall or sustain some intermediate level of damage depends on how they were constructed. That is why revolutions cluster in history, but within a given period of turbulence not all societies succumb. Goldstone recognised that the different components of a society \u2013 state, elites, masses \u2013 would respond differently to strain, but that they would also interact. In other words, he was dealing with a complex system whose behaviour was best captured mathematically. His model of why revolutions occur consists of a set of equations, but a crude verbal description goes something like this: as the population grows there comes a point where it outstrips the ability of the land to support it. The standard of living of the masses falls, increasing their potential for violent mobilisation. The state tries to counteract this \u2013 for example, by capping rents \u2013 but such measures alienate the elite whose financial interests they hurt. Since the elite has also been expanding, and competing ever more fiercely for a finite pool of high-status jobs and trappings, the class as a whole is less willing to accept further losses. So the state must tap its own coffers to quell the masses, driving up national debt. The more indebted it becomes, the less flexibility it has to respond to further strains. Eventually, marginalised members of the elite side with the masses against the state, violence breaks out and the government is too weak to contain it. Goldstone suggested ways of measuring mass mobilisation potential, elite competition and state solvency, and defined something he called the political stress indicator (psi or \u03a8), which was the product of all three. He showed that \u03a8 spiked prior to the French Revolution, the English civil war and two other major 17th-century conflicts \u2013 the Ottoman crisis in Asia Minor, and the Ming-Qing transition in China. In each case, however, there had been one more factor in the mix: chance. Some tiny rupture \u2013 a harvest failure, say, or a foreign aggression \u2013 that in other circumstances might have been absorbed easily, against a backdrop of rising \u03a8 caused conflict to erupt. Although you could not predict the trigger \u2013 meaning you could not know precisely when the crisis would occur \u2013 you could measure the structural pressures and hence, the risk of such a crisis. It was a simple model, and Goldstone acknowledged as much. Although he could show that high \u03a8 predicted historical revolutions, he had no way of predicting what came next. That depended on the precise combination of the three components of \u03a8, and on how they interacted with a given society\u2019s institutions. Incomplete as they were, his efforts led him to see revolution in a depressing new light: not as a democratic correction to an inflexible and corrupt ancien regime, but as a response to an ecological crisis \u2013 the inability of a society to absorb rapid population growth \u2013 that rarely resolved that crisis. Nor were these patterns confined to the past. As Goldstone was putting the finishing touches to his magnum opus, Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World, the Soviet Union was unravelling. He pointed out that \u03a8 had risen dramatically across the Soviet bloc in the two decades prior to 1989, and that it was persistently high in developing countries. He also wrote that: \u201cIt is quite astonishing the degree to which the United States today is, in respect of its state finances and its elites\u2019 attitudes, following the path that led early modern states to crisis.\u201d * * * When Goldstone\u2019s book came out in 1991, historians were scathing. The British historian Lawrence Stone, writing in The New York Review of Books, described Goldstone\u2019s work as \u201cfar too bold and vague in constructing a thing called a political stress indicator, which is about as real as a unicorn\u201d. Goldstone admits that it did not have the impact he had hoped. \u201cBoth the book and I fell a little bit between the cracks,\u201d he recalls. Then one day in 1997 he got a call from Peter Turchin. At the time, Turchin was going through what he jokingly calls his \u201cmid-life crisis\u201d \u2013 when, aged 40, he ditched biology and ran off with history. Part of what attracted him to the question of why societies implode is that he had personally witnessed one self-destruct. He was born in Russia, but his family defected to the US in 1978, and he did not return to Moscow until 1992. \u201cThat was the year things collapsed completely,\u201d he recalls. It was December \u2013 \u201cdark, horrible. There were drunk people lying everywhere.\u201d He and his wife passed a blown-up car on the way to the market and watched mafiosi extort cash from terrified stallholders while the police looked on. These were images that stayed with him. When Turchin came across Goldstone\u2019s book, he found it \u201cremarkable\u201d, he says. But the model was incomplete: \u201cHe described how societies got into crisis, not how they got out of it.\u201d So Turchin decided to complete the model, and to find out whether it applied to human societies over a much greater swathe of time and space. Goldstone had focused on the early modern period \u2013 roughly the four centuries from 1500; Turchin would push the survey\u2019s start date back nearly 8,000 years, to the Neolithic. That meant collecting vast quantities of data, and in this he was lucky: history\u2019s quantitative turn, which had begun with the plundering of those parish registers in the 1970s, had only accelerated in the decades since. Though the historical record remained fragmented and patchy, it was now possible to say novel things about how extinct people lived even when there was no written trace of them \u2013 and better still, from a mathematician\u2019s point of view, to put numbers on them. Ice cores from Greenland turn out to be an exquisite proxy for economic activity in Europe, for example, because the permafrost traps pollution and tracks its fluctuations over centuries. The size and construction of aristocrats\u2019 villas speak to elite competition, and coin hoards to anxieties about looming strife, while skeletal malformations reveal malnutrition \u2013 a proxy for standard of living. The informational value of these proxies had long been recognised, but now there was quantitative data on them spanning decades and sometimes centuries, meaning that you could discern trends over time. The more proxies you had for a given variable, the more accurate a picture of the past you could paint. In Historical Dynamics, in 2003, Turchin demonstrated a pattern of secular cycles in the societies that evolved into modern-day France and Russia from the first millennium BC until roughly 1800. He also showed that there were shorter oscillations in the stability of these societies, lasting about 50 years, which he called \u201cfathers-and-sons cycles\u201d: perceiving a social injustice, one generation set out to redress it violently, the next shrank from violence having grown up with its aftermath, the third started all over again. Many scholars were as sceptical of Turchin as they had been of Goldstone a dozen years before. \u201cSerious historians,\u201d Joseph Tainter, a historian and anthropologist at Utah State University, wrote in Nature, \u201chave long held cyclical theories in disrepute.\u201d But Turchin had only just got started. He poured his energy into data collection, and in 2010 \u2013 as a way of better organising those data to support comparison across societies \u2013 he and two anthropologists at the University of Oxford launched Seshat, a database of historical and archaeological information named after the ancient Egyptian goddess of record-keeping. Seshat has come in for criticism of the kind that has been directed at big data more generally. Just because there is lots of it, critics say, does not mean that the data is more reliable. On the contrary, such a database risks amplifying the interpretative biases of those who initially recorded the information, while stripping it of its context. Seshat\u2019s founders counter that bias is a problem in history generally, and only the analysis of large quantities of data allows a signal \u2013 something approaching the truth \u2013 to detach itself from that noise. To date, Seshat\u2019s founders and their 90-odd \u201cexpert collaborators\u201d \u2013 including eminent historians, archaeologists and anthropologists \u2013 have gathered data on societies from the lowland Andes to the Cambodian basin and Iceland to Upper Egypt. Analysing these, Turchin showed that the same two interacting cycles \u2013 secular and fathers-and-sons \u2013 fit patterns of instability across Europe and Asia going back as far as the first farmers. They were there in ancient Egypt, China and Rome \u2013 in every pre-industrial society he looked at. The next question was obvious: were these cycles also at play in modern, industrial societies? Turchin updated \u03a8 to reflect the forces shaping a modern labour market, and chose new proxies appropriate to an industrialised world. These included real wages for the mobilisation potential of the masses; filibustering rates in the Senate and the cost of tuition at Yale for elite competition; and interest rates for state solvency. Then he calculated \u03a8 in the US from 1780 to the present day. It was low in the so-called Era of Good Feelings around 1820, high in the 1860s \u2013 around the American civil war \u2013 and low again in the years after the second world war. Since 1970 it had risen steadily. This did not mean we were doomed to crisis, though. Many societies had avoided disaster \u2013 and Turchin was building a model to find out how they had done it. * * * In the late 1980s, Turchin had travelled to the forests of Louisiana, where the timber industry funded his research into periodic and costly infestations of a pest called the southern pine beetle. At the time, the standard procedure for controlling the beetle was to spray pesticide at the site of an infestation. Turchin showed that this only prolonged an attack, because it killed off another beetle that was a natural predator of the pest. A better strategy was to fell and remove affected trees. More broadly, he had shown that it was possible to intervene in a complex ecological system to make its crises less severe and maximise its chances of recovery. Turchin hopes to discover similar strategies for easing crises in human societies. If the approach that he and Goldstone take to modelling history is right, it means that they can meaningfully ask not only what 2020 has in store for us, but also what the future holds stretching forward over centuries. We should not expect any prophecies from this new science of history, but it could help us to identify structural threats to our societies\u2019 stability and to act to mitigate them. While societies tend to enter crisis via the path that Goldstone charted, Turchin has found that they leave it via a range of possible trajectories, from rapid recovery to total collapse. That is because crisis renders a society exquisitely sensitive to external perturbation. If no other destabilising thing happens, it could recover \u2013 as England did after the almost bloodless Glorious Revolution of 1688. But one small extra shock could push it towards a worse outcome, even to collapse. The Soviet Union was already in decline before the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986, but Mikhail Gorbachev may not have been entirely wrong when he blamed its downfall on that event. To understand this phase of the cycle better, Turchin and others plan to build computer-simulated societies composed of thousands or millions of individuals \u2013 so-called agent-based models \u2013 and programme them to behave according to the laws they have deduced from real societies. They can subject those simulated societies to stress, for example by injecting a virtual youth bulge, and observe the downstream effects on state, elites and masses. Once \u03a8 has reached dangerously high levels, they can add a shock \u2013 in the form of a foreign invasion, say \u2013 or increase resilience by strengthening the society\u2019s infrastructure, and see how it responds. They can ask such questions as: what does it take to nudge a society in crisis toward total collapse? What interventions would divert it towards a less bloody outcome? Why are some societies more resilient than others? Of course, our experience with the climate crisis suggests that even if we can predict the future the way we can forecast the weather, and come up with a set of preventative measures to stave off social collapse, that does not mean we will be able to muster the political will to act on such recommendations. But while it is true that human societies have in general been far better at reconstruction after disasters than preventing them in the first place, there are exceptions. Turchin points to the US New Deal of the 1930s, which he sees as a time when American elites consented to share their growing wealth more equitably, in return for the implicit agreement that \u201cthe fundamentals of the political-economic system would not be challenged\u201d. This pact, Turchin argues, enabled American society to exit a potentially revolutionary situation. Goldstone continues to spread the message that such pacts can work again. Now a professor of public policy at George Mason University in Virginia, he advises the National Intelligence Council \u2013 the US intelligence body responsible for long-term strategy \u2013 but says his ideas have had little impact so far. At a workshop on societal collapse at Princeton University last April, someone asked him why historical societies had so often failed to act even when the signs of a looming crisis were impossible to ignore. He suggested it was because elites continue to live the high life for some time after things start falling apart, buffered from the upheaval by their wealth and privileges. Turchin believes that historians will soon embrace complexity science, just as biologists did half a century ago. They will come to realise that it allows them to see deeper and further, to discern patterns that are not visible to the human eye. In fact, it is already happening. In the last few years, a handful of institutions have been created, such as the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, whose goal is to encourage policymakers to think about the long-term lessons of history. The Princeton meeting was attended by a risk analyst employed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, who thinks about how to make the US more resilient to future threats by reference to the past. To Turchin, these are all encouraging developments, but 2020 is nearly upon us, and lawmaking institutions in both the US and the UK are now so divided along ideological lines that they can barely function. In both countries, disgruntled members of the elite have taken power in the name of the people, while failing to address the underlying causes of the malaise: widening inequality, a swollen elite, a fragile state. Goldstone offers what consolation he can. \u201cNobody in the 1930s could have imagined how rich Europe would be by the 1960s, or that the entire continent would become unified,\u201d he says. \u201cBad as things may get for a decade or two, they\u2019re liable to be much better once you get through the crisis.\u201d It\u2019s the consolation inherent in a cyclic view of history: that beyond every fall there is another rise, just as beyond every rise there is another fall. Things will be good once again, for those of us who are still around to see it. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "bodyText": "After watching Ant &amp; Dec\u2019s DNA Journey on ITV, I can confidently say that one thing it failed to do for me \u2013 and which genetics could definitively answer \u2013 is clarify which one is Ant and which one is Dec. Alas, this mystery remains unsolved. Aside from that, the documentary is entertaining enough. In the first episode, Ant and Dec travel around, talking to genealogists and distant relatives who have been identified by having similar bits of DNA to them \u2013 like Who Do You Think You Are? but with bonus genetics. We are introduced to Dixie Carter, who is described as a \u201cgenetic cousin\u201d to Dec, though I couldn\u2019t tell precisely what relation she is. The two shared an ancestor from around 150 years ago, and her presence provides light relief as she is a Texan wrestling promoter. It is, of course, incumbent on science to spoil the fun. A common ancestor six generations into the past, like the one shared between Dixie and Dec, is one of 64 great-great-great-great-grandparents you have. Maybe Dixie was simply the most exciting relative the producers found. Without DNA analysis, the Geordie duo would not have traced her and other distant relatives, but the truth is that there is very little meaningful genetic relationship there. Geneticists did not anticipate that the human genome would become such a saleable commodity. It\u2019s estimated that more than 26m commercial genetic tests have been taken worldwide, mainly trading on the beguiling promise of revealing something about your ancestry. The show is \u201csponsored\u201d by the biggest of these companies, Ancestry, who are credible, and whose data \u2013 your data \u2013 is put to interesting use, such as producing scientific papers that analyse the genetic structure of modern Americans. Also in the programme were Alistair Moffat and Jim Wilson, founders of another, now defunct, company called BritainsDNA, which made headlines for some absurd and ahistorical claims over the years, including saying that it had traced the descendants of the Queen of Sheba (a Biblical character who may or may not have existed) and those of Eve, sticking with the Biblical theme. It was even behind claims that climate change would make ginger people extinct. In 2012, Moffat threatened legal action against geneticists at UCL (to which I am affiliated) who had criticised some of the company\u2019s claims. A paper in the peer-reviewed journal Genealogy documents this saga and the way BritainsDNA \u201cmade a number of dubious claims both directly to its customers and in the media\u201d. Companies like that devalue the business of genetic genealogy, so it is troubling to see its key players \u2013 Moffat effectively introduces the show \u2013 feature so prominently in Ant and Dec\u2019s show. The marketing ploy of the genetics industry is to tell stories of belonging. This can be powerful because everyone craves autobiographical meaning.

      "bodyText": "A video unearthed by the Guardian from the North East Says No (Nesno) campaign in the north-east referendum of 2004 reveals how Dominic Cummings successfully deployed strategies reminiscent of Vote Leave\u2019s 2016 playbook. The advert from the \u201cforgotten referendum\u201d not only pits the people against politicians but also pledges to pump millions into the NHS that would otherwise be used to run political institutions. Cummings, Nesno\u2019s strategic adviser, defeated the then deputy prime minister John Prescott\u2019s plan for regional assemblies by masterminding a campaign that led to a 78% rejection of devolution \u2013 despite early polling predicting a 60%-plus victory for the government\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d campaign. Chief among the lessons Cummings learned from this dry run for the Brexit referendum was that Britain had an appetite for supercharged anti-establishmentarianism. Nesno\u2019s chief spokesperson, Graham Robb, described the operation as \u201cBritain\u2019s first populist campaign\u201d. Nesno used billboards, stunts and television advertising for a largely negative campaign with the message that a regional assembly would have limited powers and lead to a hike in council tax that would not pay for any additional doctors, teachers or police. \u201cWe did not need a positive message. We were the no campaign. That\u2019s a negative act,\u201d wrote William Norton, Nesno\u2019s referendum agent, recounting a strategy meeting with Cummings. Norton told the Guardian that Cummings was the campaign\u2019s \u201cmessaging person\u201d who coined the slogan: \u201cPoliticians talk, we pay.\u201d That phrase is the centrepiece of the video created by Cummings and Nesno, which was broadcast on regional television in the lead-up to the vote. \u201cThe regional assembly would create more politicians, so as you would expect it means the regional assembly will come with huge extra cost. The bill for the north-east would be a staggering \u00a31m per week,\u201d the advert states, followed by the caption: \u201cMore doctors, not politicians.\u201d \u201cThe equating of money spent on more politicians instead of doctors resonated,\u201d said Robb, who voiced the video. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about, to the penny, what slogan you use about the NHS. It\u2019s about the principle of it.\u201d In contrast, yes campaigners produced \u201can upbeat image of the north-east \u2026 [which] for all its good intentions and celebrity support did not communicate its vision so clearly\u201d, a UCL report on the referendum concluded. The effectiveness of populist advertising clearly stayed with Cummings as he plotted Vote Leave\u2019s campaign strategy. \u201cIt was ludicrous to suggest that any additional money spent on a regional assembly could instead have been used to fund more doctors,\u201d said Julie Elliott, Sunderland Central MP and a key figure in the 2004 yes campaign. \u201cLocal governments do not have extensive responsibility for medical services. \u201cBut the problem was that once that disinformation was out there, it was impossible to extinguish it in many voters\u2019 minds. We debunked the claim in every town hall meeting around the region but typically only 20 to 50 people would turn up to those and the voting population was 4 million.\u201d Prescott echoed the sentiment. \u201c[A regional government would cost] \u00a312m less to the people in the north-east. They have said it will be more politicians \u2013 it\u2019s 500 politicians less,\u201d he said. Cummings worked hard to distance Nesno\u2019s campaign from the establishment. \u201c\u2018Heavyweight\u2019 after \u2018heavyweight\u2019 turned up for the yes camp, from Gordon Brown to Charles Kennedy,\u201d he blogged. \u201cThey made things worse \u2026 in fact they were moving swing voters our way and turning out our vote.\u201d Instead of celebrities, Nesno diverted its focus to stunts. While the yes campaign unveiled a cultural manifesto which promised more rights for artists, Nesno was burning \u00a31m-worth of fake \u00a350 notes. In a more recent blog, Cummings reflects on how the strategies he developed for Nesno became the blueprint for the Brexit referendum. \u201cIt was a training exercise that turned out surprisingly well. SW1 100% ignored it, thankfully,\u201d he said. Asked about the Nesno advert, a friend of Cummings said: \u201cThis was true, that\u2019s why 80% of the people in the north-east voted no to more politicians and saved themselves a fortune.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Grace Millane died from prolonged pressure to the neck, a forensic pathologist has told a jury in Auckland, as it emerged the suspect initially told police he had parted ways with the British backpacker at 8pm before staying out drinking alone. Dr Simon Stables told the high court injuries like Millane\u2019s were extremely uncommon worldwide. \u201cFrom my point of view it is incredibly rare, I have never heard of another case \u2026 in New Zealand.\u201d Stables was giving evidence in the trial of a 27-year old New Zealand man accused of murdering the 21-year-old British backpacker in Auckland in December 2018 while she was on a trip around the world. The accused, whose name is suppressed, has pleaded not guilty. Stables told the court that he first examined Millane\u2019s body on 9 December inside the suitcase where she was found buried in the Waitakere Ranges on the outskirts of the city. He told the court more than a dozen bruises were found on her body, with nine of them occurring \u201cprobably around the time of death\u201d to her upper arms, left clavicle and collarbone, and to the front and back of her left shoulder. The bruises on her upper arms and left shoulder were typical of \u201crestraint\u201d, Stables said. The bruises ranged from 1cm to 5cm in diameter. The defence asked whether the bruising could have been the result of \u201cphysical sex\u201d, or \u201clovebites\u201d. Stables said the the bruises were too big to be lovebites, but could have resulted from \u201cphysical sex\u201d, when pressed by defence lawyer Ian Brookie. The defence claims Millane died accidentally while engaging in a consensual sex act, while the crown argues she was murdered. \u201cThe pattern is consistent with some level of restraint that has gone on,\u201d Stables said, describing the bruises as typical of other restraint injuries he has seen, whether or not they were consensual. Stables said he could conclusively state that Millane died from manual pressure applied to her neck \u201cfor long enough and with enough force for that bruising to occur\u201d. There was \u201cextensive evidence\u201d of bruising on the left side of Millane\u2019s neck, in what Stables described as a \u201csignificant injury\u201d. \u201cThis bruising wouldn\u2019t occur with gentle pressure on the neck \u2026 it takes quite a bit of effort.\u201d Stables said it would typically take a person four to five minutes to die from the injuries Millane suffered. Stables said he had dealt with cases of autoerotic asphyxiation, but none involving a partner engaging in a consensual sex game. The court also heard that the suspect, in his first interview with police on 6 December, claimed he last saw Millane at about 8pm on the night of 1 December, parting ways in the city centre after their date at Andy\u2019s Burger Bar. He said he then went on for drinks alone at a bar he could not recall, drinking alone till around 11pm. He said he had invited her for a drink at Sky City that evening, choosing a public setting because he was afraid of being \u201ccatfished\u201d, or deceived, by Millane. \u201cIf she wasn\u2019t who she said she was, at least in my mind I would feel safe\u201d the accused said in video of the interview. When asked about his unusual route to the Auckland harbour side after meeting Millane, he again said it was for safety, that avoiding the back streets made him feel better. Asked how the evening had panned out for him with Millane, the accused replied: \u201cPretty good\u201d. The defence suggested alcohol could be a contributing factor in Millane\u2019s death and that her respiratory system was compromised due to high levels of intoxication, affecting a person\u2019s ability to recover a \u201cfrom a low-oxygen\u201d state. Stables disagreed, saying if intoxication were enough to affect the respiratory system, that person would be unconscious. \u201cThey can\u2019t have disordered breathing and still be conscious,\u201d Stables said. Alcohol was not a factor in Millane\u2019s cause of death, the doctor said, and her medical records and autopsy stated she was in otherwise good health. The court also heard how police were alerted to the accused\u2019s existence after an officer who was monitoring Millane\u2019s Facebook page noted a message from him under her profile picture that said: \u201cBeautiful, very radiant\u201d. The accused made the comment on 2 December. The officer then gained access to Millane\u2019s Facebook account and found details of a conversation she had with a friend discussing the Tinder date with the suspect on 1 December. Within a day, the police had entered the man\u2019s hotel room at the CityLife hotel to search for Millane. Millane\u2019s mother, Gillian, wept in court as she heard the evidence in the trial, which is expected to last until early December. Earlier in court, a young woman who went on a Tinder date with the accused in November 2018 gave further evidence about him smothering her during oral sex.

It was a stunt more than anything \u2013 One Nation still turned up for every vote that mattered, but it was a very loud stunt and it forced McKenzie into saying the timetable would be moved up, meaning the code would be implemented early next year instead of mid next year. <strong>Pauline Hanson </strong>claimed victory. </p> <p>The National party MPs who had spent the past three years working on the code (marrying up the different state industries is a little difficult, but hey \u2013 that\u2019s the federation for you) were pretty annoyed that One Nation was taking credit for their work and went on the offensive.</p> <p>Next thing you know, there are backbench drought-assistance submissions and <strong>Barnaby Joyce </strong>is anywhere a blinking camera light is featured, and the Nats came together for peace in our times.</p> <p>Except that\u2019s not possible with all the stuff that is going on right now. McKenzie looked stressed in Senate question time yesterday, and her colleagues are openly questioning whether she is up to the job. It wouldn\u2019t matter so much if they weren\u2019t also questioning whether <strong>Michael McCormack</strong> was also up to the job, and after his tone-deaf head-in-the sand performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/nov/11/morrison-coalition-labor-bushfires-monday-politics-live\">yesterday morning over climate change and its link to the catastrophic early bushfire season</a>, well, things aren\u2019t exactly great in the Nationals group chat.</p> <p>So McKenzie got up this morning and spoke to ABC radio about the dairy code and just how on top of it she all is.</p> <p>Except \u2013 she\u2019s not. And she had to concede she didn\u2019t have all the answers about why changes have been made to the exposure draft.

In the meantime \u2013 take care of you. Please. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund, (which is often called the \u201cno actual infrastructure fund\u201d around these halls, because of the lack of infrastructure) is not only undergoing another inquiry \u2013 it will also lend $20m to the North Queensland Cowboys for a training centre. The fund which was designed to turn the north into an economic powerhouse will also help the Cowboys train its Thurstons of the future. Funding for the new state-of-the-art Cowboys Community, Training and High Performance Centre continues to take shape with the advancement of a Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) loan moving to the next stage of approval. The North Queensland Toyota Cowboys\u2019 application to NAIF has progressed, with NAIF\u2019s Board making an investment decision to approve a loan to the project. The $20m NAIF loan would complement the existing $15m federal government grant announced in March enabling the construction of the project to commence. Completion is targeted for the facilities to be available for the 2021 NRL season. The proposed centre, to be located adjacent to the new North Queensland Stadium in Townsville, will combine community areas, multi-sport high-performance training spaces, sports medicine and sports science laboratories, together with the stadium and administration offices, located in between Ross Creek and Saunders Street in Townsville City. Scott Morrison is on his way to the Australian crisis centre, in Canberra, to get a fire update. It is still not listed for debate - which means the government doesn\u2019t have the numbers it wants, but the medevac issue is till ticking away. An alliance of Australia\u2019s medical professionals have put out this statement calling for medevac to stay: Medical decisions should be made by medical professionals \u2013 Alliance of medical authorities appeals to parliament to save medevac The presidents of leading medical colleges across Australia are appealing to the Senate to maintain the medevac legislation and the Independent Health Advice Panel (IHAP) process. The medical community remains united in asking the parliament to maintain the medevac legislation and to allow the IHAP panel to continue its critical work providing independent clinical review and oversight. There is clear evidence of the effectiveness of the medevac legislation, and the medical need. Medevac has improved access to appropriate healthcare for refugees and asylum seekers being held offshore. It is providing greatly improved oversight and accountability. As doctors, we continue to put patients first and uphold the basic human right to healthcare. We know that previous delays and failures to transfer ill asylum seekers resulted in preventable suffering. This statement is on behalf of the presidents of: The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) The Australasian College of Dermatologists (ACD) The Australasian College of Sport and Exercise Physicians (ACSEP) The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM) The Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) The College of Intensive Care Medicine of Australia and New Zealand (CICM) The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) The Royal Australasian College of Medical Administrators (RACMA) The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, has asked the high court to refuse Annika Smethurst\u2019s bid to order police to destroy evidence seized in the raid of her home to preserve evidence for possible future prosecution. Donaghue noted that evidence seized in the raid can be used to prosecute offences other than the one listed on the warrant \u2013 namely, the police could use it to prosecute Smethurst\u2019s source. He said Smethurst is \u201cat the other end\u201d of an alleged unlawful disclosure, a \u201cserious breach\u201d of the Intelligence Services Act. There is discretion for a court in a possible future criminal trial to reject evidence that was unlawfully obtained, and Donaghue asked that the court not order destruction or return of evidence that would \u201cpre-empt\u201d that process. He noted that even if Smethurst wins in her constitutional argument that the offence police were investigating in relation to her publication of the material was unconstitutional, the material should still be left in police\u2019s hands because of the possibility it could be used to prosecute her source. Mark Butler has put out this statement on Angus Taylor: Today it was revealed in a Senate estimates spill-over hearing that the minister\u2019s department provided a draft letter to the Minister\u2019s office which responded to the letter from the lord mayor of the City of Sydney. That draft letter is very different to the final letter sent by Minister Taylor to the lord mayor. The department\u2019s draft letter provided to the minister\u2019s office contained no reference to the City of Sydney\u2019s travel expenditure. Senator Keneally: Did that draft response include reference to the City of Sydney\u2019s travel expenditure? Departmental Official: No Senator, it did not. (Environment and Energy Estimates spill-over hearing, 12 November 2019) The department confirmed that after it provided this draft response, Angus Taylor\u2019s office did not request any further information or drafts. It was also confirmed that the department was not asked to verify any additional information in the version of the letter signed by Angus Taylor which contained the doctored figures. Despite repeated questioning, the minister representing the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Senator Birmingham, refused to provide further information about where the doctored figures came from and instead referred to Angus Taylor\u2019s previous statements. Angus Taylor needs to come clean about exactly how these doctored figures turned up in a letter signed by him \u2013 because we have yet to see a public document that confirms his version of events. If Angus Taylor won\u2019t provide the answers, the prime minister should direct his embattled minister to provide a full and frank explanation. Mike Bowers has been out and about Penny Wong just tried to bring an end to question time \u2013 \u201cI think the time for questions has expired,\u201d she says, probably hopefully. Alas, no. There are two more minutes. Annika Smethurst\u2019s lawyers have been urged to clarify their case on whether material copied from her phone was confidential to support her bid to force police to delete the information taken during the raid on her home. On Tuesday the high court stood over oral submissions to Wednesday\u2019s hearing to give Smethurst\u2019s counsel time to clarify her case and consider seeking an order to prevent the use of material copied from her phone rather than its destruction. Smethurst has asked the court for an injunction ordering the police to destroy material collected and copied from her phone on the basis the raid in June constituted trespass. Smethurst\u2019s counsel, Stephen Lloyd, was grilled repeatedly about how the court could order destruction of documents, without a breach in equity such as a breach of confidence. Chief justice Susan Kiefel said that a breach of confidentiality could result in destruction of confidential material but noted \u201cthat\u2019s not this case\u201d and the plaintiffs had \u201cnever said the information was confidential to the plaintiff\u201d, an observation echoed by Justice Patrick Keane. Justice Geoffrey Nettle noted that trespass could result in damages but asked what grounds Smethurst had to ask for destruction of the information \u201cif it is not confidential \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t sound like it is [confidential] to you\u201d. Lloyd responded that damages were \u201cnot an adequate remedy\u201d and although the plaintiffs hadn\u2019t asserted breach of confidence the court should undo the wrong of material being \u201cforcibly taken from the phone\u201d through the torts of trespass and conversion. Kiefel suggested some of the material may be confidential depending on its \u201cultimate source\u201d and queried whether a negative injunction ordering the police not to use the information would be sufficient. Lloyd said that it may be. Lloyd then changed tack, arguing that copied material is confidential in the sense that \u201cit\u2019s on their own phone and they\u2019re the only one that can access it\u201d. After a short break, the court returned and Kiefel suggested it stand over submissions on relief so that Smethurst\u2019s counsel could consider their position further. Lloyd suggested on Wednesday he may shift Smethurst\u2019s case to seek a negative injunction preventing police using material seized and copied, rather than its destruction. Kiefel replied that Lloyd would still have to examine the \u201cunderlying cause [of action]\u201d and warned \u201cthe basis for a negative or mandatory injunction needs to be dealt with with a good degree of particularity tomorrow morning\u201d. Again, it was Barnaby Joyce who raised the issue in response to a question about resources for hazard reduction burns. His comments were run in full. Barnaby Joyce has explained his comments to Sam Maiden at the New Daily: Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Joyce told Sky News the local community needed more resources for hazard reduction burns and said: \u201cAnd that\u2019s the crazy thing there, and I acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party, so I am not going to start attacking them. That\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\u201d But he accused critics of \u201cwantonly misrepresenting\u201d his remarks about two NSW bushfire victims \u2013 Vivian Chaplain and George Nole. Mr Joyce said he was actually trying to urge politicians to be more respectful of the alternative community where the victims lived, where the majority of residents did vote for the Greens. \u201cMy point is I was saying \u2018just be careful, you don\u2019t understand\u2019. If you came into my community and talked to them \u2013 I am not having a go at the Greens, I think that\u2019s completely wrong,\u201d Mr Joyce told the New Daily. \u201cThe people who live there are in a commune basically. Wytaliba is an alternative community. They don\u2019t vote for me, they vote for Greens, and I\u2019ve got no problem with it. They agree there should have been more burn reduction, fuel reduction.\u201d Jacqui Lambie asks about the number of lobbying and unescorted passes in parliament. It is a question for Scott Ryan, as a representative of DPS. Ryan refers her estimate hearings transcripts. It is worth noting that Barnaby Joyce brought this up himself \u2013 he was asked about whether or not fire and emergency service workers had enough resources for hazard reduction, and included the deaths of Vivian Chaplain and George Nole and his view of their political leanings in his answer, without any prompting. I am not sure there is ever an appropriate time to bring that up \u2013 and not just because now is not the time \u201cto talk politics\u201d. Richard Colbeck is now talking about all the action the government has taken on aged care. Given that most of the response has been \u201cthis is terrible, and we will look at it\u201d, it is not the strongest of answers here. Does Simon Birmingham have any information about potential power blackouts in South Australia, Stirling Griff asks? Grid reliability in SA is improving, Birmingham says. The reliability standard in SA is \u201cexpected to be met\u201d. Oh look \u2013 a lot of it is because of new renewables coming on to the grid. We move on to the dairy code of conduct \u2013 and why the exposure draft has been changed (which was the question Bridget McKenzie couldn\u2019t answer this morning on ABC radio). There is still not an answer. But we do have a nice history of how we got here. Senate question time begins with an update on the fire, and the defence force role. It is as expected \u2013 helping with coordination and remaining on standby \u2013 but they are not firefighters. We are coming up to Senate question time. Sigh. Larissa Waters has seen the Parliamentary Friends of Resources Christmas party invite: As Queensland and NSW burns, both the Liberals and Labor thought it was a good time to invite parliamentarians to Christmas drinks hosted by the fossil fuel industry, whose product is fuelling climate change and donations are blocking climate action. It sounds like satire but it\u2019s the sad reality of Australian politics in 2019. Mehreen Faruqi singled out Joel Fitzgibbon: Seriously, Joel? Our state is on fire and this is the day you pick to invite us all to drinks with the oil and gas lobby, some of the biggest contributors to the climate crisis \u2026 This seems like pretty bad timing, given everything that is happening with the fire emergency: Dear Colleagues, As Co-Chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Resources we are pleased to invite you to the Bright Sparks Christmas drinks hosted by the Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association (APPEA). The event will be on Wednesday, 4th December at 6:30pm. Please see attached the formal invitation and direct any RSVPs to [redacted by me] Cheers, Hon Joel Fitzgibbon Mr Craig Kelly Shadow Minister for Resources Member for Hughes Member for Hunter Labor senator Murray Watt jumped in there, with an interjection: MW: We are used to Senator Steele-John\u2019s lectures \u2026 but it is highly offensive for him to refer to members of this chamber, regardless of their political party, as arsonists. \u2026 It is an indication of the lengths that the Greens will go to to make their political point and I ask him to withdraw. Jordon Steele-John did not have to withdraw: Senator Steele-John was not making a direct reference to any senator in particular. Please continue, Senator Steele-John. There is no point of order. Steele-John: There will come a time when the Australian community will look back and ask itself a simple question: what were we doing when they were defending their homes, when they were protecting their communities, when they were defending precious natural habitat, what were we here doing? The answer this day, as has been the answer on so many occasions since I have entered this place, is make the problem worse, because it was too difficult to do otherwise or because somebody was paying us to do it. That is the only answer that they will discover in this place and they, like me, will be disgusted and ashamed at the weakness, at the cowardice, at the self-interest, at the ignorance that led us to this moment. They will condemn you, as you should rightly be condemned, and hold you accountable at the ballot box and beyond. Meanwhile, over in the Senate, Greens senator Jordon Steele-John has accused both major parties of being \u201cno better than a bunch of arsonists, borderline arsonists\u201d for supporting the coal industry, during the big stick Senate debate. Steele-John: There is not a scientist in this country \u2013 there is not a qualified individual on the face of the earth \u2013 that would say anything other than that there is a direct causal link between the burning of coal and the creation of dangerous climate change. And there is not an individual \u2013 a scientist or any other qualified person \u2013 who would deny the link between climate change and the disasters we are experiencing today. It is hypocrisy in the extreme \u2013 it is inappropriate beyond words \u2013 for this government to propose that, in this moment of national crisis, we should be using the powers of the federal government to maintain a system of burning coal for energy generation. That is what this bill seeks to facilitate. You, funded by your corporate backers, interested only in your continued political survival, have played a role in driving our country to the edge of an ecological abyss from which we may never recover. Your selfishness and your ignorance have known no bounds for decades, and now our communities are paying the price, just as your spinelessness, your contemptible inability to formulate yourselves into anything like an opposition, anything vaguely approaching an organisation capable of countering the bunch of self-obsessed corporate elites that is the Liberal party, has let this community down again and again. We heard your feeble mutterings in the chamber yesterday about the idea that, at some other point in the future, it might be the appropriate time to raise the issue of climate change. Now! Now! Now! In the past, when we as a community have confronted issues of national tragedy and crisis, such as we did after Port Arthur, we have come together as a nation and acted. We had a national firearms agreement within 11 days. How dare you suggest that our country is beyond the ability of rising to a similar challenge. How dare any of you suggest that, in this moment, at this time, it is appropriate to be prosecuting a piece of legislation with the aim of propping up coal. You are no better than a bunch of arsonists \u2013 borderline arsonists \u2013 and you should be ashamed... This is also going on Over in Senate estimates, Barnaby Joyce\u2019s comments have made waves: Kristina Keneally: Minister I have a question for you. Earlier today Barnaby Joyce said on Sky News \u2026 Chair David Fawcett: Excuse me Senator Keneally just a reminder to use the correct titles when referring to members of the other House. KK: The member for New England said on Sky News that the two people who died in bushfires, he said, \u201cI acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party so I\u2019m not going to start attacking them. That\u2019s the last thing I want to do.\u201d How does he know who they voted for and why does it matter? They\u2019re dead; they died in a bushfire. Isn\u2019t that enough? Simon Birmingham: I\u2019ve not seen the quotes Senator Keneally, I have no idea what Mr Joyce was referring to and they\u2019d be questions for him. KK: Do you think it matters who they voted for? SB: No Senator. KK: Do you associate yourself with those comments? Fawcett: I remind you this is a Senate estimates hearing into the Department of Environment. The comments by a backbencher are not relevant for this hearing. KK: They\u2019re very relevant. Gerard Rennick had the third spot on the LNP Senate ticket: he wasn\u2019t supposed to win. But Labor\u2019s primary vote tanked in Queensland, meaning they lost a Senate spot to the LNP. And Rennick is in for six years. There are bets about how long he\u2019ll stay in the LNP before moving the crossbench/One Nation \u2013 from within his own party room. Those other things he is interested in? Read One Nation\u2019s policy document and you can pretty much cross them off. He also thinks we need some sort of modern holey dollar to get the economy out of the doldrums. Good. Times. But it got SO MUCH BETTER. Because has Gerard Rennick read the bureau\u2019s explanations \u2013 the peer reviewed explanations \u2013 given, you know, he is accusing them of manipulating data, because he knows data? Rennick: No, I haven\u2019t actually read that. Oh? Why? Wouldn\u2019t that be a good idea, given his concerns? Rennick: I read someone who I trusted, Jennifer Marohasy, who has a PhD in biology \u2026 she has heaps and heaps of statistical information, so I basically posted an article by her, on my website, on Facebook page, and I basically agreed with what she said.\u201d Dr Marohasy, it might interest you to know, is attached to the IPA. Tom Connell: One person has written something, and you have agreed with that based on what they have said. Rennick: Well based on her credentials, yes. Connell: But you haven\u2019t read the data, or sought other resources. Rennick: Well, I don\u2019t \u2026 at that time I was a Senate candidate, and my view is, and I know enough to know, because I have a background in statistics, if you are not doing a parallel run, if you are not doing regression analysis properly, then you have to be very careful about changing data. Connell: Do you have to be careful about making accusations as a senator? \u2026 Have you sought briefings from the bureau? Rennick: And I\u2019ll get to that, that is not the main reason that I ran for politics, so there are other things I would like to get to first. Connell: But don\u2019t the facts matter? Rennick: Well the facts do matter, but the problem is the facts are there was data recorded in the 1930s that got changed, so what are you going to call the facts? Yesterday on Sky News, LNP senator Gerard Rennick told Tom Connell about why he believes the Bureau of Meteorology rewrote weather records to fit in with a global warming agenda. What is the proof of that? Connell asked. The proof of that, is basically, that they, basically adapted a new weather measuring instrument and they didn\u2019t run a parallel run at the time. So if you are going to adapt a new measuring instrument, which they did in the late 90s, they should have run a parallel run with the old measuring instrument, so you knew what the difference was between the old measuring instrument, and the new instrument was.\u201d The BOM have released a lot of information on homogenisation of information, Connell says \u2013 and if you took that route, it would look like global warming was even worse. Rennick: I\u2019ve worked in finance for 25 years and I have never known a CFO to walk into a company and rewrite the financial statements from 100 years ago. So why you go back 50 or 60 years and rewrite records, that you have no idea how they were measured, the standardisation or anything, and then change that, you have got to have proof. And the way you do regression analysis, is that you have to have a large number of observations to do this. Connell comes back with there being some issues with measuring stations, the changes in the environment giving different reasons - outlining some of the detail the BOM has put forward as why they did this. \u201cWhat are you accusing them of exactly?\u201d Rennick: I am accusing them of not following proper process for recording statistical data. Connell: But you had the word \u201cagenda\u201d when you mentioned this - so are you saying there are people in there deliberately altering data within the BOM? Rennick: I am saying we should have more rigorous testing of the Bureau of Metrology in the way they change data, absolutely. Connell: But the agenda part, as in, they want more people to sort of take global warming seriously, so they are deliberately fiddling data. It is a pretty serious accusation. Rennick: Yeah, it is a serious accusation, and I stand by it, I don\u2019t believe the change in records, and the way they have gone about it, and I have a background in system accounting, where I have changed records, and we have always done a parallel run. The Senate sitting has begun. Barnaby Joyce\u2019s comments have reached the red chamber. I\u2019ll bring you some of that in a moment. Despite receiving letter signed by 22 of Australia\u2019s former fire chiefs in April \u2013 followed up by another letter in September \u2013 requesting meetings to discuss the impact of climate change on the bushfire risk, the federal government failed to meet with the high level delegation. Minister Simon Birmingham, representing the minister for energy and emissions reduction, Angus Taylor said the minister\u2019s office had contacted the group on 10 September offering a meeting in October, \u201cbut this hasn\u2019t been taken up by the former fire chiefs\u201d. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young asked why it had taken five months since the first request to offer a meeting. Birmingham replied that the April letter had asked for a meeting after the election in May, so it was not five months. In the high court, Annika Smethurst\u2019s counsel has been attacking the warrant authorising the search on her home, arguing it failed to describe the conduct which allegedly constituted the offence. The warrant said: \u201cOn the 29 April 2018, Annika Smethurst and the Sunday Telegraph communicated a document or article to a person, that was not in the interest of the commonwealth, and permitted that person to have access to the document, contrary to section 79(3) of the Crimes Act 1914, Official Secrets.\u201d Stephen Lloyd argued the warrant needed to describe the information police were seeking and \u201chow it became proscribed in relation to both the [potential] accused\u201d. Warrants must \u201crefer to the offending conduct not merely a reference to the section\u201d, according to Lloyd. He attacked the floating phrase \u201cthat was not in the interest of the commonwealth\u201d \u2013 arguing it wasn\u2019t clear if it referred to a document or a communication that wasn\u2019t in the interest of the commonwealth. The warrant both \u201cdidn\u2019t state an offence known to law\u201d and lacked sufficient particularity, he said. The lack of detail was \u201capt to mislead Smethurst and the executing officers\u201d to allow a broader search. Joel Fitzgibbon has held a doorstop on the dairy code of conduct, flanked by senators and members of the NSW and Queensland dairy sector. Fitzgibbon called on Bridget McKenzie to explain the changes to the dairy code of conduct, saying it had been watered down to the extent that some farmers would rather have no code than the one proposed. \u201cSenator Bridget McKenzie, the agriculture minister, needs to immediately answer the question she declined to respond to five times on ABC radio this morning \u2013 she needs to tell dairy farm communities who it was that recommended to her that the all-important code of conduct in the dairy industry be watered down \u2013 watered down so significantly that dairy farm leaders are now saying that this dairy code would be worse than not having a dairy code at all.\u201d Fitzgibbon said Labor was calling for the code to be introduced \u201csooner rather than later\u201d alongside a floor price on farm gate prices. He said the deregulation of the industry that occurred under the Howard government in 2000 had not resulted in a \u201cgood outcome\u201d for dairy farmers, who were struggling with the cost price squeeze. He called on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to intervene in the sector. \u201cScott Morrison needs to put his pride aside and admit he has it wrong [and] concede that we do need some significant government intervention in the dairy industry. \u201cA code of conduct is important, but it won\u2019t fix the wide range of problems facing our dairy farmers, including that price squeeze. We need a minimum farm gate milk price so that farmers can receive a fair price for their milk. \u201cIf we don\u2019t intervene, we don\u2019t have a dairy industry in this country and, god forbid, we will be importing our milk.\u201d Fitzgibbon said that he never expected Pauline Hanson\u2019s dairy industry bill to pass the parliament, and defended the \u201csymbolic\u201d move against criticism that the legislation may have had some flaws. He said details could have been thrashed out in the House of Representatives had the legislation won the support of Nationals MPs, who could have crossed the floor in support of the Hanson bill. Dairy farmers from NSW and Queensland also spoke to the media, saying they were disappointed that the code had been watered down, noting concerns about the ability of contract prices to be revised down in certain circumstances. \u201cWe are very disappointed that the code has gone backwards in our opinion,\u201d Brian Tessmann, the president of the Queensland Dairyfarmers Organisation, said. He said the number of dairy farmers in Queensland had dropped from 1,500 in 2000 to just 350 today. \u201cWe are losing them all the time.\u201d Fitzgibbon said that dairy farmers needed to unite to persuade the government to act, singling out the SA dairy industry for opposing the minimum farm gate price. When asked if he believed the code had been watered down to appease large producers in McKenzie\u2019s home state of Victoria, Fitzgibbon said Australians needed to consider who would benefit from the changes. The interview finishes with this. Kieran Gilbert: But the thing is, you\u2019re also arguing for policies to change in this context, which I, which I understand and your constituents are affected here. But would any of that be enough to deal with these catastrophic conditions that we are seeing? Barnaby Joyce: Well, the only thing that burns is vegetation and if you\u2019ve done fire hazard reduction burns, you don\u2019t have the vegetation or the amount there, to burn. And the other thing is, these fires are super hot, super aggressive, because of the fuel load. And not only does that, not only does that incredibly dangerous and fatal for people, it also kills the trees. You\u2019ll go back later and because it has been so hot, the trees will be dead, and in the past, you will do a fire reduction burn and therefore the heat of the fire, when it would go through again, they would definitely be further bushfires, but they\u2019re not to the same intensity. And that is something that we need to rediscover, because it\u2019s something the Aboriginals discovered years ago, because they wanted to stay alive. KG: In the wash-up in this tragedy, this disaster, there needs to be a discussion about how we maximise our response to this, because you have said yourself the fire season is longer, the window is shorter in terms of trying to protect these communities, to backburn, to reduce these hazards. BJ: Yes, that is a fact and I used to be stupid to argue against that, that is a fact. And to say that, you know, that this the same climatic conditions as in the past is wrong, because we are in a record drought and by statement of its record droughts, it is automatically different \u2013 that is a fact. To say that a policy that is conducted in Australia from a room in Canberra, where 76 out of 150 will vote for it, that will change the bushfire season, is an absurdity and erroneous and it is completely misleading because it\u2019s going to have no effect on the climate whatsoever. Gilbert continues. KG: But the thing is that we hear from as I mentioned, Jason McKellar, the incident controller, the New South Wales deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said earlier that hazard reductions have gone on each and every year, each year we get as much done as we would like ... Barnaby Joyce: Well see, you\u2019re using different words there, \u201cas they are able to do\u201d. KG: Do they have enough resources to get it done? BJ: I just think that it, here, in the first instance, they may need more resources, but they also need legislation regulations, to allow them to get in there and do it in a more substantial way. And that the crazy thing there, and I acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party, so I am not going to start attacking them. That\u2019s the last thing I want to do. What I wanted to concentrate on is the policies that we can mitigate these tragedies happening again in the future. That\u2019s where I\u2019m going to focus. And what I wish Mr Bandt would do, is not trying to extend this argument to political purposes that he is following and I think he\u2019s a member for both Melbourne Ports, is that correct? A long, long way away from the people who were fighting the fires in the New England, on the coast, who are actually putting their lives on the line, their time on the line, doing it for free. And again, the statements he\u2019s making his for his political purpose of stopping coal production in Australia and I can understand that\u2019s his purpose, he\u2019s entitled to that purpose. But to make these spurious links, that a policy change would have stopped the fight is so insulting and just completely beyond the pale, to cast that, because people think, well, maybe if that was the truth, I wouldn\u2019t be burnt, maybe if that\u2019s the truth, a good friend of mine would not be dead. And you can\u2019t do that Adam, just can\u2019t do stuff like that. Kieren Gilbert from Sky News asked Barnaby Joyce about Greg Mullins\u2019 comments: Of course, for the salaciousness, we want sort of an adversarial relationship where people are throwing rocks at one another. I, like, completely condone that this is climate change. So let\u2019s put that one aside. And I acknowledge that things are getting drier. We\u2019re in a record drought. I mean, it\u2019s the bleeding obvious \u2013 look at the windows, wanna see what\u2019s happening. But if you say, and where I really disagree, though, is when Mr Bandt said, \u2018Oh, well, if we reduce, we stop using coal and have an anti-coal policy in Australia \u2013 that the fire season will be minimised.\u2019 That was his words. Go back and check your tape, that is what he said. That is either a lie, or absurdly misrepresenting and wrong. And I think it\u2019s because there is no policy domestically in Australia that\u2019s going to have any effect on the climate whatsoever. There are a range of things that affect the climate and on a global scale, you should be part of it, and acknowledge it would have an affect, and I acknowledge that there are other issues as well. There\u2019s just the the oscillation of the seasons. There\u2019s a change in the magnetic field of the sun. KG: But do you accept that the fire-burning opportunity is reduced, because of the fire season being longer. So the question is, when do you get to do the backburning? BJ: In the middle of winter, in times, where, after a sufficient period after rain, you \u2013 it\u2019s not as if there is no period where we do have the capacity to do it. It has been confounded by excessive bureaucracy. And I think that the bureaucracy is driven by, let\u2019s call it by conservation principle, by people who do not live in the forest, they do not live near the area. You know, we have the belief that there\u2019s a political sort of zeitgeist purpose that sits behind this, because it definitely was a political decision to let fire trials fall into disrepair. And it is definitely a bureaucratic process, that means that even when they can backburn, it is so difficult bureaucratically, that it either doesn\u2019t happen or it doesn\u2019t happen to the extent that it needs to. And it was a process and it is a policy that they don\u2019t have central watering points in the state forests and in the in the areas where they can get access to the mechanisms to fight these fires. And the other thing \u2013 the trees are right next to roads, and of course the trees burn fall over the roads, the fire trucks can\u2019t get in, and more importantly, people trying to escape the fire, can\u2019t get out. (Just another reminder that the fire authorities have said they have done hazard reduction burning ahead of this season.) Did I miss that period in Australian political history where the Greens held every single government? Or that the Liberals have held government in NSW for the last eight years? Or that the Coalition has held federal government for 17 of the last 23 years? Former NSW fire commissioner Greg Mullins wrote this in the SMH yesterday: Warmer, drier conditions with higher fire danger are preventing agencies from conducting as much hazard reduction burning \u2013 it is often either too wet, or too dry and windy to burn safely. Blaming \u201cgreenies\u201d for stopping these important measures is a familiar, populist, but basically untrue claim.\u201d He would know. It was his job to know. He, along with former fire and emergency chiefs from all over the country have tried to meet with the government since April to discuss issues with Australia\u2019s fire preparation, including the impact of climate change, and why the old way of doing things just isn\u2019t cutting it anymore. They didn\u2019t get that meeting. Barnaby Joyce is on Sky News talking about the hazard reduction burns and other things he thinks have been policy failures, less than 20 minutes after Scott Morrison told Ray Hadley that all of these issues (ahem, climate change) should only be discussed after the fire emergency. This is despite experts like Greg Mullins, saying that the fire seasons are getting closer together, leaving less time to do things like hazard burns. And also, that the Greens are not in power anywhere in Australia, and therefore have not actually enacted policy anywhere. As well as emergency service chiefs saying hazard reductions have been occurring each and every year. Joyce says it can be done during the winter. Which would be just before the Queensland fire season began this year \u2013 in September. When the rainforest was on fire. Gabby Chan has written about Michael McCormack\u2019s ABC radio interview yesterday \u2013 and the impact that his words have on people who live in the areas his party is supposed to be representing: Those of us who live in the country need metropolitan Australians to understand our lives more than ever. Yet this sort of rubbish about \u2018woke inner-city greenies\u2019 is exactly the sort of crap that divides the nation and takes the place of the more difficult policy work to address some of our challenges. It is cheap talk that kills farmers\u2019 social licence at a time when we need cities to understand how important the job of food-growing is for their own bellies and how important food production is to the economy of regional communities. As the dairy industry bleeds under crippling water prices, we need to have a serious conversation about the diversity of our food sector and its building blocks \u2013 soil, water and energy \u2013 and how they are impacted by climate change. We need the city to understand how important the growing renewables sector is to providing new jobs to our communities, while ensuring we take our own coal workers by the hand into new opportunities. The high court is sitting in Canberra today to hear Annika Smethurst\u2019s challenge against the validity of the warrant authorising the police raid on her home. In June the Australian federal police raided Smethurst\u2019s home, investigating an alleged breach of section 79(3) of the Crimes Act, which prohibits \u201ccommunicating or allowing someone to have access to an official secret without authorisation\u201d. Smethurst\u2019s challenge has two prongs: one challenging the validity of the warrant and the second challenging the validity of the offence on the basis it infringes the implied freedom of political communication. At the start of the hearing, chief justice Susan Kiefel reveals that the court has asked Smethurst\u2019s lawyers to focus their arguments on the validity of the warrant. Smethurst\u2019s counsel Stephen Lloyd says his understanding is the court wants him to make submissions about the warrant and then stop, which Kiefel confirms. This is a big hint that the case is not going to be decided on the constitutional argument. Attorney general Christian Porter has intervened in the case, asking the court to refuse a bid to destroy material collected from the raid, arguing it \u201cmay well be important\u201d for a potential future prosecution. Porter and the Australian federal police will be represented by solicitor general Stephen Donaghue. South Australia has intervened supporting the commonwealth, while the Australian Human Rights Commission has made further submissions about the limits of commonwealth power in support of Smethurst. Scott Morrison to Ray Hadley on \u201cpolicy discussions\u201d to be had after the fire emergency: But you\u2019re absolutely right, Ray the time to have those policy discussions are not in the middle of an operational response. And whether it\u2019s that [hazard reduction burning] or any other issue. It\u2019s not that people don\u2019t think those issues are important or need to be acknowledged \u2013 whatever issue we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s just going to focus our efforts on the operational response that\u2019s what people in the crisis areas need. Alexander Downer performing, \u201clol, I am not a spy (not that I can talk about it).\u201d I\u2019m not gonna say anything more about it,\u201d he told Sky News. The Australian government\u2019s fully cooperating, although I don\u2019t work for the Australian government any more. I\u2019m obviously in touch with them on all of this. And so that\u2019s our line ... ... America\u2019s politics is for Americans, not for us. I think we\u2019re best to keep me out of it if we possibly can.\u201d Scott Morrison is speaking to Ray Hadley on 2GB. \u201cI just really want to assure people that everything that can be done, is being done,\u201d he said, despite nature probably \u201cthrowing some curveballs\u201d. The defence force is on standby to assist \u2013 they are not necessarily trained in firefighting, but they can help with evacuations and coordinating teams. Alexander Downer is working his way through \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it because it is an ongoing US investigation, but I am not a spy\u201d tour. He will address the National Press Club later today. Meanwhile, the number of lobbyists wandering around Parliament House has almost doubled in less than a decade (spoiler \u2013 nothing is being done to address it). From Josh Taylor The number of lobbyists with unfettered access to the halls of Parliament House to see politicians, staffers and journalists under the sponsored pass holder scheme has nearly doubled in the last seven years, Guardian Australia has learned. In addition to parliamentarians, their staffers, building employees and the press gallery, there is a separate category for sponsored passes where people, often working as lobbyists, can enter and exit the building through the private entrances, and not need an escort through the non-public parts of the building. The passes are sponsored by MPs and senators, and although the orange passes are not limited to lobbyists, a significant proportion of those issued would be to groups lobbying in parliament. You can read more about that here. We start another day by talking about a trainwreck interview performance from a National party leader \u2013 this time Bridget McKenzie. It was over the dairy code, which is what sparked calls for her to be scrapped as deputy leader just a few weeks ago. After three years of discussions, the Nationals looked ready to move forward with the much-vaunted code. Then One Nation cottoned on to it and started making a lot of very public noises over it, including withholding votes on non-crucial legislation until one was implemented. It was a stunt more than anything \u2013 One Nation still turned up for every vote that mattered, but it was a very loud stunt and it forced McKenzie into saying the timetable would be moved up, meaning the code would be implemented early next year instead of mid next year. Pauline Hanson claimed victory. The National party MPs who had spent the past three years working on the code (marrying up the different state industries is a little difficult, but hey \u2013 that\u2019s the federation for you) were pretty annoyed that One Nation was taking credit for their work and went on the offensive. Next thing you know, there are backbench drought-assistance submissions and Barnaby Joyce is anywhere a blinking camera light is featured, and the Nats came together for peace in our times. Except that\u2019s not possible with all the stuff that is going on right now. McKenzie looked stressed in Senate question time yesterday, and her colleagues are openly questioning whether she is up to the job. It wouldn\u2019t matter so much if they weren\u2019t also questioning whether Michael McCormack was also up to the job, and after his tone-deaf head-in-the sand performance yesterday morning over climate change and its link to the catastrophic early bushfire season, well, things aren\u2019t exactly great in the Nationals group chat. So McKenzie got up this morning and spoke to ABC radio about the dairy code and just how on top of it she all is. Except \u2013 she\u2019s not. And she had to concede she didn\u2019t have all the answers about why changes have been made to the exposure draft. And she had to admit that it more than likely wouldn\u2019t be ready by January. \u201cWe either want to get it done quickly or we want to get it done right,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not going to rush to put out a code that is not going to be fit for purpose and not going to actually work in all eight of our [dairy] regions across the country.\u201d That sound you hear is Hanson skipping into work today. We\u2019ll cover that, plus the Senate, plus the government response to the ongoing bushfire emergency. You\u2019ve got a one-coffee Amy on your hands, so I will fix that, but you have the incomparable Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin to make up for my failings. Which may include, but are not limited to, typing diary instead of dairy every now and then. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

However, those seen as allied to the oligarch have dismissed Gontareva\u2019s claims of a campaign against her.</p> <p>\u201cThey decided to use this accident to maintain a PR campaign that somebody is trying to threaten her,\u201d said Alexander Dubinsky, who was elected to parliament as a member of Zelenskiy\u2019s Servant of the People party earlier this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f232d2bb40ad1e56c944c11dd0f952a126420cd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f232d2bb40ad1e56c944c11dd0f952a126420cd3/0_30_2587_1552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dubinsky previously worked as a journalist on the 1+1 channel partly owned by Kolomoiskiy, and has become one of the loudest critics of Gontareva and the National Bank, saying it preyed on banks and sold off their assets in corrupt auctions.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to understand that millions of people were affected by her decisions to bankrupt banks, millions of people lost their money,\u201d he said in an interview at a cafe in Kyiv\u2019s fashionable Podil district.</p> <p>Dubinsky said he did not believe there was any actual threat to Gontareva, despite the apparent car accident in London and the firebombing of her house, suggesting the attacks may have been faked.</p> <p>Earlier this year, he urged his more than 130,000 Facebook followers to begin a letter-writing campaign to the London School of Economics, where Gontareva has been given a fellowship, accusing her of stealing state funds. He has also sought to open a parliamentary commission to investigate the National Bank, but has been blocked by members of his own party.</p> <p>He denied his campaign against Gontareva was carried out on Kolomoiskiy\u2019s orders, saying he did not have a business relationship with the oligarch and had not spoken with him since before Zelenskiy\u2019s election.</p> <p>Some diplomatic observers say the story is a typically murky Ukrainian tale with no obvious good guys, but others involved in the country say Gontareva\u2019s role in cleaning up the banking sector should not be underestimated.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t realise what Ukraine avoided in 2014.

Her family had insisted she leave the bank in the face of repeated threats, she said. Gontareva is widely credited with cleaning up the banking sector, including by nationalising PrivatBank, which has accused Kolomoiskiy and his associates of the misappropriation and laundering of proceeds of corporate loans issued by the bank while he owned it. He has dismissed the allegations as nonsense. \u201cIt was a unique situation \u2013 33% of the private individual deposits and 50% of transactions, and the business was in the hands of an aggressive oligarch,\u201d said Gontareva. \u201cIt was just a Ponzi scheme.\u201d Since Zelenskiy\u2019s election, Kolomoiskiy has returned to Ukraine, amid rumours he is seeking a financial settlement for the PrivatBank case, and international investors have been spooked by Zelenskiy appointing a number of Kolomoiskiy-linked figures to key posts, including making the oligarch\u2019s former lawyer, Andriy Bohdan, his chief of staff. Kolomoiskiy initially agreed to an interview with the Guardian but later stopped answering messages. However, those seen as allied to the oligarch have dismissed Gontareva\u2019s claims of a campaign against her. \u201cThey decided to use this accident to maintain a PR campaign that somebody is trying to threaten her,\u201d said Alexander Dubinsky, who was elected to parliament as a member of Zelenskiy\u2019s Servant of the People party earlier this year. Dubinsky previously worked as a journalist on the 1+1 channel partly owned by Kolomoiskiy, and has become one of the loudest critics of Gontareva and the National Bank, saying it preyed on banks and sold off their assets in corrupt auctions. \u201cYou need to understand that millions of people were affected by her decisions to bankrupt banks, millions of people lost their money,\u201d he said in an interview at a cafe in Kyiv\u2019s fashionable Podil district. Dubinsky said he did not believe there was any actual threat to Gontareva, despite the apparent car accident in London and the firebombing of her house, suggesting the attacks may have been faked. Earlier this year, he urged his more than 130,000 Facebook followers to begin a letter-writing campaign to the London School of Economics, where Gontareva has been given a fellowship, accusing her of stealing state funds. He has also sought to open a parliamentary commission to investigate the National Bank, but has been blocked by members of his own party. He denied his campaign against Gontareva was carried out on Kolomoiskiy\u2019s orders, saying he did not have a business relationship with the oligarch and had not spoken with him since before Zelenskiy\u2019s election. Some diplomatic observers say the story is a typically murky Ukrainian tale with no obvious good guys, but others involved in the country say Gontareva\u2019s role in cleaning up the banking sector should not be underestimated. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise what Ukraine avoided in 2014. Together with the IMF and foreign advisers, they cleaned up the banking sector, and her work was very important,\u201d said Leszek Balcerowicz, who was responsible for reforming Poland\u2019s economy in the 1990s and was brought into Ukraine in an advisory capacity by Poroshenko in 2016. He said the nationalisation of PrivatBank had been due to an enormous hole in its budgets, and was fully justified. \u201cIn any normal country you would get arrested for what happened to PrivatBank before,\u201d he said. Gontareva said she had no plans to return to Ukraine in the near future, but hoped Zelenskiy had the character to stand up to Kolomoiskiy. \u201cI know that he was a puppet, but let\u2019s hope that when you\u2019re 40 years old, clever and handsome, you don\u2019t want to be a puppet. For me it doesn\u2019t matter who he was. It matters who he will be,\u201d she said.",

Founded in 1863, the world\u2019s oldest social democratic party has been a central pillar of Germany\u2019s postwar political order, but as a junior partner to Merkel\u2019s CDU its fortunes have declined dramatically in recent years, dropping to historic lows in the European elections this year. Following the resignation of Andrea Nahles as SPD chair in June, two relatively little-known politicians, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, standing as a joint ticket, have emerged as surprise leadership contenders from the leftwing of the party. They are up against Germany\u2019s vice-chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and Klara Geywitz, from east Germany, in a run-off vote whose result will be announced on 30 November. In an interview with three European newspapers \u2013 the Guardian, El Pa\u00eds and La Republicca \u2013 the pair said that if they won they would seek a reorientation of the SPD along traditional leftwing principles that would probably put the party on a collision course with Merkel\u2019s conservatives. \u201cWe took a turn into a neoliberal wilderness\u201d, said Walter-Borjans, 67, whom German media have likened to the US Democrat Bernie Sanders. \u201cThere were advisers who also impressed on us Social Democrats that everything works best once it is privatised, if you lower taxes for high earners and increase VAT for those who earn less.\u201d He said that to win back voters\u2019 trust, the SPD needed to \u201cface up to the mistakes made in the past\u201d, which also included its tacit support for austerity measures in Europe. \u201cThe SPD has allowed itself to be dragged into this framing where Germany is always the paymaster.

Walter-Borjans in particular is seen as a rising star because his backstory speaks of strong principles and an appetite for risk-taking. In his former role as finance minister in North-Rhine Westphalia, he paid \u20ac19m for CDs containing whistleblowers\u2019 data on thousands of Swiss bank clients who were not paying their fair share of tax \u2013 prompting thousands of people to turn themselves in to the authorities and pay back \u20ac7.2bn in taxes. Critics point out that when he left his old job in 2017 the debt pile was 60% higher than when he started. The two politicians would not be drawn on whether joining the governing alliance was one of the mistakes they would seek to reverse.

Earlier on Monday evening Morales tweeted a farewell after his resignation in the wake of a disputed election, saying that he would be take up the offer of asylum in Mexico but would soon \u201creturn with greater strength and energy\u201d. The Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard tweeted a picture of the former leader draped in the flag of Mexico, and said: \u201cThe Mexican Air Force plane has already taken off with Evo Morales on board. According to current international conventions, it is under the protection of Mexico. Your life and integrity are safe.\u201d Morales left behind a country close to chaos as his supporters and adversaries clashed on the streets, and reports of looting, vandalism and arson in the wake of an October election which the Organisation of American States reported to be rigged in his favour. The police urged La Paz residents to stay indoors and declared they were joining forces with the army to help quell the violence, as Morales\u2019 departure stoked fears of a power vacuum. Morales said in his tweet: \u201cSisters and brothers, I leave for Mexico, grateful for the generosity of the government of that kindred people who gave us asylum to defend our lives. It hurts to leave the country for political reasons, but I will remain vigilant. Soon I will return with greater strength and energy.\u201d Morales\u2019 decision to step down followed several quick-fire developments on Sunday, beginning with the release of a report by the Organisation of American States (OAS) which said it had found \u201cclear manipulations\u201d of the voting system in the October presidential election and could not verify the first-round victory for Morales.

      "bodyText": "Annika Smethurst\u2019s lawyers have been urged to clarify their case on whether material copied from her phone was confidential to support her bid to force police to delete the information taken during the raid on her home. On Tuesday the high court stood over oral submissions to Wednesday\u2019s hearing to give Smethurst\u2019s counsel time to clarify her case and consider seeking an order to prevent the use of material copied from her phone rather than its destruction. Smethurst is challenging the legality of the Australian federal police June raid investigating whether she and her source breached secrecy provisions by publication of part of a classified document revealing a proposal for the Australian Signals Directorate to gain new spying powers. The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, representing the Australian Federal Police and attorney general Christian Porter, has urged the court not to order destruction of material which \u201cmay well be important\u201d in prosecution of Smethurst or her source. On Tuesday morning the chief justice, Susan Kiefel, directed Smethurst\u2019s counsel, Stephen Lloyd, to confine oral submissions to the validity of the warrant authorising the raid rather than the constitutionality of the alleged offence police were investigating. The warrant said: \u201cOn the 29 April 2018, Annika Smethurst and the Sunday Telegraph communicated a document or article to a person, that was not in the interest of the commonwealth, and permitted that person to have access to the document, contrary to section 79(3) of the Crimes Act 1914, Official Secrets\u201d. Lloyd argued the warrant needed to describe the information police were seeking, \u201chow it came to be proscribed\u201d and particulars of the \u201coffending conduct\u201d rather than just a reference to the section of the offence. Lloyd argued the lack of detail on the warrant was \u201capt to mislead Smethurst and the executing officers\u201d to allow a broad search of any material critical of the government. Smethurst has asked the court for an injunction ordering the police to destroy material collected and copied from her phone on the basis the raid constituted trespass. Lloyd was grilled repeatedly about how the court could order destruction of documents, without a breach in equity such as a breach of confidence. Kiefel said that a breach of confidentiality could result in destruction of confidential material but noted \u201cthat\u2019s not this case\u201d and the plaintiffs had \u201cnever said the information was confidential to the plaintiff\u201d, an observation echoed by Justices Patrick Keane and Geoffrey Nettle. Lloyd responded that damages were \u201cnot an adequate remedy\u201d and although the plaintiffs hadn\u2019t asserted breach of confidence the court should undo the wrong of material being \u201cforcibly taken from the phone\u201d through the torts of trespass and conversion. Kiefel suggested some of the material may be confidential depending on its \u201cultimate source\u201d and queried whether a negative injunction ordering the police not to use the information would be sufficient. Lloyd said that it may be. Lloyd then changed tack, arguing that copied material is confidential in the sense that \u201cit\u2019s on their own phone and they\u2019re the only one that can access it\u201d. After a short break, the court returned and Kiefel suggested it stand over submissions on relief so that Smethurst\u2019s counsel could consider their position further. Lloyd suggested on Wednesday he may shift Smethurst\u2019s case to seek a negative injunction preventing police using material seized and copied, rather than its destruction. Kiefel replied that Lloyd would still have to examine the \u201cunderlying cause [of action]\u201d and warned \u201cthe basis for a negative or mandatory injunction needs to be dealt with with a good degree of particularity tomorrow morning\u201d. Lloyd argued in addition to an injunction Smethurst would like the offence ruled unconstitutional both because of the ongoing investigation of her and because police \u201cmight issue a warrant in relation to other people\u201d. Donaghue submitted that in the real world it \u201ccould not have been clearer\u201d to Smethurst what material the police had come to seize, given the warrant included the date she had published three articles about the confidential document. Donaghue submitted that a \u201clong line\u201d of authorities had established that it was sufficient for the warrant to contain details of the section and title of the alleged offence. \u201cOne can\u2019t slide from the statutory requirement to state the offence to a requirement to set out the conduct with particularity,\u201d he said, noting this was particularly difficult at the investigation phase. Donaghue conceded that some of the grammar in the warrant was \u201cnot good\u201d and the description was \u201cinapt\u201d because it lifted language from a possible defence \u2013 that communication of information was part of an officer\u2019s duty and not against the commonwealth\u2019s interests \u2013 in describing the offence. Donaghue noted that evidence seized in the raid can be used to prosecute offences other than the one listed on the warrant including the alleged unlawful disclosure to Smethurst by her source, possibly in breach of the Intelligence Services Act. Donaghue asked the court not to \u201cpre-empt\u201d the exercise of discretion to admit evidence \u2013 even where it was unlawfully obtained \u2013 that could be exercised if charges are laid. Donaghue argued that the principles for a negative injunction are \u201cno different\u201d and even if Smethurst succeeds in challenging the warrant, police should be free to use the material because if they can never look at it they are unable to decide whether or not to recommend charges. He noted an undertaking by the AFP not to use the material will \u201cexpire\u201d at the conclusion of the high court case. The hearing continues on Wednesday.",

As fires burn across eastern Australia, the government is in textbook authoritarian mode, deliberately inflaming division and manufacturing outrage towards its critics in an attempt to divert from its own manifest failure to protect the regions. It\u2019s ugly civics, but far more insidious than the rhetoric is a raft of laws and regulations that have the prospect to fundamentally recast Australia\u2019s democracy. While the media has worked itself into a lather over the impact of the tendency towards command and control on press freedom with its Right to Knowcampaign, it has remained largely silent on the implications of this broader agenda. Already in front of federal parliament is the so-called \u201cunion-busting bill\u201d, where a politician can launch action to disqualify a union official or even deregister an entire union if it has deemed to breach not just criminal law, but civil regulations.

Now that confected lawlessness is used to justify further tightening. This follows attempts last year to control the funding of charities, including making it illegal for global movements to cooperate over national borders. While the laws were wound back, the requirements created costly and time-consuming administration and compliance. Meanwhile, NGOs that receive government funds to support service delivery are having their terms of operation tightened, with any activities smacking of advocacy deemed a shortcut to a budget cut. The Australian Electoral Commission investigation of GetUp to deem it a political party, meaning it would be subject to onerous regulation and compliance, fills out the picture with a simple: if you campaign against the Morrison government and business interests, we will be coming for you. The prime minister has been ramping up the anger since his election win, hitting a menacing low point recently with a petulant performance lambasting the character of climate protestors and foreshadowing new laws to outlaw consumer and environmental boycotts. While still unformed, it appears the PM wants to prevent citizens asking their banks and super funds to invest their money in their long-term interest (ie not in coal). Doing so would be a secondary boycott modelled on already repressive union laws, that open individuals and organisations up for damages for economic loss if they attempt to influence a supply chain. Taken in isolation, each of these proposals seem a bit like a Michael McCormack rant, irritating, misguided and slightly off-kilter. Join the dots, however, and something darker and more authoritarian is taking form, a government that purports to stand for freedom is using the instruments of the state to quell political dissent. But it\u2019s not enough for a government to propose to extend its power \u2013 history shows regimes shift from populist to authoritarian only with the permission of its people. And here\u2019s where this story gets even scarier because, according to this week\u2019s Essential Report, rather than generating outrage at these attacks on political freedom, the public appears pretty relaxed about the whole thing. These figures indicate the idea of outlawing protests is contested territory, roughly one third in favour, one third against and one third on the fence. The divisions are sharply partisan but there is significant support for tightening of these controls among conservative voters and even a quarter of Labor voters. Maybe this is driven by the vitriolic fallout of the climate change debate, but what is clear is an emerging tolerance for state action to prevent those with different views from asserting their right to push back. Unpack a little more, and you can start to get a feel for where the battle lines are being drawn: in one corner our democratic heritage; in the other a strong government standing up for the nation. Responses to these sets of statements \u2013 by the same audience \u2013 show that attitudes about dissent change when the frame of the debate shifts. There is strong support for the notion of a right to protest as a democratic right and the right to pressure banks not to invest in coal. But this is tempered by majority support for the proposition that government should limit citizen protests when it disrupts business or is \u201ccontrary to the national interest\u201d. The shift here is from cause to effect. While we endorse our individual rights, we have a surprising tolerance for government to intervene when it determines a broader impact. The latter proposition in particular should give pause for concern, because if the government \u2013 with the compliance of sections of the traditional media and the amplification of the post-truth echo chambers of Facebook \u2013 can define the national interest, it is granting itself permission to limit dissent. Add the government\u2019s ability to collect, store and analyse vast troves of personal information in the national interest, and it\u2019s more than our right to know we should be worried about.

The strategic port has become emblematic of the country\u2019s investment in Greece. A decade later an estimated 10% of Chinese exports to Europe are thought to move through Piraeus, making it a direct competitor to continental ports further north such as Hamburg and Rotterdam.</p> <p>Within hours of bilateral discussions getting under way on Monday, Athens formally endorsed Cosco expanding operations in the port with a \u20ac600m project or \u201cmasterplan\u201d that will see Chinese investment approach \u20ac2.5bn in Greece. The project is aimed squarely at accelerating Piraeus\u2019 role as a hub for Chinese containers that can now save millions in shipping costs travelling from Asia to Europe via the Suez Canal.</p> <p>Mitsotakis, who visited the Cosco piers with Xi, said the two seafaring nations were united in wanting to make Piraeus \u201cnot only the largest port in the Mediterranean but in Europe.\u201d In an editorial published in Kathimerini on the eve of his arrival, the Chinese president described the investment \u201cas the dragon\u2019s head.\u201d</p> <p>With Greece\u2019s debt-stricken economy only slowly recovery from financial crisis, Athens is eager to tap China\u2019s massive market with exports such as olive oil and wine. The pro-business government, which assumed power barely four months ago, is also keen to attract further foreign investment viewed as vital to generating growth and jobs in a EU member state where unemployment remains extraordinarily high at 17.3%.</p> <p>The visit has also required the Greek prime minister to walk a diplomatic tight rope.</p> <p> The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, warned the Nato ally during a trip to Athens in October against accepting Chinese deals that look \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d. In a keynote speech he accused China of \u201cusing economic means to coerce countries into lopsided deals that benefit Beijing and leave its clients mired in debt\u201d.</p> <p>Greek interaction with Beijing \u2013 including Athens\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/18/greece-eu-criticism-un-china-human-rights-record\">refusal under its previous leftist-led government to endorse a EU statement deploring human rights violations in China</a> \u2013 has fed suspicion in western capitals. Fears were raised further when the former prime minister Alexis Tsipras announced in April that Greece would join the Beijing-led \u201c17 +1\u201d cooperation platform of central and eastern European countries despite vocal EU criticism of the grouping undermining the bloc\u2019s unity. The move came less than a year after Athens also agreed to sign up to China\u2019s flagship Belt and Road initiative.</p> <p>\u201cGeopolitically, western partners are concerned that Greece\u2019s flirtation with China may weaken the south-eastern flank of Nato and the EU,\u201d said Plamen Tonchev, head of the Asia unit at the Institute of International Economic Relations in Athens. \u201cMitsotakis will have a hard time convincing them that Greece is not a Trojan horse. He will have to deliberately double down to ensure that business with China does not undermine Athens\u2019 allegiance to the west.\u201d</p> <p>Before leaving on Tuesday, Xi was given a tour of the sculptures that once graced the 5th century BC Acropolis, the highlight of his visit, according to members of the Chinese delegation.</p> <p>\u201cIn the east civilisation sprang from China, in the west it sprang from Greece,\u201d enthused Luo Tong, a prominent Greek scholar who guided China\u2019s former president Hu Jintao around the monument when he visited Athens in November 2008. \u201cTogether we are a bridge of history,\u201d she told the Guardian, standing within view of the site. \u201cWe Chinese know that if we want to connect with the western world we have to understand Greece.\u201d</p> <p>Signalling that cultural diplomacy would reinforce blossoming Sino-Greek relations, Xi declared that Athens had Beijing\u2019s full support in its campaign to win back the Parthenon marbles from the British Museum. \u201cNot only do I agree [with their repatriation] but you also have our support,\u201d said the Chinese president when prompted by his Greek counterpart to take a stance on the issue during a tour of the Acropolis Museum. \u201cWe, too, have our own [treasures] outside the country and are doing everything we can to get them home.\u201d</p>",

The project is aimed squarely at accelerating Piraeus\u2019 role as a hub for Chinese containers that can now save millions in shipping costs travelling from Asia to Europe via the Suez Canal. Mitsotakis, who visited the Cosco piers with Xi, said the two seafaring nations were united in wanting to make Piraeus \u201cnot only the largest port in the Mediterranean but in Europe.\u201d In an editorial published in Kathimerini on the eve of his arrival, the Chinese president described the investment \u201cas the dragon\u2019s head.\u201d With Greece\u2019s debt-stricken economy only slowly recovery from financial crisis, Athens is eager to tap China\u2019s massive market with exports such as olive oil and wine. The pro-business government, which assumed power barely four months ago, is also keen to attract further foreign investment viewed as vital to generating growth and jobs in a EU member state where unemployment remains extraordinarily high at 17.3%. The visit has also required the Greek prime minister to walk a diplomatic tight rope. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, warned the Nato ally during a trip to Athens in October against accepting Chinese deals that look \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d. In a keynote speech he accused China of \u201cusing economic means to coerce countries into lopsided deals that benefit Beijing and leave its clients mired in debt\u201d. Greek interaction with Beijing \u2013 including Athens\u2019 refusal under its previous leftist-led government to endorse a EU statement deploring human rights violations in China \u2013 has fed suspicion in western capitals. Fears were raised further when the former prime minister Alexis Tsipras announced in April that Greece would join the Beijing-led \u201c17 +1\u201d cooperation platform of central and eastern European countries despite vocal EU criticism of the grouping undermining the bloc\u2019s unity. The move came less than a year after Athens also agreed to sign up to China\u2019s flagship Belt and Road initiative. \u201cGeopolitically, western partners are concerned that Greece\u2019s flirtation with China may weaken the south-eastern flank of Nato and the EU,\u201d said Plamen Tonchev, head of the Asia unit at the Institute of International Economic Relations in Athens. \u201cMitsotakis will have a hard time convincing them that Greece is not a Trojan horse. He will have to deliberately double down to ensure that business with China does not undermine Athens\u2019 allegiance to the west.\u201d Before leaving on Tuesday, Xi was given a tour of the sculptures that once graced the 5th century BC Acropolis, the highlight of his visit, according to members of the Chinese delegation. \u201cIn the east civilisation sprang from China, in the west it sprang from Greece,\u201d enthused Luo Tong, a prominent Greek scholar who guided China\u2019s former president Hu Jintao around the monument when he visited Athens in November 2008. \u201cTogether we are a bridge of history,\u201d she told the Guardian, standing within view of the site. \u201cWe Chinese know that if we want to connect with the western world we have to understand Greece.\u201d Signalling that cultural diplomacy would reinforce blossoming Sino-Greek relations, Xi declared that Athens had Beijing\u2019s full support in its campaign to win back the Parthenon marbles from the British Museum. \u201cNot only do I agree [with their repatriation] but you also have our support,\u201d said the Chinese president when prompted by his Greek counterpart to take a stance on the issue during a tour of the Acropolis Museum. \u201cWe, too, have our own [treasures] outside the country and are doing everything we can to get them home.\u201d",

Here are some of the top stories of the afternoon: Transcripts of impeachment depositions for key figures Laura Cooper, Christopher Anderson, and Catherine Croft were released today. US condemns \u201cunjustified use of deadly force\u201d in Hong Kong protests Bernie Sanders spoke out against ongoing clashes in Bolivia, saying it \u201cappears to be a coup.\u201d Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is considering entering the 2020 presidential race. The Trump administration is set to significantly limit the kinds of medical and scientific research the government can use to determine public health regulations, undermining scientific standards The Trump administration is set to significantly limit the kinds of medical and scientific research the government can use to determine public health regulations, according to a proposal reported on by the New York Times, raising concerns among scientists and physicians. The Environmental Protection Agency proposal would require scientists to disclose all of their raw data, including confidential medical records, before the agency could consider an academic study\u2019s conclusions. The measure would undermine scientific basis for many public health and policy regulations, critics say, and make it ore difficult to enact new clean air and water rules. The proposal would also retroactively apply to existing health regulations. From the New York Times: Public health experts warned that studies that have been used for decades \u2014 to show, for example, that mercury from power plants impairs brain development, or that lead in paint dust is tied to behavioral disorders in children \u2014 might be inadmissible when existing regulations come up for renewal. A new poll has found Donald Trump\u2019s approval ratings among women have hit their lowest point in over a year. According to a poll published by the Hill, just 37% of women say they approve of the job Trump is doing - down from 44% in July of 2018. Meanwhile, 63% of women say they disapprove of Trump\u2019s performance as president. As the 2020 elections approach, suburban women are thought to be a key voting block in determining the results. Trump\u2019s overall approval rating has dropped one percentage point to 47%, the poll found. Democrats behind the impeachment investigation into Donald Trump released transcripts from two more key witnesses on Monday. Interviews with diplomat Christopher Anderson and state Department Ukraine specialist Catherine Croft have been released and can be read here. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is considering entering the 2020 presidential race, the Associated Press reports: Patrick ruled out a run earlier this year but has since been talking with Democratic operatives and donors about launching a campaign. His deliberations come as some Democrats express uncertainty about the party\u2019s current crop of contenders. Patrick has not made a final decision on whether to run and faces fast-approaching deadlines to get on the ballot in key states. Patrick is a close ally of former President Barack Obama. He made history as Massachusetts\u2019 first black governor, serving from 2007 to 2015. Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders spoke out on Monday against ongoing clashes in Boliva that lead to the ousting of president Evo Morales this week. Donald Trump previously hailed the ouster of the Leftist president as a \u201csignificant moment for democracy\u201d even as others alluded to it being a coup. \u201cI am very concerned about what appears to be a coup in Bolivia, where the military, after weeks of political unrest, intervened to remove President Evo Morales,\u201d he said in a tweet. \u201cThe U.S. must call for an end to violence and support Bolivia\u2019s democratic institutions\u201d. The US has condemned \u201cunjustified use of deadly force\u201d in the latest Hong Kong violence and urged police and civilians alike to de-escalate the situation, a senior Trump administration official said on Monday. The statement, given under condition of anonymity to Reuters, comes after clashes in pro-democracy protests across the Chinese-ruled territory, a former British colony, stepped up over the weekend. Hong Kong police shot and critically wounded a protester and a man was set on fire in violence that prompted leader Carrie Lam to denounce \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d \u201cHong Kong police and civilians alike have a responsibility to de-escalate and avoid violent confrontations,\u201d the official said. Democratic impeachment investigators in the House released a transcript Monday of the testimony of Laura Cooper, deputy assistant defense secretary for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. Lawmakers are investigating whether Trump violated his oath of office by attempting to influence the president of Ukraine to investigate Democratic rivals, including Joe Biden. The 3.5-hour testimony transcript spans 115 pages and mentions how Trump froze congressionally approved aid to Ukraine. Cooper raised concerns about this, she said in the transcript, as did others. The full transcript can be read here. Hello readers, Kari Paul in San Francisco taking over for the next few hours. More news to come. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Kari Paul, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: A federal judge dismissed Trump\u2019s lawsuit challenging the House ways and means committee\u2019s ability to obtain the president\u2019s state tax returns from New York officials. The judge, a Trump appointee, said the president\u2019s legal team could refile the case in New York. Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to John Bolton at the national security council, filed a brief opposing Mick Mulvaney\u2019s effort to join his lawsuit seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether to comply with a congressional subpoena in the impeachment inquiry. Public hearings in the impeachment inquiry begin on Wednesday, and they could mark a turning point in Americans\u2019 perception of the investigation. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, is reportedly considering launching an impeachment podcast. Representative Pete King, a longtime Republican congressman who represented Long Island, became the latest GOP lawmaker to announce his retirement. Trump\u2019s Veterans Day speech in New York was met with protests along Fifth Avenue. Kari will have much more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Trump is once again complaining about the whistleblower who kicked off the Ukraine scandal and demanding the anonymous official publicly testify, as some of his Republican allies have also called for. \u201cWhere is the Whistleblower who gave so much false information? Must testify along with Schiff and others!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. He added in a separate tweet, \u201cTo think I signed the Whistleblower Protection Act!\u201d But as a reporter for the NPR affiliate WBUR noted, the law outlining protections for whistleblowers was actually enacted decades before Trump took office. Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state under George W Bush, said she found reports of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s shadow diplomacy in Ukraine to be \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d \u201cWhat I see right now troubles me. I see a state of conflict between the foreign policy professionals and someone who says he\u2019s acting on behalf of the president but frankly I don\u2019t know if that is the case,\u201d Rice said at a conference in Abu Dhabi. \u201cIt is troubling. It is deeply troubling.\u201d Rice added she thought it was \u201cout of bounds\u201d for the president to call for a foreign country to investigate one of his political rivals. \u201cThe call is murky, it is really murky,\u201d Rice said of Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president. \u201cI don\u2019t like for the president of the United States to mention an American citizen for investigation to a foreign leader. I think that is out of bounds.\u201d The Quinnipiac poll included some disappointing news for Michael Bloomberg\u2019s potential White House bid. According to the poll, very few New Hampshire voters would consider voting for the former New York mayor. More specifically, only 2 percent of the state\u2019s likely Democratic primary voters said they would definitely cast ballots for Bloomberg, while 37 percent said they would consider voting for him. More than half, 54 percent, said they would definitely not vote for Bloomberg. However, those dismal numbers may not matter much to the former mayor. Bloomberg\u2019s advisers have said he intends to forego the early voting states in order to focus on Super Tuesday states, such as Alabama and Arkansas. Joe Biden is clinging on to a narrow lead in New Hampshire as Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders also attract double-digit levels of support in the early voting state, according to a new poll. The Quinnipiac poll found Biden attracting the support of 20 percent of the state\u2019s Democrats compared to Warren\u2019s 16 percent, Buttigieg\u2019s 15 percent and Sanders\u2019 14 percent. Tulsi Gabbard also hit 6 percent, leaving her only one poll short of meeting the DNC\u2019s qualification for the December debate, although she remains short on the donor requirement. Everybody wants in on the impeachment podcast game \u2060\u2014 including the president\u2019s personal lawyer who plays a key role in the inquiry. Rudy Giuliani is reportedly considering launching his own impeachment podcast. CNN reports: Giuliani was overheard discussing the plans with an unidentified woman while at a crowded New York City restaurant, Sant Ambroeus, over lunch on Saturday. The conversation, which lasted more than an hour, touched on details including dates for recording and releasing the podcast, settling on a logo, and the process of uploading the podcast to iTunes and other podcast distributors. Two people who overheard Giuliani\u2019s discussion reached out to CNN and provided a recording they decided to make of the conversation. They contacted CNN unprompted after reading a recent story about Giuliani and the President\u2019s ongoing relationship. The people asked not to be identified and provided the audio recording on the condition that it not be published. ... In the conversation, Giuliani said he hoped to have four or five episodes \u2018to analyze the impeachment in every aspect.\u2019 Giuliani\u2019s intention seems to be to have four episodes finished before the start of the Senate trial. It would be bold (to say the least) of Giuliani to weigh in on the impeachment inquiry in such a public format while he is reportedly under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York over whether his dealings in Ukraine violated lobbying laws. A lawyer for Charles Kupperman, the former deputy to John Bolton at the national security council, argued that Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission of a quid pro quo (which he later walked back) made him ineligible to join Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether to comply with a congressional subpoena in the impeachment inquiry. The House and Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to John Bolton at the national security council, have filed briefs opposing Mick Mulvaney\u2019s effort to join Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether to testify in the impeachment inquiry. House lawyers argued that Mulvaney likely played a role in the decision to block administration officials from complying with congressional subpoenas in the investigation, thus the acting White House chief of staff was too conflicted to join Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit. The Washington Post reported yesterday: People close to Bolton and Kupperman said the two were flabbergasted by Mulvaney\u2019s surprise request to join the lawsuit because they and others on the national security team considered Mulvaney a critical player in the effort to get the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into Trump\u2019s political opponents. Their objection is twofold: Bolton views Mulvaney as a key participant in the pressure campaign, a situation that the then-national security adviser referred to derisively as \u2018a drug deal,\u2019 according to congressional testimony by his aides. The two men were barely on speaking terms when Bolton left his post in September, according to White House officials. And they believe Mulvaney\u2019s goal is to avoid testifying by joining a suit involving officials whose attorney has argued they may be limited in what they can share with Congress because of their role advising the president on national security matters. A federal judge in Washington has dismissed Trump\u2019s lawsuit challenging the House ways and means committee\u2019s ability to obtain his state tax returns from New York officials. Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, ruled that the president had not met his burden of establishing why his complaint could be taken up in the US district court for DC. The case could be refiled in New York. House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm offered reassurances that the congressional seat of Pete King, the longtime representative who announced his retirement this morning, would remain in GOP control. Democrats placed King on their retirement watch list earlier this year, and they will likely devote significant resources to capturing the Long Island district. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Public hearings in the impeachment inquiry start on Wednesday, and Trump appears to be preparing for them by claiming (without evidence) that the transcripts of the House committees\u2019 closed-door interviews were inaccurate. (No Republican present for the interviews has made such a claim.) Longtime Republican representative Pete King announced his retirement, kicking off what will likely be a heated race to succeed him. Trump\u2019s speech at New York\u2019s Veterans Day parade was met with protests. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. A Washington Post reporter shared a video of two Trump supporters clashing with a Bernie Sanders voter in New York, shortly after the president spoke at the city\u2019s Veterans Day parade. The Sanders supporter referenced Trump\u2019s claim during the 2016 campaign that he could get away with shooting someone on Fifth Avenue, as well as his offensive comments in the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape about groping women. Two of Rick Perry\u2019s political supporters were reportedly awarded an oil and gas deal in Ukraine after the energy secretary recommended one of them as a potential adviser to the country\u2019s new president. The AP reports: Perry\u2019s efforts to influence Ukraine\u2019s energy policy came earlier this year, just as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s new government was seeking military aid from the United States to defend against Russian aggression and allies of President Donald Trump were ramping up efforts to get the Ukrainians to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Ukraine awarded the contract to Perry\u2019s supporters little more than a month after the U.S. energy secretary attended Zelenskiy\u2019s May inauguration. In a meeting during that trip, Perry handed the new president a list of people he recommended as energy advisers. One of the four names was his longtime political backer Michael Bleyzer. A week later, Bleyzer and his partner Alex Cranberg submitted a bid to drill for oil and gas at a sprawling government-controlled site called Varvynska. They offered millions of dollars less to the Ukrainian government than their only competitor for the drilling rights, according to internal Ukrainian government documents obtained by The Associated Press. But their newly created joint venture, Ukrainian Energy, was awarded the 50-year contract because a government-appointed commission determined they had greater technical expertise and stronger financial backing, the documents show. Ethical experts said Perry likely did not break the law but still described his actions as \u201cicky,\u201d particularly given that many of Trump\u2019s allies are currently arguing the president mentioned the Bidens to Zelenskiy because he was trying to help crack down on the country\u2019s corruption. The announcement of Republican representative Pete King\u2019s retirement once again throws a spotlight on the high number of departures and defeats in the House GOP caucus since Trump took office. Meanwhile, Democrats are already considering possible candidates to replace King as the Long Island district\u2019s representative. Demonstrators who protested Trump\u2019s Veterans Day speech in New York criticized the president\u2019s treatment of veterans and called for his impeachment. \u201cI\u2019m here to protest Trump and support veterans,\u201d said Michelle Williams, 40. \u201cI don\u2019t know how so many veterans could support him after he was fined $2m for misrepresenting his charity saying it was to support them. I don\u2019t know how his supporters can be so against their best interests.\u201d \u201cMy father and brother are veterans, but I think a president should have served,\u201d added Derek Lowery, 52. He also criticized the Trump administration\u2019s policies toward former service members. \u201cVeterans should have the red carpet rolled out for them.\u201d Matt Mattingly, 47, specifically said he was participating in the protest to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cHe\u2019s stolen money to pay for his wall, and there are thousands of veterans being cut from Medicaid,\u201d Mattingly said. Former police commissioner Ray Kelly refused to be drawn on Trump\u2019s attendance. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be here to support our veterans,\u201d Kelly said. Trump has now concluded his appearance at New York\u2019s Veterans Day parade, where he addressed attendees amid protests on Fifth Avenue. The president touched on the recent death of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, telling the audience: \u201cThanks to American warriors, al-Baghdadi is dead, his second-in-charge is dead. We have our eyes on No. 3. His reign of terror is over, and our enemies are running very, very scared.\u201d Trump is now speaking at the Veterans Day parade in New York, taking the podium to cheers as demonstrators loudly protested just outside Madison Square Park. A handful of Trump\u2019s allies have adopted a new (and dubious) argument to push back against the impeachment inquiry. They argue that the president encouraging a foreign country to launch an investigation of his political rival, Joe Biden, does not constitute an impeachable offense. Representative Mac Thornberry, the ranking member on the House armed services committee, told ABC News yesterday: \u201cI believe it\u2019s inappropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival. ... I do not believe it was impeachable.\u201d Trump\u2019s former UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, similarly told NPR that it is \u201cnot a good practice for us ever to ask a foreign country to investigate an American.\u201d But she added, \u201cI don\u2019t see it as impeachable.\u201d Trump will soon speak at New York\u2019s Veterans Day Parade in Madison Square Park, and one building nearby marked his appearance by putting a sign calling for his impeachment in the window. As Trump challenged the accuracy of the impeachment transcripts without providing any evidence, an MSNBC correspondent noted that several Republicans affirmed the documents\u2019 authenticity last week. Trump is pushing back against the release of transcripts from the closed-door interviews in the impeachment inquiry by questioning the documents\u2019 accuracy without providing any evidence. \u201cShifty Adam Schiff will only release doctored transcripts,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cRepublicans should put out their own transcripts!\u201d However, a number of journalists who cover Capitol Hill, including this Fox News reporter, noted that none of the Republican members of the House committees leading the inquiry have challenged the transcripts\u2019 accuracy. It\u2019s also worth noting that Trump is now attacking the public release of the transcripts after Republicans previously criticized senior House Democrats for holding closed-door interviews in the inquiry. Representative Pete King, a New York Republican who has served in Congress since 1993, announced this morning that he would not seek reelection next year. King said in a Facebook post announcing his retirement: \u201cThe prime reason for my decision was that after 28 years of spending 4 days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford.\u201d King becomes the 20th House Republican to announce a departure amid increasing signs of GOP anxiety about regaining control of the chamber. In a strategy memo released earlier this year, House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm named King as one of the Republican lawmakers \u201cat the top of the retirement watch list,\u201d and his Long Island district will likely be considered a prime pick-up opportunity. King won his seat last year with 53 percent of the vote, his lowest percentage ever since first being elected in 1992. Pete Buttigieg praised the accomplishments of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency after an LA Times report misquoted the Democratic presidential candidate as lamenting the \u201cfailures of the Obama era.\u201d Some of Buttigieg\u2019s fellow presidential contenders have been criticized for attacking Obama\u2019s legacy, which appears to have made most of the Democratic candidates leery of going after the popular former president. Buttigieg is surging in the Iowa polls as he promotes a more moderate message than the one he trumpeted this summer, but his shifting stance has led some voters there to question his sincerity. A new report emerged yesterday that falls into the \u201cbig if true\u201d camp: the president\u2019s personal lawyer directly tied Ukraine\u2019s frozen military aid to an investigation of Joe Biden, according to one of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s associates. The New York Times reports: Not long before the Ukrainian president was inaugurated in May, an associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s journeyed to Kiev to deliver a warning to the country\u2019s new leadership, a lawyer for the associate said. The associate, Lev Parnas, told a representative of the incoming government that it had to announce an investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s political rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and his son, or else Vice President Mike Pence would not attend the swearing-in of the new president, and the United States would freeze aid, the lawyer said. The claim by Mr. Parnas, who is preparing to share his account with impeachment investigators, challenges the narrative of events from Mr. Trump and Ukrainian officials that is at the core of the congressional inquiry. It also directly links Mr. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, to threats of repercussions made to the Ukrainians, something he has strenuously denied. But Mr. Parnas\u2019s account, while potentially significant, is being contradicted on several fronts. None of the people involved dispute that the meeting occurred, but Mr. Parnas stands alone in saying the intention was to present an ultimatum to the Ukrainian leadership. Giuliani and Parnas\u2019s business partner, Igor Fruman, categorically denied the claim, but the report crucially indicates that Parnas may be splitting from the president and his personal lawyer. Good morning, live blog readers! This week could be one of the most pivotal yet for Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, with public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry set to begin on Wednesday. Two officials will testify together on Wednesday morning: George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, and Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine. Taylor\u2019s predecessor at the embassy in Kyiv, Marie Yovanovitch, will testify on Friday. The public hearings will give Americans the first chance to hear directly from witnesses who have testified about Trump allies\u2019 alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate one of the president\u2019s political rivals, Joe Biden. In his closed-door interview last month, Taylor testified to House committees leading the inquiry that he was told military aid to Ukraine was held up as Trump\u2019s allies sought public announcements of investigations into Biden\u2019s links to Ukraine and supposed Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Kent told the committees Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, led a \u201ccampaign of lies\u201d against Yovanovitch before she was recalled from her post. Those who have closely followed the investigation may not learn much new. But the sight of longtime civil servants testifying about whether the president sought foreign assistance in his re-election campaign could have a significant impact on public perception of the impeachment inquiry. If so, Wednesday could mark a turning point in the investigation \u2013 and in Trump\u2019s presidency. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping an eye on: Trump is in New York, where he will speak at the city\u2019s Veterans Day Parade in Madison Square Park at 10.35am ET. Mike Pence will speak at the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Veterans Day observance at Arlington National Cemetery at 11.30am ET. Biden will participate in a CNN town hall this evening. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned\u2026",

The study found the finch was no longer found across 88% of its historical range, which once stretched from near Tenterfield in New South Wales, where it was last seen in 1994.

Adani\u2019s environmental conditions demanded it author a conservation management plan for the finch, rather than requiring specific actions that would result in ecological outcomes. Reside said that sort of process can work only if approval authorities insist plans do protect species. \u201cThis is a particularly bad example. The original conditions that were set out [for the Carmichael mine], they were just amazingly poor,\u201d Reside said. \u201cIf you want to achieve something, like to halt the decline of a native species, you set out clearly what is required. Adani is required to make a plan. Just making a plan doesn\u2019t really solve anything. \u201cIt\u2019s like me having a career plan of winning the lottery \u2013 there\u2019s no way of making my plan likely to succeed. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a robust process. In other [Australian jurisdictions], they set conditions to make sure the population doesn\u2019t decline.\u201d Adani\u2019s conservation management plan will set aside 33,000ha of protected land for the black-throated finch and other species. It has said its plan was developed by ecologists and that clearing of finch habitat will occur gradually to transition the species to the offset site. Part of that conservation area sits on land earmarked for the Clive Palmer-backed Alpha North coalmine. The black-throated finch is also known to exist at the site of Palmer\u2019s other proposed Galilee Basin coalmine, the Galilee Coal project. The concern of ecologists is clear. Development has always been given precedent to the welfare of the black-throated finch. It has happened 775 times before. It will happen again, until we draw a line in the north Queensland dirt. Remarkably, the black-throated finch did not feature in the 2017 Guardian Australia Bird of the Year poll, though it did receive several write-in votes. It has been the runaway leader in both rounds this year, as the Carmichael coalmine reaches a critical stage of its construction.",

      "bodyText": "The Pentagon raised concerns over the US government\u2019s hold-up of military aid to Ukraine, which a national security official saw as \u201cessential\u201d, according to a congressional hearing transcript released on Monday. The testimony of Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense, released following a previous closed-door session, is the latest piece in the jigsaw of the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, which begins televised hearings on Wednesday. Cooper\u2019s testimony on 23 October was delayed by a few hours when a group of Republican members barged into the secure facility on Capitol Hill to stage a protest. She said the White House Office of Management and Budget directed the freeze on hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid for Ukraine against the judgment of career officials at both the defense and state departments. \u201cAll of the senior leaders of the US national security departments and agencies were all unified in their \u2013 in their view that this assistance was essential,\u201d Cooper said. She also raised concerns to senior government officials about the legality of withholding the money, which had been authorized by Congress. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, tweeted: \u201cLaura Cooper\u2019s testimony reveals how Trump froze Congressionally-approved aid to Ukraine. Cooper raised concerns about this hold, as did others.\u201d Cooper described the puzzlement at the Pentagon over the hold-up of military aid and how it queried the decision on 18 July. She told the hearing: \u201cWe called around to NSC [national security council], to state [department]. Those are our usual colleagues.\u201d Yet a satisfactory answer was not forthcoming. Other diplomats have testified that the Trump administration attempted to tie military aid to Ukraine to an investigation of a potential Democratic rival for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden. Cooper also told how Kurt Volker, then special envoy to Ukraine, implied the aid freeze might be resolved if the Ukrainians issued a statement to \u201cdisavow any interference in US elections\u201d and \u201ccommit to the prosecution of any individuals involved in election interference\u201d. Cooper was asked if Volker believed that such a gesture would \u201clift this issue\u201d of the $391m in military assistance. She replied: \u201cYes.\u201d Cooper\u2019s transcript adds to a growing body of evidence. Schiff has released transcripts from hundreds of pages of testimony received behind closed doors. Trump sought to question their veracity. He tweeted on Monday night: \u201cJust like Schiff fabricated my phone call, he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing!\u201d Trump did not cite evidence for the extraordinary claim and none of the diplomats quoted in the transcripts, or their lawyers, have complained about their accuracy. Nor has Schiff fabricated a phone call. Robert Luskin, who represents the witness Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU, said in an email to the Daily Beast: \u201cNo reason to believe that the transcript was altered.\u201d Conversely, Trump has repeatedly asserted that he released a full version of his \u201cperfect\u201d 25 July call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, repeatedly telling critics to \u201cRead the Transcript!\u201d In fact it was an edited version with some potentially crucial passages missing. The inquiry will reach a pivotal moment on Wednesday with appearances by Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine who told the House committees in closed-door sessions about his misgivings that US aid was being frozen, and George Kent, a senior state department official who expressed concern about Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani operating an irregular diplomatic channel. On Friday, the intelligence committee will hear from the former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who said in the private hearings she was removed after Giuliani waged a campaign against her with \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives\u201d. House Republicans released a list on Saturday of witnesses they would like brought before the committee, including Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who had business interests in Ukraine, and the anonymous whistleblower who brought a complaint against Trump over the Zelenskiy phone call. Neither is likely to be summoned. There will be inevitable parallels with the Watergate hearings in 1973, which over seven months transfixed the nation and precipitated the resignation of Republican Richard Nixon, and the 1998-99 impeachment of Democrat Bill Clinton, which was followed by his Senate acquittal. Although some Republicans have struggled to defend Trump\u2019s conduct, many of his dubious claims will probably be amplified by Republicans. John Farrell, a biographer of Nixon, told the Guardian: \u201cYou hope that people will try to pull themselves away from the snark and the terribly leading questions when the cameras are on but they may choose to grandstand for their base. Republicans, in particular, could decide that they just want to make the whole thing look like a circus, to tarnish it in the public eye.\u201d All concerned will be operating in a very different media environment that includes rightwing cable network Fox News and partisan echo chambers online. Brian Stelter, CNN\u2019s chief media correspondent, observed in a newsletter: \u201cThis is the first internet impeachment. The first social media impeachment. This is the first impeachment since Fox News became a powerful force in American politics. The first impeachment since smartphones, Twitter and \u2018alternative facts\u2019.\u201d Many political commentators believe Trump\u2019s impeachment is all but certain in the Democratic-controlled House, although he is almost certain to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate.",
