In a gripping late-night finish to the round robin matches in Group C, Belgium helped Great Britain across the line when their lowly regarded doubles team, Sander Gille (world ranked No 46 in singles) and Joran Vliegen (38), beat the former world No 3 and three-times major semi-finalist Grigor Dimitrov and Alexandar Lazarov 3-6, 6-4, 10-7. \u201cWe don\u2019t get many chances to play on big courts like this,\u201d a delighted Vliegen said. \u201cThere is Grigor on the other side of the net but you can\u2019t think about that.\u201d Earlier Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans breezed through their singles in straight sets against outclassed Moldovan opponents before Jamie Murray and Joe Salisbury, in only their third match together, added the doubles in quick time. It was an emphatic team performance, sustained by harmony and commitment. The clean sweep after a 2-1 defeat by Bulgaria and a win by the same score over Belgium in the first two ties sets up a knockout match against the hosts in a 24-nation event that has been played out across three cities thousands of miles apart in trying conditions. While the drama in Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide has ebbed and surged, tennis has rightly been a footnote in most news bulletins while the public consciousness has been gripped by the heat, polluted air and swirling, unpredictable winds that continue to drive the deadly fires ravaging large swaths of bushland in New South Wales and Victoria. Henman, who has never captained a team before, is in no doubt the camaraderie has held his squad together. \u201cThere\u2019s a WhatsApp group that\u2019s pretty lively, so you don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing,\u201d he said, shortly after Murray and Salisbury had beaten Radu Albot and Alexander Cozbinov 6-2, 6-3. \u201cWith practice there have been a lot of different drills, baseline drills, and the losers have had to buy a few dinners. It\u2019s been great from that point of view. I have been here a few days now and it has gone very, very quickly, so that is a good sign.\u201d Norrie shrugged off the disappointment of his defeat by Belgium\u2019s Steve Darcis on Sunday to beat the No 816-ranked Cozbinov 6-2, 6-2, and Evans was equally impressive defeating Albot, ranked 46, by the same score. Henman added: \u201cWhen I looked at the draw and we had Belgium, Moldova and Bulgaria it looked a good opportunity. I fancied our chances of making the quarters. In this team environment, to have the personal coaches is a huge asset. That certainly added a lot of value from Cam\u2019s point of view; he was the one I knew least. [Norrie\u2019s coach, Facundo Lugones] has been brilliant. \u201cBut it\u2019s the chemistry as well. We have had a lot of fun, put the hours in. We\u2019ve really enjoyed it. It\u2019s a good foundation and you see the spirit when the boys are out there on match point.\u201d Now they must all switch their focus to what will be an intense challenge against Lleyton Hewitt\u2019s Australian team. Henman, who lost nine of his 10 matches against the Australian during their playing days, joked: \u201cI hope I don\u2019t have to play Lleyton again.\u201d The real threats are De Minaur, who has twice come back from a set and a break down here to help keep the team\u2019s sheet clean, and Kyrgios. Henman sees the latter as more than just an enigma. \u201cI am a big fan because I think that there\u2019s a good person there,\u201d he said of a player who drives critics to paroxysms of anger with his boorish behaviour, yet has been at the forefront of fundraising for bushfire relief the past week or so. \u201cYou look at the weapons he has got, the athletic ability \u2013 it would be a shame if he is not successful.\u201d Except maybe tomorrow.",

That trophy proved to be the first of many, as Celtic and Rodgers swept everything before them over the following years, adding two league titles, two Scottish Cups and two more League Cups. It is harder to achieve such dominance in England but the principle of rising to big occasions is the same: Rodgers suggests the key to coping with pressure is to treat it as routine.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s something we train for, something we made clear when we came in [to Leicester],\u201d he said. \u201cA winning mentality comes from training, work, fight and running, being better and proving them wrong, and you take that into your game. So I would love to say there\u2019s been a bigger intensity [in training this week] but there\u2019s not. That\u2019s systematic in the players, so hopefully we can take that into the semi-final.\u201d</p> <p>Another feature of the 2015 disappointment that Rodgers remembers, and which could be pertinent again, is the role of Jack Grealish. At 19 the playmaker delivered a breakthrough performance for Villa at Wembley and now, aged 24, his influence at his hometown club is enormous, which comes as no surprise to Rodgers.</p> <p>\u201cI came away that day thinking: \u2018What a player that boy is,\u2019\u201d Rodgers said of the 2015 match. \u201cHe really stood out. He was drifting in and he showed he had the personality to play on the big stage.\u201d Rodgers has admired the way the player has developed, saying: \u201cHe has matured a lot since the time he was a talent and looks like he has fully developed physically and is a wonderful player.\u201d</p> <p>Leicester do not rely on any player as much as Villa count on Grealish but, even so, the tie\u2019s outcome could to an extent be decided by the displays of two players, Grealish and James Maddison, who are thought by many to be competing for the same spot in Gareth Southgate\u2019s England squad. Not by Rodgers, though.</p> <p>\u201cPeople compare [Grealish] to Maddison but he is totally different,\u201d Leicester\u2019s manager said. \u201cThey both have individual qualities but they are different players. Great skills, great ability. James Maddison is playing as a central midfielder. He not only attacks and scores goals but he also presses the game. Young Jack has a different role in the Villa team but he is a big talent.\u201d</p> <p>Grealish is so important to Villa that Smith may be tempted to leave him out to preserve him for the club\u2019s fight for Premier League survival, especially in the wake of a recent spate of injuries. Leicester have no such worries and even look quite comfortable in the top four, sitting in second place with a 14-point gap to fifth-placed Manchester United.</p> <p>Rodgers is likely to field his strongest possible lineup as he as aims to take Leicester to their first cup final since the 2000 edition of this competition. The team they beat in the semi-final back then? Villa, of course. \u201cLet\u2019s create a new history,\u201d said Rodgers.</p>",

You don\u2019t magnify things \u2013 you don\u2019t trap players under the pressure and magnify that any more.\u201d In 2016 Rodgers won his first trophy as a manager, the Scottish League Cup, which \u201cgave us as a team and squad real belief in the work we were doing together\u201d. That trophy proved to be the first of many, as Celtic and Rodgers swept everything before them over the following years, adding two league titles, two Scottish Cups and two more League Cups. It is harder to achieve such dominance in England but the principle of rising to big occasions is the same: Rodgers suggests the key to coping with pressure is to treat it as routine. \u201cThat\u2019s something we train for, something we made clear when we came in [to Leicester],\u201d he said. \u201cA winning mentality comes from training, work, fight and running, being better and proving them wrong, and you take that into your game. So I would love to say there\u2019s been a bigger intensity [in training this week] but there\u2019s not. That\u2019s systematic in the players, so hopefully we can take that into the semi-final.\u201d Another feature of the 2015 disappointment that Rodgers remembers, and which could be pertinent again, is the role of Jack Grealish. At 19 the playmaker delivered a breakthrough performance for Villa at Wembley and now, aged 24, his influence at his hometown club is enormous, which comes as no surprise to Rodgers. \u201cI came away that day thinking: \u2018What a player that boy is,\u2019\u201d Rodgers said of the 2015 match. \u201cHe really stood out. He was drifting in and he showed he had the personality to play on the big stage.\u201d Rodgers has admired the way the player has developed, saying: \u201cHe has matured a lot since the time he was a talent and looks like he has fully developed physically and is a wonderful player.\u201d Leicester do not rely on any player as much as Villa count on Grealish but, even so, the tie\u2019s outcome could to an extent be decided by the displays of two players, Grealish and James Maddison, who are thought by many to be competing for the same spot in Gareth Southgate\u2019s England squad. Not by Rodgers, though. \u201cPeople compare [Grealish] to Maddison but he is totally different,\u201d Leicester\u2019s manager said. \u201cThey both have individual qualities but they are different players. Great skills, great ability. James Maddison is playing as a central midfielder. He not only attacks and scores goals but he also presses the game. Young Jack has a different role in the Villa team but he is a big talent.\u201d Grealish is so important to Villa that Smith may be tempted to leave him out to preserve him for the club\u2019s fight for Premier League survival, especially in the wake of a recent spate of injuries. Leicester have no such worries and even look quite comfortable in the top four, sitting in second place with a 14-point gap to fifth-placed Manchester United. Rodgers is likely to field his strongest possible lineup as he as aims to take Leicester to their first cup final since the 2000 edition of this competition. The team they beat in the semi-final back then? Villa, of course. \u201cLet\u2019s create a new history,\u201d said Rodgers.",

      "bodyText": "Labour has urged Conservative MPs to defy the government and vote to restore a commitment to family reunion for child refugees in Brexit legislation, saying there was a \u201cmoral argument\u201d to protect desperately vulnerable young people. The joint letter to Tory MPs was written by Alf Dubs, the Labour peer whose amendment to the EU withdrawal bill to help refugee children was accepted by Theresa May\u2019s government, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary who is the current favourite to become the next Labour leader. The commitment was dropped in the revised version of the Brexit bill tabled by the Conservatives after Boris Johnson won a majority in December. The letter comes ahead of a Commons vote on a Labour amendment seeking to restore the plan. The letter cites the UK\u2019s \u201cproud record of supporting refugees\u201d, including helping children ahead of the second world war with the Kindertransport scheme, which saw Lord Dubs, whose father was Jewish, flee Czechoslovakia in 1939 as a child. \u201cBoris Johnson may have won a majority in parliament, but he did not win the moral argument to absolve himself of responsibility to some of the most vulnerable people in the world,\u201d the letter adds. While it seems extremely unlikely that many Tory MPs will rebel to back the Labour plan, the amendment and letter form part of a wider opposition effort to signal a continued intent to try to scrutinise the Brexit process. The withdrawal agreement bill, which sets out the legislative framework for departure, passed its second reading just before Christmas with a majority of 124, a hugely symbolic moment for the Tories after May\u2019s Brexit plan was repeatedly defeated in the Commons. The bill faces three days of scrutiny this week in the committee stage, where amendments can be tabled. Among others drawn up are proposals from Labour and the Lib Dems seeking to remove a new element committing the government to ending the post-departure transition period at the end of 2020, even if negotiations on final arrangements for trade and other areas have not been completed. Introducing the debate for the government, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said the commitment on the date showed the government was \u201cdetermined to honour its promise to the British people and to get Brexit done\u201d. He said: \u201cWith the EU and UK committed to a deal by the end of 2020 in the political declaration, now with absolutely clarity on the timetable we\u2019re working to, the UK and the EU will be able to get on with it.\u201d But a series of MPs intervened to warn that the deadline was unhelpful.

We had a good reaction in the second half, that\u2019s more like it. But in the first half before they scored it was there and back, there and back, no-one really dominated. But after they scored we didn\u2019t cope with that setback well enough. We didn\u2019t deal [with their system] well enough, we know they can play that way. They\u2019re good at what they do. The first goal, there\u2019s nothing we can do about that one. The second was a bit sloppy. And the third, we just didn\u2019t recover from those goals. We got into their heads a bit at half-time and was better second half. It was about believing, wanting the ball, passing forward. Someone needed to take responsibility and they did that second half. We have shown before that we have been down from a home tie and turned it round, last year against PSG, so we\u2019ve just got to believe, and hope we can put a performance on.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1502cd8f087e8308e6a5d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T22:19:37.511Z\">10.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Pep talks!</strong> \u201cThe first minutes were tight, but then it was an outstanding goal from Bernardo and we were really good.

But hopefully in front of our fans we can make a good game and reach the final again.\u201d He\u2019s repeatedly asked whether he\u2019s disappointed with the second-half performance, and eventually, understandably, loses a little patience. \u201cWe play against United.

But overall it was a good performance and we are very happy with this win. Pep wanted one more man in the middle so put me in there, and I\u2019m happy it worked.

City were <em>way</em> too good in the opening 45, and only a subsequent drop-off in their intensity saved United from a proper spanking. Solskjaer walks off wearing a frown that could cut diamonds. United aren\u2019t out of this tie completely, thanks to Marcus Rashford\u2019s brilliance, but it\u2019ll take one heck of a turnaround in the second leg on City\u2019s turf. The holders, magnificent tonight, have one foot and four toes in the final.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b506d98c379643a15da17beadea7652a7b5f404a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b506d98c379643a15da17beadea7652a7b5f404a/0_164_4364_2620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fernandinho of Manchester City celebrates victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fernandinho of Manchester City celebrates victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7a2c77cf1f45117d77541edf4d3ba35bfb4c74f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7a2c77cf1f45117d77541edf4d3ba35bfb4c74f/0_171_3944_2366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Whilst Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ponders defeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whilst Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ponders defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54ea68729b7a7ac48f51f0690ed9fedef24e11d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54ea68729b7a7ac48f51f0690ed9fedef24e11d0/0_0_5814_3874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City fans celebrate their team's victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City fans celebrate their team\u2019s victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T22:08:08.738Z\">at 10.08pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e14fd038f085eda5c113f5b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T21:50:50.180Z\">9.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min +2:</strong> Pereira tries to get something going down the left, but runs the ball out of play.

Outside, 14 house windows, and one shop window, were broken, leading to the arrest of seven juveniles and three adults for disorderly behaviour. Here come the seventies!</p> <p><strong>In the second leg at Old Trafford, City extended their aggregate lead when Lee, Mike Summerbee and Neil Young combined to set up Ian Bowyer on 17 minutes. </strong>Six minutes later, United halved the arrears, Paddy Crerard teeing up Paul Edwards. On the hour, George Best\u2019s shot was parried by Joe Corrigan into the path of Denis Law, with predictable results. Extra time loomed, but with eight minutes remaining, Alex Stepney failed to deal with Lee\u2019s speculative free kick and Summerbee sent City to Wembley, where they would beat West Bromwich Albion the following March.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeOAaxeSAnQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DeOAaxeSAnQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>The boot was on the other foot in 2010. </strong>It\u2019s the Carlos Tevez tie! Manchester City were looking to reach a major Wembley final for the first time in 29 years. Tevez, who had crossed the divide the previous summer, scored twice in the first leg at the Etihad, wiping out Ryan Giggs\u2019 early opener for a 2-1 victory. Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick put United 3-2 up on aggregate in the second half of the second leg at Old Trafford, but when Tevez scored with an outrageous mid-air backflick, extra time looked on the cards. Then Wayne Rooney popped up with a header deep into injury time, and City would have to wait another year to end their long wait for a trophy.

      "bodyText": "And a player looks to be leaving Old Trafford. City &gt; United. Scores on the doors. Jamie Jackson was our man at Old Trafford. Here\u2019s his verdict. Please click and enjoy ... and thank you for reading this MBM. Nighty night! And now Ole. \u201cFrom their first goal, especially from their second goal, we struggled to get to grips with them. We had a good reaction in the second half, that\u2019s more like it. But in the first half before they scored it was there and back, there and back, no-one really dominated. But after they scored we didn\u2019t cope with that setback well enough. We didn\u2019t deal [with their system] well enough, we know they can play that way. They\u2019re good at what they do. The first goal, there\u2019s nothing we can do about that one. The second was a bit sloppy. And the third, we just didn\u2019t recover from those goals. We got into their heads a bit at half-time and was better second half. It was about believing, wanting the ball, passing forward. Someone needed to take responsibility and they did that second half. We have shown before that we have been down from a home tie and turned it round, last year against PSG, so we\u2019ve just got to believe, and hope we can put a performance on.\u201d Pep talks! \u201cThe first minutes were tight, but then it was an outstanding goal from Bernardo and we were really good. In the second half they changed their shape, but it is a good result. It is not over because it is United, see what they did in the Champions League against PSG. But hopefully in front of our fans we can make a good game and reach the final again.\u201d He\u2019s repeatedly asked whether he\u2019s disappointed with the second-half performance, and eventually, understandably, loses a little patience. \u201cWe play against United. What do you expect? Zero-seven here, or what?! They played good and changed the situation, especially Greenwood between the lines, and we had a little problem. But we play at Old Trafford, against our rival, in a semi-final, and it was a fantastic result for us.\u201d Man-of-the-match Bernardo Silva speaks to Sky Sports: \u201cThe first half was pretty much the perfect 45 minutes. We could have even been winning four or five, because we missed a few chances. Then the second half was very hard for us, they started pressing higher. But overall it was a good performance and we are very happy with this win. Pep wanted one more man in the middle so put me in there, and I\u2019m happy it worked. It\u2019s never easy to come to Old Trafford against one of the best sides in England and in Europe, and to win 3-1.\u201d Kyle Walker adds: \u201cThe second half, they had to come out fighting. We knew what to expect, we had to control the game as much as possible and save our legs.\u201d Probably the best United could have hoped for after that abomination of a first-half performance. City were way too good in the opening 45, and only a subsequent drop-off in their intensity saved United from a proper spanking. Solskjaer walks off wearing a frown that could cut diamonds. United aren\u2019t out of this tie completely, thanks to Marcus Rashford\u2019s brilliance, but it\u2019ll take one heck of a turnaround in the second leg on City\u2019s turf. The holders, magnificent tonight, have one foot and four toes in the final. 90 min +2: Pereira tries to get something going down the left, but runs the ball out of play. On the touchline, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks on impassively, all colour drained from his face. 90 min +1: But it\u2019s City who are probing right now. Foden and Silva take turns to dribble on the edge of the United box. Neither can find a way through. 90 min: There will be three added minutes. United are going to lose a cup tie at home to their neighbours for the first time in their history. But if they can get another goal back, they\u2019ll feel so much better about themselves. Can they find a tie-changer? 88 min: Rashford sends a no-backlift screamer towards the top right from 25 yards. An effort that stuns Bravo, who clumsily fumbles his save round the post, nearly pushing the ball into his own net. City don\u2019t clear the first corner; they deal easily with the second. 87 min: Mahrez is replaced by Foden. Mahrez takes his sweet time to depart, and Fred tries to usher him off the playing field. Given he\u2019s on a yellow, he\u2019s taking a wee chance there. But the referee understands his frustration. 86 min: Mahrez looks like bursting free down the right. He\u2019s well shepherded away from danger by Williams, who wins a rare defensive duel. A young player on a steep learning curve. 84 min: Martial slips Williams into space down the left. Williams crosses low and hard. There\u2019s nobody in red taking a chance, and Bravo claims easily. 83 min: Rashford briefly threatens to break clear down the right, making space to shoot, but as he enters the box he\u2019s robbed by Otamendi. 82 min: Walker is booked for faffing around in the professional style over a throw. 81 min: United make their final change. Greenwood is replaced by Anthony Martial. 80 min: But City are taking no unnecessary risks with their star man, and De Bruyne walks off, looking fine, to be replaced by Jesus. 78 min: De Bruyne clatters into Lindelof, and ends face down on the turf. For a second there\u2019s panic all round, as De Bruyne lies stock still. But it\u2019s soon clear he\u2019s not been knocked out, and quickly enough he\u2019s up and about again. 76 min: On the touchline, Pep bollocks his players with great feeling. He\u2019s clearly not enamoured with their drop-off in intensity during this second half. 74 min: United back off De Bruyne as he drives down the left. They\u2019re fortunate that the City playmaker gets the ball stuck a little under his feet before he can shoot, and then plays an uncharacteristically sloppy pass inside. The hosts clear. 73 min: A yellow card for Williams, who barges into the back of Mahrez with unnecessary force. 71 min: Well that\u2019s got Old Trafford singing again. Sterling does his level best to quieten them down by tearing down the inside left and into the box, but he dallies over a shot and is forced to clip back for Mahrez, who clumps softly into the arms of De Gea. City nearly had a four-goal lead; now it\u2019s just two! De Bruyne and Rodri get careless in midfield. Greenwood strides down the middle before slipping a ball down the inside-right channel for Rashford, who takes a silky touch, strides into the box, and lashes a fine shot across Bravo and into the bottom left! 69 min: Mahrez drops a shoulder to drift past Williams yet again, then slams a shot towards the bottom-left corner. De Gea sticks out a strong leg to save. 68 min: Williams bombs down the inside-left channel, a maverick run that nearly opens City up. Nearly, but not quite. 66 min: Mahrez sends Walker into acres down the right, Williams way out of position. Walker\u2019s cross hits Jones on the hand, but from the sort of range that\u2019s never leading to a penalty kick. 64 min: Rashford looks for the top-right corner of the goal. He finds the top-right corner of the Stretford End. Then United make their second change, replacing James with Angel Gomes. 63 min: Rodri is booked for a cynical clip on Pereira, who is skedaddling down the inside-right channel after a clever Lindelof pass. A free kick in Rashford Country. 61 min: Sterling breaks upfield as United throw men forward. He slips the ball left for Silva, who knocks it back infield for De Bruyne. De Bruyne takes a shot. It\u2019s deflected off Matic, and breaks to Sterling, who is clear, only to fall over. He wants a penalty, but he\u2019s not getting one. United living dangerously. Like that\u2019s breaking news. 59 min: Mahrez briefly has an opportunity to slip Sterling clean through on goal, but fails to spot the run in time. United go up the other end, James chasing a long ball down the right. Bravo claims easily. James takes the opportunity to go shoulder to shoulder with Otamendi, barging his man over again. This developing battle\u2019s worth keeping an eye on. 57 min: United spend a little bit of time in City\u2019s final third. City are happy to sit back, leaving no gaps. United can\u2019t work out a way through. James eventually clatters Otamendi, knee to knee. It\u2019s no more than a foul, though VAR sticks its neb in, looking for trouble that isn\u2019t there. 55 min: Mahrez tries to keep a loose ball in play down the right. Williams comes sliding in at 100mph. He\u2019s fortunate not to make contact with Mahrez, because that was reckless. Mahrez does him a favour by leaping out of the way and giving up the goal kick. Williams has looked impressive on the front foot; he\u2019s been a bit shaky in defence. 54 min: Williams clanks a clearance straight into Walker, who immediately feeds Mahrez down the right. Williams does well to get back and limit the damage to a corner. Mahrez takes. United half clear. Mendy loops the ball back to Mahrez, who chests down, facing a very tight angle on the right. His low shot clatters the post and goes out for a goal kick. Had it been on target, De Gea had it well covered. 52 min: Fred is booked for an obvious clip on Bernardo Silva\u2019s heel. He gives referee Mike Dean what for. He\u2019d do well to keep his counsel. The last thing United need is to go down to ten men. 51 min: Greenwood and James combine neatly down the inside-right channel, but just as the move begins to look promising, James runs the ball out for a goal kick. 50 min: De Bruyne dances down the left and pulls one back through a thicket for Sterling, who can\u2019t sort his feet out on the edge of the box. For a split second, Old Trafford held its breath. The pensive sucking of teeth was also audible. 49 min: All a bit scrappy since the restart. A few defiant chants from the home faithful. Nothing much else to report. United will appreciate the respite. 47 min: Pereira slips a decent ball down the left for Rashford, who checks back and finds Fred. A few rat-a-tat passes on the edge of the box, and finally Williams sends a pea-roller towards the bottom left. Bravo gathers. United get the second half underway. They\u2019ll be looking to reboot just like Arsenal did last night in the FA Cup after being outplayed in the first 45 by Leeds. Problem is, of course, as good as Leeds are, they\u2019re no Manchester City ... and Arsenal weren\u2019t three goals down. Still, United need something, anything. Reaching this year\u2019s League Cup final already looks to be a pipe dream, but they\u2019ll be desperate for some sort of response. Or at least to not totally capitulate. To this end, Matic has been sent on for Lingard. Half-time entertainment. City have been as breathtaking as United have been shocking. A few boos from the home crowd, but only a smattering. Nothing that sounds as though a revolt is on the cards. \u201cOf all the players on the field, Sterling is the only one with any desire to make the scoreline look remotely respectable for United.\u201d Naveen RS, a United supporter, with the gallows humour there. 45 min: There will be one added minute. The next 60 seconds can\u2019t go by quickly enough for Manchester United. 44 min: Pereira has a dig from 25 yards. United need something, anything. But not this. The ball flies harmlessly over the bar, miles off target. 43 min: For the second time, it\u2019s nearly four, as De Bruyne whips a low ball across the face of goal from the right. Sterling will curse clipping his toenails last night, because he was a couple of millimetres away from poking home at the far post. 42 min: It\u2019s important to remember that City have been quite outstanding since the get-go. Few teams could live with their relentless attacking. But of course the normal rules of analysis never apply in derby matches. 40 min: This is already embarrassing for United. It could get a whole lot worse. City win a corner out on the right. The ball\u2019s worked all the way to Bernardo Silva on the left. He breaks clean through down the channel, and he\u2019s one on one with De Gea. The keeper makes a sensational save, and it turns out Silva was offside anyway. United are in danger of totally capitulating. Another City break. Silva slips Mahrez away down the middle. Mahrez brushes past Williams with ease and slips the ball wide left to De Bruyne, who sits Jones down as he enters the area. De Bruyne looks to curl one into the bottom left. De Gea saves, only for the ball to pinball off Pereira six yards out and into the unguarded net. 36 min: United nearly find some succour as Fred plays a fizzing pass down the inside-left channel for Lingard, who cushions the ball towards Greenwood. The young striker drags a shot well wide right. But that\u2019s given a worried Old Trafford a little something to go on. 35 min: A frustrated Lingard is shown the yellow card, sticking his studs up while chasing a heavy touch and catching Fernandinho. United need to clear their heads and quick, or this semi-final will get away from them very soon. Another simple goal, perfectly executed. Bravo clears. Bernardo Silva picks up possession in the centre circle, and slips a pass down the middle. Mahrez is clear! He rounds De Gea on the right, and rolls home. As easy as that. City might not be perfect at the back, but they\u2019re damn well near it up front. 32 min: United win a corner out on the right. Fred\u2019s delivery is not great, but only half cleared, allowing Pereira to swing one in from the same flank. The cross causes momentary panic in the City defence, but unfortunately for United, there\u2019s nobody in red in a central position to latch onto the ball and poke home. A reminder that City are not infallible. 30 min: Bravo, quarterbacking from the goalkeeping position, sprays a lovely pass wide left for Sterling, who finds himself one on one with Wan-Bissaka. It looks very promising for City, until Sterling executes one shimmy too many and falls over, kicking the ball out for a goal kick. United fans take the rare opportunity to cheer. 28 min: Since the goal, City have enjoyed 70% possession. United are having to work at full pelt to plug all the gaps and keep City at arm\u2019s length. 26 min: Williams is a prospect, and he drops a shoulder out on the left to make himself a lot of space, then slips James away further upfield. James knocks it inside to Lingard, who can\u2019t decide whether to shoot or return the ball to James. The ball clanks through to Bravo. Some very nice play from deep by Williams, though. 24 min: Walker drives down the inside right at full speed. A crisp one-two with De Bruyne sends him free into the box. It\u2019s another simple but glorious City move. Walker picks out Sterling on the penalty spot. Sterling shoots, but is denied by a combination of Wan-Bissaka and Lindelof. Blocked. Cleared. But that was so close to 0-2. 22 min: City continue to ping it about. United are struggling to retain any significant possession at the moment. 20 min: There\u2019s been a wonderful atmosphere since kick-off, though that goal has dampened the majority\u2019s spirits a little. The knowledge that City have won six of their last nine at Old Trafford may also be a factor. City fans in full voice. 18 min: United try to respond immediately, Pereira nearly sending James clear down the middle with a sliderule pass. But Bravo has been attentive, and he\u2019s out quickly from his area to clear. This is so simple, but so, so good. De Bruyne advances down the inside-right channel. He slips the ball inside for Bernardo Silva, who takes a touch to ghost past Fred, and launches an unstoppable curler into the top left. De Gea, at full stretch, had no chance whatsoever. First blood to City! 15 min: City hog the ball some more. They\u2019ve had 57% possession so far. United will presumably be happy enough too, coiled to spring on the break as they are. 13 min: City take the pace down a notch by stroking it around the back for a while. The slowly advance forward. Mahrez has a gander down the right; Sterling probes down the left. And then back to Mahrez again. The treble-winners are beginning to establish a little control; it\u2019s the first period of sustained possession by either side in the game so far. 11 min: A long ball down the middle. Rashford cushions a header into Greenwood\u2019s path; the young striker wins a corner off Fernandinho, who was taking great care not to concede a penalty kick. The resulting corner comes to nothing. This has been great end-to-end fun so far. Mind you, Wolves-United at the weekend was pretty good for the first 15 minutes, and look what happened there, so let\u2019s not get too carried away yet. 9 min: Mahrez sashays in from the right. He rolls the ball inside for Sterling, coming in from the other flank. Sterling momentarily has a chance to curl one into the top right, Curtis Jones style, but he\u2019s quickly crowded out by a swarm of red shirts. The chance, split-second as it was, is gone. 8 min: United put their first meaningful attack together. Greenwood plays Rashford in down the right. Rashford takes one silky touch to glide past Otamendi with ease, but can\u2019t find Lingard in the middle with his pullback from the halfway line. 7 min: ... Lindelof heads Gundogan\u2019s near-post delivery powerfully clear. \u201cI see that both teams are wearing white shorts,\u201d notes Stephen Carr. \u201cThis could well cause VAR to malfunction whilst making tight offside calls and ultimately lead to the collapse of modern civilisation.\u201d Oh that\u2019s already jiggered. To be fair to VAR, association football\u2019s going to be one of the last pieces to fall. 6 min: Sterling works his way down the left and wins the first corner of the evening. From which ... 4 min: James scampers down the right into an awful lot of space, and very nearly finds Greenwood in the middle with a fiercely whipped cross. Otamendi is positioned well to intercept and clear. The brisk pace of this match continues. 2 min: Well it didn\u2019t take Phil Jones long to start sliding across the turf on his nipples. He nearly gifts possession to De Bruyne down the right in doing so, but he does just enough to usher the ball away from danger as he falls. You wouldn\u2019t have him any other way. 1 min: Fernandinho, deep on the right, pearls a delightful crossfield ball towards Sterling, who briefly threatens to get away down the left. He can\u2019t find a route through, so City settle for stroking it around the back instead. United are pressing hard; it\u2019s a fast-paced start by both teams. The first leg of the semi-final is go! City get the ball rolling; they\u2019re kicking towards the Stretford End in this first half. Here come the teams! United in red, City in blue. This is the one, warble the Stone Roses, though Ian, John, Reni and Mani\u2019s retro jangle is nearly drowned out by the special Mancunian-derby roar that greets the players. Handshakes and coin-tossing going on all over the shop. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! Why has Pep left Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus on the bench? \u201cI decide for this team,\u201d he tells Sky Sports. Was it anything to do with the last game against United? \u201cNo.\u201d Will it be a different game? \u201cWe will try to make a lot of passes.\u201d Does it suit that the first leg is away? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Giving the square root of nothing away there, just the right side of disdain. His old mentor Louis van Gaal would be proud. Some late, breaking team news. Manchester City have two big names positioned in the away end tonight: Oleksandr Zinchenko and Taylor Harwood-Bellis, the latter, by the looks of it, popping into the little room to do some falling water. Solskjaer speaks! \u201cIf we create as many chances as we did last month, I\u2019ll be happy! But of course we\u2019re playing against a good team so you can\u2019t expect to create that many. We were excellent that night, hopefully we can see that tonight. We\u2019re a young team with lots of energy, so hopefully we\u2019ll see something similar. Every game is big for Manchester United, so we are going to go out there and enjoy it, give our best, and see where it takes us.\u201d Look at the quality of the embroidery on this corner flag! That\u2019s some top-notch stitching. You could forgive Manchester United for whacking a cheap transfer onto an old sheet and making do; it\u2019s going to be soaked by the end of the 90 after all, as players repeatedly wipe their muddy paws on it. But no, they\u2019ve refused to cut corners, almost literally, marking them out as the sort who always use the best linen and uncork the good wine when folk come round for dinner. Say what you like about Old Trafford; it may have seen better days, there may be water coming through the roof, but the old pile will always have that indefinable class. No out-and-out striker for Manchester City there, you will have noticed. Cue much speculation over the possible jiggery-pokery Pep has cooked up in response to the recent derby defeat at the Etihad, where United ripped the champions to shreds for the first 30 minutes or so, a period of extreme dominance that proved more than enough for a shock win. In other news, United defender Harry Maguire has been ruled out with a foot injury. Both managers have made plenty of changes to the sides sent out for FA Cup battle last weekend. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer makes six from the side that drew at Wolves: David de Gea, Phil Jones, Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard, Fred and Aaron-Wan Bissaka take the places of Sergio Romero, Harry Maguire, Ashley Young, Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic and Tahith Chong. Pep Guardiola makes eight changes to the team that beat Port Vale. The only survivors from that starting XI are Claudio Bravo, Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva. In come Kyle Walker, Raheem Sterling, Rodri, Kevin De Bruyne, Nicolas Otamendi, Riyad Mahrez, Benjamin Mendy and Fernandinho. Manchester United: De Gea, Wan-Bissaka, Jones, Lindelof, Williams, Fred, Pereira, James, Lingard, Rashford, Greenwood. Subs: Romero, Dalot, Matic, Chong, Gomes, Mata, Martial. Manchester City: Bravo, Walker, Otamendi, Fernandinho, Mendy, Rodrigo, Gundogan, Mahrez, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Sterling. Subs: Ederson, Jesus, Aguero, Silva, Cancelo, Foden, Garcia. The League Cup semi-finals; a Manchester derby. We\u2019ve been here twice before. In December 1969, City welcomed United to Maine Road for the first leg. Colin Bell gave the hosts an early lead, Bobby Charlton drove home an equaliser midway through the second half, then with two minutes to go, Ian Ure brought down Franny Lee, who belted home a penalty to give City the halfway advantage. Outside, 14 house windows, and one shop window, were broken, leading to the arrest of seven juveniles and three adults for disorderly behaviour. Here come the seventies! In the second leg at Old Trafford, City extended their aggregate lead when Lee, Mike Summerbee and Neil Young combined to set up Ian Bowyer on 17 minutes. Six minutes later, United halved the arrears, Paddy Crerard teeing up Paul Edwards. On the hour, George Best\u2019s shot was parried by Joe Corrigan into the path of Denis Law, with predictable results. Extra time loomed, but with eight minutes remaining, Alex Stepney failed to deal with Lee\u2019s speculative free kick and Summerbee sent City to Wembley, where they would beat West Bromwich Albion the following March. The boot was on the other foot in 2010. It\u2019s the Carlos Tevez tie! Manchester City were looking to reach a major Wembley final for the first time in 29 years. Tevez, who had crossed the divide the previous summer, scored twice in the first leg at the Etihad, wiping out Ryan Giggs\u2019 early opener for a 2-1 victory. Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick put United 3-2 up on aggregate in the second half of the second leg at Old Trafford, but when Tevez scored with an outrageous mid-air backflick, extra time looked on the cards. Then Wayne Rooney popped up with a header deep into injury time, and City would have to wait another year to end their long wait for a trophy. United beat Aston Villa in the final. Plenty of water has passed under the bridge since, of course. And here we all are. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018There was nothing special about us,\u201d says Tim Carter. \u201cThere was nothing unspecial about us.\u201d Carter is a survivor of the 1978 Jonestown massacre. He appears with a handful of others in Shan Nicholson\u2019s two-part Storyville documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000d27r\">Jonestown: Terror in the Jungle</a> (BBC4). It was first shown in the US two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/an-apocalyptic-cult-900-dead-remembering-the-jonestown-massacre-40-years-on\">on the 40th anniversary of the deaths of more than 900 people in the Peoples Temple in Guyana</a>, headed by the Rev Jim Jones, who ingested potassium cyanide in an act of what he called \u201crevolutionary suicide\u201d. Until 9/11, it was the largest single loss of American life by deliberate act.</p> <p>Whether you call it mass suicide, suicide-murder or simply mass murder probably depends on how much you already know. Outside the US, many of us only know of it through the phrase \u201cdrinking the Kool-Aid\u201d (the cyanide was delivered in soft drinks, actually Flavor Aid) as a synonym for being brainwashed or believing in something bizarre. It conjures a common conception of those who died as a homogenous group of gullible fools.</p> <p>Carter, who lost his wife and son in the compound\u2019s pavilion, objects deeply to the way the massacre has been simplified and reduced. Nicholson\u2019s film should bring some comfort: its grave and careful tracing of how Jones and his followers came to be where they were and do what they did restores much of what has been lost in cultural translation. Although we open with some of the extraordinary, horrific footage from the moment of discovery in the Jonestown compound, the film\u2019s focus quickly shifts to and largely stays on the history of the Peoples Temple, its followers\u2019 motivations and their leader\u2019s gradual transformation from charismatic preacher to crazed despot.</p> <p>Jones founded what would become known as the Peoples Temple in 1955, when he was just 25. It was the first desegregated church in Indiana. His pro-integrationist and civil rights stance surely helped attract black followers and white idealists to his cause in greater numbers than perhaps anything else, though the film doesn\u2019t make much of this point, nor interrogate too closely how genuine or calculated a position it was by Jones. His later claims to socialism are treated with more scepticism. Perhaps this is overthinking things, but the lack of examination of his racial progressivism feels strange in such an otherwise detailed portrait of events. You wonder if it\u2019s because Good Man Gone Bad makes for a better narrative than On the Make From the Beginning and Just Got Worse.</p> <p>But perhaps Jones and his origins are slightly glossed over simply because there is so much to be heard from the survivors \u2013 including two of Jones\u2019s sons, Jim and Stephan \u2013 who, 40 years on, are only just at peace with their experiences. Their testimonies are spare, direct and all the more harrowing for that. Carter was seeking solace after the horrors of Vietnam, others were fleeing unhappy childhoods and other traumas. Some simply believed in Jones\u2019s promise of a better world. They talk about how intensely persuasive he was, and their accounts are interspersed with the plentiful audio footage that exists from all stages of the evolution of the Temple and its leader. It leaves you free to ponder how what sounded like sanctuary to many sounds only like aggression and a kind of terrifying certainty now. Is that the benefit of hindsight alone? Or proof that you hear what you need to hear?</p> <p>These up-close-and-personal descriptions of life under a power-hungry, drug-addicted narcissistic leader exerting increasingly brutal physical and mental control over his followers are given context by Jeff Guinn, on whose book, The Road to Jonestown, the film is based. Nothing is sensationalised, but the details quietly and relentlessly build into an ever more dreadful threat. By the day of the massacre, which began with the murder of Senator Leo Ryan who had flown out to investigate Jonestown after former members went public with their concerns that people were effectively being held against their will, it feels like an organic, inevitable ending. Not the demise of fools, but of frightened people, coerced and controlled for years, surrounded by armed guards instructed to shoot them if they fled, drinking Flavor Aid or forcibly injected with it if they refused. It was a film about ordinary people\u2019s capacity for faith, for hope, for denial and for exploitation by those with an extraordinary capacity for harm. Would that we were in a position to take no lesson from it at all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018There was nothing special about us,\u201d says Tim Carter. \u201cThere was nothing unspecial about us.\u201d Carter is a survivor of the 1978 Jonestown massacre. He appears with a handful of others in Shan Nicholson\u2019s two-part Storyville documentary Jonestown: Terror in the Jungle (BBC4). It was first shown in the US two years ago, on the 40th anniversary of the deaths of more than 900 people in the Peoples Temple in Guyana, headed by the Rev Jim Jones, who ingested potassium cyanide in an act of what he called \u201crevolutionary suicide\u201d. Until 9/11, it was the largest single loss of American life by deliberate act. Whether you call it mass suicide, suicide-murder or simply mass murder probably depends on how much you already know. Outside the US, many of us only know of it through the phrase \u201cdrinking the Kool-Aid\u201d (the cyanide was delivered in soft drinks, actually Flavor Aid) as a synonym for being brainwashed or believing in something bizarre. It conjures a common conception of those who died as a homogenous group of gullible fools. Carter, who lost his wife and son in the compound\u2019s pavilion, objects deeply to the way the massacre has been simplified and reduced. Nicholson\u2019s film should bring some comfort: its grave and careful tracing of how Jones and his followers came to be where they were and do what they did restores much of what has been lost in cultural translation. Although we open with some of the extraordinary, horrific footage from the moment of discovery in the Jonestown compound, the film\u2019s focus quickly shifts to and largely stays on the history of the Peoples Temple, its followers\u2019 motivations and their leader\u2019s gradual transformation from charismatic preacher to crazed despot. Jones founded what would become known as the Peoples Temple in 1955, when he was just 25. It was the first desegregated church in Indiana. His pro-integrationist and civil rights stance surely helped attract black followers and white idealists to his cause in greater numbers than perhaps anything else, though the film doesn\u2019t make much of this point, nor interrogate too closely how genuine or calculated a position it was by Jones. His later claims to socialism are treated with more scepticism. Perhaps this is overthinking things, but the lack of examination of his racial progressivism feels strange in such an otherwise detailed portrait of events. You wonder if it\u2019s because Good Man Gone Bad makes for a better narrative than On the Make From the Beginning and Just Got Worse. But perhaps Jones and his origins are slightly glossed over simply because there is so much to be heard from the survivors \u2013 including two of Jones\u2019s sons, Jim and Stephan \u2013 who, 40 years on, are only just at peace with their experiences. Their testimonies are spare, direct and all the more harrowing for that. Carter was seeking solace after the horrors of Vietnam, others were fleeing unhappy childhoods and other traumas. Some simply believed in Jones\u2019s promise of a better world. They talk about how intensely persuasive he was, and their accounts are interspersed with the plentiful audio footage that exists from all stages of the evolution of the Temple and its leader. It leaves you free to ponder how what sounded like sanctuary to many sounds only like aggression and a kind of terrifying certainty now. Is that the benefit of hindsight alone? Or proof that you hear what you need to hear? These up-close-and-personal descriptions of life under a power-hungry, drug-addicted narcissistic leader exerting increasingly brutal physical and mental control over his followers are given context by Jeff Guinn, on whose book, The Road to Jonestown, the film is based. Nothing is sensationalised, but the details quietly and relentlessly build into an ever more dreadful threat. By the day of the massacre, which began with the murder of Senator Leo Ryan who had flown out to investigate Jonestown after former members went public with their concerns that people were effectively being held against their will, it feels like an organic, inevitable ending. Not the demise of fools, but of frightened people, coerced and controlled for years, surrounded by armed guards instructed to shoot them if they fled, drinking Flavor Aid or forcibly injected with it if they refused. It was a film about ordinary people\u2019s capacity for faith, for hope, for denial and for exploitation by those with an extraordinary capacity for harm. Would that we were in a position to take no lesson from it at all.",

After the visitors at last took hold of the ball, Kevin De Bruyne rolled it to Kyle Walker. He roved forward and fed the Portuguese who fired a 25-yard finish into David de Gea\u2019s top-right corner that gave the goalkeeper no chance. City\u2019s supporters were jubilant and United were stunned. It allowed Guardiola\u2019s team to relax with Silva chief tormentor. Guardiola was unhappy with Otamendi\u2019s and Benjamin Mendy\u2019s reluctance to play quick balls along the latter\u2019s left flank but he was about to be delighted with the second goal. It began with a loose Victor Lindel\u00f6f header that went straight to Silva. He punished his opponents with a pinpoint pass into Riyad Mahrez, who slipped in behind the defence, skated round De Gea, and slid the ball into the unguarded net. City\u2019s third had a hint of farce about it. Silva \u2013 again \u2013 unlocked the door, hitting a pass from halfway into the path of Mahrez. He found De Bruyne and, when Brandon Williams intervened, the young left-back ended in a heap on the turf. Solskj\u00e6r believed a foul was committed but the Belgian was allowed to continue forward. His shot was saved by De Gea only for the ball to ricochet off Pereira and in. United had to reach the break \u201conly\u201d 3-0 down as this was threatening to be a humiliation. City were rampant: Sterling fluffed a chance to add another \u2013 one of a few spurned openings \u2013 and when Mike Dean blew for half-time his whistle was accompanied by boos from the home support. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s response was to take off Lingard \u2013 who was feeling the effect of a recent virus \u2013 for Nemanja Matic to try and even up the midfield numbers in the second half. The sense though, was that United would surely secretly have been happy with the match ending 3-0. They were still something close to shell-shocked, a condition Guardiola was intent his team should exploit further. The manager was unhappy whenever they did not look forward, as when Walker and Mahrez engaged in keep-ball near him. Each time City attacked they looked menacing, so Guardiola\u2019s stance was understandable. Mahrez had taken over from Silva as City\u2019s conductor-in-chief and his dazzling feet first won a corner, then had him driving a shot at De Gea. To United\u2019s credit they continued playing. Williams is only 19 but his willingness to dribble forward and ignite a move as the hour mark neared was admirable. This did not mask the underlying issue, though: City were in cruise control and could again expose United at any moment. After Rashford blasted a free-kick over, Solskj\u00e6r took James off for Angel Gomes but hoping a 19-year-old would help salvage something was optimistic. It was Rashford who did so. De Bruyne found Rodri but he was pickpocketed by Greenwood. The forward passed to the No 10 and after he slid beyond Claudio Bravo the tie was suddenly alive again. It was barely credible yet near the end Bravo had to save another Rashford effort and United, remarkably, had been the better since the break.",

I thought it was a brilliant performance throughout the five days. We had to work extremely hard there. Credit to South Africa, they made it hard for us but the guys stood up and put in a real team effort. It always felt like we were in the gamre and if we trusted it for long enough things would fall in our favour. [Stokes] makes things happen, he\u2019s a golden nugget in our side. It\u2019s not happened by accident, he works bloody hard. It\u2019s a great example to the guys who are coming into this side and seeing what Test cricket\u2019s like, and how different it is to county cricket. They\u2019re having to learn on their feet, and they\u2019re standing up as well. This week has really pleased me and made me really proud of a young set of lads.</p> <p>I thought I did a couple of other things pretty well this week. You\u2019re always only as good as your players and we had a really strong message about how we wanted to perform and we stuck to that and really drove that really well. There\u2019s things we tinkered with throughout, especially in the field, that fell into place really nicely. For long periods of time we were excellent, we built pressure and we followed it through. It\u2019s a good marker going into the rest of this series and future tours as well.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e14a6d58f08c39722646616\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T15:46:10.948Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The man of the match</strong> is ...

He\u2019s trying to run away as fast as he can. I think credit\u2019s got to go to everyone who\u2019s played this week. Sam Curran, Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope and Dom have shown how good they are. The future looks great for us and hopefully this is a stepping stone. When you have series and the first two games are results, it makes things very interesting, and <strong>it\u2019s why five-day cricket should always be around. It\u2019s the best format of the game </strong>and it makes cricket ... you know, games like these are just unforgettable.

A brilliant performance by the whole group of players. Showed a great amount of character, patience and a lot of belief as well today. Credit to South Africa, they threw a lot back at us, but the guys really stuck to it, put in a brilliant performance. A brilliant way to start the year. For a young group of players to be involved in a Test match like that is a great opportunity for us to move forward. We found ourselves at times under a lot of pressure but some individuals really stood up and put in some brilliant performances that got momentum back in our favour. The way Jimmy bowled in that first innings was outstanding, and then you\u2019ve got guys like Ben Stokes who can just change the game for you. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e14a4f28f085eda5c113bc5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T15:38:03.804Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Time for the post-match presentations,</strong> with Faf du Plessis the first to be called up:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What an advertisement for Test cricket. Obviously sad that we\u2019re on the losing side but all I\u2019m asking for is that we fought and fought very hard, and we did that. Over five days, there has to be a winner and credit to England for just a little bit more in the tank than we have. It was a great Test match. Obviously a good variety in the wicket as well: day one and two probably bonus wickets, and then towards the end it got a bit flatter to bat on. But big series like this you want two teams to bash it out for five days. The next Test will be very exciting.</p> <p>What pleases me is the fact we\u2019ve found someone who\u2019s really good at the top of the order in Pieter Malan. Technically extrmeely sound, knows his game well, and those are the things you\u2019re nervous about when there\u2019s a bit of transition, how are the new players going to do when they come in? He\u2019s stepped in and obviously played one of the great innings. We\u2019ve shown we\u2019ve got another opener who can play Test cricket for us. From a batting point of view not where we want to be yet, but today was a great step in the right direction. Most teams would come when the chips are down and probably fall after lunch or fade away. For me it\u2019s a huge step for us as a young batting unit, showing a lot of character and fight. Today we lost with the right character, and I\u2019m proud of that.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e14a3798f08c397226465e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T15:29:55.008Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>England\u2019s Barmy Army</strong> has been extremely loud all day, and their support was possibly decisive in keeping the side motivated during the longueurs of the afternoon as De Kock and Van der Dussen settled in.

The OBO is the usual lifeline, but it\u2019s bad enough sitting here at my desk without the pang I feel, wishing I was at Newlands. I\u2019ve been wondering why Jos Buttler has been so underwhelming in Tests for so long. It can\u2019t be temperament, as he has smarts and captaincy material written all over him, so is it technique, or the role he\u2019s expected to play in the team? Other quick-fire destructive batsmen (Stokes, obviously, and Quinton de Kock for SA who, ahem, ahem, went to my old school) regularly get fifties or go on to hundreds, while Buttler makes a fast 20 and then holes out. I know you\u2019ve interviewed him so would be keen to hear your take.\u201d </p> <p>Well, I interviewed him a year ago when he was about to become one of Wisden\u2019s Five Cricketers of the Year, so I didn\u2019t ask about underperforming \u2013 he\u2019d just had his best year in Tests. Things have only gone awry since the World Cup, which seemed to leave him with a hangover: in the Ashes, he was poor for three Tests, better in the last two. My feeling is that he hasn\u2019t been helped by changes of role \u2013 batsman then keeper again, vice-captain then demoted, wrongly, when Stokes asked for the job back. But perhaps he tried too hard to rein himself in when he was being picked as a No.5. He should be de Kocking it all over the park \u2013 and did, briefly, in his last innings, when he played for the team rather than his average. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1453418f087e8308e69ec8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T09:47:38.043Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>72nd over: South Africa 153-3 (Malan 72, du Plessis 15) </strong>Stokes hits his straps, digging it in to get Faf fending over the slips, then pitching it up and beating him outside off.

As in any good drama, things are bubbling up as the final act approaches. England need eight more wickets to level the series, which makes them favourites but not a sure thing. South Africa need 312 runs, which is the longest of long shots, but not unthinkable. Failing that, the South Africans have to bat out the day \u2013 though if they get a sniff of a draw, the chance of a win will be there to tempt them into an indiscretion or two. With England relying on two elderly seamers and a rookie spinner, and South Africa leaning rather too heavily on a debutant opener, it\u2019s all deliciously intriguing. And let\u2019s not forget that if some people get their way, days like this will soon be a distant memory.</p> <p>England were given a late boost by Jimmy Anderson, looking himself again and taking his sixth wicket of the match, to see off Zubayr Hamza. But that was only England\u2019s second wicket in 56 overs. Today they need to nab one every 11 overs, which means being more than twice as incisive when their attack is missing both its high pace (Jofra Archer, Mark Wood) and its battle-hardened spin (Moeen Ali). Joe Root has to stop Pieter Malan going the whole Dom Sibley, while also making sure that neither Faf du Plessis nor Quinton de Kock hits a hundred \u2013 a feat that, in a plot twist nobody saw coming, only Sibley has managed in this series.</p> <p>South Africa\u2019s problem is that, for them to win, almost everything has to go right. The pitch seems to be on their side, but Test history is not. Then again, no visiting team has won a Test here since readmission, unless it\u2019s been wearing baggy green caps. And the target Root ended up setting them \u2013 438 \u2013 is the very same total they once rattled up to win a match <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/14676/scorecard/238200/south-africa-vs-australia-5th-odi-australia-tour-of-south-africa-2005-06\">in half a day</a>. Can they do it? Probably not, but let\u2019s entertain the possibility. See you at 10.30am local time, which is 8.30am in the UK.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "A great day for Stokes. Joe Root is a Stokes fan. Barney Ronay on five-day Tests and why they need to stay. And with that, I\u2019m done. It\u2019s been a fantastic day of Test cricket, up there with the best. Cheers for dropping in. Here\u2019s our report: And here\u2019s Joe Root on four-day Tests: Some people might think there\u2019s a place for it but you don\u2019t want to miss out on days like today. You don\u2019t want to miss out on games like this. I mean, this is what makes Test cricket what it is. Going right down to the wire. Nearly a full house at Newlands. And what a great finish to a brilliant game of cricket. Here\u2019s Joe Root, who is happy with the team - \u201cthe guys stood up and put in a real team effort\u201d - and with himself - \u201cI thought I did a couple of things pretty well this week\u201d: It feels fantastic. I thought it was a brilliant performance throughout the five days. We had to work extremely hard there. Credit to South Africa, they made it hard for us but the guys stood up and put in a real team effort. It always felt like we were in the gamre and if we trusted it for long enough things would fall in our favour. [Stokes] makes things happen, he\u2019s a golden nugget in our side. It\u2019s not happened by accident, he works bloody hard. It\u2019s a great example to the guys who are coming into this side and seeing what Test cricket\u2019s like, and how different it is to county cricket. They\u2019re having to learn on their feet, and they\u2019re standing up as well. This week has really pleased me and made me really proud of a young set of lads. I thought I did a couple of other things pretty well this week. You\u2019re always only as good as your players and we had a really strong message about how we wanted to perform and we stuck to that and really drove that really well. There\u2019s things we tinkered with throughout, especially in the field, that fell into place really nicely. For long periods of time we were excellent, we built pressure and we followed it through. It\u2019s a good marker going into the rest of this series and future tours as well. The man of the match is ... Ben Stokes, who tries to bring Dom Sibley up with him: I thought Dom put all the hard yards in to get us into a position of winning, so he should be the one up here. He\u2019s trying to run away as fast as he can. I think credit\u2019s got to go to everyone who\u2019s played this week. Sam Curran, Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope and Dom have shown how good they are. The future looks great for us and hopefully this is a stepping stone. When you have series and the first two games are results, it makes things very interesting, and it\u2019s why five-day cricket should always be around. It\u2019s the best format of the game and it makes cricket ... you know, games like these are just unforgettable. We\u2019ll remember this for a long time and I\u2019m sure South Africa will. It\u2019ll go down as one of the greats. Joe Root, who has had one of his best days as captain today, has a chat: It was fantastic. A brilliant performance by the whole group of players. Showed a great amount of character, patience and a lot of belief as well today. Credit to South Africa, they threw a lot back at us, but the guys really stuck to it, put in a brilliant performance. A brilliant way to start the year. For a young group of players to be involved in a Test match like that is a great opportunity for us to move forward. We found ourselves at times under a lot of pressure but some individuals really stood up and put in some brilliant performances that got momentum back in our favour. The way Jimmy bowled in that first innings was outstanding, and then you\u2019ve got guys like Ben Stokes who can just change the game for you. Time for the post-match presentations, with Faf du Plessis the first to be called up: What an advertisement for Test cricket. Obviously sad that we\u2019re on the losing side but all I\u2019m asking for is that we fought and fought very hard, and we did that. Over five days, there has to be a winner and credit to England for just a little bit more in the tank than we have. It was a great Test match. Obviously a good variety in the wicket as well: day one and two probably bonus wickets, and then towards the end it got a bit flatter to bat on. But big series like this you want two teams to bash it out for five days. The next Test will be very exciting. What pleases me is the fact we\u2019ve found someone who\u2019s really good at the top of the order in Pieter Malan. Technically extrmeely sound, knows his game well, and those are the things you\u2019re nervous about when there\u2019s a bit of transition, how are the new players going to do when they come in? He\u2019s stepped in and obviously played one of the great innings. We\u2019ve shown we\u2019ve got another opener who can play Test cricket for us. From a batting point of view not where we want to be yet, but today was a great step in the right direction. Most teams would come when the chips are down and probably fall after lunch or fade away. For me it\u2019s a huge step for us as a young batting unit, showing a lot of character and fight. Today we lost with the right character, and I\u2019m proud of that. England\u2019s Barmy Army has been extremely loud all day, and their support was possibly decisive in keeping the side motivated during the longueurs of the afternoon as De Kock and Van der Dussen settled in. The team is back out now, thanking them for their support. Ben Stokes has picked up a few more fans today: Here\u2019s Abhijato Sensarma: \u201cSome genius is measured on paper, while some genius is measured in emotions. Ben Stokes is a man of moments, not numbers. His affinity for big moments makes him a big man. How lucky are we to live in the same generation as this man?\u201d And Robert Ellson: \u201cIt\u2019s rough on Sibley, but I reckon Stokes is the man of the match. Brilliant catches, and a sensational innings yesterday to give England the time they needed to win the game. Then a heroic spell at the end. What a man.\u201d Here\u2019s a quick report on England\u2019s victory: Vernon Philander does a lap of honour after his final Test appearance at Newlands. Meanwhile, Quinton de Kock talks: I think the boys fought very hard. The English made it very difficult for us at times and they kept fighting. Credit to them. Obviously we tried to push them as far as we can. We knew today was going to be hot and sunny and the bowlers were going to be spending a lot of time on their feet, so we tried to push them as hard as we can. Unfortunately we just fell a little bit short. [His dismissal] It was quite disappointing. Me and [Van der Dussen] I felt we had a good partnership going. We were hoping we could keep going and break the England team, but unfortunately I ended up smoking it straight to the fielder. Zak Crawley, who contributed a couple of cracking catches to the England effort, says the two-stage effort to dismiss Nortje was \u201ca bit lucky\u201d and concludes: \u201cThis was unbelievable. Best game of cricket I\u2019ve ever played in.\u201d Stuart Broad has a chat: Yeah, very special. The crowd has been exceptional today. It\u2019s been an incredible day\u2019s play and a great Test match actually. We had to work incredibly hard. I think we knew we were going to have to do that from yesterday\u2019s play. Incredible discipline from South Africa throughout the day, but we kept saying, one bit of magic ... We tried some funky fields. One breakthrough and we could apply some pressure, and fortunately we got that. Of the Van der Dussen dismissal, when Anderson took the catch moments after being moved to leg slip, he says: To be honest, I put a leg slip in try try to get him to stay leg side, to try and bring the edge into play, and then missed my line by about three foot and it ended up getting guided to leg slip. You need a bit of luck chasing 10 wickets, then you need a hell of a lot of character and skill. For the record: Philander c Pope b Stokes 8 (South Africa 248 all out) And also, stick that in your four-day Test pipe and smoke it, or whatever. Sky lose the feed, they cut to a still of a distant cricket ground and make their apologies ... and then they cut back to the action, Stokes bangs one in, and Philander fences straight to gully! 137th over: South Africa 245-9 (Philander 4, Rabada 1) Bess bowls at Rabada, with seven fielders clustered round the bat, but doesn\u2019t really find the length required to bring them into play. Nine overs to go 136th over: South Africa 245-9 (Philander 4, Rabada 1) Stokes has three shots at Rabada and three at Philander, without reproducing the magic of his previous over. Bess now will get a go at the new man. 10 overs to go 135th over: South Africa 245-9 (Philander 4, Rabada 0) Bess bowls to Philander, whose decision to turn down an easy run at the end of the 133rd over didn\u2019t turn out so well. Five dots and a boundary off the last mean that Stokes will have a bowl at Rabada next. 11 overs to go 134th over: South Africa 241-9 (Philander 4, Rabada 0) The last hour or so has been just phenomenal sport. The absolute pinnacle. Am I alone in being a tad disappointed that Stokes\u2019 two wickets here - his first of the match, bizarrely - look likely to end it a little earlier than necessary? 12 overs to go He\u2019s gone first ball! Another edge, and the slip cordon - five of them! - is so close that it\u2019s almost past Crawley when he sticks out a right hand to deflect the ball up and into the air with his right, and then catch it with his left as it comes back down! He\u2019s edged this one, and Root has taken a terrific low catch at slip! 133rd over: South Africa 241-7 (Philander 4, Pretorius 0) Root brings in another short leg as Bess bowls to Philander. There\u2019s a leg slip, a leg gully and two short legs, as well as a slip and a silly point, but this time they get no catching chances. The last ball is sent squirming past point and South Africa turn down a run. Pretorius survived the last Stokes over and clearly concluded that he fancies a bit more, which is just remarkable. 13 overs to go 132nd over: South Africa 241-7 (Philander 4, Pretorius 0) A couple of rippers from Stokes go cruelly unrewarded. Stokes gets Pretorius to hang out his bat, but can\u2019t quite find the edge, then squares him up with another beauty. Then the third in this trifecta of terrificness stays low, and the batsman does brilliantly to get his bat on it. The next ball is pretty great as well. How Pretorius survived that over I do not know, but it was fantastic viewing. 14 overs to go 131st over: South Africa 241-7 (Philander 4, Pretorius 0) Bess\u2019s first ball comes off the bat, into the pad, loops up gently and then plops down to earth. Short leg shuffles a little shorter. Then Philander thumps a full toss down the ground, but the bowler gets a hand to it. And then, runs! Philander tonks one through the covers for four, to get off the mark from his 31st delivery! More thrills from the last, which clips the bat and flies into the space between short leg and leg gully. That\u2019s drinks, taken with 15 overs to go 130th over: South Africa 237-7 (Philander 0, Pretorius 0) Stokes is back, with the crowd greeting with delight the complete absence of action that follows every delivery. The last leaves a cloud of dust as it comes off the pitch and zips just past Pretorius\u2019 bat, a cracker. The batsman remains uncracked. That\u2019s maiden No11. 16 overs to go 129th over: South Africa 237-7 (Philander 0, Pretorius 0) Philander decides it\u2019s about time he scored a run, and swings his bat at a couple of Bess deliveries. He doesn\u2019t get hold of either of them, and this is thus maiden No10. In short, ostensibly nothing at all is happening, and it\u2019s absolutely unmissable. \u201cHave been driving from the south of Cameroon to the north today, following on radio and OBO,\u201d writes Anna Halford. \u201cJust felt the need to add my voice to those raging against the philistine idea of cutting the fifth day - I would not have been making sure I had credit for a data connection for a measly fourth and final day in this test. Having arrived after 8 hours on the road, I am finally able to join the OBO community in their biscuit-dunking as well as the cricket (tea, and something more or less equivalent to a malted milk biscuit - don\u2019t judge, Cameroon\u2019s biscuit selection is sadly limited).\u201d 17 overs to go 128th over: South Africa 237-7 (Philander 0, Pretorius 0) CricViz now gives England a 44% chance of winning. Broad bowls to Pretorius, with three slips, a gully, a leg slip a short leg and a short mid on in place. Broad gets a warning for running on the pitch, his second of the innings, and Pretorius sees out a ninth successive maiden. 18 overs to go 127th over: South Africa 237-7 (Philander 0, Pretorius 0) Another maiden from Bess. Run-scoring is pretty low on everybody\u2019s list of priorities. Philander has faced 20 balls so far. 19 overs to go 126th over: South Africa 237-7 (Philander 0, Pretorius 0) Another maiden, this one containing the considerable bonus of Van der Dussen\u2019s wicket, rendered all the sweeter because the fielder who took the catch did so having spent about 20 seconds in situ. Anyway, that\u2019s maiden No7: the world record is 25 in a row, so we still have time to shatter that here. 20 overs to go Got him! Broad sends one just down the leg side, and Van der Dussen works it off his hip and straight to Anderson, who had just been moved from mid on to leg slip! 125th over: South Africa 237-6 (van der Dussen 17, Philander 0) Philander sees off another Denly over, by my count a sixth successive maiden. 21 overs to go 124th over: South Africa 237-6 (van der Dussen 17, Philander 0) A second slip comes in for Broad here, and there\u2019s a gully there as well. Broad tries to bring them into play by bowling wide of off stump, which only allows Van der Dussen to leave the ball completely. After a couple of these deliveries the bowler tweaks his radar and straightens, but the batsman\u2019s defensive game is strong. Then he ends the over with the best of both worlds, one that jags back in, but it\u2019s just wide of off stump! 22 overs to go 123rd over: South Africa 237-6 (van der Dussen 17, Philander 0) Another maiden, Denly this time the bowler. \u201cIt\u2019s a truth universally acknowledged that a captain in search of wickets must be in want of some close fielders,\u201d notes Tom Carver. \u201cSolitary slip? Three men around the bat when the spinner was on earlier. How is Capt JR planning to get the Saffers, historically known to be impossible to bore out, out on a dying wicket? Granted, if there\u2019s no swing then there\u2019s no need for slips and if the pitch isn\u2019t taking spin then close fielders are also a bit superfluous. So is there a discernible plan? 210 or so runs to play with; 4 wickets needed. Surely worth a few more close fielders just in case the ball hits a crack or something\u2026\u201d There\u2019s one slip, a short leg and a silly point here for Philander, but they get no exercise. 23 overs to go 122nd over: South Africa 237-6 (van der Dussen 17, Philander 0) Broad, having been rested during the last session to allow him a go at potentially fresh batsmen in this one, bowls another entire over at Van der Dussen, who has now faced 129 balls for his 17 runs in what has been a magnificent rearguard effort. This just in from Kim Thonger: \u201cDipping one\u2019s biscuit sounds a great more savoury than this from my Faber Dictionary of Euphemisms, which lives in the downstairs loo: \u2018Dipping Cecil in the hot grease\u2019. Clue, nothing to do with biscuits.\u201d This I fear is dangerous territory for the OBO. 24 overs to go 121st over: South Africa 237-6 (van der Dussen 17, Philander 0) So England take the vital wicket of De Kock, and then cook their final review. The match returns to its knife-edge. 25 overs to go. The question is whether the ball flicked the glove on its way up off the pad. The umpire thinks not. England think it\u2019s worth checking. It wasn\u2019t: the ball flicked a forearm. From nothing, from nowhere, for no reason, Quinton de Kock swings his bat and thunders the ball to Zak Crawley at mid on! 120th over: South Africa 237-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 50) Hello sailor! Broad replaces a clearly ailing Anderson, and his first two deliveries are wide of off stump and left alone, his next is straight and defended, and then comes a ripper, a cutter that moves away from Van der Dussen and just past the edge. Still no wicket, though. 119th over: South Africa 237-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 50) CricViz now has the draw at 79%. Like the Bisto kids on a bad day, the scent of victory is drifting away from England. De Kock thumps Curran\u2019s final delivery through the covers for four to reach the slowest half-century of his Test career. 118th over: South Africa 233-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 46) Four balls into the over, broadcasters pick out five or six England fielders as they all clap and shout encouragement at each other/themselves. Anderson stays faithful to a line well outside off stump, and Van der Dussen doesn\u2019t feel compelled to play. Meanwhile Joachim Demnitz has an important point of information on the subject of biscuit-dunking: \u201cHere in Brazil molhar o biscoito (to dip your biscuit) means \u2018to get your leg over\u2019,\u201d he writes. \u201cJust thought all cricket and OBO lovers ought to know.\u201d 117th over: South Africa 233-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 46) De Kock edges a Curran slower ball well wide of the solitary slip and away for four. It\u2019s quite a fun field, littered with close fielders rather than having them in clusters, but a second slip would have come in handy then. Then De Kock does it again, more deliberately this time, for four more. 116th over: South Africa 225-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 38) England are only one wicket from ... er ... only needing four more wickets, but that vital breakthrough remains elusive. Anderson\u2019s over seems to bother him a fair amount more than it bothers the batsmen, but it\u2019s a maiden. They\u2019re back out, and Anderson is going to start the final session. This is going to the wire. Strap yourselves in. 115th over: South Africa 225-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 38) Bess overpitches, which he has tended to do a bit, and De Kock hits past point for four. And then a sniff of a wicket, as he edges the last ball before tea just short of Root at gully! So the batsmen survive, and South Africa have a real chance of drawing this. There are 32 overs to go today, not much more than the number this pair have already survived. Anyway, that\u2019s tea. I\u2019ll be back in a little bit. Here\u2019s some teatimely reading for you: 114th over: South Africa 221-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 34) This partnership has now contributed 50 runs, and more importantly in the circumstances gobbled up 162 balls. \u201cCricViz now has the draw at 70% probability,\u201d writes Michael Meagher. I\u2019ve checked, and this is true. \u201cLooks like not just an algorithm but someone actually watching!\u201d 113th over: South Africa 219-5 (van der Dussen 16, de Kock 33) Root retires, unrewarded, and Bess gets another go. \u201cAs a Proteas supporter this is pretty tense - one wicket and it could all come tumbling down,\u201d writes Richard Mansell. \u201cI am reminded a bit of the 2005 Test against Australia where SA clung on for 126 overs to salvage a draw. One can hope...\u201d That hope seems to be rising, with this pair refusing to be drawn into significant risk-taking. England will be desperate for some pre-tea cheer. 112th over: South Africa 215-5 (van der Dussen 16, de Kock 33) \u201cI\u2019d like to see you get out here like that. Imagine that,\u201d says Stokes, as Van der Dussen hooks, safely, for a single. As well as some other stuff that isn\u2019t picked up clearly on the stump mic, perhaps fortunately. 111th over: South Africa 215-5 (van der Dussen 15, de Kock 32) More Root, no more worries for the batsmen. \u201cThe big OBO debate yesterday was Flintoff v Stokes, but even weirder than England\u2019s ability to have produced three blond all rounders with super human powers is the inability to produce captains who grow stronger rather than weaker as they grow into the role. Where is our Steve Smith, our Graeme Smith? It\u2019s not like we don\u2019t have anyone called Smith in England,\u201d says Andrew Williams. Who\u2019s our best cricketing Smith? Should they just be fast-tracked into the job? 110th over: South Africa 215-5 (van der Dussen 14, de Kock 31) Still Stokes, still no dice. De Kock is scoring a lot quicker than Van der Dussen, but still very slowly for De Kock: of innings of 50 balls or more, this is his third-slowest. 109th over: South Africa 212-5 (van der Dussen 12, de Kock 28) Root continues, with a slip, leg slip and short leg in place, and his first delivery skids out of the rough and past the edge of De Kock\u2019s bat! Still no breakthrough, though, and England are teetering towards desperation. 108th over: South Africa 211-5 (van der Dussen 12, de Kock 27) A change of pace, and not for the first time England ask Ben Stokes to magic something up. His spells do not immediately work. Here meanwhile is this week\u2019s Spin, courtesy of Michael Butler: 107th over: South Africa 209-5 (van der Dussen 12, de Kock 27) Denly keeps rolling, and De Kock hoists the ball high to midwicket, where the complete absence of fielders makes the shot safe. I\u2019m still getting emails about biscuit-dunking, a debate I am unable to enter or even officiate, being something of a hot-drink hater. I did go through a period of dunking a particular extraordinarily dull biscuit in orange squash once, but I don\u2019t look back on it with any pride. 106th over: South Africa 205-5 (van der Dussen 12, de Kock 23) Root\u2019s fourth ball is a surprise bumper sent down to Van der Dussen, who gets his bat to it and works it to square leg. I remember Phil Edmonds doing a good line in those, back in the day, a case of chucking the kitchen sink at the problem. 105th over: South Africa 204-5 (van der Dussen 12, de Kock 22) Denly gets one to rear up out of the rough and into De Kock, who reacts smartly to fend it away. And now there will be a change of bowler, but it\u2019s more spin: Joe Root is giving himself a go. 104th over: South Africa 203-5 (van der Dussen 12, de Kock 21) \u201cI think England may get a bit carried away with the marks for the spinners here,\u201d sniffs Kevin Wilson, as another over spins away. \u201cWe\u2019re bowling a rookie and a part-timer. Bowl one, sure, but both? Our best chance of wickets are still with the quicks. One of them needs to be on at a time.\u201d 103rd over: South Africa 200-5 (van der Dussen 12, de Kock 18) Quinton de Kock scores South Africa\u2019s 200th run, with another cover drive off Denly that gets part-stopped by the fielder and thus yields only a single. That brings Van der Dussen on strike, and he leaves a ball that turns into his pads: it was heading well wide of off stump, but had there been a bit less turn he\u2019d have been in a great deal of trouble. 102nd over: South Africa 199-5 (van der Dussen 12, de Kock 17) Bess continues, and Van der Dussen gets a couple through cover. 101st over: South Africa 197-5 (van der Dussen 10, de Kock 17) I apologise for the multiple posts you\u2019ve had to negotiate over the last couple of overs. These are confusing times we live in. Another phenomenal cover drive from De Kock off Denly. 100th over: South Africa 193-5 (van der Dussen 10, de Kock 13) Bess to van der Dussen, so you can guess the rest. Root has three men round the bat when there\u2019s surely a strong case for nine. Here\u2019s Jamie Woodward. \u201cWas Jimmy late back because he was still dunking Hobnobs?\u201d At last, the cricket and the biscuit come together. My job is done, and it will be Simon Burnton to see if this absorbing contest can end up as a thriller. 99th over: South Africa 193-5 (van der Dussen 10, de Kock 13) Hello everyone! Simon Burnton here, taking over for the remainder of the day and indeed the Test. Denly restarts with an appeal, a shake of the head from Paul Reiffel and the very briefest discussion about a potential review, the ball having hit De Kock on the pad but outside the line. A couple of balls later, he thumps one through the covers for four. 98th over: South Africa 189-5 (van der Dussen 10, de Kock 9) Yet another maiden from Bess to van der Dussen, who now has 10 off 63 balls. And that\u2019s drinks, with England ahead but not by as much as they might like, following Malan\u2019s superb vigil. They need another wicket soon, and it may have to be Anderson who provides it. 97th over: South Africa 189-5 (van der Dussen 10, de Kock 9) After a maiden from Bess, Denly beats de Kock again, on the back foot this time, with a ball that spits out of the rough like the best of them. For a moment, de Kock\u2019s energy infected van der Dussen, but now it\u2019s going the other way and even de Kock is strokeless. 95th over: South Africa 189-5 (van der Dussen 10, de Kock 9) Denly beats de Kock with an unusual ball \u2013 a dipping, turning near-yorker outside off. It may be a stumping chance too, albeit a tricky one, thanks to the quirkiness of the delivery. 94th over: South Africa 189-5 (van der Dussen 10, de Kock 9) Now it\u2019s a double dose of spin as Dom Bess returns, complete with a change of ends. He\u2019s on the spot right away and van der Dussen is back in his dour mode, which is dourer than most. 93rd over: South Africa 189-5 (van der Dussen 10, de Kock 9) Root turns to Denly, who turns his first ball, and gets some bounce, but de Kock survives. And now Brian Withington entersg the great dunkin\u2019 debate. \u201cThe definitive word on hobnobs, aka \u2018the SAS of the biscuit world\u2019, from the (uncivilised?) Peter Kay. The image of him simulating their enthusiasm for repeated dunking still makes me chuckle.\u201d 92nd over: South Africa 187-5 (van der Dussen 9, de Kock 8) Root keeps Broad on, blatantly disregarding the OBO\u2019s advice, as well he may after being right about Bess and Curran. \u201cDo you think there is a negative physique bias when is comes to Sam Curran?\u201d wonders Martin Laidler. \u201cHe bowls at a similar pace to Chris Tremlett and bats with explosive power yet seems to have many doubters who take one look at him and dismiss him due to his stature. As a diminutive left hander he pretty much has all modes of dismissal on the cards at all times and his record is already impressive.\u201d That\u2019s spot on about his good days, but he has had some bad ones too \u2013 when the ball won\u2019t swing and he can be all too hittable. But he\u2019s got talent and spirit and plenty of time to hone his game. 91st over: South Africa 186-5 (van der Dussen 9, de Kock 7) Just a single off Curran, who has been almost as stingy as the old geezers. Over at CricViz, the forecasting gizmo has something to say. \u201cFollowing the wicket of Pieter Malan, WinViz climbed to 74% for an England win. Before the dismissal it was down at only 53%.\u201d Quite an impact for a debutant. It looks as if South Africa have found themselves a rock, though perhaps we should see him on a spicy surface before leaping to conclusions. 90th over: South Africa 185-5 (van der Dussen 9, de Kock 6) Still nothing happening for Broad, who\u2019s been merely miserly. Time for Anderson. 89th over: South Africa 184-5 (van der Dussen 9, de Kock 5) Waspish as ever, Curran hurries van der Dussen into a jab which turns into a leg glance, not far away from the diving Buttler. So van der Dussen now has nine off 37 balls, eight of them from false shots. Here\u2019s Pete Salmon. \u201cSad as it is about Rory Burns, I did love this in the news report: \u2018Burns had landed awkwardly on his left ankle in the follow-through from a shot that saw him score despite the close attention of Joe Root.\u2019 As long as he scored, that\u2019s the main thing. I do hope if he missed Root would have stood over him and given him some chat before the stretcher came out, John Terry style.\u201d 88th over: South Africa 179-5 (van der Dussen 5, de Kock 4) That boundary from de Kock sparks up van der Dussen, who attempts a pull off Broad \u2013 and nearly pays for it as a bottom edge goes close to the stumps. 87th over: South Africa 175-5 (van der Dussen 1, de Kock 4) Even more full of beans than usual, Curran greets de Kock with his slower ball, which got him out the other day. But he overpitches and de Kock flicks a full toss away for four. With van der Dussen playing musical statues, de Kock\u2019s fluency is just what the game needs. This is the huge one. After surviving 287 balls, Malan finally gets an outside edge, as Curran finds a lot of bounce for a short bowler and the ball goes off the shoulder, low to second slip, where Stokes is not dropping anything at the moment. Well done Curran, well done Root for giving him the new ball, and very well done Malan, who has established himself as a senior player in his very first Test. 85th over: South Africa 171-4 (Malan 84, van der Dussen 1) Jimmy Anderson was off the field, perhaps finishing his lunch with some Stilton and port. He\u2019s back now but Broad continues, uneventfully. Rassie van der Dussen now has one run off 26 balls. The game hasn\u2019t quite gone to sleep, but the pitch has. \u201cHi Tim, always enjoy your OBO coverage,\u201d says Quinn on Twitter. Thank you, but it takes a village. \u201cRE: the lbw not reviewed \u2013 if the umpire thought it was out, would he have given it despite no appeal? Or does his interest correlate with the confidence of the appeal? Cheers, and keep it Aristarchus (Colossians 4:10).\u201d There does have to be an appeal, confident or otherwise. And thanks for sending me to St Paul, when my thoughts are more about St Pieter Malan. How the hell are England going to dislodge him? 84th over: South Africa 171-4 (Malan 84, van der Dussen 1) Broad is back, predictably, but with a twist \u2013 it\u2019s Anderson, not Curran, who gives way. On Twitter, Leonard Smith is taking issue with Martin Laidler\u2019s Anglo-optimism (81st over). \u201cCan you imagine an attack including both Curran and Bess ever bowling out Smith and co. next winter on those wickets? No way under 500.\u201d Fair point, though Bess is an understudy and Curran may be squeezed out of the next Test if Jofra Archer is fit again. Also, at the risk of being picky... Steve Smith isn\u2019t even Australia\u2019s biggest run-scorer at the moment \u2013 he\u2019s an ominous third, behind the home-track bully David Warner and the man of the moment Marnus Labuschagne. Calling Rob Lewis \u2013 Kim Thonger is back atcha. \u201cRob Lewis is clearly unfamiliar with advanced laser cutting technology. I\u2019m rather surprised, I thought all OBOers kept abreast of cutting edge technology? Also, Dakkers gets half of each one and he doesn\u2019t like them dunked.\u201d Greater love hath no man than this, that he lays down half his Hobnob for his dachsund. Kim is also back at you, Professor Thwaites. \u201cI note from Peter Thwaites\u2019 comment that I am officially more barbaric than my dog. I suppose I should have known that. Mea cuppa.\u201d Classy. Some people are managing, somehow, to concentrate on the cricket. \u201cWith this absorbing Test match building up to a potentially thrilling fifth day finish,\u201d says William Ellen, \u201cthe timing could not be any more exquisite. What chance an Ebeneezer Scrooge style epiphany from the money men at the ICC and ECB, resulting in a changing of their waxy, pea-sized hearts? Say boy, what day is it today?\u201d Hobnob latest. \u201cMuch as I love the cricket, I\u2019ve never been moved to email the Guardian OBO \u2013 until now,\u201d says Peter Thwaites in Keimyung, South Korea. \u201cI simply cannot accept such appalling suggestions as that made by Rob Lewis at 10.41. Dunking a Hobnob is uncivilised. To do so into a cup of coffee is barbaric.\u201d But first, an urgent question. \u201cPlease ask Kim,\u201d says Rob Lewis, \u201chow he can possibly eat Hobnobs with Turkish coffee (78th over)... I imagine he\u2019s using those dinky cups that it is always served in (at least it is here in Istanbul). So how do you dunk the Hobnob?\u201d 83rd over: South Africa 170-4 (Malan 83, van der Dussen 1) For a moment England think they\u2019ve got Malan, but Curran\u2019s nip-backer has only flicked the waistband. And that\u2019s lunch, with honours still even \u2013 England buoyed by a surprise gift from Faf du Plessis, but SA satisfied with losing just the one serious batsman, and delighted to have Malan still there. He\u2019s playing like an opener with a hundred Test caps, not one. Meanwhile Geoff Wignall has been thinking about Jos Buttler (73rd over). \u201cSurely a part of Buttler\u2019s apparent underperformance is that his role at 7 should be to supply the icing, not bake the cake?\u201d Nice. \u201cToo often he comes in after the mixing bowl has been smashed and there\u2019s a gooey mess all over the floor. Though I haven\u2019t checked, I\u2019m fairly sure he and Stokes have similar averages.\u201d Broadly, yes, but last time I looked Stokes had edged up to 36, while Buttler had slipped to 33. I\u2019d love to see him make a hundred in the next two Tests. Time for some fresh air \u2013 back in half an hour or so. 82nd over: South Africa 170-4 (Malan 83, van der Dussen 1) Anderson is back, and there\u2019s no swing for him either, but he does get some lift as he did early on. Not bad for a 37-year-old lad. 81st over: South Africa 169-4 (Malan 83, van der Dussen 0) Curran finds his line but no swing, and Malan uses the bounce of the harder ball to ease him away for two between gully and cover. Malan\u2019s wagon wheel must be more like a sheaf of twigs. A rare note of English optimism is being struck. \u201cIt feels like, either through great studious planning or a bit of a fluke,\u201d reckon Martin Laidler, \u201cEngland have found a really good balance to this side with a mixture of experience and promise which should see us through to the next few years.\u201d Not sure I\u2019d go that far, but they may be about to show that you can win something with kids. Here it is, and it\u2019s being taken by Curran. 80th over: South Africa 167-4 (Malan 81, van der Dussen 0) Stokes still hasn\u2019t taken himself off. he tries a yorker on off stump, but van der Dussen is ready with a firm prod. Tone White has a question. \u201cCould Bess be the spinning equivalent to Curran, able to bowl decently but without apparent menace then whoops, he takes a crucial wicket? And hullo and thanks from France!\u201d Similar personalities, certainly \u2013 each a bundle of energy. 79th over: South Africa 167-4 (Malan 81, van der Dussen 0) Malan, facing Bess, moves into the eighties with what seems to be his signature stroke \u2013 the careful push to wide third man. Root has been slow to plug that gap, as modern captains often are. 78th over: South Africa 165-4 (Malan 79, van der Dussen 0) So almost everything rests on the shoulders of Pieter Malan, who doesn\u2019t seem bothered at all. He just gets on with the job, pushing Stokes for a single. As Nasser observed a few overs ago, \u201cSouth Africa have found one here\u201d. Before Faf\u2019s brainstorm, Kim Thonger sent this. \u201cThere seem to be a number of people this morning hell-bent on ignoring the sage advice of Donald Sutherland\u2019s eccentric tank commander in Kelly\u2019s Heroes \u2013 \u2018don\u2019t make wid da negative waves\u2019. I for one am having a very positive Turkish coffee with Hobnobs, and Dakkers the dachshund and I are cheering our brave boys all the way to victory (or a draw).\u201d A very positive Turkish coffee with Hobnobs, eh: cricket commentary has been waiting for those words. 77th over: South Africa 164-4 (Malan 78, van der Dussen 0) In comes Rassie van der Dussen, who almost gives a low catch to forward short leg as Root brings the close catchers back. And Root needs to be congratulated for keeping Bess on, when some idiots would have turned to Denly\u2019s leggies. Out of nowhere, Bess bags the big one. It was a regulation delivery, but Faf didn\u2019t get over the ball as he swept and it went straight to Joe Denly at square leg. That is the moment of the day so far. 76th over: South Africa 163-3 (Malan 77, du Plessis 19) Root had Curran lined up, but Stokes said he wanted one more. Another case of Stokes getting what he wants, and it not bearing fruit. He\u2019s a commanding batsman now, and has always been a great fielder, but he doesn\u2019t get quite as many wickets as he thinks he does. 75th over: South Africa 163-3 (Malan 77, du Plessis 19) The first boundary off Bess this morning as Malan cuts for four. Time to bring on Denly, the only spinner with a wicket in this innings. 74th over: South Africa 159-3 (Malan 73, du Plessis 19) Better from Faf, who strokes Stokes for four past gully. 73rd over: South Africa 154-3 (Malan 72, du Plessis 15) Another maiden from Bess, who is being tidy when tidiness is not needed. \u201cGood morning Tim.\u201d Good morning, Matthew Kentridge. \u201cI\u2019m back at work after the holidays so envy you camped out in front of the cricket with your coffee and your keyboard. The OBO is the usual lifeline, but it\u2019s bad enough sitting here at my desk without the pang I feel, wishing I was at Newlands. I\u2019ve been wondering why Jos Buttler has been so underwhelming in Tests for so long. It can\u2019t be temperament, as he has smarts and captaincy material written all over him, so is it technique, or the role he\u2019s expected to play in the team? Other quick-fire destructive batsmen (Stokes, obviously, and Quinton de Kock for SA who, ahem, ahem, went to my old school) regularly get fifties or go on to hundreds, while Buttler makes a fast 20 and then holes out. I know you\u2019ve interviewed him so would be keen to hear your take.\u201d Well, I interviewed him a year ago when he was about to become one of Wisden\u2019s Five Cricketers of the Year, so I didn\u2019t ask about underperforming \u2013 he\u2019d just had his best year in Tests. Things have only gone awry since the World Cup, which seemed to leave him with a hangover: in the Ashes, he was poor for three Tests, better in the last two. My feeling is that he hasn\u2019t been helped by changes of role \u2013 batsman then keeper again, vice-captain then demoted, wrongly, when Stokes asked for the job back. But perhaps he tried too hard to rein himself in when he was being picked as a No.5. He should be de Kocking it all over the park \u2013 and did, briefly, in his last innings, when he played for the team rather than his average. 72nd over: South Africa 153-3 (Malan 72, du Plessis 15) Stokes hits his straps, digging it in to get Faf fending over the slips, then pitching it up and beating him outside off. England need a breakthrough and only Stokes and Anderson have looked like supplying it. Get Curran on! 71st over: South Africa 148-3 (Malan 72, du Plessis 10) Bess races through a maiden to Malan \u2013 doesn\u2019t he realise there are people with OBOs to write? \u2013 and gets a puff of dust with the last ball. Here\u2019s Brian Withington. \u201cInterested to hear Michael Holding politely put pro-verbals KP back in his box on commentary. \u2018I know it can work, I just don\u2019t believe in it.\u2019 Refreshingly old school.\u201d Quite agree, Brian. Sledging is a dismal thing, a way for sportsmen to strip themselves of their dignity. But whether it was different in the old days, I\u2019m not so sure \u2013 surely Fred Trueman was effing and blinding at batsmen in the Fifties? 70th over: South Africa 148-3 (Malan 72, du Plessis 10) Stokes gets some reverse swing away from the bat, the opposite of Anderson\u2019s, but has nothing to show for it yet. \u201cAnother fellow United fan here,\u201d says Michael Robinson. \u201cNot sure how much positivity we can gain from winning this Test. It\u2019s like beating City and Spurs back in December, what\u2019s the point when Watford batter you?One victory does not a Test team make.\u201d No, but it would be the making of the series, and give England a fair chance of winning away from home, which doesn\u2019t happen often enough. Also, if you\u2019d been offered those United results as a package deal, you\u2019d have taken them, wouldn\u2019t you? 69th over: South Africa 146-3 (Malan 71, du Plessis 10) Dom Bess comes on for the first twirl of the morning and has a noisy appeal against Faf. Whether it\u2019s for lbw or caught at short leg, we will never know, as it\u2019s not given and England don\u2019t review. That\u2019s drinks, with honours even so far \u2013 England got the early wicket, but not the big one, and SA have been impressively calm. A lot will hinge on the new ball, due just before lunch. 68th over: South Africa 144-3 (Malan 71, du Plessis 8) Stokes bowls a no-ball, as he may have done, undetected, in the previous over. Also undetected, more importantly, is an lbw that England didn\u2019t appeal for, which would have been given had they reviewed. It was the same ball from Anderson off which du Plessis was nearly run out. The beady eyes in the TV truck have spotted that it was pad first. Just before that, the umpires summoned Root for a telling-off, possibly because du Plessis felt he was obstructed by Anderson as he went for that third run. Too many sub-plots. \u201cPicking up on Christopher Drew\u2019s theme [8:17],\u201d says Matt Dony, \u201cthe apostle James was, along with his brother (unfortunately not called Stuart), nicknamed \u2018Son of thunder.\u2019 James Anderson certainly bringing the storm in this match.\u201d You\u2019re right \u2013 the New Testament does suffer from a severe shortage of Stuarts. 67th over: South Africa 143-3 (Malan 71, du Plessis 8) Faf almost gets run out going for a third, playing a clip off Anderson and then underestimating the waspishness of Curran\u2019s throw from the deep. \u201cI am an England cricket and Manchester United supporter,\u201d says David Gaskell. Always good to find a fellow sufferer. \u201cSo unfortunately all I see is Australia and Liverpool disappearing over the rise with nary a look in their rear view mirrors. But I must rebel against the negativity surrounding this Test match. One wicket ( and as I write it has fallen) and the rest will follow as surely as a packet of Maltesers will disappear in a crowded cinema. So let us embrace positivity. Go out ye non believers and book lunch as it will all be over before the port is passed around.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t go that far, but the chances are you\u2019re right about the result: CricViz has England winning by 135 runs. 66th over: South Africa 141-3 (Malan 71, du Plessis 6) Root takes Broad off, wisely, and springs a surprise by summoning Stokes rather than Curran. A touch short at first, Stokes soon beats Malan with a beauty \u2013 the first ball this morning, I think, to get past that sturdy outside edge. 65th over: South Africa 139-3 (Malan 70, du Plessis 5) Broad has been merely steady, whereas Anderson is back to his masterly best \u2013 reversing it in, mostly pitching it up, then suddenly going shorter and finding an extra snap, which now forces Faf to take his hand off the bat in a hurry. There\u2019s some news of Rory Burns, and it\u2019s not good alas. 64th over: South Africa 139-3 (Malan 70, du Plessis 5) Malan tucks Broad away for a couple, but more importantly Broad gets a warning for running on the pitch. Maybe he won\u2019t take the new ball after all. And incase anyone is playing Mark Nicholas Bingo, he has just come out with his first Nicholasism of the day: \u201cI\u2019ll wager\u201d. Meanwhile Richard O\u2019Hagan is picking up on Harry Lang\u2019s question (57th over). \u201cI would suggest,\u201d he says, \u201cthat shipping 300 on the last day would be akin to Lord\u2019s in 1984 when Greenidge made a mockery of Gower\u2019s declaration.\u201d Yes, except that it was more of a shock then, because scoring was slower. 63rd over: South Africa 137-3 (Malan 68, du Plessis 5) Anderson thinks he\u2019s got Malan with another lbw shout, but it\u2019s going over the stumps and there may have been an inside edge too. 62nd over: South Africa 136-3 (Malan 67, du Plessis 5) Faf glances Broad for the first four of the day. He can do vigils, but he\u2019s rightly looking for runs too, to push the field back and prey on Root\u2019s nerves. 61st over: South Africa 132-3 (Malan 67, du Plessis 1) Faf du Plessis gets off the mark with a glance off Anderson, and CricViz have a good point about him. \u201cdu Plessis averages 61.66 on Day Five of Tests in South Africa.\u201d Formidable \u2013 but England could give him that today and still win with time to spare. \u201cMorning Tim,\u201d says Jeff Doherty, \u201cwe\u2019re strapped in and waiting to go. So what have we got, sunshine, heat, which way \u2018s the wind blowing, how\u2019s that crack on the pitch?\u201d The sun is shining, it\u2019s warm but not hot, and as far as I can tell there\u2019s barely a breeze to ruffle Joe Root\u2019s stubble. The crack hasn\u2019t widened, according to Michael Holding in his pitch report. The main thing is that there is that bit of movement, which is just how these old bowlers like it. 60th over: South Africa 131-3 (Malan 67, du Plessis 0) The good news for England is that the new ball is only 20 overs away, so these two will be back before lunch, asking sharper questions. For now, they\u2019re finding just enough movement to keep the batsmen honest. Malan takes another watchful two to third man. He\u2019s an old lag already, even if he is on debut. 59th over: South Africa 129-3 (Malan 65, du Plessis 0) That was hitting the inside of leg stump. Anderson has 2-18 off 11 overs in the innings, and 7-58 in the match. He can smell a ten-for. Anderson strikes again! He goes fuller and straighter, with a bit of nip in off the seam, and Maharaj barely waits for the finger, let alone a review. 58th over: South Africa 129-2 (Malan 65, Maharaj 2) At the other end it is, of course, Stuart Broad. He\u2019s accurate but not threatening, and Malan picks up two with a prod that runs past the slips. 57th over: South Africa 127-2 (Malan 63, Maharaj 2) Straight away, Anderson makes things almost happen. There\u2019s a big appeal for caught behind as Malan plays outside the nip-backer, but England don\u2019t use their last review and they\u2019re right not to as the nick was off the flap of the pad. After a leg bye, Anderson finds some extra lift and splits Maharaj\u2019s bat in two, to general amusement. The bat has PR written all over it. In a way. \u201cEngland have become rather adept at batting collapses recently,\u201d says Harry Lang on Twitter. \u201cBut where would shipping 300+ runs on a 5th day sit alongside all time bowling collapses, I wonder? Is there a stats-astute reader who can assist? Obv. I\u2019m brimming with confidence...\u201d Thank you for asking the readers. It\u2019s going to be Jimmy Anderson, who has just become the oldest swinger ever to take a five-for for England. \u201cWOO-HOO!\u201d says my inbox, slightly unexpectedly. \u201cMorning Tim. Morning all.\u201d Morning Peter Gibbs, in Selsey. \u201cPint of tea (straight glass)....aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand....BACON! \u201cFour-dayers be damned.\u201d An early email, of biblical proportions. \u201cMorning Tim.\u201d Morning, Christopher Drew, in Normandy. \u201cI think Pieter will need to be the rock for South Africa. Already scored more than our current Pope, but a greater miracle will be required today.\u201d Morning everyone and welcome to the fifth day of the second Test in Cape Town. As in any good drama, things are bubbling up as the final act approaches. England need eight more wickets to level the series, which makes them favourites but not a sure thing. South Africa need 312 runs, which is the longest of long shots, but not unthinkable. Failing that, the South Africans have to bat out the day \u2013 though if they get a sniff of a draw, the chance of a win will be there to tempt them into an indiscretion or two. With England relying on two elderly seamers and a rookie spinner, and South Africa leaning rather too heavily on a debutant opener, it\u2019s all deliciously intriguing. And let\u2019s not forget that if some people get their way, days like this will soon be a distant memory. England were given a late boost by Jimmy Anderson, looking himself again and taking his sixth wicket of the match, to see off Zubayr Hamza. But that was only England\u2019s second wicket in 56 overs. Today they need to nab one every 11 overs, which means being more than twice as incisive when their attack is missing both its high pace (Jofra Archer, Mark Wood) and its battle-hardened spin (Moeen Ali). Joe Root has to stop Pieter Malan going the whole Dom Sibley, while also making sure that neither Faf du Plessis nor Quinton de Kock hits a hundred \u2013 a feat that, in a plot twist nobody saw coming, only Sibley has managed in this series. South Africa\u2019s problem is that, for them to win, almost everything has to go right. The pitch seems to be on their side, but Test history is not. Then again, no visiting team has won a Test here since readmission, unless it\u2019s been wearing baggy green caps. And the target Root ended up setting them \u2013 438 \u2013 is the very same total they once rattled up to win a match in half a day. Can they do it? Probably not, but let\u2019s entertain the possibility. See you at 10.30am local time, which is 8.30am in the UK.",

In it she insisted, as she did earlier today, that she was not a Jeremy Corbyn continuity candidate. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/07/labour-leadership-long-bailey-adopts-pro-immigration-stance-as-she-launches-campaign-with-today-interview-live-news?page=with:block-5e1467568f087e8308e69f73#block-5e1467568f087e8308e69f73\">11.53am.)</a> But when Brand tried to get her to identify any differences between them, he did not get very far. This is from the transcript sent out by ITV. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>PB:</strong> I\u2019ll ask you again what makes you different?</p> <p><strong>RLB:</strong> We are very different people. The reasons I supported him were because I liked his approach to policy making.</p> <p><strong>PB: </strong>But how different are you?</p> <p><strong>RLB:</strong> We are different in the way we speak, different in tone.</p> <p><strong>PB: </strong>How would rate Corbyn as a leader out of ten?</p> <p><strong>RLB:</strong> I thought Corbyn was one of most honest, kind, principled politicians I\u2019ve ever met.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> Out of 10?</p> <p><strong>RLB: </strong>I\u2019d give him 10 out of 10, because I respect him and I supported him all the way through. What we can\u2019t ignore was that Jeremy was savaged from day one by the press ... We have a role as party to develop the image of our leader and to put them forward in the most positive way, but we also have a duty to rebut criticism and attacks. As a party we needed to have a rebuttal unit, a clear structure in place to rebut the attacks against him.</p> </blockquote> <p>Labour does employ press officers whose job it is to present the party to the media in a positive light. And Corbyn has his own press team too. Long Bailey is implying either that they weren\u2019t very good (not true, in my experience as a \u201ccustomer\u201d), or that they should have been more pro-active in responding to media criticism. She is not attaching any blame to Corbyn himself for the way he was presented in the media.</p> <p>Brand also asked Long Bailey what she did for fun. She replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I like watching telly. I spend a lot of time with my family and my favourite hobby is having a Chinese take away and watching box set on a Friday night with my husband.

What he said at the start did not really go beyond what the government has already said about the US killing of Qassem Suleimani (lukewarm endorsement, combined with a call for restraint and de-escalation) and the most lively opening exchanges came when Wallace clashed with <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong>, the Labour leader, who was responding for the opposition.</p> <p>Wallace started by saying the UK would always defend the right of countries to defend themselves. He said the US had in the past shown restraint when its bases in Iraq were under attack, and he said the UK was urging all parties to de-escalate the crisis as soon as possible.</p> <p>Travel advice for Iran and Iraq has been revised, he said. And he said non-essential UK personnel had been moved out of Baghdad. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As part of prudent planning, a small team has been sent to the region to provide additional situational awareness and contingency planning assistance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wallace said the Iraqi parliament had voted to end the coalition presence in Iraq. But that vote was only one part of the process, he said. The UK government was speaking to the Iraqi government about what this might mean, he said. He said the coalition was only in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government.</p> <p>He said the UK would be urging Iran to take a different path. Its aggressive behaviour, including targeting dissidents in Europe and hijacking civilian ships, was never going to go unchallenged. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Her Majesty\u2019s government urges Iran to return to the normal behaviour of the country it aspires to be and resist the urge to retaliate ... None of us wants conflict, none of us wants our citizens, our friends and our allies to be put at risk.</p> </blockquote> <p>In response Corbyn said Boris Johnson was \u201chiding behind\u201d his defence secretary and that he should be making the Commons statement himself. He said the \u201cassassination\u201d of Suleimani put British servicemen and women in danger, but Johnson was afraid to say so. Corbyn explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Isn\u2019t the truth that he\u2019s scared to stand up to President Trump because he\u2019s hitched his wagon to the prospect of a toxic Trump trade deal?</p> <p>Instead, at this highly dangerous moment, we find the government giving cover and even expressing sympathy for what is widely regarded as an illegal act, because they\u2019re so determined to keep in with President Trump?</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn asked Wallace if he thought the killing of Suleimani was legal. And he criticised the government for saying that the onus was on Iran to de-escalate. If an American general had been killed, the government would not be telling the US to de-escalate.<br></p> <p>Responding to Corbyn, Wallace said what he was saying was \u201cusual anti-American tripe\u201d.</p> <p>On the issue of the legality of the killing, Wallace said it was for the US to make its case. But Wallace also said it was clear that a legal defence of self-defence could be made in this case relating to Suleimani going to Iraq plotting to murder American citizens.</p> <p>My colleague <strong>Matthew Weaver</strong> has more about the Iran crisis on a separate live blog.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jan/07/iran-qassem-suleimani-funeral-stampede-updates-iraq\">Iran: Suleimani funeral crush death toll increases to 50 - latest updates</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T17:30:42.917Z\">at 5.30pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e149dda8f08c3972264659c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T15:31:42.195Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Javid branded 'pathetic' by Labour after claiming UK has had 'unprecedented decade of growth'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Boris Johnson likes to adopt a positive, optimistic approach to life and his outlook seems to be rubbing off on the chancellor, <strong>Sajid Javid,</strong> who has just told MPs that the UK has just ended \u201can unprecedented decade of growth\u201d.</p> <p>Javid was responding to a question from <strong>Peter Dowd</strong>, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, who asked what the government was going to do about falling productivity.

And he did face round after round of redundancies.</p> <p>I remember, I was always quite nosy as a child and I used to sit at the top of the stairs when my dad came home from shifts and listen to what him and my mum were talking about. And one particular incident stuck in my mind where he came home and he was in tears because he\u2019d been forced to - he was sitting in a room that looked at the oil tankers being filled up on cameras and it was the same exit that workers used to leave the premises. And he knew that redundancy consultations and discussions were happening and he was forced, as the trade union rep, to sit in that room and watch colleague after colleague walk out of the building with a bin liner full of stuff from their lockers. And he knew that his role to protect them as a trade union organiser and representative hadn\u2019t been fulfilled, and he was absolutely devastated by that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She praised Angela Rayner, her flatmate in London, who is standing for the deputy Labour leadership.</strong> Asked what last made her laugh out loud, she said it was probably Rayner, because she was \u201calways coming out with cracking jokes\u201d.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d22450d88e94b5ea649dbec81ba0ca5d434b137\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d22450d88e94b5ea649dbec81ba0ca5d434b137/0_289_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Long Bailey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Long Bailey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T10:56:12.063Z\">at 10.56am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1452a08f085eda5c11384c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T09:55:36.354Z\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is some Twitter comment on the Rebecca Long Bailey interview from journalists.</p> <p>From the BBC\u2019s <strong>Norman Smith</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNormanS/status/1214463241235173378\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Corbyn with a Smile ?

At one stage <strong>Rebecca Long Bailey</strong>, the shadow business secretary, was seen as the favourite in the Labour leadership contest because she is the candidate most favoured by Jeremy Corbyn and his inner circle. But she kept a low profile after the general election, avoiding interviews, and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is now seen as the favourite based on polling showing that he is more popular with members.</p> <p>But Long Bailey has now given her first interview as a candidate for the Labour leadership. She did so after using <a href=\"https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/01/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-leadership-socialism\">an article for Tribune published last night</a> to formally announce that she will be a candidate. My colleague <strong>Rajeev Syal</strong> has written it up here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/06/rebecca-long-bailey-announces-labour-leadership-bid\">Rebecca Long Bailey launches Labour leadership bid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her interview Long Bailey mostly struck a note likely to go down well with Labour members. Two of her answers were particularly revealing.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Long Bailey insisted that Labour should be pro-immigration. </strong>In her Tribune article she said that Labour should never again \u201cput \u2018controls on immigration\u2019 on a mug\u201d, as it did in the 2015 general election, and, when asked if that meant she was opposed to any immigration controls, she said the 2015 policy was a \u201cnod towards quite dangerous politics\u201d. She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think we need to have a fair immigration system, but we can\u2019t nod towards quite dangerous politics ... And I understand the reasons why that was done in the election campaign. There are concerns... We do need as a party to make a stronger argument, because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve every set out the economic case as to why immigration is a positive force.</p> </blockquote> <p>Long Bailey said she did not accept claims that immigration depressed wages. She said that, when the UK left the EU, EU freedom of movement would end. But when asked what should replace it, she said that was the \u201cmillion dollar question\u201d. When it was put to her that as party leader she should have a response to the million dollar question, she said it was vital to protect the rights of EU nationals living in the UK. And she added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to have immigration to serve our economic needs.</p> </blockquote> <p>This stance is likely to meet the approval of Labour members who, at the party conference last year, <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2019/09/labour-conference-approves-motion-to-extend-free-movement/\">passed a motion saying that freedom of movement </a>should be extended (even though quite what this meant has subsequently become a matter for debate).</p> <ul> <li><strong>Long Bailey expressed very strong reservations about using the nuclear deterrent - without ruling it out.</strong> Asked if she would be willing to authorise the nuclear deterrent as PM, she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any leader, any prime minister, has to be very clear that the security and the protection of the people that they represent comes first, above all else, and that they would do anything that it takes to ensure that the people of this country are protected. And I would be very clear on that.</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked if that included using the nuclear deterrent, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, if you have a deterrent, you have to be prepared to use it. But I\u2019m not going to be a warmonger foaming at the mouth and saying that I\u2019m going to press a button, because any leader needs to ensure that they assess the situation, they address the consequences of their actions. And of course any country that was considering pushing the nuclear button needed to realise that we were facing nuclear annihilation right across the whole world. But, yes, a leader would need to be prepared to engage in that if they were going to use the nuclear deterrent going forward. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is probably the right answer for the Labour membership too. They will interpret the \u201cwarmonger foaming at the mouth\u201d line as a reference to the former Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, who is much disliked by Labour activists and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jo-swinson-nuclear-weapon-button-war-lib-dems-election-debate-a9210456.html\">who stressed her willingness to push the nuclear button during the election campaign.</a> In the early days of his leadership Corbyn did firmly rule out using nuclear weapons, but the party as a whole backs the nuclear deterrent (not least because a lot of union jobs are tied up with the nuclear submarine programme) and later he became more evasive when asked if he would ever use nuclear weapons.</p> <p>I will post more on the interview shortly.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9.30am: </em>Boris Johnson chairs cabinet.</p> <p><em>12pm: </em>Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2.30pm: </em>Sajid Javid, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>After 3.30pm:</em> Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, makes a statement in the Commons about the Iran crisis.</p> <p><em>Around 5pm or later:</em> MPs begin the committee stage debate for the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill.</p> <p><em>6pm:</em> Labour leadership candidates speak at a private hustings for Labour MPs organised by the parliamentary Labour party.</p> <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

      "bodyText": "The Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) held its leadership hustings in the House of Commons. Lisa Nandy was acclaimed by some as having \u2018won\u2019 the event in what was being called a breakout performance, telling the PLP that \u201cif we do not change course we will die and we will deserve to\u201d. Jess Phillips also set out the stark future facing the party, saying: \u201cWe run the risk of being completely irrelevant for the next four years. All over the country people have busy lives, with lots of noise from one way or another. We have got to get them to hear us in the little time they give us.\u201d Keir Starmer told the hustings that Labour \u201cneeded to win back our heartlands. We need to understand and to address each and every reason we lost at this election, but we also need to win back Scotland, we need to win back seats in Wales and if you draw a line from London to Bristol and look south we only have a handful seats. So, we have got a mountain to climb.\u201d Rebecca Long Bailey, who is widely seen as being favoured by the current leadership, denied that she was the Jeremy Corbyn continuity candidate. However in an interview with ITV\u2019s Paul Brand she described Corbyn as \u201cone of the most honest, kind, principled politicians\u201d she had ever met and said that she would give his leadership 10/10, while blaming the media for his portrayal. Clive Lewis, the Norwich South MP who is pitching himself as the candidate to tackle the \u201ccrisis of democracy\u201d in British politics, said that Lords reform and PR for voting must be part of radical political reform. He also said Labour must work with other progressive forces in British politics. In non-Labour leadership news, Jeremy Corbyn condemned the US \u201cassassination\u201d of Qassem Suleimani for putting British servicemen and women in danger, and accused Boris Johnson of being too scared to stand up to Donald Trump. Defence secretary Ben Wallace accused him of talking his \u201cusual anti-American tripe\u201d. And the government has confirmed it has shelved controversial plans that were mooted to merge the Department for International Development with the Foreign Office. Louise Haigh, who had previously been identified as backing Rebecca Long Bailey, says that Lisa Nandy\u2019s performance at the hustings stood out: All this Lisa-mania is causing her betting odds to shorten, with Ladbrokes now quoting her as 5/1 third favourite: I think it\u2019s safe to say Tom Copley, a London Assembly member, is part of Team Nandy: Chris Bryant, already declared as a Phillips supporter, is raving about her \u201cimpressive\u201d performance: Seb Dance, an MEP for London, has tweeted that the hustings at least showed that the party\u2019s potential leaders were under no false illusions about the size of the task facing them and that they could provide a \u201ccredible opposition\u201d: Gareth Thomas, MP for Harrow West, also felt that all six contenders acquitted themselves well: ITV political correspondent Paul Brand tweeted that \u201ca lot of wavering MPs leaning towards Keir Starmer tonight after the hustings. But Lisa Nandy also said to have performed well. None of the candidates had a shocker.\u201d To judge by social media reaction from those in the room and journalists talking to them, Lisa Nandy \u2013 who was predicted by YouGov\u2019s poll of Labour party members to be the first candidate to leave the race \u2013 has had a good night at the leadership hustings. Peter Hain said colleagues told him they felt she had \u2018won\u2019: Journalists talking to MPs, MEPs and Lords who attended reported the same. Kevin Schofield, editor of PolticsHome.com said: Jane Merrick, policy editor of the i paper, said that while Long Bailey, Starmer and Phillips were seen as having performed well, Nandy\u2019s was a breakout appearance: Paul Brand of ITV has said that both Starmer and Long Bailey impressed some undecided MPs, but pointed out that the PLP remains \u201cless ideologically inclined to [Long Bailey] and so were a tough crowd to impress: He also tweets that Clive Lewis had a difficult night: Some positive mood music coming out of the hustings from MPs. Darren Jones, who represents Bristol North West, tweeted about the virtues of the candidates before nailing his colours to Jess Phillips\u2019 mast. His name wasn\u2019t on the list we referred to here so that suggests a gain for Phillips from the hustings: Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon and son of the former leader Neil, has already come out for Nandy and is singing her praises on Twitter: \u201cLisa Nandy nails it in PLP hustings: a plan for empowering local communities (based on her Centre for Towns); clear on how to re-build trust &amp; support in our heartlands; courage to make tough choices on policy priorities. Bold, inspiring and crystal clear. #WeWinTogether\u201d. Nandy is saying that the party must sing the praises of its local councils where there are successes taking place: \u201cLet\u2019s tell the stories about what Preston council is doing rebuild the economy, how Plymouth is providing clean energy, how Luton is building homes. Let\u2019s show the difference Labour councillors and Labour in power make.\u201d Adam Payne of Business Insider says that Starmer, Nandy and Phillips have been the most impressive so far of the six candidates: Jack McConnell, a Labour lord who was first minister of Scotland between 2001 and 2007, sounds like he\u2019s had his mind made up by Lisa Nandy\u2019s pitch tonight: Jess Philips has given a strong message on antisemitism, saying: \u201cJewish people were afraid of us governing\u201d, and that she can be \u201ctrusted to fight antisemitism and bullying and harassment\u201d. Peter Hain makes the good point that, as chair of Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East, Lisa Nandy\u2019s strong message on antisemitism has considerable resonance: A half-time verdict if you will from inside the room courtesy of Alexandra Rogers: According to Harpin, Lisa Nandy has said that there was a \u201ccollective leadership failure to acknowledge anitsemitism crisis\u201d and says that party must \u201caccept the Equality and Human Rights Commission in full and emphasises listening to Jewish community\u201d. In an apparent attack on Rebecca Long Bailey, Nandy says \u201cpeople on this stage\u201d didn\u2019t agree with International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism. Lee Harpin of the Jewish Chronicle tweets that Emily Thornberry has backed her rival Keir Starmer over being willing to raise the issue of antisemitism at shadow cabinet meetings: The hustings has turned to the issue of antisemitism, which has bedevilled the party over the last few years. Andrew Adonis notes that: \u201cKeir Starmer the strongest answer in the PLP hustings \u2013 \u2018the job of leaders is to lead &amp; on antisemitism I wouldn\u2019t leave it to someone else but take personal responsibility for dealing with it, every day\u2019.\u201d Although seen as a centrist option, Keir Starmer has made a string emotional appeal to the party\u2019s traditional bonds to unions and other organisations that he worked for in his career as a barrister. Alexandra Rogers tweets that he earlier backed Labour\u2019s union links: As we reported earlier, Jess Phillips is doubling down on her ability to challenge Boris Johnson as a different sort of politician: \u201cYes I would be a different kind of leader, no doubt about it. But anyone who ever fought a marginal seat knows that playing it safe doesn\u2019t win, sometimes you have to close your eyes and be bold. I am the bold choice, its going to take bold to beat Boris Johnson.\u201d Asked about the disconnect between the party and previously solid areas such as Wales, where the party lost seats in December, Lisa Nandy says: \u201cWe need to tell the stories of Labour\u2019s success in power and show we are relevant in people\u2019s lives \u2013 but in Rhyl they feel just as distant from Cardiff as they do from Westminster. We need to empower people and communities.\u201d Keir Starmer also went down well in the room. The Independent\u2019s Lizzy Buchan wrote that: The BBC\u2019s Iain Watson tweets that Starmer stressed the need for the party to become an effective opposition to the Tories: Lisa Nandy\u2019s pitch to the party has gone down well. Paul Waugh tweets that: And Labour veteran Peter Hain said: Paul Waugh, executive editor of Huffington Post, reports that deputy leadership hopeful Richard Burgon arrived at the hustings flanked by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, newly elected MP Claudia Webbe and Nav Mishra, MP for Stockport who was elected in December. His hustings for deputy aren\u2019t until tomorrow. Responding to a constituent and party member on Twitter, Charlotte Nicholls, the MP for Warrington North, makes an important point that the PLP process is different from that involving Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs): For more information on the slightly Kafka-esque process that the party now uses to select a leader, here\u2019s our excellent guide by political editor Heather Stewart: According to lobby journalist Alexandra Rogers, the candidates have been allowed two minutes to make their opening statements at the hustings: Some Twitter banter as the hustings begin, former secretary of state for transport, Andrew Adonis, on just how many elections his colleague Margaret Beckett has endured: While Louise Haigh, shadow minister for policing, seems somewhat less than enthused by the event: Jess Phillips will tell the Labour hustings tonight that they have the chance to elect a different sort of leader who can communicate in a way that resonates with normal people, and who is a big enough personality to take on Boris Johnson. She\u2019ll tell Labour MPs: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the leader of the opposition \u2013 I want to be prime minister. I want to be PM to change people\u2019s lives. I have spent my life in one way or another working to change lives. What I have realised is that I can\u2019t keep moving the dial slightly. We have to get power to really swing the dial and change lives. That would be radical. \u201cI understand that there\u2019s a path that looks safe. But the pathway to being prime minister is much harder. Out of 31 elections since the Labour was created, we have won a working majority in only five. Boris Johnson has got a majority of 80. We run the risk of being completely irrelevant for the next four years. All over the country people have busy lives, with lots of noise from one way or another. We have got to get them to hear us in the little time they give us.\u201d The Guido Fawkes website is maintaining a running tally of the MPs who have publicly declared for the six leadership candidates, and as of around 5pm with 46 MPs having committed, 23% of the party, the total is: Keir Starmer: 17 Jess Phillips: 11 Rebecca Long Bailey: 10 Lisa Nandy 6 Clive Lewis: 2 Emily Thornberry: 0 The prominent names in the party to declare include the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, for Long Bailey (as well as party chairman Ian Lavery); former cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw for Starmer as well as Tracy Brabin, who replaced Tom Watson as shadow culture secretary today; and ex-ministers Margaret Hodge and Chris Bryant for Phillips. Lisa Nandy is backed by Jon Cruddas, the MP for Dagenham and Rainham, who served in Ed Miliband\u2019s shadow cabinet, while Lewis is supported by Rachael Maskell, who was today appointed to the shadow cabinet as employment rights spokesperson. In the Commons Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just finished his speech opening the committee stage debate on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. As expected, he restated the government\u2019s determination not to extend the post-Brexit transition period, which will finish at the end of 2020 (meaning any UK-EU trade deal must be concluded by then). Otherwise, he did not say anything particularly striking, and my colleague Peter Walker sums it all up well here. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Seth Jacobson is now taking over. During his statement earlier about the Iran crisis, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, insisted that Britain\u2019s support of the United States was not unquestioning. Responding to a question from Labour\u2019s Chi Onwurah, who criticised the government\u2019s \u201cunquestioning support of Trump\u201d, Wallace replied: Our support of the United States is not unquestioning at all. We talk to our allies a lot, indeed I said to my United States counterpart about being told in advance, and not being told in advance, I have those discussions. We are friends and allies but we are also critical friends and allies when it matters. During the general election campaign the Conservative party issued a press notice about what would happen in the first 100 days of a Boris Johnson government. Among other things, it promised \u201ca post-Brexit budget in February which will cut taxes for hardworking families\u201d. In perhaps the first broken election promise of this parliament, Sajid Javid, the chancellor, announced today that his first budget will in fact take place on 11 March. No one would normally object to a budget being delayed by a week or two, regardless of what was said during the campaign. But in Scotland this has serious consequences because Scottish councils have to set their budgets by 11 March, and this year they will have to do so not knowing now much cash they will get from the Scottish government. Derek Mackay, the Scottish finance secretary, told the Scottish parliament that this was \u201cdisrespectful of devolution\u201d. He went on: It appears to me that the Tory UK government has given up on the union altogether, in not wanting to make our established processes work. In response, a spokesman for the UK Treasury said: Nothing stops the Scottish parliament from passing their budget before the UK budget. We are working with the Scottish government as part of an agreed process to provide the information they need to prepare their budget. At the spending round, we announced that the Scottish government\u2019s block grant will increase by \u00a31.2bn next year. This is from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, responding to the report that Boris Johnson has told cabinet ministers to cut wasteful spending. (See 2.21pm.) McDonnell said: During the election the IFS said that austerity was baked into the government\u2019s future spending plans. So this looks like a cuts round dressed up as an efficiency exercise with the government desperately looking for funds down the back of the sofa. In an interview before Christmas Dan Jarvis refused to rule out standing for the Labour leadership. But he has finally ruled it out now. Jarvis already has a second job in addition to being MP for Barnsley Central; he is mayor of Sheffield city region. Normally MPs with metro mayor positions stand down from parliament, but Jarvis has been able to hang on to both posts because the Sheffield city region mayor currently has only very limited powers and responsibilities. Rebecca Long Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, has recorded an interview with ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. In it she insisted, as she did earlier today, that she was not a Jeremy Corbyn continuity candidate. (See 11.53am.) But when Brand tried to get her to identify any differences between them, he did not get very far. This is from the transcript sent out by ITV. PB: I\u2019ll ask you again what makes you different? RLB: We are very different people. The reasons I supported him were because I liked his approach to policy making. PB: But how different are you? RLB: We are different in the way we speak, different in tone. PB: How would rate Corbyn as a leader out of ten? RLB: I thought Corbyn was one of most honest, kind, principled politicians I\u2019ve ever met. PB: Out of 10? RLB: I\u2019d give him 10 out of 10, because I respect him and I supported him all the way through. What we can\u2019t ignore was that Jeremy was savaged from day one by the press ... We have a role as party to develop the image of our leader and to put them forward in the most positive way, but we also have a duty to rebut criticism and attacks. As a party we needed to have a rebuttal unit, a clear structure in place to rebut the attacks against him. Labour does employ press officers whose job it is to present the party to the media in a positive light. And Corbyn has his own press team too. Long Bailey is implying either that they weren\u2019t very good (not true, in my experience as a \u201ccustomer\u201d), or that they should have been more pro-active in responding to media criticism. She is not attaching any blame to Corbyn himself for the way he was presented in the media. Brand also asked Long Bailey what she did for fun. She replied: I like watching telly. I spend a lot of time with my family and my favourite hobby is having a Chinese take away and watching box set on a Friday night with my husband. My life centres around my little boy ... making sure the time I spend time with my family is fun for him, taking him to trampoline parks and things like that. UPDATE: Here is a clip from ITV. Turning back to Treasury questions, Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, made what may be a revealing slip of the tongue when he spoke about the government\u2019s plans to hire extra police officers. He said: The government is determined to keep our families and communities safe by backing the police with the resources that they need. And that is why we have committed to finding 20,000 new police officers by the end of 2023 to help keep our seats ... streets safe. When he said \u201cseats\u201d, MPs erupted with laughter. This is from my colleague Peter Walker, who is reporting back from the afternoon Downing Street briefing. In the Commons Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, is giving a statement to MPs updating them on the Iran crisis. What he said at the start did not really go beyond what the government has already said about the US killing of Qassem Suleimani (lukewarm endorsement, combined with a call for restraint and de-escalation) and the most lively opening exchanges came when Wallace clashed with Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, who was responding for the opposition. Wallace started by saying the UK would always defend the right of countries to defend themselves. He said the US had in the past shown restraint when its bases in Iraq were under attack, and he said the UK was urging all parties to de-escalate the crisis as soon as possible. Travel advice for Iran and Iraq has been revised, he said. And he said non-essential UK personnel had been moved out of Baghdad. He went on: As part of prudent planning, a small team has been sent to the region to provide additional situational awareness and contingency planning assistance. Wallace said the Iraqi parliament had voted to end the coalition presence in Iraq. But that vote was only one part of the process, he said. The UK government was speaking to the Iraqi government about what this might mean, he said. He said the coalition was only in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government. He said the UK would be urging Iran to take a different path. Its aggressive behaviour, including targeting dissidents in Europe and hijacking civilian ships, was never going to go unchallenged. He went on: Her Majesty\u2019s government urges Iran to return to the normal behaviour of the country it aspires to be and resist the urge to retaliate ... None of us wants conflict, none of us wants our citizens, our friends and our allies to be put at risk. In response Corbyn said Boris Johnson was \u201chiding behind\u201d his defence secretary and that he should be making the Commons statement himself. He said the \u201cassassination\u201d of Suleimani put British servicemen and women in danger, but Johnson was afraid to say so. Corbyn explained: Isn\u2019t the truth that he\u2019s scared to stand up to President Trump because he\u2019s hitched his wagon to the prospect of a toxic Trump trade deal? Instead, at this highly dangerous moment, we find the government giving cover and even expressing sympathy for what is widely regarded as an illegal act, because they\u2019re so determined to keep in with President Trump? Corbyn asked Wallace if he thought the killing of Suleimani was legal. And he criticised the government for saying that the onus was on Iran to de-escalate. If an American general had been killed, the government would not be telling the US to de-escalate. Responding to Corbyn, Wallace said what he was saying was \u201cusual anti-American tripe\u201d. On the issue of the legality of the killing, Wallace said it was for the US to make its case. But Wallace also said it was clear that a legal defence of self-defence could be made in this case relating to Suleimani going to Iraq plotting to murder American citizens. My colleague Matthew Weaver has more about the Iran crisis on a separate live blog. Boris Johnson likes to adopt a positive, optimistic approach to life and his outlook seems to be rubbing off on the chancellor, Sajid Javid, who has just told MPs that the UK has just ended \u201can unprecedented decade of growth\u201d. Javid was responding to a question from Peter Dowd, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, who asked what the government was going to do about falling productivity. Javid replied: Mr Speaker, we\u2019ve just had an unprecedented decade of growth ... It is only the third time since 1700 that we\u2019ve had an uninterrupted decade of growth thanks to the work of this government. Javid\u2019s claim may well be true, because the UK economy has grown every year since 2010 and this may well be only the third time since 1700 (although the economic data was probably a bit haphazard back then). But \u201cunprecedented decade of growth\u201d implies something to boast about. What has been unprecedented about the last 10 years is quite how feeble growth has been. As this Bank of England chart shows, growth in recent years has been well below the post-war average. And as this Financial Times chart (paywall) shows, this government\u2019s record on growth is worse than any other postwar government. And my colleague Larry Elliott wrote about what happened to growth in the last decade in a recent column. He says that what was remarkable about the 2010s was that the recovery expected 10 years ago never materialised. In the Commons, in response to Javid, Dowd said the chancellor\u2019s claim was \u201cpathetic, absolutely pathetic\u201d and that Javid was just engaging in bluster. He said Britain had had the worst recovery since the Industrial Revolution. Later this afternoon MPs will start debating the committee stage of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. Eight hours have been set aside for debate, and the list of amendments tabled to the bill (pdf) runs to 78 pages. Throughout the whole of 2019 the government\u2019s lack of a majority meant that every Brexit vote was fraught with peril. But given that the government now has a majority of 88 (taking into account the seven Sinn Fein MPs who haven\u2019t taken their seats), there is no need to stay up late to find out whether the government is going to beat the opposition. Ministers always have the option of deciding to accept opposition amendments without letting them go to a vote. But on the BBC\u2019s Politics Live programme earlier James Duddridge, a Brexit minister, said the government was not planning to accept any amendments. He told the programme: Our focus will be getting the bill through as it is. A lot of changes have been made to the bill historically [ie between the version published before the election, and the version published after the election]. So I don\u2019t think the government will be minded to make any changes or accept any amendments. We want to keep this bill simple A large number of amendments have been tabled by the DUP, and on some issues the DUP is lining up with the SDLP and the Alliance party to propose measures that would protect businesses in Northern Ireland from the impact of the plan that would effectively place a customs border down the Irish Sea. When asked specifically about these amendments, Duddridge said that Robin Walker, a Northern Ireland minister, would say more on this topic in the debate tomorrow. But Duddridge also said that some of these amendments were \u201cprobing amendments\u201d (ie, amendments tabled with the intention of provoking debate, not with the intention of being passed into law). At cabinet Boris Johnson and the chancellor, Sajid Javid, also unveiled a plan for what was described as \u201ctough decisions\u201d on spending ahead of March\u2019s budget and the subsequent spending review. \u201cMinisters need to root out any waste, particularly anything that is not aligned with the government\u2019s priorities and demonstrate value for money of every pound of taxpayers\u2019 money that we spend,\u201d the pair told the meeting, according to the No 10 spokesman. The spokesman went on: All secretaries of state were encouraged to go through their departmental spending and their projects, each and every one, in detail, and ensure that there is no waste, and where waste exists, it is rooted out. The project will involve ministers and officials examining all ongoing projects, even those begun under the last nine years of Conservative rule, to both assess them for waste and for compliance with Johnson\u2019s stated aim of spreading wealth around the country. Such campaigns against supposed waste or flabbiness in Whitehall are traditional for new governments, and generally meet with mixed success. David Cameron\u2019s much-touted \u201cbonfire of the quangos\u201d in 2010, intended to abolish unnecessary quasi-government agencies, ended up costing twice as much to implement as planned, the National Audit Office concluded two years later. Declining to give specifics on what projects could be at risk, the No 10 spokesman was asked how Johnson\u2019s war on waste would differ from others in the past. He said: The key point is, this is a new government, it has a new manifesto with new priorities. It was elected on the basis of those priorities, and it\u2019s making sure that we are focused on delivering the country\u2019s priorities. That will mean looking at existing priorities and making sure that they deliver on the government\u2019s agenda. Downing Street has indicated that it has abandoned plans to reshape or merge a series of ministerial departments, and will instead focus on more traditional new-government priorities such as a war on wasteful spending. Ahead of the election aides around Boris Johnson said that a new government would merge the Department for International Development (DfID) with the Foreign Office, and create borders and immigration department, spun off from the Home Office, among other changes. But asked whether these ideas had been abandoned following reports this was the case, a No 10 spokesman indicated this was correct. While stressing that he could not discuss the \u201cmachinery of government changes\u201d, the spokesman hinted that the decision had been taken to avoid the organisational turmoil. \u201cThe PM has set out his ambitious programme to get Brexit done and level up the country,\u201d the spokesman said, citing priorities such as investing in the NHS. \u201cThe government\u2019s focus will be on delivery of these priorities.\u201d Here are some of the lines from the Downing Street lobby briefing earlier. Downing Street said that force protection measures for British troops in Iraq were kept under \u201cconstant review\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: The safety and security of our personnel is of paramount importance. We keep our force protection measures under constant review. The spokesman said Boris Johnson briefed ministers on the situation in Iraq at cabinet. The spokesman said: The prime minister set out the government\u2019s position on the importance of protecting British citizens and interests and de-escalating tensions. A more \u201csubstantial\u201d discussion would take place at the national security council following cabinet, the spokesman said. The spokesman defended Johnson\u2019s decision not to give the oral statement to MPs this afternoon about the Iran crisis himself. Instead Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, will address the Commons. Asked why the PM was not doing it, the spokesman said: The PM leads a cabinet government and the response to events in the Middle East is a collective cabinet response. The prime minister continues to speak to world leaders. He has overseen the ministerial response and will chair the national security council later today. The spokesman said the government had raised \u201cnumerous concerns\u201d about the judicial process in the Cyprus rape case case with the Cypriot authorities. The spokesman said: The Foreign Office will be working with Cyprus and other countries on how we can avoid cases like this happening ever again. The woman\u2019s lawyers have said they are going to appeal the verdict and we will await the outcome of that appeal. We have had numerous concerns about the judicial process in this case and the woman\u2019s right to a fair trial, and we have made these clear to the Cypriot authorities. UK ministers could make provision in areas of devolved policy as a result of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, according to a new report. As the Press Association reports, a briefing (pdf) by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) says new powers in devolved policy areas will be handed to Scottish ministers under Boris Johnson\u2019s EU (withdrawal agreement) bill to ensure it is properly implemented. But the powers will also be conferred on UK ministers, allowing them to act \u201calone or jointly with Scottish ministers\u201d, according to SPICe. It means the powers granted to UK ministers in the bill will extend to the whole of the UK and relate to both reserved and devolved matters. The SPICe document states: The new powers conferred on Scottish ministers are also conferred on UK ministers to act alone or jointly with Scottish ministers. As a result, the powers granted to UK ministers in the withdrawal agreement bill extend to the whole of the UK and relate to both reserved and devolved matters. Consequently, the powers allow UK ministers, acting alone, to make provision in devolved policy areas. Jeremy Corbyn has conducted a mini reshuffle to fill three gaps in his frontbench team left by the general election. Tracy Brabin has been appointed shadow culture secretary to replace Tom Watson, who stood down. Rachael Maskell has been appointed shadow employment rights secretary to replace Laura Piddock, who lost her seat. And Luke Pollard has been appointed shadow environment secretary to replace Sue Hayman, who also lost her seat. Corbyn has also appointed Tan Dhesi as his parliamentary private secretary. Jess Phillips, the Labour leadership candidate, has said she is opposed to holding a second referendum on Scottish independence. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme this morning, she said: I don\u2019t think we should have another referendum on Scottish independence \u2013 53% of the Scottish public in the general election did not vote for a party that was promoting independence. I think that we should be talking about things that are relevant to the lives of people in Scotland. I can\u2019t see a circumstance where I think it would be better for Scotland to leave the UK. Phillips also said she thought one of the reasons why Labour lost in Scotland was that it did not necessarily have a clear position on the two big constitutional questions of the day (Brexit and Scottish independence). On Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn said he would be neutral in a second referendum on the topic. And, although Corbyn did not support Scottish independence, he did not rule out allowing Scotland to hold a second referendum on the issue. In a clip recorded for Sky News Rebecca Long Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, dismissed claims she was a continuity Corbyn candidate. She said: I\u2019m nobody\u2019s continuity candidate, that\u2019s for sure. Tom Watson, the former Labour deputy leader, became the most senior party figure to level this accusation against Long Bailey yesterday, when he said she represented \u201cCorbynism in its purest sense\u201d. Despite her comment to Sky, Long Bailey\u2019s Tribune article shows that, in terms of policy at least, she does want to continue with the approach championed by Jeremy Corbyn. She says: Many candidates in the leadership election say they will not return to the triangulation and Tory-lite policies that held our party back before Jeremy. But we need a leader that can be trusted with our socialist agenda. A leader who is totally committed to the policies and has the political backbone to defend them ... I don\u2019t just agree with the policies, I\u2019ve spent the last four years writing them. Last night the Labour MP Alison McGovern posted this on Twitter. It attracted this response from someone who presents on Twitter as a Jeremy Corbyn supporter. In response, Rebecca Long Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, posted this. The shadow sports minister, Rosena Allin-Khan, has also announced this morning that she is standing to be Labour\u2019s next deputy leader. In a statement the MP for Tooting, who still works as a practising A&amp;E doctor, said the party needed to listen with \u201chumility\u201d to voters who abandoned the party at last month\u2019s general election. She said: It is vital that we restore trust in the Labour party across the country. It is clear that people did not trust us \u2013 we need to accept this fact, evaluate it, and learn from it in order to move forward. We cannot put words into people\u2019s mouths. Our path back to power involves listening with humility to those former Labour voters who have abandoned the party. I believe my life experience means I can help our movement do this. As a doctor, I cannot guess or assume what is wrong with a patient \u2013 I have to listen to their symptoms and investigate the root causes. This is what we must do as a party, and is what I will do as deputy leader. Here is her campaign video. Allin-Khan is the sixth candidate to declare for the deputy leadership. The others are: Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary (and probable favourite); Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary; Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities; Khalid Mahmood, the shadow Europe minister; and Ian Murray. Ian Murray, the only Labour MP in Scotland, has confirmed he is standing to be Labour\u2019s deputy leader. In a statement he said: The next leadership team must turn us into an election-winning machine that uses the skills and talents of all our members and supporters to succeed. To win again we will need to beat the odds, and I know how to win by building broad coalitions of support. The Labour party must change. We must be honest with ourselves so we can be honest with the voters. Looking to the past will only prolong our years in the wilderness and put our country at risk. We must become a credible alternative government of the future, not a protest movement of the past. That\u2019s how we lift millions of children, families, and pensioners out of poverty again. As he sets out in an article for the Daily Mirror, he has four campaign priorities: 1) making sure Labour listens to voters who have given up on the party, particularly in Scotland; 2) being clear on key issues like Brexit and Scottish independence; 3) reforming Labour\u2019s organisation; and 4) having an open policymaking process. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is travelling to Brussels today for talks with his European counterparts on the situation in the Middle East following the death of Qassem Suleimani and the escalating conflict in Libya, the Foreign Office has confirmed. As the Press Association reports, Raab will have a bilateral meeting with the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, before they join their German and Italian counterparts and the EU high representative for talks on Libya. The so-called \u201cE3\u201d \u2013 Britain, France and Germany \u2013 will then meet to discuss the tensions between the US and Iran, with all three pushing for de-escalation, a Foreign Office spokesman said. I have already posted on two of the main lines from Rebecca Long Bailey\u2019s Today interview. (See 9.18am.) Here are some of the other points she made. Long Bailey cited Brexit and antisemitism as two of the reasons for Labour\u2019s election defeat. In her first answer, speaking about why Labour lost, Long Bailey said: We weren\u2019t trusted on Brexit. We weren\u2019t trusted as a party to tackle the crisis of antisemitism. We weren\u2019t trusted on our policies, no matter how radical or detailed they were. They simply didn\u2019t hit the ground running. In her Tribune article published last night she did not mention Brexit or antisemitism at all. Instead, in that article she said one reason for Labour\u2019s defeat was that the campaign \u201clacked a coherent narrative\u201d. She accepted that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership was a factor in Labour\u2019s defeat, but she implied that his unpopularity was down to critical coverage in the media. When it was put to her that Corbyn\u2019s name came up repeatedly on the doorstep, she replied: Of course it did. Jeremy had suffered unprecedented levels of criticism and attack against his own personal character, and he was very resilient throughout. She stressed her support for Corbyn. She said: I supported Jeremy. I still support Jeremy because I felt that he was the right man with the right moral integrity to lead the party. She said Labour lost the trust of leave voters during the election and that all the parliamentary effort focused on blocking a no-deal Brexit obscured the fact that Labour was \u201ctrying to get a good deal\u201d. She said Labour was not \u201cstrong enough\u201d when it came to dealing with antisemitism. Asked if Corbyn was responsible, she said: \u201cUltimately he has to take responsibility as the leader of the party.\u201d She also said Labour should accept all the recommendations of the Equality and Human Rights Commission report into the party when it was published. She rejected claims that she had given a misleading account of remembering the impact of the closure of the Salford docks on her family. Asked about this story in the Sunday Times (paywall), she said: That\u2019s rubbish. People are scraping the barrel. My dad worked for Shell Barton docks, which is a dock in Salford, and that closed approximately around the late 80s and unfortunately we were forced to move as a family, because my dad needed to move to a new place of work, Ellesmere Port, Shell there. And he did face round after round of redundancies. I remember, I was always quite nosy as a child and I used to sit at the top of the stairs when my dad came home from shifts and listen to what him and my mum were talking about. And one particular incident stuck in my mind where he came home and he was in tears because he\u2019d been forced to - he was sitting in a room that looked at the oil tankers being filled up on cameras and it was the same exit that workers used to leave the premises. And he knew that redundancy consultations and discussions were happening and he was forced, as the trade union rep, to sit in that room and watch colleague after colleague walk out of the building with a bin liner full of stuff from their lockers. And he knew that his role to protect them as a trade union organiser and representative hadn\u2019t been fulfilled, and he was absolutely devastated by that. She praised Angela Rayner, her flatmate in London, who is standing for the deputy Labour leadership. Asked what last made her laugh out loud, she said it was probably Rayner, because she was \u201calways coming out with cracking jokes\u201d. Here is some Twitter comment on the Rebecca Long Bailey interview from journalists. From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith From my colleague Gaby Hinsliff From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom From the Bureau of Investigative Journalism\u2019s James Ball From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole Cole is rarely positive about any Labour figure, and so this counts as a compliment. Good morning. At one stage Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, was seen as the favourite in the Labour leadership contest because she is the candidate most favoured by Jeremy Corbyn and his inner circle. But she kept a low profile after the general election, avoiding interviews, and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is now seen as the favourite based on polling showing that he is more popular with members. But Long Bailey has now given her first interview as a candidate for the Labour leadership. She did so after using an article for Tribune published last night to formally announce that she will be a candidate. My colleague Rajeev Syal has written it up here. In her interview Long Bailey mostly struck a note likely to go down well with Labour members. Two of her answers were particularly revealing. Long Bailey insisted that Labour should be pro-immigration. In her Tribune article she said that Labour should never again \u201cput \u2018controls on immigration\u2019 on a mug\u201d, as it did in the 2015 general election, and, when asked if that meant she was opposed to any immigration controls, she said the 2015 policy was a \u201cnod towards quite dangerous politics\u201d. She said: I think we need to have a fair immigration system, but we can\u2019t nod towards quite dangerous politics ... And I understand the reasons why that was done in the election campaign. There are concerns... We do need as a party to make a stronger argument, because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve every set out the economic case as to why immigration is a positive force. Long Bailey said she did not accept claims that immigration depressed wages. She said that, when the UK left the EU, EU freedom of movement would end. But when asked what should replace it, she said that was the \u201cmillion dollar question\u201d. When it was put to her that as party leader she should have a response to the million dollar question, she said it was vital to protect the rights of EU nationals living in the UK. And she added: We need to have immigration to serve our economic needs. This stance is likely to meet the approval of Labour members who, at the party conference last year, passed a motion saying that freedom of movement should be extended (even though quite what this meant has subsequently become a matter for debate). Long Bailey expressed very strong reservations about using the nuclear deterrent - without ruling it out. Asked if she would be willing to authorise the nuclear deterrent as PM, she said: Any leader, any prime minister, has to be very clear that the security and the protection of the people that they represent comes first, above all else, and that they would do anything that it takes to ensure that the people of this country are protected. And I would be very clear on that. When asked if that included using the nuclear deterrent, she replied: Well, if you have a deterrent, you have to be prepared to use it. But I\u2019m not going to be a warmonger foaming at the mouth and saying that I\u2019m going to press a button, because any leader needs to ensure that they assess the situation, they address the consequences of their actions. And of course any country that was considering pushing the nuclear button needed to realise that we were facing nuclear annihilation right across the whole world. But, yes, a leader would need to be prepared to engage in that if they were going to use the nuclear deterrent going forward. This is probably the right answer for the Labour membership too. They will interpret the \u201cwarmonger foaming at the mouth\u201d line as a reference to the former Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, who is much disliked by Labour activists and who stressed her willingness to push the nuclear button during the election campaign. In the early days of his leadership Corbyn did firmly rule out using nuclear weapons, but the party as a whole backs the nuclear deterrent (not least because a lot of union jobs are tied up with the nuclear submarine programme) and later he became more evasive when asked if he would ever use nuclear weapons. I will post more on the interview shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Sajid Javid, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, makes a statement in the Commons about the Iran crisis. Around 5pm or later: MPs begin the committee stage debate for the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. 6pm: Labour leadership candidates speak at a private hustings for Labour MPs organised by the parliamentary Labour party. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. We plan to post a summary when we wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

If so, how? And do the lawyers in the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence regard it as legal?</p> <p>\u201cIf he really believes this was an act of self-defence, what evidence has he or the prime minister seen of the imminent attack on the US?\u201d</p> <p>The US has repeatedly said it launched the drone strike that killed Suleimani after receiving intelligence he was planning attacks on American personnel in Iraq, without providing further details.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the information and intelligence I have seen it is clear that there is a case for self-defence to be made, about an individual [Suleimani] who had come to Iraq to coordinate murder and attacks on US citizens,\u201d Wallace said.</p> <p>Johnson was conspicuously absent from the debate. The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/04/boris-johnson-attacked-for-silence-on-iran-assassination\">has not appeared in public since returning from holiday in the Caribbean</a> over the weekend \u2013 prompting Corbyn to accuse Johnson of \u201chiding behind his defence secretary\u201d.</p> <p>Wallace hit back, saying: \u201cFunnily enough, the prime minister is running the country, something the leader of the opposition will fail to ever do.\u201d Wallace said Johnson believed cabinet members should answer questions where appropriate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/04/royal-navy-vessels-sent-to-protect-shipping-in-strait-of-hormuz\">Royal Navy vessels sent to protect shipping in Strait of Hormuz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wallace also promised to \u201cissue guidance imminently\u201d to oil tankers and other British flagged merchant shipping passing through the strait of Hormuz and said the threat was being reviewed on a daily basis.</p> <p>Defence sources also said that about 50 British personnel had been ordered out of Baghdad\u2019s secure Green Zone, and relocated for their own safety to either Camp Taji, 24 miles (40km) north of the Iraqi capital, or out of the country.</p> <p>Meanwhile, about 20 military planners have flown to Iraq to help prepare for a range of scenarios, from an escalation of conflict with Iran to a full departure of British forces from the country. They were engaged in \u201ccontingency planning\u201d, Wallace told MPs.</p> <p>The deployment means that the UK\u2019s overall contribution to coalition troop numbers in Iraq remains at about 400, with the majority stationed alongside Australian forces at Camp Taji.</p> <p>On Sunday, British forces in Iraq halted their work helping train Iraqi soldiers to counter Islamic State. The soldiers are now focused on \u201cforce protection\u201d \u2013 guarding themselves against potential local reprisals, particularly from pro-Iran militias.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Rob Macaire, the UK ambassador to Iran, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jan/07/iran-qassem-suleimani-funeral-stampede-updates-iraq?page=with:block-5e14bfe38f085eda5c113d2f#block-5e14bfe38f085eda5c113d2f\">summoned to meet the Iranian European affairs minister</a> after Johnson said he did not lament Suleimani\u2019s death and the UK foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/05/britain-sympathetic-to-us-over-killing-of-qassem-suleimani\">Dominic Raab, said the UK was on \u201cthe same page\u201d as the US</a>.</p> <p>Following the meeting, IRNA \u2013 the semi-official Iranian news agency \u2013 reported a foreign ministry spokesman as saying \u201cthe people and the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarded the positions adopted by the British government constitute an alliance with a US terrorist act. It cannot be justified and accepted, and with such positions Britain can be a partner in this crime.\u201d</p> <p>Although the remarks do not mean that British troops would be regarded as legitimate targets in any potential Iranian reprisals, the summons underlines the risks UK ministers take in trying to remain politically aligned with the inconsistent Trump administration.</p> <p>Privately, some British ministers regard Trump\u2019s decision to launch the strike against Suleimani as erratic, but the UK cannot afford to be seen as being out of step with its closest long-term ally, not least when US-UK trade talks are due to commence.</p> <p>Capita, the firm that handles recruitment for British army, said that they saw the highest number of applications to join in a single day on Monday. The heightened interest is likely tied to the possibility of conflict with Iran. Army recruitment traditionally increases when people believe there is a possibility of war.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British warships, helicopters and several hundred military personnel have been put on standby of 48 hours or less for deployment in or near Iraq, ready to respond as the Iran crisis escalates. Tensions in the aftermath of the US assassination of Gen Qassem Suleimani led to Iran firing a salvo of missiles on Tuesday night at Al-Asad airbase in Iraq\u2019s Anbar province, which hosts a US contingent, hitting it at least six times. The backup forces \u2013 including a handful of twin-engine Chinook helicopters \u2013 could be used to evacuate British troops if the security situation in Iraq worsens further. The disclosure of the numbers involved is also designed to put Tehran on notice, with the additional details emerging shortly after Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, told MPs that the UK would respond if Britons were killed by Iran or any of its proxies. \u201cIf British civilians were killed or even military personnel as a result of Iranian or terrorist action, we would look at the response. The response would no doubt be proportionate,\u201d said Wallace, as parliament returned from the Christmas break. Britain has 400 troops in Iraq at present, currently focused on protecting themselves in the aftermath of the controversial killing by an American drone strike that has prompted speculation that Tehran will seek to hit back at western interests. Two British warships are already stationed near the Gulf, HMS Montrose and HMS Defender, which are ready to escort British flagged oil tankers through the strait of Hormuz if required. On Friday, Wallace updated MPs for the first time since the killing of Suleimani, and faced questions about whether he believed the drone strike outside Baghdad airport had been legal. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, asked: \u201cSo does the government regard the assassination as legal under international law? If so, how? And do the lawyers in the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence regard it as legal? \u201cIf he really believes this was an act of self-defence, what evidence has he or the prime minister seen of the imminent attack on the US?\u201d The US has repeatedly said it launched the drone strike that killed Suleimani after receiving intelligence he was planning attacks on American personnel in Iraq, without providing further details. \u201cFrom the information and intelligence I have seen it is clear that there is a case for self-defence to be made, about an individual [Suleimani] who had come to Iraq to coordinate murder and attacks on US citizens,\u201d Wallace said. Johnson was conspicuously absent from the debate. The prime minister has not appeared in public since returning from holiday in the Caribbean over the weekend \u2013 prompting Corbyn to accuse Johnson of \u201chiding behind his defence secretary\u201d. Wallace hit back, saying: \u201cFunnily enough, the prime minister is running the country, something the leader of the opposition will fail to ever do.\u201d Wallace said Johnson believed cabinet members should answer questions where appropriate. Wallace also promised to \u201cissue guidance imminently\u201d to oil tankers and other British flagged merchant shipping passing through the strait of Hormuz and said the threat was being reviewed on a daily basis. Defence sources also said that about 50 British personnel had been ordered out of Baghdad\u2019s secure Green Zone, and relocated for their own safety to either Camp Taji, 24 miles (40km) north of the Iraqi capital, or out of the country. Meanwhile, about 20 military planners have flown to Iraq to help prepare for a range of scenarios, from an escalation of conflict with Iran to a full departure of British forces from the country. They were engaged in \u201ccontingency planning\u201d, Wallace told MPs. The deployment means that the UK\u2019s overall contribution to coalition troop numbers in Iraq remains at about 400, with the majority stationed alongside Australian forces at Camp Taji. On Sunday, British forces in Iraq halted their work helping train Iraqi soldiers to counter Islamic State. The soldiers are now focused on \u201cforce protection\u201d \u2013 guarding themselves against potential local reprisals, particularly from pro-Iran militias. Meanwhile, Rob Macaire, the UK ambassador to Iran, was summoned to meet the Iranian European affairs minister after Johnson said he did not lament Suleimani\u2019s death and the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the UK was on \u201cthe same page\u201d as the US. Following the meeting, IRNA \u2013 the semi-official Iranian news agency \u2013 reported a foreign ministry spokesman as saying \u201cthe people and the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarded the positions adopted by the British government constitute an alliance with a US terrorist act. It cannot be justified and accepted, and with such positions Britain can be a partner in this crime.\u201d Although the remarks do not mean that British troops would be regarded as legitimate targets in any potential Iranian reprisals, the summons underlines the risks UK ministers take in trying to remain politically aligned with the inconsistent Trump administration. Privately, some British ministers regard Trump\u2019s decision to launch the strike against Suleimani as erratic, but the UK cannot afford to be seen as being out of step with its closest long-term ally, not least when US-UK trade talks are due to commence. Capita, the firm that handles recruitment for British army, said that they saw the highest number of applications to join in a single day on Monday. The heightened interest is likely tied to the possibility of conflict with Iran. Army recruitment traditionally increases when people believe there is a possibility of war.",

Part pug, part beagle, his dog Buddy only has one eye and looks somewhat menacing. Which is just as well, considering Buttigieg\u2019s attempts at convincing us of his fighting credentials haven\u2019t exactly paid off.</p> <p>Buttigieg has mentioned his time in the military hundreds of times during his campaign trail, describing it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/17/politics/buttigieg-military-service-2020/index.html\">dangerous</a>\u201d, and bragging about time he spent \u201coutside the wire\u201d. Alas, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/442082-documents-provide-glimpse-into-buttigiegs-military-service\">documents</a> seem to suggest that Buttigieg didn\u2019t spend any time in direct combat during his time in the army.

That puppy, Otis, didn\u2019t make it to see Warren\u2019s presidential bid, having died in 2012. But Warren, ever the woman with a plan, wasn\u2019t going to let that stop her. She replaced Otis last year with another golden retriever, this time named Bailey.</p> <h2>Joe Biden</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"539d9bed6f9046ccabd2d9af95762b9218befe3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/539d9bed6f9046ccabd2d9af95762b9218befe3a/0_73_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\".\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Joe Biden has two dogs, and like any guy trying to rebuild the soul of the nation, he rescued them both. Biden\u2019s dogs are German shepherds named Champ and Major \u2013 although he probably would have called them \u201cMan\u201d and \u201cFolks\u201d, if they were more acceptable dog names.</p> <h2>Mike Pence</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzgEdPDhOs_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brought joy to the world in the form of a video announcing a new addition to her family: a dog. The dog appears to be a French bulldog, an intelligent dog known for its stubborn streak. That\u2019s perhaps an obvious fit for the freshman congresswoman, who ousted a 10-term incumbent without any lobbyist cash (although it is worth noting that concerns have been raised around this breed, as some have trouble breathing). As legend has it, a dog says a lot about its owner. That saying surely holds even more relevance when it comes to politicians. Second only to babies, pets are a choice weapon for politicians who want to soften their image. Their canine best friend holds a special role: to project the image that the politician wants the public to have of them. Here is our take on what the following dogs say about their political owners. Pete Buttigieg Mayor Pete wants you to know his dog is a fighter. Part pug, part beagle, his dog Buddy only has one eye and looks somewhat menacing. Which is just as well, considering Buttigieg\u2019s attempts at convincing us of his fighting credentials haven\u2019t exactly paid off. Buttigieg has mentioned his time in the military hundreds of times during his campaign trail, describing it as \u201cdangerous\u201d, and bragging about time he spent \u201coutside the wire\u201d. Alas, documents seem to suggest that Buttigieg didn\u2019t spend any time in direct combat during his time in the army. But the dog still looks tough. Boris Johnson Boris Johnson\u2019s dog is a Jack Russell with floppy blond hair. They say a Jack Russell is a small dog with a big attitude, which is fitting for a prime minister who wrote a back-up newspaper column arguing that the UK should stay in the EU, then campaigned to leave, pushed for a hard Brexit and asked everyone if they still wanted to be mates after. Justin Trudeau The Canadian prime minister has many things going for him. He recently got a beard, when he roasts Donald Trump alongside world leaders they all laugh, and he has a cute dog. No wonder Melania kissed him. Elizabeth Warren When Elizabeth Warren was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, her students surprised her one day with a golden retriever puppy. That puppy, Otis, didn\u2019t make it to see Warren\u2019s presidential bid, having died in 2012. But Warren, ever the woman with a plan, wasn\u2019t going to let that stop her. She replaced Otis last year with another golden retriever, this time named Bailey. Joe Biden Joe Biden has two dogs, and like any guy trying to rebuild the soul of the nation, he rescued them both. Biden\u2019s dogs are German shepherds named Champ and Major \u2013 although he probably would have called them \u201cMan\u201d and \u201cFolks\u201d, if they were more acceptable dog names. Mike Pence We are aware that Marlon Bundo is a rabbit, not a dog. Mike Pence also has a dog, but that seemed far less interesting than Bundo, who has its own Wikipedia page. Bundo is colloquially known as Botus \u2013 or Bunny of the United States. He has been described as the \u201conly positive thing in Washington\u201d.",

An interactive online map shows the wave crossing the sky, passing the familiar constellations of Orion, Perseus, Taurus and more. \u201cIt\u2019s been a puzzle for decades as to why so many of our local Gould\u2019s Belt star-forming regions lie so far out of the galactic plane,\u201d said Jennifer Hatchell, an astrophysicist at Exeter University who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe previous expanding-ring model fitted cloud positions and velocities well but never entirely explained the fragmentary structure, rotation or the origin of the ring, which required the energetic equivalent of several supernovae. \u201cThis alternative linear structure is just the sort of insight we hoped would come out of Esa\u2019s Gaia dataset, and the team deserve credit for their excellent analysis and visualisation work. It will be interesting to see how this develops as explanations are proposed for its origin and relationship to the galactic spiral arms.\u201d",

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, confirmed that forces in the region were braced for Iranian reprisal strikes, but said the US would prefer a diplomatic solution.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re prepared for the worst.

I was thinking that he came out here to watch me and unfortunately he\u2019s not been able to, so there was a lot more in my efforts this game, doing it for him. I haven\u2019t managed to speak to him yet but hopefully I\u2019ve made him proud. I had a text off Mum but I haven\u2019t read it yet.\u201d</p> <p>During the final session Stokes told Joe Root, England\u2019s captain, he would not be taken out of the attack until he had won his team the game. A spell of three for one in 2.2 overs saw that happen and the 28-year-old admitted: \u201cThe more experienced you get, the more understanding of games you have. I said: \u2018You\u2019re not getting the ball out of my hand here until this day is done.\u2019 It was one last push for this Test match. We have a few days off here so whether that game went a bit longer, I was running in and trying to put everything into every ball.\u201d</p> <p>Stokes celebrated with a hand gesture in which he bends his middle finger forward so the tip cannot be seen, a reference to his father having to have part of that finger amputated after continuing to play when suffering an injury during his rugby league career in the 1980s.</p> <p>The dismissals of Dwaine Pretorius, Anrich Nortje and Vernon Philander sealed victory for England deep into the last session and Stokes said the drama of the final day was a strong enough argument as to why Test matches should remain of five days\u2019 duration.</p> <p>The International Cricket Council has floated the idea of introducing mandatory four-day Tests from 2023, a concept the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board has \u201ccautiously welcomed\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Ben Stokes has dedicated his match-winning performance in the second Test against South Africa to his stricken father, who kept tabs on England\u2019s series-levelling victory from his hospital bed in Johannesburg. An emotional Stokes spoke after his three wickets in the final session led Joe Root\u2019s team to a 189-run win in Cape Town. The all-rounder\u2019s tour has been overshadowed by the illness to his father, Ged, who was admitted to intensive care two days before Christmas but has since been stabilised. Stokes won the man-of-the-match award, having made the decisive contribution with the ball after taking a record-equalling five catches in South Africa\u2019s first innings and then scoring 72 from 47 balls to set up England\u2019s declaration on day four at Newlands. However, the illness to his father, a former rugby league player and coach who lives in his native New Zealand, has kept things in perspective. \u201cThis year can only really go downhill from here after that,\u201d said Stokes. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few knee issues and stuff like that, but this game here I\u2019ve got the three lions on my chest which is such a proud thing to be standing on a field doing. \u201cBut I always had my dad in the back of my mind and that took any injury worries or niggles out of my head. I was thinking that he came out here to watch me and unfortunately he\u2019s not been able to, so there was a lot more in my efforts this game, doing it for him. I haven\u2019t managed to speak to him yet but hopefully I\u2019ve made him proud. I had a text off Mum but I haven\u2019t read it yet.\u201d During the final session Stokes told Joe Root, England\u2019s captain, he would not be taken out of the attack until he had won his team the game. A spell of three for one in 2.2 overs saw that happen and the 28-year-old admitted: \u201cThe more experienced you get, the more understanding of games you have. I said: \u2018You\u2019re not getting the ball out of my hand here until this day is done.\u2019 It was one last push for this Test match. We have a few days off here so whether that game went a bit longer, I was running in and trying to put everything into every ball.\u201d Stokes celebrated with a hand gesture in which he bends his middle finger forward so the tip cannot be seen, a reference to his father having to have part of that finger amputated after continuing to play when suffering an injury during his rugby league career in the 1980s. The dismissals of Dwaine Pretorius, Anrich Nortje and Vernon Philander sealed victory for England deep into the last session and Stokes said the drama of the final day was a strong enough argument as to why Test matches should remain of five days\u2019 duration. The International Cricket Council has floated the idea of introducing mandatory four-day Tests from 2023, a concept the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board has \u201ccautiously welcomed\u201d. But Stokes had added his voice to those against the idea, following on from Indian icons Virat Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar. \u201cI think people are saying it because a few matches peter out into a boring draw,\u201d he said. \u201cThat takes away games like this, which must be awesome as a spectator to be living through the emotions. But being a player on the field, going through the highs and lows of what Test cricket can do to you on a day-to-day basis is just awesome. Test cricket is not made for four days. It\u2019s made for five. It\u2019s called Test cricket for a reason. Change it to Easy cricket if they make it four days.\u201d Though Stokes was named man of the match, he was insistent the award should have gone to his teammate Dom Sibley, the opener who batted for more than eight hours to compile his maiden Test hundred and produced an innings that set up England\u2019s victory charge. Sibley refused to join Stokes during the post-match interviews after England\u2019s vice-captain attempted to cajole him up to the stage with him. But he has since given Sibley the trophy. \u201cSo we are sitting next to each other in the dressing room and I walked in, gave it to him and he put it in my place,\u201d said Stokes. \u201cI went \u2018no\u2019 and put it in his bag. I walked back in and it was back in my bag. I said: \u2018You\u2019ve shafted me once by making me do the interviews, if it ends up back in my spot we are never sitting next to each other again.\u2019 He has got it now.\u201d As for how it feels to be the man who consistently gets England over the line in tight situations, Stokes added: \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing to be a part of with adrenaline.

James Knightley, the chief international economist at ING bank, said Trump could be tempted to expand his tariff war to include the EU, which is expected to see its surplus with the US hit an all-time high for the whole of 2019. \u201cThe EU [deficit] is on course to increase by $8bn,\u201d he said. \u201cConsequently, the EU is likely to remain nervous that President Trump could focus more of his attention on perceived European trade indiscretions in 2020.\u201d However, Andrew Hunter, a US economist at Capital Economics, said it was premature for Trump to declare victory because the narrowing of the trade gap could prove to be temporary. He said a decline in consumer goods imports was likely driven by US retailers selling stockpiled Chinese electronics purchased ahead of tariffs imposed in September. Once the stockpiles are exhausted, imports are expected to climb again. A rupture to the Keystone oil pipeline, which caused a sharp yet short-lived fall in crude oil imports from Canada, also played a part in improving the November trade figures. The annual trade deficit is also expected to be only marginally smaller than 2018\u2019s total of $627.7bn, which had been a 14.1% jump over 2017, leaving the deficit over the US president\u2019s first term much higher than the one he inherited from his predecessor. Trade flows between the world\u2019s two biggest economies have been disrupted over the past two years by the tit-for-tat trade war as both nations have first threatened and then pushed ahead with tariffs on the other nation\u2019s products. While the US trade deficit with China shrank, the deficit with Japan rose to $5.4bn in November while the deficit with the EU declined to $13.1bn.",

All 79 Mothercare shops and 15 Links of London will have shut by Sunday night, after both companies collapsed into administration before Christmas. The latest wave of closures, with 2,800 jobs lost at Mothercare and 350 at Links, comes after a tough festive period for high street retailers when subdued spending combined with the shift to online. Three HMV stores are also closing this month \u2013 Bury St Edmunds, Nuneaton and Fopp in Glasgow\u2019s Byres Road \u2013 while a further 10 stores are likely to be axed if new deals with landlords are not secured, the music specialist has confirmed. The company is also relocating in Lincoln and Plymouth, with new stores opening in both cities at the start of February. Further closures are expected this year as the futures of the fashion chain Bonmarch\u00e9, department store group Beales and camera retailer Jessops hang in the balance. Beales, which has 22 outlets, said before Christmas it had appointed the advisory firm KPMG to look at money-raising options, including a sale. It is widely expected to have to restructure as investors are not keen to enter the troubled department store market in the UK. This weekend will also include the shuttering of the first six closures of the 19 Debenhams\u2019 stores closing this month, which will result in 660 jobs losses over the next two weeks.

Parliament has returned and you\u2019re going to have to say something about the US wet job on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/07/qassem-suleimani-burial-iran-general-home-town\">Qas</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/07/qassem-suleimani-burial-iran-general-home-town\">sem Suleimani</a> and the Australian bushfires.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat bushfires?\u201d Boris moaned, tugging at his hair.</p> <p>Classic Dom sighed. The prime minister was in even worse shape than he had imagined. Best to keep things simple. In his current state, Boris could not be trusted not to screw things up by making a Commons statement that didn\u2019t either end up condoning the American hit job or screw up any chance of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US.</p> <p>What was needed was someone who was too dim to realise he had been thrown under a bus by being forced to defend the indefensible while simultaneously trying to maintain an air of feigned detachment. Under ordinary circumstances Dominic Raab would have been the ideal choice, but now was not the time to send out an angry psychopath who would have happily volunteered to fire the drone himself.</p> <p>It would have to be the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, then. The cabinet\u2019s very own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2014/jun/25/blackadder-namesakes-bbc-first-world-war\">Captain Darling</a>. A man of so many limitations, he has yet to register double figures on any IQ scale. A man with the virtue of mindless loyalty who would regard being used as collateral damage as the highest honour that could be bestowed on him. Darling Darling.</p> <p>So just after 3.30pm, Wallace found himself on his feet reading out a statement that would have amounted to his own death warrant in the previous parliament, but now barely raised an eyebrow. With an 80-seat majority, the Tories have licence to pretty much do what they want. We are in a brave new world where the idiots have full licence to be idiots. The People\u2019s Idiots.</p> <p>Darling Darling does have the ideal voice for such a suicide mission. A dull, entitled monotone that makes every listener forget the beginning of a sentence long before it has been brought to a close. Suleimani had been a bad man, so he\u2019d probably had it coming. And the Americans had said he was going to do more bad things and he saw no reason not to disbelieve them even though they hadn\u2019t been able to offer any evidence to that effect. So when you came to think about it, the US had actually displayed superhuman self-restraint by not whacking him sooner.</p> <p>But the UK was keen that the killing should not escalate into a third world war, and the prime minister had done his best to operate cocktail diplomacy from Mustique once the US had supplied him with the Sky News footage of the aftermath of the drone strike. In fact, Boris had gone the extra mile by WhatsApping a few world leaders to find out what the fuck was going on and he was now urging the Iranians to avert a crisis by acting with more restraint than the US. So sweet. Darling Darling didn\u2019t even realise he\u2019d effectively called the US a rogue state.</p> <p>The Labour benches were almost empty for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s reply. It was sod\u2019s law that the one time the Labour leader had a decent case to make, both about the dangers posed by President Trump and the UK\u2019s dependence on him, it had come when he was a political irrelevance. He briefly stated the obvious \u2013 that going around assassinating world leaders was a dangerous precedent<sup> </sup>\u2013 before sitting down to near silence. Apart from a few jeers from Tories who appeared keen on the idea of mobile death squads taking out anyone they fancied.</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt was also fully deranged. He\u2019s clearly bitterly regretting once having had enough principle to refuse a job in Boris\u2019s cabinet and is now desperate to get reinstated. He had always loved the Donald and was fed up with people maligning him. All that had happened was that the president had got a little bit narked that some Nato countries were not pulling their weight and had wanted to teach them a lesson about what might happen if they didn\u2019t get their act together. Now was the time to remind countries of their financial obligations to Nato rather than giving the US a hard time about one little killing.</p> <p>Darling Darling trundled on obliviously. Everyone could be forgiven one extrajudicial murder. It just mustn\u2019t be allowed to become a habit. And though the killing might not have been legal under UK law, the US were noticeably much more relaxed about homicide and we should respect their traditions. Each to their own and all that. On the whole he would draw the line at the UK condoning war crimes, but each case would have to be considered on its own merits.</p> <p>On the plus side it was only 7 January and Wallace knew his year couldn\u2019t get any worse. Over in Downing Street, Boris was fairly certain that his year had already peaked. Running the People\u2019s government was a piece of piss when all you had to do was remain resolutely out of sight.</p>",

But the UK was keen that the killing should not escalate into a third world war, and the prime minister had done his best to operate cocktail diplomacy from Mustique once the US had supplied him with the Sky News footage of the aftermath of the drone strike. In fact, Boris had gone the extra mile by WhatsApping a few world leaders to find out what the fuck was going on and he was now urging the Iranians to avert a crisis by acting with more restraint than the US. So sweet. Darling Darling didn\u2019t even realise he\u2019d effectively called the US a rogue state. The Labour benches were almost empty for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s reply. It was sod\u2019s law that the one time the Labour leader had a decent case to make, both about the dangers posed by President Trump and the UK\u2019s dependence on him, it had come when he was a political irrelevance. He briefly stated the obvious \u2013 that going around assassinating world leaders was a dangerous precedent \u2013 before sitting down to near silence. Apart from a few jeers from Tories who appeared keen on the idea of mobile death squads taking out anyone they fancied. Jeremy Hunt was also fully deranged. He\u2019s clearly bitterly regretting once having had enough principle to refuse a job in Boris\u2019s cabinet and is now desperate to get reinstated. He had always loved the Donald and was fed up with people maligning him. All that had happened was that the president had got a little bit narked that some Nato countries were not pulling their weight and had wanted to teach them a lesson about what might happen if they didn\u2019t get their act together. Now was the time to remind countries of their financial obligations to Nato rather than giving the US a hard time about one little killing. Darling Darling trundled on obliviously. Everyone could be forgiven one extrajudicial murder. It just mustn\u2019t be allowed to become a habit. And though the killing might not have been legal under UK law, the US were noticeably much more relaxed about homicide and we should respect their traditions. Each to their own and all that. On the whole he would draw the line at the UK condoning war crimes, but each case would have to be considered on its own merits. On the plus side it was only 7 January and Wallace knew his year couldn\u2019t get any worse. Over in Downing Street, Boris was fairly certain that his year had already peaked. Running the People\u2019s government was a piece of piss when all you had to do was remain resolutely out of sight.",

In a leaked resolution drafted by the main political groups and due to be backed by MEPs next Wednesday, Johnson\u2019s administration is accused of creating \u201canxiety\u201d in recent months. The condemnation follows the comments of security minister Brandon Lewis, who threatened EU citizens with deportation from the UK if they do not apply for settled status before the deadline of 30 June 2021. The minister later claimed that his comments had been taken out of context, raising concerns about what the parliament\u2019s political groups describe as \u201cconflicting\u201d announcements from Whitehall. The parliament\u2019s resolution, obtained by the Guardian, further warns: Without a \u201cphysical document\u201d offering proof of their right to residency at the end of the transition period on 1 January 2021 there is an increased \u201crisk of discrimination against EU27 citizens by prospective employers or landlords who may want to avoid the extra administrative burden of online verification, or erroneously fear they might place themselves in an unlawful situation\u201d. The \u201climited geographical spread\u201d of assistance offered to \u201colder and vulnerable\u201d EU citizens, including those who may have difficulty in using digital applications, needs addressing. The application procedure that EU citizens go through should be dropped to ensure that there is a presumption that they will can retain their rights to live and work in the UK. Johnson\u2019s decision to revise the withdrawal agreement bill to allow the independent monitoring authority, responsible for overseeing UK policies towards EU citizens, to delegate its powers to other bodies is concerning. The parliament will also state that the level of free movement granted to EU citizens after Brexit should be a factor in deciding the \u201cdegree of future cooperation in other areas\u201d.

The former German defence minister will give a speech, entitled Old Friends, New Beginnings, at her former university, the London School of Economics, before joining the prime minister at No 10, where they are expected to express confidence about the coming year. Sources close to Von der Leyen said she would seek to privately sketch out the potential pitfalls in the 11 months Johnson has set as the timeframe within which to agree a comprehensive deal. But EU sources said the trip would be the first of a number of initiatives designed to move the Brexit negotiations into a more collaborative phase that avoids the clashes of the last three years. \u201cWe do not want to do this negotiation in public, that is for sure,\u201d one senior EU official said. When the EU\u2019s negotiating position is revealed in draft form in early February, before its formal adoption by the EU27 at a meeting of ministers on 25 February, it will only contain \u201cheadline principles\u201d in order to avoid an early clash with the UK. Johnson has said the UK will not align with EU rules after Brexit, while the EU is expected to make significant \u201clevel playing field\u201d demands on the UK in exchange for a zero tariff, zero quotas trade deal. But the detail of those demands are not expected to be stipulated in the negotiating mandate to avoid clashes when the talks start in earnest in early March. It is understood, however, the demands will closely follow those contained in the agreement made between Theresa May\u2019s government and the EU over the operation of the shared customs territory envisioned in the original Northern Ireland backstop. The EU will seek dynamic alignment with the bloc\u2019s state aid rules and the continuation in the UK\u2019s domestic law of the bloc\u2019s directives on the exchange of information on taxation, anti-tax avoidance rules and country-by-country reporting by credit institutions and investment firms. The UK will be asked to reaffirm its commitment to curb harmful tax measures as defined in the EU code of conduct. In the field of environmental standards, sources said the EU will \u201cat the very least\u201d seek a commitment from the British government that it will not lower the EU\u2019s existing environmental standards in key areas such as industrial emissions, air quality targets, nature and biodiversity protection and environmental impact assessments. EU sources suggested that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, could push for a closer alignment to ensure the UK stays in line with Brussels as Von der Leyen pushes her new green deal. The EU will also demand that the UK implements a system of carbon pricing that is as effective as the EU emission trading scheme for greenhouse emission allowances. The EU additionally wants non-regression clauses in the trade deal on labour and social protection standards. The UK is expected to leave the EU on 31 January. The withdrawal agreement bill is returning to the Commons this week and will move to the House of Lords on Monday. It is expected to be on the statute books by the middle of the month and the European parliament will vote to ratify the deal on 29 January, according to a leaked draft agenda. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe have already provided certainty to over 2 million people who have been granted status through the EU settlement scheme. Our scheme is free, there is plenty of support for applicants and, once the withdrawal agreement bill passes, EU citizens have until the end of June 2021 to apply. \u201cWe have done far more than any other EU member state has done for British citizens, and it\u2019s time they adopted a similarly generous approach.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Back in 2014, Donald Tusk was on his way to Brussels to become president of the European council. At Warsaw airport he bumped into Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2018/nov/14/lech-walesa-wins-the-nobel-peace-prize-archive-1983\" title=\"\">Nobel peace laureate</a> and veteran leader of Solidarity, the Gda\u0144sk-based trade union movement which played such a crucial role in the end of communism in 1989. \u201cBe careful out there,\u201d Wa\u0142\u0119sa warned Tusk. \u201cI worry that the EU will break up, and they chose a Pole so that they have someone to blame.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tusk was heading to Brussels as a passionate European, a staunch defender of what he called \u201cfundamental\u201d European values: solidarity, freedom and unity in the face of threats from inside and out. But Wa\u0142\u0119sa\u2019s words may have been prophetic. Tusk\u2019s two-term stint, which has just ended, coincided with Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, the euro crisis in Greece, devastating terrorist attacks in cities across Europe, the 2015 refugee crisis which fuelled the rise of populism, and of course Brexit. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the US elected Donald Trump, who launched a series of trade wars. </p> \n<p>Now Tusk has published the diary he kept during his time running the EU. The book, which he calls <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hc7QBD1H6pw\" title=\"\">Szczerze</a> (Frankly), is out in Polish (not yet translated into English), and in it Tusk takes us behind the scenes to show how these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/05/brexit-one-of-most-spectacular-mistakes-in-eu-history-donald-tusk\" title=\"\">tumultuous events</a> were handled in Brussels. That Brexit dominates this political memoir perhaps isn\u2019t surprising, but the extent to which it is such a romantic topic for Tusk is. Even Brexiteers are sick of Brexit, but Tusk\u2019s faith that Britain\u2019s exit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/donald-tusks-message-to-uk-voters-dont-give-up-on-stopping-brexit\" title=\"\">might be stopped</a> was unfailing right to the end of the withdrawal negotiations. A master of hopeless situations, Tusk\u2019s skill is to reduce them to simple rules and apply cold pragmatism. Confronted with the global financial crisis just a year after becoming Polish prime minister in 2007, he managed to keep Poland out of recession, the only country in Europe to do so. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/05/macron-was-great-hope-for-centrists-despite-his-struggles-all-is-not-lost\">Macron was the great hope for centrists. Despite his struggles, the hope is not lost | John Lichfield</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And when it came to Brexit it was as if Tusk thought the UK, the home of pragmatism and rational thinking, had gone crazy and had to be ministered to by an outsider. Doggedly he sought a compromise to allow an orderly UK exit, even if, as his diary shows, he dreamed of a second referendum. On 13 July 2016 he wrote: \u201cIn the evening I sent my congratulations to the newly nominated prime minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May. In the coming months I will probably spend more time with her than with my own family.\u201d In the following months and years, Tusk strove to protect May and her beleagured beleaguered ministers from their increasingly impatient opponents within the EU.</p> \n<p>This was a difficult balancing act because as an EU leader he was obligated to represent its interests. In the most divisive crisis the EU has faced, Tusk appears to have fought for both sides: the UK\u2019s interests in Brussels and EU (especially Ireland\u2019s) interests in the UK. Sometimes he had to stiffen Angela Merkel\u2019s resolve and oppose Emmanuel Macron\u2019s anger. Often he used his brand of humour to break down the EU\u2019s dismal newspeak: \u201cA journalist suggests that the EU wants to punish the UK for Brexit. I answer that Brexit itself is punishment enough.\u201d Throughout, he maintained a strong affection for the British, for whom he sees a special place in heaven. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b8c7f621-6eab-4710-805d-4b09f7adfab0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3igAAGxOK_4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On some of Europe\u2019s big challenges, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that Tusk displayed better instincts than other EU leaders. Take the refugee crisis. Merkel\u2019s open border policy was clear from a moral standpoint, but it proved politically counterproductive. Moral victories that lead to political disaster are something Poland is familiar with. What is the benefit of admitting one or two million refugees if that leads to populist victories and inspires millions more to cross the Mediterranean to face populists who have no interest in helping them? Going against what is right to ensure that a worse evil does not win is a difficult choice for any politician. Tusk\u2019s priorities were the inverse of those of most western leaders: first strengthen the borders, then relocate and assist the refugees. Today, most European leaders \u2013 including Merkel \u2013 see things this way.</p> \n<p>It also meant a lot that when he visited the capitals of new member states or eastern European allies, he spoke in their languages: Ukrainian, Croatian, Bulgarian and even Montenegrin. Dignity meant more than money. Many Polish liberals placed their hopes for a defeat of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s populist Law and Justice (PiS) party in Tusk\u2019s return to Polish politics. After all, Tusk defeated Kaczy\u0144ski eight times between 2006 and 2014. But after polling showed that he stood no chance of winning against incumbent Andrzej Duda in the upcoming presidential election, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/06/donald-tusk-tipped-to-take-charge-of-eu-centre-right-group\" title=\"\">opted out</a>.

      "bodyText": "Back in 2014, Donald Tusk was on his way to Brussels to become president of the European council. At Warsaw airport he bumped into Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, Nobel peace laureate and veteran leader of Solidarity, the Gda\u0144sk-based trade union movement which played such a crucial role in the end of communism in 1989. \u201cBe careful out there,\u201d Wa\u0142\u0119sa warned Tusk. \u201cI worry that the EU will break up, and they chose a Pole so that they have someone to blame.\u201d Tusk was heading to Brussels as a passionate European, a staunch defender of what he called \u201cfundamental\u201d European values: solidarity, freedom and unity in the face of threats from inside and out. But Wa\u0142\u0119sa\u2019s words may have been prophetic. Tusk\u2019s two-term stint, which has just ended, coincided with Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, the euro crisis in Greece, devastating terrorist attacks in cities across Europe, the 2015 refugee crisis which fuelled the rise of populism, and of course Brexit. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the US elected Donald Trump, who launched a series of trade wars. Now Tusk has published the diary he kept during his time running the EU. The book, which he calls Szczerze (Frankly), is out in Polish (not yet translated into English), and in it Tusk takes us behind the scenes to show how these tumultuous events were handled in Brussels. That Brexit dominates this political memoir perhaps isn\u2019t surprising, but the extent to which it is such a romantic topic for Tusk is. Even Brexiteers are sick of Brexit, but Tusk\u2019s faith that Britain\u2019s exit might be stopped was unfailing right to the end of the withdrawal negotiations. A master of hopeless situations, Tusk\u2019s skill is to reduce them to simple rules and apply cold pragmatism. Confronted with the global financial crisis just a year after becoming Polish prime minister in 2007, he managed to keep Poland out of recession, the only country in Europe to do so. And when it came to Brexit it was as if Tusk thought the UK, the home of pragmatism and rational thinking, had gone crazy and had to be ministered to by an outsider. Doggedly he sought a compromise to allow an orderly UK exit, even if, as his diary shows, he dreamed of a second referendum. On 13 July 2016 he wrote: \u201cIn the evening I sent my congratulations to the newly nominated prime minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May. In the coming months I will probably spend more time with her than with my own family.\u201d In the following months and years, Tusk strove to protect May and her beleagured beleaguered ministers from their increasingly impatient opponents within the EU. This was a difficult balancing act because as an EU leader he was obligated to represent its interests. In the most divisive crisis the EU has faced, Tusk appears to have fought for both sides: the UK\u2019s interests in Brussels and EU (especially Ireland\u2019s) interests in the UK. Sometimes he had to stiffen Angela Merkel\u2019s resolve and oppose Emmanuel Macron\u2019s anger. Often he used his brand of humour to break down the EU\u2019s dismal newspeak: \u201cA journalist suggests that the EU wants to punish the UK for Brexit. I answer that Brexit itself is punishment enough.\u201d Throughout, he maintained a strong affection for the British, for whom he sees a special place in heaven. On some of Europe\u2019s big challenges, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that Tusk displayed better instincts than other EU leaders. Take the refugee crisis. Merkel\u2019s open border policy was clear from a moral standpoint, but it proved politically counterproductive. Moral victories that lead to political disaster are something Poland is familiar with. What is the benefit of admitting one or two million refugees if that leads to populist victories and inspires millions more to cross the Mediterranean to face populists who have no interest in helping them? Going against what is right to ensure that a worse evil does not win is a difficult choice for any politician. Tusk\u2019s priorities were the inverse of those of most western leaders: first strengthen the borders, then relocate and assist the refugees. Today, most European leaders \u2013 including Merkel \u2013 see things this way. It also meant a lot that when he visited the capitals of new member states or eastern European allies, he spoke in their languages: Ukrainian, Croatian, Bulgarian and even Montenegrin. Dignity meant more than money. Many Polish liberals placed their hopes for a defeat of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s populist Law and Justice (PiS) party in Tusk\u2019s return to Polish politics. After all, Tusk defeated Kaczy\u0144ski eight times between 2006 and 2014. But after polling showed that he stood no chance of winning against incumbent Andrzej Duda in the upcoming presidential election, he opted out. Memories remain strong of unpopular policies his government introduced in 2007-2014, including raising the retirement age. The pro-government Polish media\u2019s attempts to undermine Tusk also counted against him. Tusk had no desire to retire from politics and watch events unfolding on TV. The truth is, however, that he would have had a greater chance of resurrecting his political career in any EU country but today\u2019s Poland. Instead he has become head of the centre-right EPP group in the European parliament. In this role he faces a challenge to his beloved European project which is existentially bigger even than Brexit.

Troops loyal to Maduro had surrounded the palm-dotted national assembly compound in Caracas in a bid to keep Guaid\u00f3 and his supporters out after the president\u2019s attempt to seize control of the parliament on Sunday. But in frantic scenes that spread rapidly on social media, Guaid\u00f3 and his backers were filmed physically forcing their way into the 19th-century capitol to cheers of \u201cViva Venezuela!\u201d Outside, pro-government thugs attacked and robbed Venezuelan and European journalists, including one correspondent from Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds. Inside, Guaid\u00f3 was sworn in for a second term as Venezuela\u2019s caretaker leader, even though the auditorium\u2019s electricity had been cut. \u201cIn the name of those who have no voice, of the mothers who weep in the distance, of the teachers who are battling and the nurses and the students, of the political prisoners \u2026 in the name of Venezuela, I vow to fulfill the duties of interim president,\u201d said Guaid\u00f3, who is recognized by more than 50 governments including the United States and United Kingdom but boasts little concrete power. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s wife, Fabiana Rosales, tweeted: \u201cNow the struggle goes on, together with all Venezuelans we will rescue our country from dictatorship.\u201d The new decade has started with a bang in Venezuela, with Guaid\u00f3\u2019s stuttering year-long campaign to topple Maduro suddenly reinvigorated by this week\u2019s events. Even the leftwing governments of Argentina and Mexico were critical of Maduro\u2019s attempt to take over Venezuela\u2019s parliament on Sunday, with Argentina\u2019s new foreign minister warning such actions would condemn Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heir to \u201cinternational isolation\u201d. Vanessa Neumann, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s envoy to London, said she was convinced Maduro\u2019s maneuver had backfired by reuniting Venezuela\u2019s opposition behind her leader. \u201cGuaid\u00f3 emerges stronger from all of this,\u201d Neumann insisted. \u201cHe has more legitimacy even than he did in 2019.\u201d Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America, said Tuesday\u2019s storming of the legislature represented \u201ca clear symbolic victory\u201d for Guaid\u00f3. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this fundamentally alters the equation,\u201d he added. \u201cThe main problem for the opposition for the last two years has been how to get their democratic legitimacy to translate into real power on the ground. Unless Guaid\u00f3 is able to get the masses into the streets in a way he hasn\u2019t been able to for almost a year I don\u2019t see much changing in the short term.\u201d The coming weeks could prove crucial for Guaid\u00f3, who shot to prominence last January after using his position as national assembly president to declare himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful interim leader. This Friday is the first anniversary of Maduro\u2019s swearing-in, an event many western governments boycotted because of suspicions he stole the 2018 presidential election. 23 January marks a year since Guaid\u00f3 publicly declared himself president. Ramsey said both sides would exploit those politically charged dates to pose as the \u201cclear victors in this conflict\u201d. \u201cBut the truth is that this is increasingly looking like a stalemate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way forward is for the mainstream opposition and the regime to hash out the details of some kind of electoral way forwards [towards presidential elections].\u201d Later on Tuesday, Guaid\u00f3 summoned fresh protests for Friday, Saturday and next Tuesday when he urged \u201call of Venezuela\u201d to demonstrate outside the national assembly. \u201cIt is time to rise up and rise up with strength,\u201d he said.",

The teenager stood motionless in the dock throughout, her head bent slightly as she listened to an interpreter.</p> \n<p>The suspended sentence will do little to allay what her lawyers described as an \u201cincredibly sad and tragic case\u201d for a young woman whose crime had been to report a sexual assault while on holiday in the party resort of Ayia Napa last July.</p> \n<p>The Briton turned from victim to suspect overnight when, in now disputed circumstances, she withdrew the rape complaint after eight hours of police questioning.</p> \n<p>Within hours of the retraction, the Israelis she accused of gang-rape, aged between 15 and 22, with most of them about to enter the army as conscripts, were allowed to fly home.

      "body": "<p>It makes for a dramatic headline, but it is unfortunate that the Guardian has produced such a partial report on what a council meeting in York decided (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/york-to-ban-private-cars-from-city-centre-within-three-years\" title=\"\">York to ban private city centre car journeys to cut air pollution</a>, 1 January).</p> <p>The city tried to ban cars from crossing a single bridge in 2014 and it ended in failure \u2013 not because the idea of banning cars wasn\u2019t a worthy one but because sticks have to be accompanied by carrots or they do not work. Banning cars is the easy bit. But what do you put in its place? Light rail? Biogas buses? A tram network? An electric car hire scheme?</p> <p>York declared a climate emergency in March 2019 and the cross-party climate change committee is charged with delivering a zero-carbon future. Liberal Democrat, Green and Labour councillors are working to transform our response to the climate emergency. The committee has recommended the council adopt a cumulative carbon budget for 2020-30 and a science-based approach to evaluating the carbon cost of our activities, projects, procurement and investment from here on in. The city\u2019s Lib Dem-Green administration is considering introducing amendments to this year\u2019s council budget to enable these proposed changes to be implemented.</p> <p>Turfing people out of cars without producing a viable and attractive alternative is a recipe doomed to failure. Major investment is required and we must take residents and businesses with us. I believe we can. There is no planet B.<br><strong>Cllr</strong><strong> Christian Vassie</strong><br><em>Chair of climate change committee, City of York </em><em>council</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your article on York highlights how important it is for both central and local government to take urgent action to reduce air pollution in our cities and tackle the climate crisis. Transport is the only sector where CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are rising as our reliance on motor vehicles remains at an all-time high. If we are to reduce harmful emissions, we need to make walking and cycling the most attractive option for short journeys.</p> <p>Bike Life 2017 \u2013 the UK\u2019s biggest assessment of cycling in cities \u2013 revealed that 53% of people would like to start cycling or cycle more, but its perceived danger is still a barrier. Initiatives to take more cars off the road would make people feel safer and more confident.</p> <p>However, this is only a first step. To see a significant reduction in air pollution and meet the target of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, the government must commit greater funding to build dedicated walking and cycling infrastructure in our towns and cities.</p> <p>Until we end our reliance on motor vehicles, we will continue to live with dangerous levels of air pollution.

      "bodyText": "It makes for a dramatic headline, but it is unfortunate that the Guardian has produced such a partial report on what a council meeting in York decided (York to ban private city centre car journeys to cut air pollution, 1 January). The city tried to ban cars from crossing a single bridge in 2014 and it ended in failure \u2013 not because the idea of banning cars wasn\u2019t a worthy one but because sticks have to be accompanied by carrots or they do not work. Banning cars is the easy bit. But what do you put in its place? Light rail? Biogas buses? A tram network? An electric car hire scheme? York declared a climate emergency in March 2019 and the cross-party climate change committee is charged with delivering a zero-carbon future. Liberal Democrat, Green and Labour councillors are working to transform our response to the climate emergency. The committee has recommended the council adopt a cumulative carbon budget for 2020-30 and a science-based approach to evaluating the carbon cost of our activities, projects, procurement and investment from here on in. The city\u2019s Lib Dem-Green administration is considering introducing amendments to this year\u2019s council budget to enable these proposed changes to be implemented. Turfing people out of cars without producing a viable and attractive alternative is a recipe doomed to failure. Major investment is required and we must take residents and businesses with us. I believe we can. There is no planet B. Cllr Christian Vassie Chair of climate change committee, City of York council \u2022 Your article on York highlights how important it is for both central and local government to take urgent action to reduce air pollution in our cities and tackle the climate crisis. Transport is the only sector where CO2 emissions are rising as our reliance on motor vehicles remains at an all-time high. If we are to reduce harmful emissions, we need to make walking and cycling the most attractive option for short journeys. Bike Life 2017 \u2013 the UK\u2019s biggest assessment of cycling in cities \u2013 revealed that 53% of people would like to start cycling or cycle more, but its perceived danger is still a barrier. Initiatives to take more cars off the road would make people feel safer and more confident. However, this is only a first step. To see a significant reduction in air pollution and meet the target of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, the government must commit greater funding to build dedicated walking and cycling infrastructure in our towns and cities. Until we end our reliance on motor vehicles, we will continue to live with dangerous levels of air pollution. The government must take action to ensure all cities can introduce changes such as this, and that streets are designed with people in mind, rather than motor vehicles. Rachel White Head of public affairs, Sustrans \u2022 Your editorial (27 December) says that \u201cIn the age of climate emergency the car is no longer the star\u201d. The car has never been the star \u2013 more an asteroid that hurtles on our roads, too often out of control. A significant omission from your long editorial was the annual global strike rate: 1.35 million killed, countless millions suffering life-changing injuries, many of whom are pedestrians and cyclists. Any other machine with this killing record would not be tolerated by intelligent caring creatures. No mention was made of the behavioural changes that overcome some otherwise careful and considerate individuals. Once behind the wheel of their box, they are isolated, feel secure and, with terrifying power under their feet, become reckless toads of our roads. Phase out the car, run trains on our motorways, trams and buses on our A roads, walk and cycle shorter town and city distances. Learn to share again and liberate our urban centres from the tyranny of the private car with all its undeniable ills.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on the US trade figures: The U.S. trade deficit fell to a more than three-year low in November as imports declined further, likely weighed down by the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with China, and exports rebounded, suggesting the economy ended 2019 on solid footing. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade deficit decreased 8.2% to $43.1 billion, the smallest since October 2016. The percentage drop was the largest since January. The trade deficit has narrowed 0.7% through November and is on track to record its first annual decline since 2013. While the shrinking trade bill should provide a boost to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, falling consumer goods imports also suggest a cooling in domestic demand. Data for October was revised to show the trade gap declining to $46.9 billion instead of the previously reported $47.2 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap narrowing to $43.8 billion in November. The goods trade deficit with China, the focus of the White House\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda tumbled 15.7% to $26.4 billion, with imports dropping 9.2% and exports jumping 13.7%. The goods trade gap with the European Union fell 20.2% to $13.1 billion. More here. Goodnight! GW Germany\u2019s stock market had a stronger day than its UK counterpart, with the Dax index gaining 0.75%. Optimism that the US-China trade deal will be signed next week lifted German exporters, says Fiona Cincotta of City Index: The FTSE was outperformed by the Dax, which has more to gain from the US \u2013 China trade talks. Data from Europe\u2019s largest economy has also been supportive with the retail sales, the service sector and retail sales all beating expectations this week, yet the euro has weakened \u2013 good news for Germany\u2019s multinationals and exporters. After a calmer day than yesterday, the FTSE 100 has closed just 1 point lower at 7,574. Back on Rolls-Royce..... it appears that strong demand for customised luxury vehicles boosted sales last year. The number of cars designed to customers\u2019 specifications hit a new high in 2019, it says, keeping its \u201cBespoke\u201d division busy catering for their whims. One customer even wanted flowers sewn into the interior! My colleague Rupert Neate explains: The Bespoke collective at the home of Rolls-Royce in Goodwood, West Sussex, comprises several hundred creative designers, engineers and craftspeople,\u201d the company said. \u201cThese highly talented men and women take enormous pride in fulfilling unprecedented levels of customer requests for bespoke personalisation and delivering on beautiful individual commissions such as the Rose Phantom.\u201d The Rose Phantom was requested by Swedish billionaire Ayad al-Saffar, who asked Rolls-Royce to fill the interior with roses. More than 1m embroidered satin stitches were needed to create a fantasy rose garden interior with an entanglement of greenery, flowers, and butterflies. In another boost to the US economy, growth across America\u2019s services sector has accelerated. The non-manufacturing PMI index, calculated by ISM, has jumped to 55.0 for December, up from 53.9 in November. That shows faster growth, and could mean the US economy is strengthening. Companies reported that activity grew at a faster rate, while new orders and employment kept rising but slower than in November. Today\u2019s US trade figures show that Donald Trump\u2019s tough stance with China is paying off, argues James Knightley of ING. And that means other countries should be nervous, as it could encourage the White House to launch more trade disputes. Knightley says: Looking geographically, the numbers suggest that President Trump\u2019s tough stance with China has paid dividends. Based on the January-November data, it looks as though the US is on course to run its smallest trade deficit with China since 2016 - the US-China deficit looks set to contract nearly $70bn in 2019 versus 2018. However, we continue to see a significant amount of substitution (although not be as much as the deficit with China has shrunk) given the US deficits with both Mexico and the EU will hit new all-time highs \u2013 the deficit with the EU is on course to increase by $8bn while the deficit with Mexico is set to increase by $21bn. Consequently, the EU is likely to remain nervous that President Trump could focus more of his attention on perceived European trade indiscretions in 2020. Ding ding! The New York stock exchange is open. But despite today\u2019s strong trade figures, stocks are dipping. The Dow has dropped by 107 points to 28,595, or 0.35%, as investors worry about Middle East tensions. Construction equipment and vehicles maker Caterpillar is among the fallers, along with chipmaker Intel, and conglomerates 3M and United Technologies. American firms exported more heavy duty machinery (capital goods), cars and consumer products in November. That helped to narrow the trade gap, points out Greg Daco of Oxford Economics: Brian Wesbury of First Trust Portfolios reckons today\u2019s trade data shows companies have moved supply chains away from China, and into other Asia-Pacific countries such as Vietnam and Taiwan. Just in: America\u2019s trade deficit has hit a three-year low, as the trade war with China hits imports. The gap between US imports and exports shrank by 8.2% to $43.1bn in November, the Commerce Department says, down from $46.9bn in October. That\u2019s the lowest monthly deficit since October 2016. US exports rose 0.7% during the month, while imports dropped 1.0%. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics says there are two temporary factors behind the drop in imports: The rupture to the Keystone pipeline caused a sharp fall in crude oil imports from Canada. Meanwhile, the continued decline in consumer goods imports partly reflects slower consumption growth, but it has probably also been driven by the continued unwinding of stockpiling ahead of the tariffs on China imposed back in September. But the White House will still be very pleased to see the trade gap narrowing... especially as the deficit with China tumbled by 15%, thanks to a drop in imports and a rise in exports. Even Sony is taking an interest in the car industry. The Japanese electronics giant unveiled a new concept electric car at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The Vision-S includes a swathe of imaging and sensing technologies, plus AI software and various telecoms and cloud computing services. The car contains 33 sensors both outside the vehicle (to sense the environment and help with parking) and inside (to recognise passengers and respond to motions and gestures). There\u2019s also something called \u201c360 Reality Audio\u201d, to give each passenger a \u201cdeep and immersive audio experience\u201d (in the old days we just listened nervously to the rattle of the ending and argued about what tape to listen to). It\u2019s only a prototype -- Sony isn\u2019t going toe-to-toe with Tesla, and the idea is to show off how Sony\u2019s electronics tech could be used in future cars. Here\u2019s our updated news story on Aston Martin\u2019s profits shocker: And here\u2019s a flavour: The company is pinning its hopes on the new DBX sports utility vehicle, for which it has received 1,800 orders since the launch in late November. It hopes the \u00a3158,000 SUV will widen its appeal to wealthy women \u2013 nearly all its current customers are men. It will start delivering the DBX in the April to June quarter. Palmer said the rapid rise in orders had been \u201csignificantly better than any other previous models\u201d. Aston Martin will also launch an open-top Vantage Roadster in the spring. The firm said it would borrow a further $100m (\u00a376m) within the next four weeks, at a hefty interest rate of 15%, in addition to the $150m in raised in a bond sale in September. It is reviewing other funding options and remains in discussions with with potential investors. According to reports, Lawrence Stroll, the billionaire owner of a Formula One racing team, is leading a consortium that wants to bid for a stake in Aston Martin, which has gone bust seven times in its 106-year history. Morrison\u2019s isn\u2019t the only UK supermarket to struggle over Christmas. New industry figures suggest that the Big Four UK supermarkets all suffered falling sales over the festive period, as shoppers continue to flock to discount chains such as Lidl and Aldi. More here. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is having a more subdued day than the rest of Europe, up just 0.15% or 12 points at 7,587. Supermarket chain Morrisons is among the top risers, up 2.2%, despite reporting that its sales declined over the crucial Christmas period. Sales in the 22 weeks to 5 January dropped 1.7%, the company reports, as it blames an unusually challenging sales period (with Brexit uncertainty, a general election, and a weak economic growth all hurting). So why are shares up? Because things could have been worse! Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, explains: This is a fair set of results from Morrisons, which is not as bad as some analysts had been expecting. The dip in like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) of 1.7 percent in the 22 weeks to the 5th January reflects the exceptionally tough trading conditions in the run up to Christmas 2019 and, in particular, the timing of the general election, which may have discouraged consumer spending. \u201cMorrison\u2019s \u2018fix, rebuild and grow\u2019 strategy has delivered strong results in recent years, but there was a setback in September last year when the company reported its first underlying fall in sales since 2016. This further fall in like-for-like sales will be concerning for shareholders. \u201cThe key to strengthening its position among the big four supermarkets may lie in making more of its wholesale business, which sells goods to McColl\u2019s and Amazon, whilst staying focused on delivering its turnaround plan and managing costs carefully. \u201cA focus on market share and margins looks like it will be the key to success in 2020.\u201d After yesterday\u2019s nervous trading, Europe\u2019s stock markets are recovering some ground today as investors watch for developments in the US-Iran crisis. Germany\u2019s DAX is the best performer, up 1.1%, led by by consumer groups such as Adidas (+2.2%). BMW, which owns Rolls-Royce, is also among the top risers - up 1.7% today. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 index is up 0.6%, as traders pin their hopes on a US-China trade deal being signed next week (Donald Trump says it will happen on January 15th). But the crisis between Washington and Iran, sparked by the killing of Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike, threatens to destabilise the world economy. Oxford Economics says: Signs that global growth may stabilise in early 2020 have calmed fears that the current slowdown in the world economy will morph into a full-blown global recession. Activity data over recent months have mostly evolved as we expected, and some uncertainties have ebbed. As a result, we have lowered our estimate of the probability of a global recession in 2020 to 25% from 30% previously. But while we are a little more confident that global growth will pick up beyond Q1, we still expect the improvement to be steady and unspectacular. Recent economic data has not been uniformly positive, and while US-China trade concerns have receded, apprehension over a US-Iran conflict has filled the void. Investors who trusted Neil Woodford with their savings should take a deep breath before reading on..... ...because we\u2019ve just learned that Woodford and business partner Craig Newman picked up \u00a313.8m in dividends in the last financial year. That\u2019s according to the latest Woodford annual report, released this morning, which shows that running an underperforming fund can still be lucrative. This takes the pair\u2019s earnings to around \u00a3112m since 2014, when they launched Woodford Equity Income Fund -- which was ignominious frozen last summer after a surge of outflows. Hundreds of thousands of small investors are still trapped in the Fund, and face losing at least a third of their money as Woodford\u2019s various investments are unwound. We also have new retail sales data, showing that eurozone consumers have raised their spending. Retail sales jumped by 1.0% in November, and were 2% higher than a year ago. Sales of non-food products were particularly strong, up 3.1% year-on-year. That may show that households are less anxious about economic prospects, as recession fears are receding. Just in: inflation across the eurozone has risen to 1.3%, driven by higher food prices. Eurostat reports that food prices jumped 2% year-on-year last month, with services costing 1.8% more. That might cheer the ECB, as it tries to get inflation closer to its 2% target. But it\u2019s a blow to households across the euro area, who have been enjoying low inflationary pressures. Aston Martin\u2019 is \u201cone of the biggest flops on the stock market in living memory\u201d, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. He\u2019s deeply unimpressed that its share price has tumbled from \u00a319 to below \u00a35 since it floated 15 months ago -- adding that there\u2019s nothing in today\u2019s trading statement to improve its \u201ctarnished reputation\u201d. Perhaps it\u2019s time for Aston\u2019s CEO, Andy Palmer, to consider his position? Mould writes: \u201cThe big question is why wealthy people aren\u2019t buying its luxury cars. Working for this company should be a marketeer\u2019s dream but the team responsible for attracting customers clearly haven\u2019t got the formula right. \u201cAston Martin has previously talked about relying too heavily on its ties to the James Bond franchise. Once the latest film had been released, the hype died down and so did the number of people talking about the brand. Efforts to refresh the brand with more of an emotional angle don\u2019t appear to have had the desired effect. \u201cThere is plenty of competition for luxury cars and it seems that Aston Martin is being left behind. For example, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has just announced its highest annual sales in its 116-year history. Perhaps it is time to get someone new in the driving seat of Aston Martin?\u201d Back on Rolls-Royce.... and its chief executive has warned that Britain needs to ensure smooth trading with the EU after Brexit: Neil Wilson of Markets.com reckons Aston Martin has been forced to slash prices due to weak demand, saying: Heavy discounting when buyers can see multiple models on the forecourt is impossible to avoid. He points out that the strong order book for the DBX SUV means Aston Martin can now borrow another $100m from lenders. However.... This is a drop in the ocean though and for sure Aston needs to raise cash in some way. The bond market looks unpalatable but even an equity raise could prove tricky. The rationale to go private is impossible to resist \u2013 the brand still has the cache to make it appealing. Cat Rutter Pooley of the Financial Times says Aston Martin\u2019s \u201ccar crash\u201d of a stock market float has got even worse. She writes: This morning\u2019s unscheduled trading update is a doozy. Adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation \u2014 the luxury carmaker\u2019s preferred earnings measure \u2014 is expected to be just \u00a3130m-\u00a3140m in 2019. FactSet reports a consensus estimate of \u00a3200m. Adjusted ebitda margins will be between 12.5 per cent and 13.5 per cent. Back in July (another profit warning), Aston guided to a figure of 20 per cent for the year. The list of reasons for the latest profit warning are long. Wholesale sales have fallen 7 per cent year-on-year, with Europe underperforming. Core retail sales increased, but customers needed more financing support to persuade them to buy. The cheaper Vantage model made up more of the sales mix. Shares in Aston Martin have plunged by over 11% at the start of trading in London. That pulls them down to 462p, from 520p last night, dragging the company\u2019s value down to just over \u00a31bn. It\u2019s only 15 months since Aston Martin floated on the UK stock market, at a price of \u00a319 per share. The stock has performed dreadfully since, as this chart shows: Aston Martin is explaining what went (badly) wrong in 2019 now, on a call with analysts and investors (and my colleague Julia Kollewe). CEO Andy Palmer is talking up the prospects for its new sport utility vehicle..... ...while also explaining how Aston Matin has been forced to slash prices: The City is about to give Aston Martin a serious kicking: Newsflash: Aston Martin, another storied carmaker, has hit shareholders with a stinging profits warning. Aston Martin says it that has suffered \u201clower sales, higher selling costs and lower margins\u201d in December, denting its hopes of a late pick-up in demand. As a result, it now expects adjusted earnings to shrink to just \u00a3130m-\u00a3140m for 2019, down from City forecasts of around \u00a3196m. According to my Reuters terminal, they made \u00a3247m in adjusted earning in 2018, so this is a serious slump. Dr Andy Palmer, Aston Martin Lagonda President and Group CEO, says the company has failed to hit its profit targets.: \u201cFrom a trading perspective, 2019 has been a very disappointing year. Whilst retails have grown by 12%, our best result since 2007, our underlying performance will fail to deliver the profits we planned, despite a reduction in dealer stock levels. We are taking a series of actions to manage the business through this difficult period. This will include a cost saving programme alongside a focus on returning dealer stock levels to those more normally associated with a luxury company; winning back our strong price positioning is a key focus. Aston Martin is now pinning its hopes on its new sport utility vehicle, the DBX. Palmer says there are \u201cvery encouraging\u201d signs, with orders higher than any previous models. The secret to Rolls-Royce\u2019s success is that it\u2019s more of a luxury goods maker than a carmaker. So says chief executive Torsten M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s, who told the BBC\u2019s Wake Up To Money programme that its customers approach cars rather differently than the masses: \u201cWe are not really in the car business, we are in the luxury goods business,\u201d \u201cAll of our clients have multiple cars in their garages. It is more that you look for something that\u2019s very special. We are famous for bespoke so you can basically customise a Rolls-Royce to build your own masterpiece and I think that has attracted quite a lot of clients worldwide.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Rolls-Royce is celebrating a surge in sales this morning as it shakes off the malaise gripping the auto industry. Sales at the luxury carmaker have surge by 25% in the last 12 months, to a new record high. It sold 5,152 new vehicles in 2019, up from 4,107 in 2018, which is the most in the 116 years since Charles Rolls and Henry Royce teamed up in 1906 to develop and sell motor cars. Rolls-Royce reports that sales grew across the world -- with demand picking up in North America, China, and Europe. There was also \u201csignificant saes growth\u201d in the UK, it says -- suggesting that Brexit uncertainty hasn\u2019t dented confidence among Rolls-Royce\u2019s monied clients. Rolls-Royce also posted record sales results in Russia, Singapore, Japan, Australia, Qatar and Korea -- a reminder that there\u2019s plenty of wealthy clients around the globe happy to drop hundreds of thousands of pounds on a new car. The Phantom, which costs upwards of \u00a3363,600, remained the company\u2019s \u201cpinnacle\u201d product. But its new sports utility vehicle, the Cullinan (costing a chunky \u00a3264,000) is also selling well. The company says: In its first full year of availability, Cullinan exceeded even the highest expectations raised by its successful launch. The world\u2019s pre-eminent super-luxury SUV has become the fastest-selling new Rolls-Royce model in history. Impressive figures, at a time when the wider car market is under strain. Yesterday we learned that UK car sales fell by 2.4% in 2019, with the industry blaming the diesel emissions scandal and weak consumer confidence. Rolls-Royce, which is owned by BMW, reports that it has created 50 new jobs in the last year -- and also taken on a record number of new apprentices. More to follow.... The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone inflation for December: expected to rise to 1.3%, from 1.0%, still below the European Central Bank\u2019s target 10am GMT: Eurozone retail sales for November: expected to rise by 0.6%, after a 0.6% decline in October 3pm GMT: US service sector PMI: expected to rise to 54.5, from 53.9, showing faster growth",

BP agreed to sell its share in the Andrew and Shearwater fields to its smaller, debt-laden rival as part of a plan to pare its ageing North Sea portfolio. Under the terms of the deal BP will hand Premier Oil the Andrew platform and its controlling stake in five surrounding fields, as well as its minority stake in the Shearwater field, which is operated by Shell. In a separate deal, Premier Oil has also agreed to pay $246m to Dana Petroleum to buy a separate clutch of North Sea assets. The FTSE 250 oil producer believes the fields, which together produce the equivalent of 23,000 barrels of oil a day, should help to generate $1bn of free cashflow to the end of 2023, which would help pay off its debts. Shares in Premier Oil jumped by more than 16% after the announcement to reach 120p a share, its highest value since October 2018. But one of Premier Oil\u2019s largest creditors has warned it will \u201cvigorously contest\u201d the spending spree, which will require a $2.9bn refinancing and a $500m equity raise. Hong Kong\u2019s Asia Research and Capital Management (ARCM) said it would \u201ctake all steps to oppose the company\u2019s proposal\u201d, adding it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that Premier plans to invest in the North Sea basin. The deals are the latest in a long line of North Sea sales totalling billions of dollars in which big oil companies have passed on their older fields to smaller offshore oil producers in favour of lucrative new projects. Premier Oil has shouldered a giant debt burden since the global oil market crash forced the company into one of the largest and most complex debt restructurings in the history of the North Sea. The company hopes to push back the deadlines on its loan facilities to the end of 2023 through a court-supervised scheme of arrangement that would give the company an extra two and a half years to pay back its debts. ARCM warned the plan would raise the cost of Premier Oil\u2019s debts by 9% and that falling gas prices in the UK market could make it harder to pay off its loans. The asset manager has reportedly gone to war with Premier Oil by placing a significant bet against its share price. A report from the Sunday Telegraph says Premier Oil has hired investment bankers from Rothschild to help defend the company after ARCM snapped up 19% of Premier Oil\u2019s debt and built a \u00a3130m \u201cshort position\u201d against the company\u2019s share performance.",

      "body": "<p>The classicist Jasper Griffin, who has died aged 82 of pneumonia, is best known for his work on <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Iliad-epic-poem-by-Homer\" title=\"\">the Iliad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Homer-Greek-poet/The-Odyssey#ref11601\" title=\"\">the Odyssey</a>, ancient Greek epic poems that deal with the Trojan war and its aftermath and are traditionally attributed to Homer. Crucial to Griffin\u2019s work, which helped bridge a gulf between anglophone and continental European scholarship, was a paradoxical situation in which Homer had found himself.</p> <p>In antiquity, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Homer-Greek-poet\" title=\"\">Homer</a>, who was sometimes thought to have lived around 800 BC, was regarded as a Greek poet like any other, only much better. Distinctive features of his poetry, such as a bewildering mixture of words from different Greek dialects and a tendency to reuse entire lines, were thought part of the impressive style that he so masterfully created.</p> <p>In the early 20th century, the work of the US scholar <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Milman-Parry\" title=\"\">Milman Parry</a> led to a new understanding of these features: behind the Iliad and Odyssey lay a long tradition of orally composed poetry. This meant pPoets improvising at speed could draw on a stock of ready-made lines and alternative ways to say the same thing.</p> <p>The alternatives (often taken from different dialects) tended to fill different metrical slots, a sign that the poet\u2019s choices were driven by the metre rather than by considerations of style or content. It seemed to follow that the ancients had misjudged Homer \u2013 and yet one could not help feeling that the Iliad and Odyssey were brilliant poems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c22d70a9d66f1dc446e26daeb9b49ddb91a5916b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c22d70a9d66f1dc446e26daeb9b49ddb91a5916b/55_277_841_841/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jasper Griffin at Oxford\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jasper Griffin was a fellow and tutor in classics at Balliol from 1963 to 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Balliol College, Oxford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In practice, aAnglophone scholars tended to turn their interests to technical aspects of the two works, and the light these could shed on the poems\u2019 composition and the tradition lying behind them. Continental scholars remained readier to engage with the poems as poetry. What was needed was a serious attempt to see where each group was right, and how their insights fitted together.</p> <p>For example, if some words predominantly occur in the direct speeches of Homer\u2019s characters whileand others occur predominantly in the narrative, is this because the speeches tend to contain younger linguistic features, for reasons that should be sought in the poems\u2019 prehistory? Or does the narrator adopt a different tone from the characters, with some words being considered more suitable to the narrator or the characters?</p> <p>In his influential article Homeric Words and Speakers (1986), Griffin acknowledges the oral compositionists\u2019 insight that the speeches do contain younger linguistic features, but then shows that not every linguistic difference between Homeric direct speech and narrative is to be seen in this light. For instance, the speakers use many more words conveying moral judgments \u2013 for example, words meaning foolish, be foolish and folly \u2013 because they freely pass moral judgment on each other\u2019s actions, while the narrator maintains an impartial moral stance.</p> <p>Griffin\u2019s demonstration was convincing because he understood the insights of scholars working in different traditions and saw how each left room for the other. Together with his book Homer on Life and Death (1980), this article helped convince a generation to grapple with the Iliad and Odyssey both as the products of an oral tradition and as poetry.</p> <p>His other works include Latin Poets and Roman Life (1985), introductions to Homer (1980) and Virgil (1986) for the Past Masters series, a guide to the Odyssey (1987), The Oxford History of the Classical World (co-edited with John Boardman and Oswyn Murray, 1986), and an edition and commentary on the ninth book of the Iliad (1995). In it the Greek commander-in-chief, Agamemnon, tries to make amends for his insulting treatment of the great warrior Achilles, who dramatically rejects the attempt. In Griffin\u2019s words, the poem \u201ctakes on a new intensity and a darker atmosphere\u201d.</p> <p>Born in London, Jasper was the son of Frederick Griffin and his wife, Constance (nee Cordwell), who worked as postal clerks. His father joined the navy during the second world war, and Jasper had a peripatetic childhood until he won a scholarship to Christ\u2019s Hospital school, West Sussex. He did not enjoy boarding but thrived academically, winning an exhibition to Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied classics (1956-60), graduating with first-class honours. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b7c1f02cf8692be387edcfadaef3d014fd0fd0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b7c1f02cf8692be387edcfadaef3d014fd0fd0c/0_74_1723_1034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Achilles confronting Agamemnon in a scene from the Iliad, shown on a mosaic from Pompeii.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Achilles confronting Agamemnon in a scene from the Iliad, shown on a mosaic from Pompeii.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Historic Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On doing so he married <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/19/miriam-griffin-obituary\" title=\"\">Miriam Dressler</a>, a scholar of ancient history from a New York Jewish family. She became a fellow and tutor at Somerville College, Oxford, an authority on Cicero and Nero, and the world expert on the Roman philosopher Seneca.</p> <p>Griffin was actively involved in parenting their three daughters, a responsibility he took seriously in a distinctive fashion. On becoming a father, he purchased texts of the major English authors because \u201cthe baby would expect it\u201d.</p> <p>He belonged to a generation of academics for whom doctorates were optional, and he did not opt for one. Instead he held research fellowships at Harvard (1960-61) and Balliol (1961-63), and then became a fellow and tutor in classics at Balliol (1963-2004). The university conferred on him the titles of reader in 1990 and professor in 1992.</p> <p>He also served as TS Eliot memorial lecturer at the University of Kent in 1984; those lectures were later published as The Mirror of Myth (1986).

      "bodyText": "The classicist Jasper Griffin, who has died aged 82 of pneumonia, is best known for his work on the Iliad and the Odyssey, ancient Greek epic poems that deal with the Trojan war and its aftermath and are traditionally attributed to Homer. Crucial to Griffin\u2019s work, which helped bridge a gulf between anglophone and continental European scholarship, was a paradoxical situation in which Homer had found himself. In antiquity, Homer, who was sometimes thought to have lived around 800 BC, was regarded as a Greek poet like any other, only much better. Distinctive features of his poetry, such as a bewildering mixture of words from different Greek dialects and a tendency to reuse entire lines, were thought part of the impressive style that he so masterfully created. In the early 20th century, the work of the US scholar Milman Parry led to a new understanding of these features: behind the Iliad and Odyssey lay a long tradition of orally composed poetry. This meant pPoets improvising at speed could draw on a stock of ready-made lines and alternative ways to say the same thing. The alternatives (often taken from different dialects) tended to fill different metrical slots, a sign that the poet\u2019s choices were driven by the metre rather than by considerations of style or content. It seemed to follow that the ancients had misjudged Homer \u2013 and yet one could not help feeling that the Iliad and Odyssey were brilliant poems. In practice, aAnglophone scholars tended to turn their interests to technical aspects of the two works, and the light these could shed on the poems\u2019 composition and the tradition lying behind them. Continental scholars remained readier to engage with the poems as poetry. What was needed was a serious attempt to see where each group was right, and how their insights fitted together. For example, if some words predominantly occur in the direct speeches of Homer\u2019s characters whileand others occur predominantly in the narrative, is this because the speeches tend to contain younger linguistic features, for reasons that should be sought in the poems\u2019 prehistory? Or does the narrator adopt a different tone from the characters, with some words being considered more suitable to the narrator or the characters? In his influential article Homeric Words and Speakers (1986), Griffin acknowledges the oral compositionists\u2019 insight that the speeches do contain younger linguistic features, but then shows that not every linguistic difference between Homeric direct speech and narrative is to be seen in this light. For instance, the speakers use many more words conveying moral judgments \u2013 for example, words meaning foolish, be foolish and folly \u2013 because they freely pass moral judgment on each other\u2019s actions, while the narrator maintains an impartial moral stance. Griffin\u2019s demonstration was convincing because he understood the insights of scholars working in different traditions and saw how each left room for the other. Together with his book Homer on Life and Death (1980), this article helped convince a generation to grapple with the Iliad and Odyssey both as the products of an oral tradition and as poetry. His other works include Latin Poets and Roman Life (1985), introductions to Homer (1980) and Virgil (1986) for the Past Masters series, a guide to the Odyssey (1987), The Oxford History of the Classical World (co-edited with John Boardman and Oswyn Murray, 1986), and an edition and commentary on the ninth book of the Iliad (1995). In it the Greek commander-in-chief, Agamemnon, tries to make amends for his insulting treatment of the great warrior Achilles, who dramatically rejects the attempt. In Griffin\u2019s words, the poem \u201ctakes on a new intensity and a darker atmosphere\u201d. Born in London, Jasper was the son of Frederick Griffin and his wife, Constance (nee Cordwell), who worked as postal clerks. His father joined the navy during the second world war, and Jasper had a peripatetic childhood until he won a scholarship to Christ\u2019s Hospital school, West Sussex. He did not enjoy boarding but thrived academically, winning an exhibition to Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied classics (1956-60), graduating with first-class honours. On doing so he married Miriam Dressler, a scholar of ancient history from a New York Jewish family. She became a fellow and tutor at Somerville College, Oxford, an authority on Cicero and Nero, and the world expert on the Roman philosopher Seneca. Griffin was actively involved in parenting their three daughters, a responsibility he took seriously in a distinctive fashion. On becoming a father, he purchased texts of the major English authors because \u201cthe baby would expect it\u201d. He belonged to a generation of academics for whom doctorates were optional, and he did not opt for one. Instead he held research fellowships at Harvard (1960-61) and Balliol (1961-63), and then became a fellow and tutor in classics at Balliol (1963-2004). The university conferred on him the titles of reader in 1990 and professor in 1992. He also served as TS Eliot memorial lecturer at the University of Kent in 1984; those lectures were later published as The Mirror of Myth (1986). He was elected fellow of the British Academy in 1986. From 1992 until 2004 Griffin also served as public orator, composing speeches for Oxford\u2019s honorary degrees. After Miriam died in 2018, he was able to continue living in his home with the support of his daughters, Julia, Miranda and Tamara. He is survived by them and his granddaughter, Zuzana. \u2022 Jasper Griffin, classicist, born 29 May 1937; died 22 November 2019",

In a sense, though, the formidable show of unity is no surprise.

When Isis approached the Iranian border after taking over swaths of territory in neighbouring Iraq in 2014, the Quds force were at the forefront, representing the only country willing to commit boots on the ground in the fight to destroy the group. While many in the region viewed Suleimani as a deeply controversial figure, to put it mildly, a significant number of Iranians, Kurds and Iraqis saw him as having been pivotal in stopping Islamic State.</p> <p>At home, this popularity cut across political lines. Becoming a battle hero is one way to win broad legitimacy, and so it has proved in death as in life. The killing of one of their country\u2019s most senior officials is perceived by Iranians as a violation of sovereignty, and the rally-around-the-flag effect has been notable.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean all Iranians condoned Suleimani\u2019s actions abroad.

      "bodyText": "For Iranians, the assassination of Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s notorious Quds force, was a profound upset. Suleimani was one of the most influential and powerful men in the Islamic Republic of Iran. He had more sway than the president, spoke to all the various factions, and had a direct line to the supreme leader. Most importantly, he was popular with the general public. One poll, taken as the fight against Islamic State raged, found that 73% of Iranians had a favourable opinion of him. Even so, the large crowds that have turned out on the streets of cities across the country have exceeded predictions. In a sense, though, the formidable show of unity is no surprise. Iran \u2013 like any other country \u2013 is proud, patriotic, and its people tend to put their differences aisde when faced with an outside enemy. Suleimani oversaw Iran\u2019s regional policy, and as a result is regarded as having spent his lifetime defending his country. When Isis approached the Iranian border after taking over swaths of territory in neighbouring Iraq in 2014, the Quds force were at the forefront, representing the only country willing to commit boots on the ground in the fight to destroy the group. While many in the region viewed Suleimani as a deeply controversial figure, to put it mildly, a significant number of Iranians, Kurds and Iraqis saw him as having been pivotal in stopping Islamic State. At home, this popularity cut across political lines. Becoming a battle hero is one way to win broad legitimacy, and so it has proved in death as in life. The killing of one of their country\u2019s most senior officials is perceived by Iranians as a violation of sovereignty, and the rally-around-the-flag effect has been notable. That doesn\u2019t mean all Iranians condoned Suleimani\u2019s actions abroad. In fact, for years people have been complaining about the extent to which the government has seemed to be occupied elsewhere, even as the internal situation deteriorated. In 2018, chants of \u201cno to Gaza, no to Lebanon, I give my life for Iran\u201d and \u201cLeave Syria and think of us\u201d echoed (not for the first time) at protests around the country. When economic times have been hard due to sanctions, both prior to the 2015 nuclear deal and today, Iranians find it difficult to understand why their rulers pour money into the region rather than using it in Iran. Ordinary people continue to be squeezed by Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, with no prospects for improvement. This, along with general discontent, led to significant protests in November 2019. These caught the government off guard, but didn\u2019t prevent it swiftly crushing the demonstrations and enacting a nationwide ban on the internet that lasted five days. That response, unsurprisingly, further entrenched the discontent. Trump\u2019s killing of Suleimani, however, has put those concerns on the back burner. Instead, Iranians have adopted a \u201cbetter the devil you know\u201d approach: unifying across the spectrum, even to the point of standing behind their government, in order to resist increasing US aggression. And this means that, while Suleimani\u2019s loss is a significant blow for Iran, the strike by the US was in one sense a gift to the Iranian government. It could never have dreamed of achieving such unity in difficult times otherwise. The assassination has also had the effect of bringing together a divided elite, at least for the time being. Leading figures from the conservative and reformist camps spoke in unison, from the supreme leader, who vowed \u201crevenge\u201d, to the former presidential candidate and leader of the Green movement, Mehdi Karroubi, still under house arrest, who reportedly expressed his condolences. Even the former foreign minister of Iran under the shah, Ardeshir Zahedi, described Suleimani as a \u201cpatriotic and honorable soldier who was a son of Iran\u201d.

Who in the political establishment can expend political capital suggesting rapprochement with the US after what it has done and, importantly, after the level of public mourning? The answer is easy: no one. With the killing of Suleimani, Trump has accomplished what no one in the Iranian elite thought possible: he has united a fractured, exhausted and desperate Iranian public in a show of unity. And while these scenes are very far from an equivocal statement of support for the Islamic Republic, they are a resounding message to the world: Iranians will stand with their government in the face of external threats. \u2022 Dina Esfandiary is a fellow at the Century Foundation and co-author of Triple-Axis: Iran\u2019s Relations with Russia and China",

Richard, a British man, is talking to a Nigerian poet called Okeoma about his interest in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo-Ukwu\">Igbo-Ukwu</a> artefacts.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been fascinated by the bronzes since I first read about them,\u201d says the eager and enthusiastic white writer. \u201cThe details are stunning. It\u2019s quite incredible that these people had perfected the complicated art of lost-wax during the time of the Viking raids. There is such marvellous complexity in the bronzes, just marvellous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sound surprised,\u201d Okeoma replies. And when Richard says \u201cwhat?\u201d, he goes on: \u201cYou sound surprised as if you ever imagined <em>these people</em> capable of such things.\u201d</p> <p>Richard, who has been eating hot pepper soup, can feel himself burning up both literally and metaphorically. He doesn\u2019t just care about the bronzes. He is in love with an Igbo woman. He has learned the local language. Later, he will long to be accepted as a Biafran. But hasn\u2019t he here just revealed himself to have the condescension and arrogance of the British colonial mindset? Has he been thinking of <em>these people</em> as somehow lesser than himself?</p> <p>Maybe. It\u2019s typical of this fine novel that the scenario isn\u2019t entirely black and white. When Richard later mulls over the conversation, he decides that Okeoma is wrong to think him condescending:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was the look in Okeoma\u2019s eyes that worried him the most: a disdainful distrust that made him think of reading somewhere that the African and the European would always be irreconcilable. It was wrong of Okeoma to assume that he was one of those Englishmen who did not give the African the benefit of an equal intelligence. Perhaps he had sounded surprised, now that he thought of it, but it was the same surprise he would express if a similar discovery were made in England or anywhere else in the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>Richard can perhaps wriggle off the hook. Even so, this is a passage that caused me some uncomfortable self-reflection as well.</p> <p><a href=\"http://100photos.time.com/photos/don-mccullin-albino-boy-biafra\">The most famous images of the Biafran war</a> were of children with distended bellies and haunting eyes, most often lining up at refugee centres and feeding stations. They are tragic and moving, but also thankfully far removed from the experience and domestic lives of most of Richard\u2019s compatriots \u2013 which is to say, a reader like myself. But Half of a Yellow Sun starts in the early 1960s, a few years before the Biafran war even began, when the characters are leading lives that also seem far removed from the skeletons that stare out of those 50-year-old photographs. They are academics, writers and industrialists; smart and vigorous people, who live lives of \u201cmarvellous complexity\u201d. Their high-powered professional lives are complemented by raucous, brandy-fuelled parties, witty conversation, leftist politics and tangled love affairs. They inhabit a rarefied, comfortable world that put me in mind of Iris Murdoch and the campus novels of David Lodge and Malcolm Bradbury.</p> <p>But if those sound like surprising comparisons for a book describing the eve of the Biafran war, then you have to ask yourself why. The challenge that Okeoma gives Richard might also be applied to readers of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s novel.</p> <p>Even with conflict seeming not as distant from us as we might like to hope, it feels crude to draw too many modern parallels with the complete world that Adichie describes, and its unique circumstances. Just as much sets the novel far apart from our contemporary circumstances, and those 1960s novels about British intellectuals. There\u2019s the fact that Ugwu, one of the lead characters, is a \u201chouse boy\u201d, a servant who only becomes fully literate because his \u201cmaster\u201d sends him to school. There\u2019s the long shadow of colonialism and all the faultlines, inequalities and resentments caused by British rule. </p> <p>And there\u2019s the knowledge that the society Adichie describes so vividly is on the edge of catastrophe. Everything we read, we read in the knowledge of those horrifying photos and the war that must follow. It gives a brightness and urgency to these early pages, their significance and emotional impact heightened by the knowledge that this sophisticated society will soon be blown to smithereens \u2026 But more on that, next week.</p>",

Their high-powered professional lives are complemented by raucous, brandy-fuelled parties, witty conversation, leftist politics and tangled love affairs. They inhabit a rarefied, comfortable world that put me in mind of Iris Murdoch and the campus novels of David Lodge and Malcolm Bradbury. But if those sound like surprising comparisons for a book describing the eve of the Biafran war, then you have to ask yourself why. The challenge that Okeoma gives Richard might also be applied to readers of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s novel. Even with conflict seeming not as distant from us as we might like to hope, it feels crude to draw too many modern parallels with the complete world that Adichie describes, and its unique circumstances. Just as much sets the novel far apart from our contemporary circumstances, and those 1960s novels about British intellectuals. There\u2019s the fact that Ugwu, one of the lead characters, is a \u201chouse boy\u201d, a servant who only becomes fully literate because his \u201cmaster\u201d sends him to school. There\u2019s the long shadow of colonialism and all the faultlines, inequalities and resentments caused by British rule. And there\u2019s the knowledge that the society Adichie describes so vividly is on the edge of catastrophe. Everything we read, we read in the knowledge of those horrifying photos and the war that must follow. It gives a brightness and urgency to these early pages, their significance and emotional impact heightened by the knowledge that this sophisticated society will soon be blown to smithereens \u2026 But more on that, next week.",

      "bodyText": "The Conservative mayor of the West Midlands has told Boris Johnson cancelling HS2 would fail the new Tory voters who returned him to No 10 last month believing he would bring prosperity to their region. As the government prepares to publish a review into the future of the high-speed railway line, Andy Street said abandoning the project would deliver a \u201chammer blow\u201d to the West Midlands from which it could take a decade to recover. Street was a member of the panel on the Oakervee review into HS2, which has been submitted to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary. A leaked early draft last year suggested the recommendation would be to press ahead with HS2 with some running costs scaled back. However, the review\u2019s deputy, Lord Berkeley, published his own dissenting assessment last week claiming costs had risen to \u00a3108bn \u2013 more than double the original estimated amount. With political pressure on Johnson to reduce spending on the project, Street told the prime minister the railway line was \u201cmission critical\u201d to the West Midlands. \u201cSince reviewing all the evidence, my position has only hardened \u2013 HS2 could make or break the future of the West Midlands,\u201d he said, highlighting the thousands of jobs that had already been created by the project. \u201cIf HS2 does not go ahead, I fear the West Midlands economy will suffer a hammer blow from which it might take decades to recover. Moreover, residents across the region, many of whom voted Conservative in last month\u2019s general election, are all too aware of this. \u201cThe prime minister helped build his 80-seat majority in part thanks to a huge swathe of new voters in the West Midlands. They are now expecting him to deliver on his promise to rebalance the economy and power up our region. The first clear and decisive step that can be taken to fulfil that promise is to back HS2.\u201d Street acknowledged the government needed to \u201cget a grip of both the costs and timeline\u201d and inject some more \u201cvision\u201d, such as by linking the line to Eurostar, but insisted these issues could be rectified.

What he said at the start did not really go beyond what the UK government has already said about the UK killing of Qassem Suleimani (lukewarm endorsement, combined with a call for restraint and de-escalation) and the most lively opening exchanges came when Wallace clashed with <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong>, the Labour leader, who was responding for the opposition.</p> \n  <p>Wallace started by saying the UK would always defend the right of countries to defend themselves. He said the US had in the past shown restraint when its bases in Iraq were under attack, and he said the UK was urging all parties to de-escalate the crisis as soon as possible.</p> \n  <p>Travel advice for Iran and Iraq has been revised, he said. And he said non-essential UK personnel had been moved out of Baghdad. He continued:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As part of prudent planning, a small team has been sent to the region to provide additional situational awareness and contingency planning assistance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wallace said the Iraqi parliament had voted to end the coalition presence in Iraq. But that vote was only one part of the process, he said. The UK government was speaking to the Iraqi government about what this might mean, he said. He said the coalition was only in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government.</p> \n  <p>He said the UK would be urging Iran to take a different path. Its aggressive behaviour, including targeting dissidents in Europe and hijacking civilian ships, was never going to go unchallenged. He continued:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Her Majesty\u2019s government urges Iran to return to the normal behaviour of the country it aspires to be and resist the urge to retaliate \u2026 None of us wants conflict, none of us wants our citizens, our friends and our allies to be put at risk.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In response, Corbyn said that Boris Johnson was \u201chiding behind\u201d his defence secretary and that he should be making the Commons statement himself. He said the \u201cassassination\u201d of Suleimani put British servicemen and women in danger, but Johnson was afraid to say so. Corbyn explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Isn\u2019t the truth that he\u2019s scared to stand up to President Trump because he\u2019s hitched his wagon to the prospect of a toxic Trump trade deal?</p> \n   <p>Instead, at this highly dangerous moment, we find the government giving cover and even expressing sympathy for what is widely regarded as an illegal act, because they\u2019re so determined to keep in with President Trump?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Corbyn asked Wallace if he thought the killing of Suleimani was legal. And he criticised the government for saying that the onus was on Iran to de-escalate. If an American general had been killed, the government would not be telling the US to de-escalate, Corbyn said.<br></p> \n  <p>Responding to Corbyn, Wallace said what he was saying was \u201cusual anti-American tripe\u201d.</p> \n  <p>On the issue of the legality of the killing, Wallace said that it was for the US to make its case. But Wallace also said it was clear that a legal defence of self-defence could be made in this case relating to Suleimani going to Iraq plotting to murder American citizens.</p> \n  <p>There is more coverage of the statement on our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/07/labour-leadership-long-bailey-adopts-pro-immigration-stance-as-she-launches-campaign-with-today-interview-live-news\">UK politics live blog.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T16:32:30.276Z\">at 4.32pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e14a5c98f087e8308e6a253\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T15:40:01.357Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In his 13-minute exchange with reporters, Pompeo offered no further evidence that Suleimani posed a direct threat to US lives.</p> \n  <p>This is what he said when challenged about the imminence of the threat the Iranian military commander posed:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any time a president makes a decision of this magnitude there are multiple pieces of information that come before us.

We know what happened at the end of last year in December ultimately leading to the death of an American. So if you are looking for imminence you need look no further than the days that led up to the strike that was taken against Suleimani. </p> \n   <p>In addition to that, you have what we could clearly see were continuing efforts on behalf of this terrorists to build out a network of campaign activities that were going to lead, potentially, to the death of many more Americans. It was the right decision. We got it right. The Department of Defense did excellent work and the president had an entirely legal, appropriate basis, as well as a decision that fit perfectly within our strategy in how to counter the threat of malign activity from Iran more broadly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"72599bf2-efe9-4b98-9960-6f038789fefe\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RHN38HVPSQ4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T19:07:23.211Z\">at 7.07pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e14a2628f087e8308e6a20b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T15:24:17.557Z\">3.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Would you push back against Trump hitting cultural sites in Iran?</em></p> \n  <p>\u201cEvery action we take will be consistent with international law,\u201d Pompeo said. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e14a2408f087e8308e6a207\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T15:23:05.915Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cI know the strike saved American lives, I\u2019m confident about that,\u201d Pompeo said. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e14a1618f087e8308e6a1fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-07T15:20:52.409Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Were lawyers consulted about the attack on Suleimani?</em></p> \n  <p>We never act without full legal vetting, Pompeo said.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a closing summary of today\u2019s events: More than 50 people have been killed in a crush in the south-eastern Iranian city of Kerman, where hundreds of thousands of mourners gathered for the burial of the military commander Qassem Suleimani. State media said 56 people had been killed and 213 injured. Suleimani\u2019s burial has been postponed due to the size of the crowd. It comes a day after Iranian police said millions gathered to mourn Suleimani in Tehran, in the largest turnout since the 1989 funeral of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo has again defended the killing of Suleimani but provided no new evidence to support the US claim that the general posed a direct threat to US lives. At a press conference he accused Iran of propaganda by claiming Suleimani was in Baghdad on a diplomatic mission. Pompeo also said he was \u201cconfident\u201d that lawyers were consulted before Donald Trump ordered the strike. The UK\u2019s ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, has been summoned by Iran\u2019s foreign ministry and warned against siding with the US over the attack. Macaire was also told to convey a message to London that UK should not be a \u201cpartner in this crime\u201d. Iranian military forces have said they are prepared to use medium- to long-range missiles to attack US bases in the Middle East, in revenge for the assassination of Suleimani. The secretary of Iran\u2019s national security council, Ali Shamkhani, said: \u201cThe 27 US bases that are closest to Iran\u2019s border are already on high alert; they know that the response is likely to include medium-range &amp; long-range missiles.\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has vowed that Iran will respond \u201cproportionately\u201d to the killing of Suleimani. He described the US-ordered drone strike as an act of state terrorism and claimed Donald Trump had no respect for international law. Javad Zarif has also been told he will not get a US visa to travel to the United Nations later this week. He accused the US of violating the 1947 UN HQ Agreement. British ships and helicopters have been placed on standby in the Middle East in case there is a further military escalation of the Iran crisis, the defence minister told MPs in the Commons. Ben Wallace said the UK had taken \u201curgent measures\u201d to protect British nationals and interests in Iraq and other nearby countries should Iran retaliate. Boris Johnson was due to chair a meeting of the UK national security council to discuss the crisis. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has travelled to Brussels for talks with his European counterparts. Germany is reducing its troop numbers in Iraq for security reasons after the US killing of Suleimani. It is the first coalition withdrawal since the Iraqi parliament voted on Sunday to call for the withdrawal of US forces from the country. That\u2019s it for today. Our US politics live blog will cover any major developments on the aftermath of the assassination of Suleimani and there will be more reports and analysis on our Iran page. The Islamic Republic News Agency, Irna, has a fuller account of Iran\u2019s decision to summon the UK\u2019s ambassador in Tehran, Rob Macaire. Macaire was warned that siding with the US over the assassination of Suleimani constitutes \u201can alliance with an act of US terrorism\u201d, according to a translation of the report. Macaire was also told to convey a message to London that UK should not be a \u201cpartner in this crime\u201d. Macaire said the government believes that escalating tensions in the regions are in no one\u2019s interest, and called on Iran to exercise restraint. British ships and helicopters have been placed on standby in the Middle East in case there is a further military escalation of the Iran crisis, the defence minister told MPs in the Commons. Ben Wallace said the UK had taken \u201curgent measures\u201d to protect British nationals and interests in Iraq and other nearby countries should Iran retaliate after the assassination of Suleimani. The cabinet minister said it was necessary to \u201cchange the readiness of our forces\u201d, which include an estimated 400 troops in Iraq, and two warships, the HMS Montrose and the HMS Defender in the Persian Gulf. Iranian military forces have said they are prepared to use medium- to long-range missiles to attack US bases in the Middle East, in revenge for the assassination of Suleimani. According to a report by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, Iran has prepared 13 scenarios for retaliation, and the secretary of Iran\u2019s national security council said that even the most limited of the options would be a \u201chistoric nightmare\u201d for the US. Ali Shamkhani told the news agency: \u201cThe 27 US bases that are closest to Iran\u2019s border are already on high alert; they know that the response is likely to include medium-range &amp; long-range missiles.\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign ministry has summoned the UK ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, following what state media describes as \u201cunacceptable remarks\u201d by Boris Johnson and Ben Wallace. It comes amid reports that an adviser to Iran\u2019s foreign ministry described the UK as a \u201cpartner in crime\u201d to the US over the killing of Suleimani. Saudi Arabia\u2019s defence minister, Khalid bin Salman, is in London for talks with his UK counterpart to discuss the \u201cwar against terrorism and challenges facing our region\u201d. The UK government is putting in place \u201curgent measures\u201d to protect British nationals and interests amid rising tensions in the Gulf, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace has said. PA Media reports: Wallace said non-essential personnel had been moved out of Baghdad while Royal Navy warships and military helicopters were on heightened readiness to assist if needed. In a Commons statement, he again appealed for all sides to \u201cde-escalate\u201d in the wake of the killing of the Iranian military chief Qassem Soleimani in a US drone strike. At the same time he defended the right of the US to act in self-defence, saying Suleimani had been in neighbouring Iraq when he was hit to \u201cco-ordinate murder and attacks on US citizens\u201d. Before a meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the growing crisis, Wallace said the safety and security of UK nationals and interests in the region were of \u201cparamount concern\u201d. Non-essential personnel had been re-located from Baghdad to the military base at Camp Taji, north of the Iraqi capital, while the Department of Transport was reviewing its advice to British shipping on a daily basis. \u201cAt the same time, Defence are changing the readiness of our forces - including helicopters and ships on standby to assist if the need arises,\u201d he said. \u201cAs part of prudent planning, a small team has been sent to the region to provide additional situational awareness and contingency planning assistance.\u201d The government has already announced that the Type 45 destroyer HMS Defender and the Type 23 frigate HMS Montrose are to resume duties escorting shipping through the strait of Hormuz. Here\u2019s a summary of events so far: Dozens of people have been killed in a crush in the south-eastern Iranian city of Kerman, where hundreds of thousands of mourners have gathered for the burial of the military commander Qassem Suleimani. State media said 56 people had been killed and 213 injured. Suleimani\u2019s burial has been postponed due to the size of the crowd. It comes a day after Iranian police said millions gathered to mourn Suleimani in Tehran, in the largest turnout since the 1989 funeral of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

He described the US-ordered drone strike as an act of state terrorism and claimed Donald Trump had no respect for international law. The UK has said it wants to keep its troops in Iraq but will pull out if Baghdad demands. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace said: \u201cIf they require us to leave, that is their right and we will respect it.\u201d Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the supreme national security council, said 13 \u201crevenge scenarios\u201d were being considered by Tehran. Even the weakest option would prove \u201ca historic nightmare for the Americans\u201d, he said. Javad Zarif has also been told he will not get a US visa to travel to the United Nations later this week. He accused the US of violating the 1947 UN HQ Agreement. Boris Johnson is due to chair a meeting of the UK national security council to discuss the crisis. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has travelled to Brussels for talks with his European counterparts. Germany is reducing its troop numbers in Iraq for security reasons after the US killing of Suleimani. It is the first coalition withdrawal since the Iraqi parliament voted on Sunday to call for the withdrawal of US forces from the country. Downing Street has given an account of a phone call between Boris Johnson and Turkey\u2019s President Erdogan. The leaders discussed the situation in Iraq following the death of Qasem Soleimani. They agreed on the importance of reducing tensions and finding a diplomatic way through the current crisis, and of continuing to work together in the fight against terror. \u201cThey agreed that Iran cannot be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon and must comply with the terms of the nuclear deal.\u201d In his press conference, Pompeo accused his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, of being a \u201cpropagandist\u201d by claiming that Suleimani was travelling to Baghdad on diplomatic mission when he was killed in the US drone strike. Pompeo said: Zarif\u2019s first statement that Sulemiani traveling to Baghdad on a diplomatic mission. Anybody here believe that? Is there any history that would indicate that it was remotely possible that Suleimani had travelled to Baghdad for the idea of conducting a peace mission. We know that wasn\u2019t true. Zarif is a propagandist of the first order. Most of what you laid out was Iranian propaganda. It\u2019s not new, we\u2019ve heard these same lies before. It\u2019s fundamentally false. He was not there on the diplomatic mission trying to resolve a problem. There\u2019s been some story that he was representing a Saudi peace deal. I\u2019ve spoken to my Saudi counterparts at great length. I can assure you that they will share my view that he was not there representing some kind of agreement that was going to reduce risk or reduce the risk to the lives of Americans when he was on that trip. On Trump\u2019s threat to target 52 cultural sites, Pompeo said: \u201cEvery action we take will be consistent with the international rule of law.\u201d He added: \u201cLet me tell you who\u2019s done damage to Persian culture. It\u2019s not the United States of America. It\u2019s the Ayatollah. The real risk to Persian culture does not come from United States of America. That there is there is no mistake about that. Asked whether lawyers were consulted about Suleimani\u2019s killing, Pomopeo said: I have never seen this administration engage in an activity of this nature without a thorough and complete legal review. Often the lawyers review all of the options that are being presented to the president in advance of them being presented such that every option that is presented to him has been fully vetted through the legal process. I\u2019m confident that that was the case here, although I don\u2019t have specific knowledge of that. Asked if there will be similar strikes against highranking Iranians, Pompeo said: The President\u2019s been unambiguous in the remarks he made down in Florida, as well as the tweets that he\u2019s put out, about the seriousness with which we take this and the risk attendant that we are deeply aware of, and the preparations we\u2019ve made to prevent those risks, as well as our determination that in the event the Iranians make another bad choice, that the president will respond in a way that he did last week, which was decisive, serious and messaged Iran about the constraints that we are going to place on that regime so that it doesn\u2019t continue to put American lives at risk. In the end our Iran policy is about protecting and defending the homeland and securing American lives. I know that the efforts that we have taken not only last week with a strike against Suleimani, but the strategy that we\u2019ve employed, has saved American lives. I\u2019m highly confident of that. Iran\u2019s Fars News agency now says 56 people killed were killed in the funeral crush in Kerman. It said 35 men and 21 women were killed and 213 people injured. In the House of Commons in London, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, is giving an oral statement to MPs updating them on the Iran crisis. What he said at the start did not really go beyond what the UK government has already said about the UK killing of Qassem Suleimani (lukewarm endorsement, combined with a call for restraint and de-escalation) and the most lively opening exchanges came when Wallace clashed with Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, who was responding for the opposition. Wallace started by saying the UK would always defend the right of countries to defend themselves. He said the US had in the past shown restraint when its bases in Iraq were under attack, and he said the UK was urging all parties to de-escalate the crisis as soon as possible. Travel advice for Iran and Iraq has been revised, he said. And he said non-essential UK personnel had been moved out of Baghdad. He continued: As part of prudent planning, a small team has been sent to the region to provide additional situational awareness and contingency planning assistance. Wallace said the Iraqi parliament had voted to end the coalition presence in Iraq. But that vote was only one part of the process, he said. The UK government was speaking to the Iraqi government about what this might mean, he said. He said the coalition was only in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government. He said the UK would be urging Iran to take a different path. Its aggressive behaviour, including targeting dissidents in Europe and hijacking civilian ships, was never going to go unchallenged. He continued: Her Majesty\u2019s government urges Iran to return to the normal behaviour of the country it aspires to be and resist the urge to retaliate \u2026 None of us wants conflict, none of us wants our citizens, our friends and our allies to be put at risk. In response, Corbyn said that Boris Johnson was \u201chiding behind\u201d his defence secretary and that he should be making the Commons statement himself. He said the \u201cassassination\u201d of Suleimani put British servicemen and women in danger, but Johnson was afraid to say so. Corbyn explained: Isn\u2019t the truth that he\u2019s scared to stand up to President Trump because he\u2019s hitched his wagon to the prospect of a toxic Trump trade deal? Instead, at this highly dangerous moment, we find the government giving cover and even expressing sympathy for what is widely regarded as an illegal act, because they\u2019re so determined to keep in with President Trump? Corbyn asked Wallace if he thought the killing of Suleimani was legal. And he criticised the government for saying that the onus was on Iran to de-escalate. If an American general had been killed, the government would not be telling the US to de-escalate, Corbyn said. Responding to Corbyn, Wallace said what he was saying was \u201cusual anti-American tripe\u201d. On the issue of the legality of the killing, Wallace said that it was for the US to make its case. But Wallace also said it was clear that a legal defence of self-defence could be made in this case relating to Suleimani going to Iraq plotting to murder American citizens. There is more coverage of the statement on our UK politics live blog. In his 13-minute exchange with reporters, Pompeo offered no further evidence that Suleimani posed a direct threat to US lives. This is what he said when challenged about the imminence of the threat the Iranian military commander posed: Any time a president makes a decision of this magnitude there are multiple pieces of information that come before us. We present that to him in all its broad detail. We evaluated the relevant risks and the opportunity that we thought might present itself at some point. And we could see clearly that not only had Suleimani done all of the things that we have recounted \u2013 massacres in Syria, enormous destruction of countries like Lebanon and Iraq \u2026 this is all Suleiman\u2019s handiwork. And then we\u2019d watch to see the continuing terror campaign in the region. We know what happened at the end of last year in December ultimately leading to the death of an American. So if you are looking for imminence you need look no further than the days that led up to the strike that was taken against Suleimani. In addition to that, you have what we could clearly see were continuing efforts on behalf of this terrorists to build out a network of campaign activities that were going to lead, potentially, to the death of many more Americans. It was the right decision. We got it right. The Department of Defense did excellent work and the president had an entirely legal, appropriate basis, as well as a decision that fit perfectly within our strategy in how to counter the threat of malign activity from Iran more broadly. Q: Would you push back against Trump hitting cultural sites in Iran? \u201cEvery action we take will be consistent with international law,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI know the strike saved American lives, I\u2019m confident about that,\u201d Pompeo said. Q: Were lawyers consulted about the attack on Suleimani? We never act without full legal vetting, Pompeo said. He said he was confident this took place before the attack. Pompeo insists Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on \u201cour watch\u201d. The previous administration chose to \u201cunderwrite and appease\u201d, we have chosen to confront, Pompeo said. Q: Iran says Suleiman was on a diplomatic mission. Does anyone believe Suleiman was on a peace mission? We know that isn\u2019t true, Pompeo said. This is Iranian propaganda. Q: Why did the US deny a visa to Javad Zarif? We can\u2019t comment on visa issues, Pompeo said. Q: How imminent was the threat posed by Suleimani? We could see clearly all of Suleimani\u2019s previous \u201chandiwork\u201d. If you are looking imminence look no further than the days leading up to the attack. It was the right decision, Pompeo said. In his opening remarks, Pompeo says Iran is \u201cactively working to undermine the peace process\u201d in Afghanistan. You can watch Pompeo\u2019s press conference here: The death toll from the crush at Suleimani\u2019s funeral has increased to 50, Reuters reports, citing Iran\u2019s ISNA news agency. INSA quoted Abbas Amian of the coroner\u2019s office for Kerman province. The funeral, which has been postponed, started in Kerman, Suleimani\u2019s home town. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is due to give a press conference in the next half an hour. Syrian state media have more on Putin\u2019s rare visit to Damascus for talks with Iran\u2019s ally Bashar al-Assad. President al-Assad and President Putin listened to a military briefing by the commander of the Russian forces operating in Syria \u2026 President al-Assad also congratulated the Russian officers and soldiers on the occasion of Christmas, expressing the appreciation of himself and the Syrian people for the sacrifices made by the Russian forces alongside their counterparts in the Syrian Arab Army. Germany\u2019s minister for EU affairs, Heiko Maas, said Europe could not \u201cshrug its shoulders\u201d at Iran\u2019s decision to breach the terms of the nuclear agreement in a sign of the parlous state of relations. He said: \u201cWe still believe that this is an important agreement that will prevent Iran from coming into possession of a nuclear bomb.\u201dBut we will not be able to take note of announcements with a shrug of our shoulders that the commitments in Tehran will no longer be met.\u201d Maas was speaking ahead of a meeting in Brussels with his French and British counterparts, including the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has arrived in Damascus for talks with Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, according to Syrian state media and Russia\u2019s Ifax. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has repeated his call for a diplomatic solution to the crisis as he headed to Brussels for talks with his German and French counterparts. Nikki Haley, a former US ambassador to the United Nations and in many eyes a future Republican presidential candidate, has claimed the only people mourning the loss of Suleimani are the \u201cDemocrat leadership and our Democrat presidential candidates\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t see anyone standing up for Iran,\u201d Haley told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday night. \u201cYou\u2019re not hearing any of the Gulf [states], you\u2019re not hearing China, you\u2019re not hearing Russia. The only ones that are mourning the loss of Suleimani are Democrat leadership and our Democrat presidential candidates.\u201d Downing Street has said force protection measures for British troops in the region were kept under \u201cconstant review\u201d. \u201cThe safety and security of our personnel is of paramount importance. We keep our force protection measures under constant review,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said. Asked why the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, rather than Boris Johnson would be making a statement on the situation in the Commons, the spokesman said: \u201cThe PM leads a cabinet government and the response to events in the Middle East is a collective cabinet response. \u201cThe prime minister continues to speak to world leaders. He has overseen the ministerial response and will chair the national security council later today.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of events so far: Dozens of people have been killed in a crush in the south-eastern Iranian city of Kerman, where hundreds of thousands of mourners have gathered for the burial of the military commander Qassem Suleimani. Emergency officials told state TV that 40 people had been killed and 213 injured. Suleimani\u2019s burial has been postponed due to the size of the crowd. It comes a day after Iranian police said millions gathered to mourn Suleimani in Tehran, in the largest turnout since the 1989 funeral of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has vowed that Iran will respond \u201cproportionately\u201d to the killing of Suleimani. He described the US-ordered drone strike as an act of state terrorism and claimed Donald Trump had no respect for international law. Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the supreme national security council, said 13 \u201crevenge scenarios\u201d were being considered by Tehran. Even the weakest option would prove \u201ca historic nightmare for the Americans\u201d, he said. Javad Zarif has also been told he will not get a US visa to travel to the United Nations later this week. He accused the US of violating the 1947 UN HQ Agreement. Boris Johnson is due to chair a meeting of the UK national security council to discuss the crisis. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has travelled to Brussels for talks with his European counterparts. Germany is reducing its troop numbers in Iraq for security reasons after the US killing of Suleimani. It is the first coalition withdrawal since the Iraqi parliament voted on Sunday to call for the withdrawal of US forces from the country. Javad Zarif insists that Iran respects international law, unlike Donald Trump. CNN has broadcast more of its interview with the Iranian foreign secretary. In it he explained that Iran\u2019s response to the killing of Suleimani will be proportionate because it abides by international law. Speaking about Friday\u2019s drone strike in Baghdad, Javad Zarif said: The United States violated three principles: Iraqi sovereignty and the agreement they had with Iraq, they got a response from the Iraqi parliament [to expel US troops]; they violated the emotions of the people, they will get a response from the people; they killed one of our most revered commanders and they took responsibility for it. This is state terrorism ... and we will respond, but we will respond proportionately, not disproportionately because we are committed to law. We are law-abiding people, we are not lawless like President Trump. He added: We have people on our side in this region. That\u2019s much more important. Beautiful military equipment doesn\u2019t rule the world, people rule the world. He [Trump] needs to wake up and apologise. He has to apologise, he has to change course. He cannot add mistake upon another mistake. He is just making it worse for America. He is destroying the US constitution, he is destroying the US political process, he is destroying the rule of law in the United States. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has been told he will not get a US visa to travel to the United Nations later this week, AP reports Javad Zarif told CBS This Morning, that the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, informed the UN secretary general, who in turn relayed to Zarif, that they did not have time to review my request. It\u2019s not clear that Zarif\u2019s request has been formally rejected, which would trigger legal technicalities that could affect future visa applications. A US official said the visa application had not been processed but declined to comment on whether it had been formally denied. The State Department cited visa confidentiality laws that bar the release of such information with certain limited exceptions. Zarif had applied for the visa in order to speak to a UN Security Council session Thursday about the importance of upholding the UN charter. Under its obligations as the host country of the UN headquarters, the US is required in most circumstances to issue visas to foreign officials for meetings at the world body. However, there are exceptions and the US has severely restricted the movements of Iranian diplomats in New York in the past. Suleimani\u2019s planned burial in his home town of Kerman has been postponed due to the size of the crowd, after 40 mourners were killed in the crush, according to state media. Fars News Agency said the revised timing for Suleimani\u2019s burial will be announced shortly. The death toll in the crush at Suleimani\u2019s burial has risen to 40, according to the state-backed Fars News agency. Fars cited Iran\u2019s head of emergency services, Pirhossein Kolivand, for the revised figure. It also said 213 people were injured in the incident. The killing of Suleimani by the US was an act of state terrorism and Iran will respond proportionately, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has told CNN. He said: \u201cThis is an act of aggression against Iran, and it amounts to an armed attack against Iran, and we will respond. But we will respond proportionately.\u201d Zarif also said Donald Trump was threatening an international war crime by pledging to attack cultural sites if Iran retaliates against Suleimani\u2019s killing. \u201cHe has no respect for international law. That he is prepared to commit war crimes, because attacking cultural sites is a war crime, this disproportionate response is a war crime. But he doesn\u2019t care it seems about international law. Has made the US more secure? That\u2019s the price for arrogance, for ignorance, for lack of respect. Their days in our region are numbered, not because anybody will take any action against him but because they are not welcome. The United States has to wake up to the reality that the people of this region are enraged. That the people of this region want the United States out. The United States has been in in this region for many years and has not brought itself or the region any security. We leave it at that.\u201d Fars new agency has released helicopter footage showing the huge crowds that have gathered for Suleimani\u2019s burial in his home town of Kerman. Iran\u2019s state media have revised down the casualty figures from the funeral crush to 32 and 190 injured. Fars News agency cited Iran\u2019s head of emergency services, Pirhossein Kolivand, for the revised figure. Germany is reducing its troop numbers in Iraq for security reasons after the US killing of Suleimani. It is the first coalition withdrawal since the Iraqi parliament voted on Sunday to call for the withdrawal of US forces from the country. The non-binding resolution has prompted a chaotic response from US officials. The German decision \u2013 set out in a letter from the defence minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, and the foreign minister, Heiko Maas, to the German parliament \u2013 underlines the extent to which the assassination may have weakened the years-long efforts of the coalition forces to fight Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Nato has already announced that all training of Iraqi forces has been suspended. A senior Iranian official said Tehran was considering 13 scenarios to avenge Suleimani\u2019s killing, according to the state-backed Fars news agency. \u201cWe will take revenge, a hard and definitive revenge,\u201d the head of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, Gen Hossein Salami, told mourners in Kerman. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and military commanders have said Iranian retaliation for the US action on Friday would match the scale of Soleimani\u2019s killing but that it would be at a time and place of Tehran\u2019s choosing. Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the supreme national security council, said 13 \u201crevenge scenarios\u201d were being considered, Fars news agency reported. Even the weakest option would prove \u201ca historic nightmare for the Americans\u201d, he said. Trump has threatened strikes on 52 Iranian targets, including cultural sites, if Iran retaliates. Boris Johnson is to chair a meeting of the national security council and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is to travel to Brussels for talks with his European counterpart, PA Media reports. The so-called \u201cE3\u201d \u2013 Britain, Germany and France \u2013 have jointly called for \u201cde-escalation\u201d of the tensions between the US and Iran. The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on reports that it is stepping up contingency plans to evacuate military and civilian personnel from neighbouring Iraq amid fears they could be targets for Iranian reprisals. The Times reported that a team of about 20 senior military planners and liaison officers had been dispatched to the embassy in Baghdad over the weekend. The Foreign Office was coy over reports that it was scaling back staffing at British embassies in the Middle East. A spokesman said: \u201cThe British embassies in both Baghdad and Tehran are open. The safety and security of our staff is of paramount importance and we keep our security posture under regular review.\u201d The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is due to update MPs \u2013 returning to Westminster following their Christmas break \u2013 on the latest situation in the region. Raab also is due to fly to Washington later this week to meet US counterpart, Mike Pompeo, after the secretary of state criticised the lack of support by the Europeans \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for the US action. Mark Esper, the US defence secretary, has been forced to deny that America was about to withdraw its troops from Iraq, where the strike on General Soleimani took place. A leaked letter from a US Marine Corps commander said: \u201cWe respect your sovereign decision to order our departure.\u201d It followed a vote in the Iraqi parliament on Sunday, backed by the prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops including British forces. Johnson emphasised the need to maintain a coalition presence in Iraq against Islamic State when he spoke by telephone to Abdul-Mahdi on Monday. About 400 UK troops are stationed in Iraq in the fight against Islamic State, while the US has 5,200, prompting fears of a withdrawal that could cripple the battle against the terror group. Welcome to live coverage of the continuing aftermath from the US killing of Qassem Suleimani amid reports of a deadly crush at his funeral procession. According to an initial state TV report, 35 people were killed in the incident at Kerman, Suleimani\u2019s home town, where his burial is taking place. Videos posted online showed people lying lifeless on a road, with others shouting and trying to help them. The crush was reported to have started when the burial procession got under way. Iranian TV gave the casualty toll in its online report, without saying where it obtained the information. Pirhossein Koulivand, the head of Iran\u2019s emergency medical services, earlier spoke by telephone to state TV and confirmed the incident took place. \u201cUnfortunately as a result of the stampede, some of our compatriots have been injured and some have been killed during the funeral processions,\u201d he said. A procession in Tehran on Monday drew more than 1 million people in the Iranian capital, crowding both main thoroughfares and side streets in Tehran.",

The idea of a Green New Deal has been championed by New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has pushed the idea within the Democratic Party.

The deal \u201cis an ambitious response to the imminent threat of climate change on a scale that is commensurate with the threat that we are facing\u201d, Kelton said. \u201cTo do something like this in 10 years time requires a mobilisation that is sort of parallel to what we did in world war two\u201d.

She mocked the idea it was \u201ctoo hard\u201d. \u201cImagine if we had said that after the bombing of Pearl Harbor \u2013 oh, I don\u2019t know if we can fight back against the Nazi invasion and the threat.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer.

      "bodyText": "Bot and troll accounts are involved in a \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d exaggerating the role of arson in Australia\u2019s bushfire disaster, social media analysis suggests. The bushfires burning across the nation have been accompanied by repeated suggestions of an arson epidemic or \u201carson emergency\u201d. The false claims are, in some cases, used to undermine the link between the current bushfires and the longer, more intense fire seasons brought about by climate change. The Queensland University of Technology senior lecturer on social network analysis Dr Timothy Graham examined content published on the #arsonemergency hashtag on Twitter, assessing 1,340 tweets, 1,203 of which were unique, published by 315 accounts. Using a Twitter bot detection tool, he assessed a random sample for bot-like characteristics. His preliminary analysis found there is likely a \u201ccurrent disinformation campaign\u201d on Twitter\u2019s #arsonemergency hashtag due to the \u201csuspiciously high number of bot-like and troll-like accounts\u201d. He similarly found a large number of suspicious accounts posting on the #australiafire and #bushfireaustralia hashtags. \u201cAustralia suddenly appears to be getting swamped by mis/disinformation as a result of this environmental catastrophe, and we are suffering the consequences in terms of hyped up polarisation and an increased difficulty and inability for citizens to discern truth,\u201d Graham told the Guardian. \u201cLooking at the kinds of accounts that post using the #ArsonEmergency hashtag, you see that these are individuals who are hyper-partisan ideologues, behaving in a way that is not reflective of the average Twitter user. \u201cThe conspiracy theories going around (including arson as the main cause of the fires) reflect an increased distrust in scientific expertise, scepticism of the media, and rejection of liberal democratic authority. These are all major factors in the global fight against disinformation, and based on my preliminary analysis it appears that Australia has for better or worse entered that battlefield, at least for now.\u201d There is no dispute that arson is a serious problem in Australia, or that arsonists have not been active in the current bushfire season. NSW police say they have charged 24 people with deliberately lighting bushfires this season. But that does not detract from the clear scientific evidence showing climate change is making Australia\u2019s bushfire seasons longer and more severe.

      "body": "<p>Australia\u2019s unprecedented bushfire crisis has prompted a wave of philanthropic responses globally.

This is particularly clear in times of crisis. \u201cWe rally around communities in need during times of natural disasters, and emergency relief is one of the top causes that are supported by Australians,\u201d Seibert says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e32fc813-0887-436a-bc58-6c78cf57c1e8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QAD4JuI4Q00?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, donating and fundraising can be a complex endeavour.

This has become the case in Victoria, prompting premier Daniel Andrews to tweet: \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the emergency relief effort is being run by experienced organisations \u2013 &amp; they don\u2019t have space to sort or store donations.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanielAndrewsMP/status/1213703278699016193\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I know it\u2019s tough to watch this all unfold &amp; feel helpless.

Gaeta was hopeful they would raise $1m. So far, the ABC\u2019s partnership has raised over $10m. \u201cThe fact that we were doing it meant so much,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Seibert says that partnering with a large charity is often the best way to give: \u201cThose appeals have the staff, expertise and linkages on the ground to understand where the funds are needed.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s unprecedented bushfire crisis has prompted a wave of philanthropic responses globally. High-profile campaigns such as Celeste Barber\u2019s fundraiser for New South Wales\u2019 Rural Fire Service have raised tens of millions of dollars and celebrities incuding Chris Hemsworth (who pledged $1m to bushfire relief charities on 7 January) Kylie Minogue, Pink, Selena Gomez and Nicole Kidman have donated large individual sums. Krystian Seibert, an industry fellow at Swinburne University\u2019s Centre for Social Impact, notes that Australians are a generous population, ranked number four on the World Giving Index. This is particularly clear in times of crisis. \u201cWe rally around communities in need during times of natural disasters, and emergency relief is one of the top causes that are supported by Australians,\u201d Seibert says. However, donating and fundraising can be a complex endeavour. Guardian Australia spoke with Seibert, and several people running successful bushfire relief fundraisers, to find out how to make the best of our collective goodwill. When you can, give cash While it may feel like a nice thing to do \u201cdonating blankets and other sorts of goods can overwhelm charities\u201d, says Seibert. Often the logistics of accepting and storing donations of goods can be too difficult for already-stretched organisations. This has become the case in Victoria, prompting premier Daniel Andrews to tweet: \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the emergency relief effort is being run by experienced organisations \u2013 &amp; they don\u2019t have space to sort or store donations.\u201d Unless you are responding to a specific request for goods or services, \u201cthe best thing that somebody can do to help is actually donate cash\u201d, Seibert advises. If you\u2019re unable to give cash but still want to assist in some way, contacting a major charitable organisation to offer your time is a good place to start. Or, if you only have an hour and some haemoglobin to spare, giving blood is always a helpful thing to do. Be mindful of administrative burdens When the ABC decided to turn their New Year\u2019s Eve concert into a fundraising drive, they knew they need a partner that would be national and able to set up a phone bank to accept donations quickly. \u201cSo we put in a call to the Red Cross,\u201d says Janet Gaeta, the concert\u2019s executive producer. \u201cThey were amazing, fantastic to work with \u2026 This disaster and recovery fund has to be spent in Australia, it can also go to drought or flood victims in Australia.\u201d Gaeta knew \u201cthis is a very fine line we\u2019re walking here \u2026 with so many people \u2026 facing utter catastrophe\u201d. Gaeta was hopeful they would raise $1m. So far, the ABC\u2019s partnership has raised over $10m. \u201cThe fact that we were doing it meant so much,\u201d she says. Seibert says that partnering with a large charity is often the best way to give: \u201cThose appeals have the staff, expertise and linkages on the ground to understand where the funds are needed. They\u2019re going to have the oversight.\u201d Direct donations keep things clean While many first-time fundraisers \u201cgo in with the best of intentions \u2026 it can be very difficult\u201d, Seibert notes. Working with an established partner eases that difficulty. \u201cRather than set up your own \u2026 encouraging people to give to existing appeals and organisations is what I would recommend is the best approach,\u201d says Seibert. This is exactly the method YA novelist Emily Gale used when she and author Nova Weetman set up the donation drive #AuthorsforFireys on Twitter. Gale and Weetman are encouraging authors to use Twitter to auction signed books as well meet-and-greet opportunities. Then, auction winners donate their funds directly to Country Fire Authority Victoria. \u201cThe auction model is a little bit easier on the organisers because it takes place on Twitter and each person who\u2019s involved auctioning an item takes care of their own auction item,\u201d Gale says. So far high-profile authors including Cheryl Strayed, Leigh Sales, Annabel Crabb and Benjamin Law are participating in the auction, which closes on 11 January. Gale has participated in similar charity auctions in the past, but says the response to this drive is overwhelming. \u201cI always like to donate my time, I don\u2019t have a lot of cash to give but I do have time.\u201d Seibert says for individuals, Facebook\u2019s fundraising function \u2013 which is the mechanism Celeste Barber is using \u2013 can be a very effective way to raise money for a cause. Facebook does not charge a fee for charitable donations. If you have connections, use them While Seibert says it\u2019s \u201cimportant to be mindful of the administrative and governance challenges associated with setting up an independent campaign\u201d, he commends \u201cthe initiative of individuals and groups who start independent campaigns. They may identify a need that\u2019s not being met by existing organisations, or have particular links on the ground in communities where they want to direct funds. So there is a role for independent campaigns.\u201d An unmet need was exactly what motivated the musician, broadcaster and community organiser Neil Morris to set up his Fire Relief Fund For First Nations Communities, which has so far raised almost $500,000. \u201cI\u2019m very mindful of the impact [these fires have had] on Indigenous lives and how intense that can be,\u201d Morris says. \u201cThere are sensitivities for our people. We do need very specific support.\u201d Morris notes that larger organisations may be \u201cinundated\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s only a certain amount of nuance that they can give in their support.\u201d Morris is working closely with communities in fire-affected areas to determine the most culturally appropriate, streamlined and useful allocation of funding. \u201cEven for us, as First Nations people, we cannot make decisions for any community we sit outside of,\u201d he says. He has been heartened by the sheer volume of donations his drive has received, and says: \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for other people to come to the fore and provide what our people need. Above and beyond that, it\u2019s our cultural responsibility to look out for one another\u2019s people.\u201d You don\u2019t have to sell something to give something On 9 January, 30 Australian retailers including Cue, General Pants Co and The Iconic will be donating 100% of their profits to the Red Cross disaster relief and recovery plan. Seibert says while \u201cevery bit of money helps\u201d when it comes to companies that devote a portion of proceeds to charities and other drives, he says: \u201cIf you\u2019re a business and you\u2019re turning a profit, you have money that you can give, rather than expecting people to buy your products.\u201d Seibert suggests that, in times of disaster, businesses should not \u201cuse this as an opportunity to market your products \u2013 use it as an opportunity to show what kind of corporate citizen you are\u201d. He points to matched funding initiatives, where businesses can match public donations dollar for dollar as a particularly effective way of raising funds. However, he also acknowledges \u201cit can be tougher for small businesses \u2013 there are a few different things that they can do \u2026even just putting a tin on the counter where people can put spare change can make a difference\u201d. Do your homework to avoid bad actors In times of crisis, Seibert warns, \u201cCertain people might prey on the generosity of individuals and there can be scams used to try and extract money from people.\u201d The ACCC have set up a hotline for people to report bushfire appeal-related scams, and Seibert says it is important to ask people soliciting donations on the street for more information. While giving to established charities \u2013 such as those registered with the Australian Charities and Non-Profits Commission \u2013 is the safest way to avoid scams, donors and beneficiaries still have some protections through crowdfunding website GoFundMe, which offers a GoFundMe guarantee in cases of campaign misuse, such as intentionally misleading descriptions or funds not being delivered to their intended recipients. Give with a thought to the future During and in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, people are at their most generous. However, Seibert wants people to be mindful of \u201cwhat happens when the bushfires subside, we move out of summer and what happens next?\u201d Making a positive contribution to Australia\u2019s future is what motivated NSW Young Australian of the Year Corey Tutt to replenish the burned-down school libraries of Cobargo and Clifton Creek. Through his organisation Deadly Science, Tutt has been providing rural and remote communities with school books, telescopes and other Stem-related equipment. \u201cI want to be able to make sure that no kid has their education severely impacted by these fires,\u201d he explains. Tutt has roots in the south coast, where he used to work as an alpaca shearer, and he used those connections, particularly in the local Lions Clubs, to arrange for the delivery of books with a particular focus on texts that convey traditional knowledge, such as Young Dark Emu. Right now Tutt is acting as \u201ca logistics octopus\u201d, arranging for the donation of books and money, which will be deposited directly into fire-affected schools\u2019 recovery funds.

The usually mild-mannered judge, James Burke of New York county supreme court, responded in fury when it emerged that Weinstein had used his phone inside the courtroom soon after arriving on his trademark walking frame, despite numerous orders not to do so. \u201cMr Weinstein, I cannot implore you more not to answer the phone,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIs this really the way you want to end up in jail for the rest of your life \u2013 by texting in violation of a court order?\u201d Burke told the movie producer\u2019s lead lawyer, Arthur Aidala, that if Weinstein was caught in the act again his $2m bail would immediately be revoked. \u201cMy advice to you is before you come into the courtroom take his [Weinstein\u2019s] cellphone and put it in your briefcase. It\u2019s my understanding that he did hand over his phone, but then he had two more.\u201d When Weinstein looked as though he were preparing to say something, the judge snapped: \u201cYou might want to invoke your right to counsel in silence right now.\u201d The most intensely watched criminal trial of the century has begun with heated exchanges between opposing lawyers even before the trial proper begins. Weinstein is accused of five counts of serious sexual offences that could see him sentenced to life in prison, relating to allegations that he abused his power as a movie titan to prey on vulnerable women, claims that trigged the #MeToo movement. He is accused of two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of a criminal sexual act in the first degree, one count of rape in the first degree and one count of rape in the third degree. A few hours after the first day\u2019s proceedings ended on Monday, Weinstein\u2019s legal problems multiplied when the district attorney in Los Angeles announced new charges. The film producer was accused of raping one woman and sexually assaulting another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013. Prosecutors at the New York trial said one of the cases in the LA charges had elements overlapping with the Manhattan trial but the second woman \u2013 representing the most serious charge \u2013 was entirely separate. On the back of the news out of LA, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers made a fiery attempt to get the New York trial adjourned on grounds that the fresh criminal charges would taint any jury. It followed their unsuccessful efforts last year to persuade the judge to move the trial out of New York City to some other part of the state, on the grounds that Manhattan was media capital of the world and deeply prejudiced against Weinstein. Aidala argued that the LA announcement had been a co-ordinated move designed to harm Weinstein. \u201cThis was Christmas for the prosecution,\u201d he said. He said news outlets such as the Daily News, New York Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal and others had reported the new LA charges in prejudicial terms. \u201cI cannot think of one case where the day of jury selection this kind of prejudice was being cast against the criminal defendant,\u201d he said. Aidala added colourfully that when the defence went out to dinner on Monday, \u201cthe next table were, \u2018Did you hear about Weinstein, the new charges?\u2019 It was the talk of the town.\u201d Burke took little time to swat away the request for an adjournment. He said the premise at the start of all criminal trials was that the defendant is innocent and the New York jury would be instructed as such. His advice to Aidala was to stop \u201ctrying to ring a bell that really has no resonance\u201d. The court has now turned to the prolonged and arduous job of selecting a jury of 12 women and men and six alternates. The pool begins with 120 potential jurors. As a first round of the filtering process, potential jurors are being asked to fill out a questionnaire that includes a number of questions on Weinstein. It says there has been wide publicity about him over the last year, and asks: \u201cCan you assure all parties that you will determine this case based only on the evidence you will hear in court?\u201d The questionnaire asks potential jurors what they have heard about the defendant and if it affects their ability to be fair and impartial. It also asks whether they or a family member or close friend has been the victim of physical or sexual abuse. The trial proper, starting with the opening argument of the prosecution, is likely to begin on 21 January.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m having a beer and enjoying an Edinburgh fringe show from the front row. But I\u2019m on the sofa rather than a folding chair, there\u2019s a cat on my lap and the beer didn\u2019t cost \u00a36. While the pet and the beverage are optional, the large pair of goggles I\u2019m wearing are not. Much fancier headsets are available but this one \u2013 which works with my smartphone \u2013 comes with a subscription to <a href=\"https://livr.co.uk/\">LIVR</a>, \u201cthe world\u2019s first virtual reality content platform dedicated to theatre\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s fringe theatre in particular that the company has focused on. The 360-degree VR experience situates you in the middle of the front row and lets you immerse yourself in the show. Instead of a conventional film, where the emphases have been predetermined in the editing suite, you can choose what to concentrate on. You can switch focus on different performers as they move around the stage and into the audience and, in a manner that would be downright shifty in the theatre, turn and gawp at your neighbours\u2019 reactions to the show. All of this distinguishes LIVR\u2019s service from, say, the polished and slickly edited productions available online from <a href=\"https://www.digitaltheatre.com/\">Digital Theatre</a>, which also tend to have bigger budgets and starrier casts. The biggest actor in LIVR\u2019s current offerings is Gyles Brandreth, whose Hamlet with his son Benet at Park theatre is one of the service\u2019s most watched shows.</p> <p>Mostly, LIVR gives you a chance to experience fringe shows that you may have missed at a festival and, in some cases, are no longer being performed. Leo Kellgren-Parker, the company\u2019s founder, says: \u201cThe majority of our audience is based outside London so they use it as a chance to catch things that may not have toured. We wanted to create a place where people can experience shows when it suits them. I like the idea of someone finding a gem long after it would have gone otherwise.\u201d The current catalogue of 60-odd shows includes gig theatre, monologues, puppetry and comedy, with a new batch of titles added each month.</p> <p>While some acclaimed fringe hits have been adapted for short TV versions \u2013 such as Half Breed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/09/ad-libido-review-taking-female-pleasure-into-her-own-hands\">Ad Libido</a>, which both recently became Comedy Blaps on Channel 4 \u2013 this is a chance to relive the rough and ready original. It also allows users to graze on several shows, as you might at a festival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e45885240053a7681a87a16596ffd78ec13e122\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e45885240053a7681a87a16596ffd78ec13e122/761_285_4999_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fran Bushe\u2019s Ad Libido was adapted for Channel 4.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fran Bushe\u2019s Ad Libido was adapted for Channel 4.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cInternationally, we are seeing binge consumption, particularly from the US,\u201d says Kellgren-Parker. \u201cAs they have no name recognition they are picking shows they like the sound of with an entirely open mind.

Ming Hon\u2019s raw, traumatic and sometimes funny production recreates 60 movie pursuits in 60 minutes. Hon, whose work as a film classifier inspired the show, performs alongside two other actresses. They take turns to wield video cameras, filming each other, with the footage projected on a split screen behind them. If this sounds like it might be quite complicated to follow, the way you choose to frame the action yourself using VR \u2013 rather than watching an edited version of the production \u2013 neatly complements the performers\u2019 methods. \u201cAlmost all my performances use live camera with live projection,\u201d Hon tells me. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in how an audience experiences and navigates between watching live performers and the irresistible seduction of moving images on a lit-up screen.\u201d</p> <p>Watching the VR version of Chase Scenes feels like you are in the middle of the show \u2013 props lie at your feet and you twist your neck around to follow Hon running in and out of the audience. Hon says that recording the show was simple. \u201cThe camera operator took one seat in the audience and the camera, which looks like a stick with a robot head, sits beside them. I was able to play up and perform to the camera like it was a real human audience member which was really fun.\u201d She has been reflecting on VR within the pornography industry as part of her next show, Exciting Consequences, which explores the tropes and cliches of pornography; VR porn \u2013 \u201cabout making the sexual experience as real as possible\u201d \u2013 is booming.</p> <p>I check out some more of LIVR\u2019s offerings. The Brandreths\u2019 Hamlet, on a set dominated by a kitchen table, feels a tad flat to me, as does Famous Puppet Death Scenes, which has a set design like a Punch and Judy booth. Neither seems to take great advantage of the possibilities of VR, but then hardly any fringe productions are being designed with the technology in mind. That may change \u2013 and VR may well be developed to suit immersive and promenade performances. Electrolyte, a scrappy and energetic bit of gig theatre, is a good VR fit and I\u2019m gripped by the immediacy of Apphia Campbell\u2019s storytelling and singing in Woke. The technology also suits the decidedly analogue For the Record, an intimate solo show by the poet Toby Thompson, in which he shares coffee and LPs with the audience. It\u2019s a black-box fringe experience perfectly preserved: you can look up to the low ceiling, count the audience members around you, and even hear mutterings from outside the venue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5992ea3b053dbea4c156e7f7f59b3bf53d718123\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5992ea3b053dbea4c156e7f7f59b3bf53d718123/0_108_3917_2350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gripping \u2026 Apphia Campbell\u2019s storytelling and singing in Woke is a good fit for VR.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gripping \u2026 Apphia Campbell\u2019s storytelling and singing in Woke is a good fit for VR.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of these productions were new to me so I watch one of my favourite shows from 2018, Songlines by Tallulah Brown, recorded at Edinburgh\u2019s Pleasance Beside venue. This teen romance, with live music, is even better than I remembered and this time I get a better view as I\u2019m up close and dead centre in the first row. Sometimes that can feel awkward as an audience member \u2013 when I saw the unpredictable comic Jordan Brookes in the same venue I was sure to avoid the front row. There are hearty laughs during Songlines, and when I look around at my neighbours I\u2019m surprised to find the venue is probably at half capacity; it\u2019s a striking contrast to the way filmed performances often try to convey a packed audience.</p> <p>Ming Hon, who is based in Winnipeg, Canada, says that the VR version of Chase Scenes means she can find audiences she\u2019d never otherwise reach. But I wonder if other performers worry about the impact on ticket sales if their show is already available in a sophisticated version online. Although LIVR says it is happy to remove a film from the site when that show is out on tour, the activist and theatremaker Nathaniel Hall says the two are different experiences. He is about to tour the UK with his show First Time, which is also on LIVR. \u201cVR can help us reach people in rural areas, or who are unable to travel, or feel uncomfortable in the restrictive atmosphere of the theatre space,\u201d he adds.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/374163529\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/374163529?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch a trailer for First Time</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cFirst Time is a show that transforms people\u2019s attitudes to HIV and HIV stigma \u2013 the more people that can access the story, the better.

However, the air force insisted it was a coincidence that the number of aircraft used echoed Donald Trump\u2019s threat to hit 52 Iranian targets, including cultural sites. \u201cJust like the timing, the number is a coincidence. This is the most we can get airborne,\u201d Micah Garbarino, a spokesman at the Hill air force base, said. The last F-35A Lightning was delivered in December, four years after the first was delivered, bringing the total force of the active duty 388th and reserve 419th fighter wings to 78 aircraft. Of the three active duty squadrons, one is deployed in the Middle East, leaving two in Utah, which carried out the mass launch \u2013 known in the air force as an \u201celephant walk\u201d. The exercise represented the achievement of full warfighting capability for the F35, estimated to be the most expensive military program ever, which has been marked by controversies, technical issues and cost overruns. The F-35A is a conventional takeoff and landing version of the plane. There are also short takeoff and vertical landing, and catapult-assisted takeoff variants. The US plan is ultimately to acquire more than 2,600 of the planes between now and 2037. The president has repeatedly expressed a fascination with the aircraft, once telling an audience that the F-35A was \u201calmost like an invisible fighter\u201d. The F-35A is not invisible, though it is unusually small and designed to be less visible to radar than conventional aircraft. Trump first startled reporters with talk of an invisible plane in 2017, when he discussed the F-35 at a military briefing in hurricane-hit Puerto Rico. \u201cAmazing job,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo amazing we are ordering hundreds of millions of dollars of new airplanes for the air force, especially the F-35. You like the F-35? ... You can\u2019t see it. You literally can\u2019t see it. It\u2019s hard to fight a plane you can\u2019t see.\u201d",

Which is why I didn\u2019t read on,\u201d he wrote on Twitter to a chorus of growing criticism, adding that he believes that he \u201ctreated the subject matter with great care in my novel, although readers are of course free to feel differently\u201d. \u201cAll I said was that the Auschwitz Museum was linking to an article \u2013 not an article that THEY had published or written \u2013 that addressed supposed inaccuracies in my novel which, of course, was a work of fiction \u2026 and therefore by its nature cannot contain inaccuracies, only anachronisms, and I don\u2019t think there are any of those in there,\u201d Boyne told the Guardian on Tuesday. The Irish author has previously been the subject of online criticism over his novel My Brother\u2019s Name Is Jessica. \u201cI may not always get it right, no one does, but I\u2019d rather give it my best shot every time than be someone who gets their kicks by tearing strangers down through phone &amp; thumb and then walking away with a smug smile thinking, \u2018I told him,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. \u201cThe \u2018new dictators\u2019 try to define discourse, control literature &amp; instigate online attacks. Perhaps they feel voiceless but screaming like jackals rather than talking like humans isn\u2019t helpful. After 20 years of publishing novels, I know that real writers write from the gut, regardless of the abuse that comes their way.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>All she wanted was one last summer adventure before buckling down to the beginnings of adult life.</p> <p>If all had gone to plan, the 19-year-old would have flown home from Cyprus with nothing more than a few lively gap year stories to show for it, and by now would presumably have been happily settled into university life.</p> <p>Instead it is by all accounts a broken young woman who returns to Britain this week. She still bears the stain of her conviction for supposedly lying about being gang-raped in the resort of Ayia Napa, despite grave concerns about how that verdict was reached. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/07/cyprus-case-british-teenager-given-suspended-sentence\" title=\"\">The suspended sentence she has just been handed</a> looks suspiciously like a fudge designed to get Cyprus out of a politically embarrassing situation, allowing her to leave the country and international outrage to die down while resolving none of the questions raised by her conviction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/31/cyprus-case-rape-victims-women\">The Cyprus case shows how easily rape victims are let down and distrusted | Joan Smith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>False accusations of rape do happen, although they are vanishingly rare. And of course, where they are made deliberately, they should carry serious consequences. But the facts of this case are so disturbing that it\u2019s impossible to feel justice has been done. The judge talked magnanimously of giving a teenager a \u201csecond chance\u201d, presenting the fine and four-month suspended sentence he dished out as a gesture of compassion, given that he could, in theory, have jailed her. But many will ask whether she really got a first chance. This is, after all, a young woman who retracted her original allegation of rape only after a lengthy police interrogation with no lawyer present. A pathologist testified that she had injuries consistent with being attacked. The group of young Israeli men she originally accused of bursting in \u2013 while she was having consensual sex in a hotel room with one of their friends \u2013 and raping her were not required to testify, yet still the judge seemed convinced she wasn\u2019t telling the truth.</p> <p>So the dispiriting message conveyed to young women travelling abroad, and not just to Cyprus, is that if something terrible happens then it\u2019s probably safest not to tell. Better to cry your tears in private and jump on the first plane home than play Russian roulette with a system that might not be on your side. It\u2019s daunting enough for rape victims in Britain to face reliving everything in court, but how many would be brave enough to risk ending up like this young woman, who spent weeks on remand in prison while the men she accused flew home, and is now said to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and hallucinations?</p> <p>Her lawyers are expected to lodge an appeal now, but that could take years to grind its way through the system, and in the meantime she must plan for a career that isn\u2019t incompatible with a criminal conviction. Her identity, which has been withheld by the press, is bandied about in the darker recesses of the internet; film of her having consensual sex with her Israeli boyfriend in Ayia Napa was posted on porn sites. Her lawyers are frank about how hard it will be for her to put all this behind her. In Cyprus, meanwhile, this must look like a missed chance to reform what women\u2019s groups say is a criminal justice system sorely in need of it. It\u2019s not just tourists but women permanently living on the island who could have benefited from an honest examination of what went wrong in this case.</p> <p>In the circumstances it may be some time before British parents feel relaxed about their daughters jetting off to Ayia Napa for a post A-level summer of partying. But cheap sun, sea, cocktails and clubbing are a potent draw for teenagers filled with the blithe sense of invincibility that comes with being 18, and watching the world open up in front of you. It would be wholly wrong to tell our daughters to narrow their horizons and stay home, and even if we tried, it\u2019s unlikely they would listen at an age where parental nagging is just white noise. (Although it wouldn\u2019t hurt for parents of sons to deliver some blunt reminders about consent before packing their boys off on a gap year.)</p> <p>So after a while, calls to boycott Cyprus will probably fade from public consciousness, not least because it\u2019s hardly the only exotic destination in which young women might fear an unsympathetic hearing from the criminal justice system. If the idea behind this suspended sentence was to make a difficult diplomatic incident go away, while shielding the island\u2019s tourism industry from any more bad publicity, then the depressing truth is that it will probably work in the long run. Ayia Napa, and all the places like it around the world, will party on.</p> <p>But what remains is an uncomfortable reminder of the price too often paid for speaking up about sexual violence; how often blame and shame clings, however unfairly, to the woman involved. It will be rather longer before most women are capable of forgetting that.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "All she wanted was one last summer adventure before buckling down to the beginnings of adult life. If all had gone to plan, the 19-year-old would have flown home from Cyprus with nothing more than a few lively gap year stories to show for it, and by now would presumably have been happily settled into university life. Instead it is by all accounts a broken young woman who returns to Britain this week. She still bears the stain of her conviction for supposedly lying about being gang-raped in the resort of Ayia Napa, despite grave concerns about how that verdict was reached. The suspended sentence she has just been handed looks suspiciously like a fudge designed to get Cyprus out of a politically embarrassing situation, allowing her to leave the country and international outrage to die down while resolving none of the questions raised by her conviction. False accusations of rape do happen, although they are vanishingly rare. And of course, where they are made deliberately, they should carry serious consequences. But the facts of this case are so disturbing that it\u2019s impossible to feel justice has been done. The judge talked magnanimously of giving a teenager a \u201csecond chance\u201d, presenting the fine and four-month suspended sentence he dished out as a gesture of compassion, given that he could, in theory, have jailed her. But many will ask whether she really got a first chance. This is, after all, a young woman who retracted her original allegation of rape only after a lengthy police interrogation with no lawyer present. A pathologist testified that she had injuries consistent with being attacked. The group of young Israeli men she originally accused of bursting in \u2013 while she was having consensual sex in a hotel room with one of their friends \u2013 and raping her were not required to testify, yet still the judge seemed convinced she wasn\u2019t telling the truth. So the dispiriting message conveyed to young women travelling abroad, and not just to Cyprus, is that if something terrible happens then it\u2019s probably safest not to tell. Better to cry your tears in private and jump on the first plane home than play Russian roulette with a system that might not be on your side. It\u2019s daunting enough for rape victims in Britain to face reliving everything in court, but how many would be brave enough to risk ending up like this young woman, who spent weeks on remand in prison while the men she accused flew home, and is now said to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and hallucinations? Her lawyers are expected to lodge an appeal now, but that could take years to grind its way through the system, and in the meantime she must plan for a career that isn\u2019t incompatible with a criminal conviction. Her identity, which has been withheld by the press, is bandied about in the darker recesses of the internet; film of her having consensual sex with her Israeli boyfriend in Ayia Napa was posted on porn sites. Her lawyers are frank about how hard it will be for her to put all this behind her. In Cyprus, meanwhile, this must look like a missed chance to reform what women\u2019s groups say is a criminal justice system sorely in need of it. It\u2019s not just tourists but women permanently living on the island who could have benefited from an honest examination of what went wrong in this case. In the circumstances it may be some time before British parents feel relaxed about their daughters jetting off to Ayia Napa for a post A-level summer of partying. But cheap sun, sea, cocktails and clubbing are a potent draw for teenagers filled with the blithe sense of invincibility that comes with being 18, and watching the world open up in front of you. It would be wholly wrong to tell our daughters to narrow their horizons and stay home, and even if we tried, it\u2019s unlikely they would listen at an age where parental nagging is just white noise. (Although it wouldn\u2019t hurt for parents of sons to deliver some blunt reminders about consent before packing their boys off on a gap year.) So after a while, calls to boycott Cyprus will probably fade from public consciousness, not least because it\u2019s hardly the only exotic destination in which young women might fear an unsympathetic hearing from the criminal justice system. If the idea behind this suspended sentence was to make a difficult diplomatic incident go away, while shielding the island\u2019s tourism industry from any more bad publicity, then the depressing truth is that it will probably work in the long run. Ayia Napa, and all the places like it around the world, will party on. But what remains is an uncomfortable reminder of the price too often paid for speaking up about sexual violence; how often blame and shame clings, however unfairly, to the woman involved. It will be rather longer before most women are capable of forgetting that. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

Out of 35 investigations launched by military police over the past five years, only six people have been found guilty, data from a Guardian investigation shows. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) admitted the number of cases investigated by military police services for the army, navy and RAF was already low. The army\u2019s Royal Military Police (RMP), which carried out 22 of the investigations, referred 13 cases to the Service Prosecuting Authority (SPA), the organisation within the MoD that initiates and conducts prosecutions in criminal cases. However, just six of those army cases ended up being directed to court martial over the past five years, according to statistics revealed under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. Of those, four soldiers were found guilty, one was acquitted and another is currently awaiting trial. The other two guilty verdicts across the military as a whole concerned members of the RAF and the navy. The figures come as the independent ombudsman overseeing complaints in the armed forces warned in December that incidents of racism in the armed forces were happening with \u201cincreasing and depressing frequency\u201d. Emma Norton, head of legal casework at the civil rights group Liberty, told the Guardian: \u201cThese stark figures suggest large numbers of BAME service personnel are suffering in silence and feel unable or unsupported to report allegations of racism and pursue complaints.\u201d \u201cWe know from other sources that disproportionate numbers of BAME service personnel have disclosed experiencing bullying, harassment and discrimination. Many service men and women are discouraged from pursuing complaints for fear of harm to their careers.\u201d She added that the MoD urgently needed to ensure that anyone making complaints was properly supported if racism in the armed forces was to be taken seriously. Ahmed Al-Nahhas, a solicitor and head of military claims at Bolt Burdon Kemp, said: \u201cThe figures really are quite stark and I am afraid that in my practice I have become very cynical about the choices that are made in relation to when matters are referred to the SPA. \u201cI see a lot of cases involving racial harassment where, for example, there might be an informal chat with a complainant and then attempts are made to try to water down charges. \u201cI do wonder about the number of cases where, for example, individuals get assaulted but a racial element is not ultimately recorded.\u201d The MoD failed to provide figures in response to FOI requests for the number of referrals to the SPA by the Royal Naval Police and Royal Air Force Police following investigations into allegations of racially aggravated crimes in the ranks of those services. However, statistics published online by the MoD for courts martial records that one RAF senior aircraftman was found guilty in 2018 for \u201cusing racially aggravated threatening abusive or insulting words or behaviour\u201d. In 2017, a leading hand in the navy was given a \u00a32,000 fine after being charged with racially aggravated harassment. The degree of punishment in the army has varied. A lance corporal in the Mercian regiment was dismissed in 2017 after being found guilty of \u201cracial aggravated fear or provocation of violence\u201d. But other cases in that year included a private in the Princess of Wales\u2019s royal regiment who was punished with 90 days\u2019 detention after being found guilty of racially aggravated harassment and using threatening, abusive or provocative behaviour. A trooper in the Household Cavalry was \u201cadmonished\u201d after being found guilty of racially aggravated assault. An MoD spokesperson said: \u201cRacism has no place in the military and anyone found to be behaving in such a way can expect to be disciplined, discharged or dismissed. \u201cWe are committed to stamping it out and have a range of measures to ensure that this issue is tackled. \u201cThis includes creating a new team to deal more quickly and effectively with complaints by service personnel of racism, shifting the culture of the armed forces so that everyone feels included, with even more emphasis on stronger leadership action and improved education and training.\u201d A report earlier this year by Air Chief Marshal Michael Wigston concluded that the armed forces had unacceptable levels of sexual offences, discrimination and bullying because of a pack mentality among the mostly white, middle-aged men who make up the senior ranks.",

She thinks successful LAT relationships achieve a balance between independence and emotional commitment. \u201cIt allows for something called individuation,\u201d she says. Some people might like a \u201ccalm space to go to, or a little meditation room\u201d \u2013 a more extreme version of the garden shed bolt hole. But presumably some have more mundane wishes, such as a space where lids are replaced on bottles and jars, and the toilet flushed. Either way, living apart together \u201cgives you breathing space\u201d, she says.</p> <p>Nurturing self-reliance is a skill that cohabitees can learn from those in LAT relationships. \u201cWhen people complain, \u2018My husband doesn\u2019t support me\u2019, or \u2018My wife isn\u2019t there for me emotionally\u2019, those are very important observations in a relationship,\u201d Beresford says. \u201cBut we must never expect someone else to rescue us. Emotionally, we need to be resilient. It\u2019s the opposite of codependency and collapsing on your partner.\u201d</p> <p>Living apart together can make it easier to find breathing space in a relationship, but sustaining a support network, and pursuing outside interests can create the same sense of space and individuation in a cohabiting dynamic.</p> <p>Beresford also thinks that LAT scenarios show a healthy realism away from the traditional fairytale of lasting love under one roof. \u201cIf we are going to live to 110, some of our relationships might have a life expectancy of more than 80 years,\u201d she says. Practical changes might be necessary to make a relationship endure.</p> <p>But Simon Duncan, emeritus professor in social policy at the University of Bradford, who has written about LAT relationships in the book Reinventing Couples, sounds a note of caution. Often the choice to live apart can be a \u201cnegative preference\u201d \u2013 a choice to preserve the relationship when living together is unbearable. He cites one woman whose partner\u2019s \u201chardcore\u201d green lifestyle meant a lack of washing and no central heating.</p> <p>As Beresford points out, the possibility of escape that a separate home provides can mean that \u201cnothing gets resolved, nothing gets processed. Millions of people make it work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there are important skills that no one should run away from \u2013 around compromise, respect and accommodation.\u201d</p>",

But presumably some have more mundane wishes, such as a space where lids are replaced on bottles and jars, and the toilet flushed. Either way, living apart together \u201cgives you breathing space\u201d, she says. Nurturing self-reliance is a skill that cohabitees can learn from those in LAT relationships. \u201cWhen people complain, \u2018My husband doesn\u2019t support me\u2019, or \u2018My wife isn\u2019t there for me emotionally\u2019, those are very important observations in a relationship,\u201d Beresford says. \u201cBut we must never expect someone else to rescue us. Emotionally, we need to be resilient. It\u2019s the opposite of codependency and collapsing on your partner.\u201d Living apart together can make it easier to find breathing space in a relationship, but sustaining a support network, and pursuing outside interests can create the same sense of space and individuation in a cohabiting dynamic. Beresford also thinks that LAT scenarios show a healthy realism away from the traditional fairytale of lasting love under one roof. \u201cIf we are going to live to 110, some of our relationships might have a life expectancy of more than 80 years,\u201d she says. Practical changes might be necessary to make a relationship endure. But Simon Duncan, emeritus professor in social policy at the University of Bradford, who has written about LAT relationships in the book Reinventing Couples, sounds a note of caution. Often the choice to live apart can be a \u201cnegative preference\u201d \u2013 a choice to preserve the relationship when living together is unbearable. He cites one woman whose partner\u2019s \u201chardcore\u201d green lifestyle meant a lack of washing and no central heating. As Beresford points out, the possibility of escape that a separate home provides can mean that \u201cnothing gets resolved, nothing gets processed. Millions of people make it work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there are important skills that no one should run away from \u2013 around compromise, respect and accommodation.\u201d",

The charity is supporting those who want to build community action groups to put pressure on councils to adopt climate action plans. The aim is to build upwards to push the government to adopt a national action plan that will put the UK on a path to net-zero emissions by 2045 by tackling transport, heating, energy and agriculture. \u201cThis will be the backbone of our campaigning this year,\u201d says Claire Norman of FOE.</p> <p>Extinction Rebellion encourages anyone in an area without a local group to set one up.

      "bodyText": "A teenager with neo-Nazi views who planned a terror attack in Durham has been sentenced to six years and eight months in custody. The 17-year-old identified potential targets including schools, pubs and post offices, in a \u201cguerrilla warfare\u201d manual. Police seized documents \u2013 including one that contained details of a plan to carry out an arson campaign against synagogues \u2013 and a collection of far-right literature from his bedroom in March last year. He was also found to have researched firearms, explosives and knives by officers who analysed his computer and mobile phone devices. The then 16-year-old was the youngest person to be convicted of planning a terrorist attack in the UK during a trial in which he described himself as a \u201cnatural sadist\u201d. During his sentencing at Manchester crown court on Tuesday, the court heard of his \u201cadmiration\u201d for Adolf Hitler and fixation on the Columbine high school massacre, in which two teenagers killed 13 people in the US in 1999. Judge David Stockdale described the defendant as a \u201chighly intelligent\u201d boy who had \u201ccontempt for Jewish people, black people, gay people and disabled people\u201d. He added that his \u201ctwisted and many would say sick ideological path\u201d was a \u201cmatter of obvious regret\u201d. Alongside the custodial sentence for preparing terrorist acts between October 2017 and March 2019, the teenager will also serve five years on licence after his release. Following a six-week trial the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty in November. He was also convicted of disseminating a terrorist publication, possessing an article for a purpose connected to terrorism, and three counts of possessing documents useful to someone preparing acts of terrorism. Defending, Nigel Edwards QC argued that the teenager\u2019s offending should be viewed in the context of his autism, citing a psychiatric assessment in which a doctor had taken the view that his \u201ccognitive age was significantly affected by his disability\u201d. The defendant said he had no intention of carrying out any attacks and claimed he had adopted a fake rightwing persona for \u201cshock value\u201d. Edwards told the court the teenager\u2019s parents \u201cdidn\u2019t believe there was anything wrong\u201d and had not engaged in adequate intervention, including therapeutic treatment, for his condition for fear of \u201clabelling\u201d him. He added that the boy\u2019s hostility towards certain groups of people was influenced \u201cby how he perceived the world around him\u201d and that he had been allowed to spend long periods in his darkened bedroom with his laptop. Stockdale said he took both the fact the boy had an autistic spectrum disorder, and a letter he had written expressing his remorse, into account during sentencing. The boy\u2019s young age was also a mitigating factor, according to Stockdale, who said it was a \u201cmost disturbing\u201d aspect of the case. He added he believed the boy had sought both acceptance and to make himself \u201cimportant, controversial and shocking\u201d by posting his views in an online neo-Nazi forum. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 January 2020. An earlier version mistakenly said the defendant\u2019s sentence was for crimes committed \u201cbetween October 2019 and March 2019\u201d. This has been corrected.",

      "body": "<p>Ben Stokes had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/15/ben-stokes-redemption-story-world-cup-tour-de-force\" title=\"\">very satisfactory 2019</a>. Well, 2020 has not started too badly either. With the shadows lengthening under Table Mountain late on the fifth afternoon of a memorable match it was, inevitably, Stokes who sealed a famous England victory by 189 runs. He was the man to snatch the last three wickets just when it seemed that a determined South Africa side might hang on for a draw.</p> <p>Hard-fought victories are the most satisfying and England had to toil for 137.4 overs for this one. They were hampered by an injury to Jimmy Anderson, a pitch that stubbornly declined to deteriorate under a hot sun and some gutsy batting from the home side. With 12 overs remaining South Africa were 241 for seven and Stokes had a ball that was 54 overs old as he ran in from the Wynberg End. Throughout an arduous day England had dug out five batsmen but Dwaine Pretorius and Vernon Philander, the batsmen at the crease, were capable obstacles.</p> <p>Stokes, though, has a habit of ignoring conventional hurdles. In he charged for one final spell propelling that old ball at 90 mph. Once again he would not be denied. He beat the bat of Pretorius several times; he snorted and glared down the pitch to indicate he was going to prevail in the end.</p> <p>When Philander rejected a single at the end of an over from Dom Bess, Pretorius was still exposed. In came Stokes again, for an edge and a diving catch from Joe Root on a day when England seized every chance that came their way and the game had turned yet again. Next came Anrich Nortje, the nightwatchman of Centurion. In steamed Stokes, another edge flew into the slip cordon and Zak Crawley parried the ball with his right hand before falling to the ground to catch it calmly with his left. Kasigo Rabada negotiated the hat-trick ball but England had to wait only four overs more for the final wicket, that of Philander.</p> <p>At last the surface offered some help as Stokes ran in again; this time the ball popped and was sliced to Ollie Pope in the gully. One-all in the series and so much to play for, so much to anticipate as England conjured their first overseas victory since the Test in St Lucia and their best for much longer than that.</p> <p>It always felt this would be a long day, in which patience would be required, even though the nightwatchman, Keshav Maharaj, did not dally long. In the third over he was struck on the pads by a straight delivery from Anderson and so became the first batsman of the match to be lbw. Correctly, He did not consider a review for very long before setting off for the pavilion.</p> <p>Faf du Plessis has yet to fire in this series; here he occupied 18 overs without much bother before a rare attacking shot caused his demise. From outside off-stump he swept at an off-break from Bess and middled the ball straight to Joe Denly at square-leg. Even though this was not a classic dismissal it was no more than Bess deserved, if only for his perseverance. He bowled respectably all day but the pitch was bland, the ball really turned only out of the rough and, when the right-handers were on strike, the bowlers\u2019 footmarks were out of play. His rewards have been slim but he has bowled better than anyone could expect given his lack of preparation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fcfbea7968466e63cedb02aa16807ed176153c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fcfbea7968466e63cedb02aa16807ed176153c7/135_130_3319_1991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England players celebrate victory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England players celebrate victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hutchings/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Root took the new ball just before lunch. Anderson bowled one over with it but did not resume after the break. He was a spectator all afternoon, sometimes from the pavilion as it became apparent something was wrong. It transpired he has a problem with his side, a nightmare injury for a fast bowler. After tea he would bowl two more overs but it was soon evident he was struggling.</p> <p>In that afternoon session only one wicket fell, that of Pieter Malan, who batted over six hours for his 84. He was surprised by the extra bounce extracted by Sam Curran and the edge, as ever, was held by the alert Stokes at second slip. Malan had relished batting on his home ground. There was barely an indiscretion during his 288-ball innings and there was no disgrace in the way he played his final delivery.</p> <p>So Malan has proved quite a find, even though he has been around for a decade at domestic level. His judgment of what to leave was impeccable, his technique sound and his concentration sure. Here was the virtue of having a 30-year-old debutant; he clearly knows his game inside out. Rassie van der Dussen, another 30-year-old whose first game was at Centurion, is in the same category. He was happy in defence and not bothered about scoring runs.</p> <p>Quinton de Kock naturally scores more freely and he proceeded without too many alarms to his half-century. Sometimes he was inconvenienced by Denly\u2019s leg-breaks when they pitched in the footmarks outside his off-stump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the leg-break that dismissed him did not land in the rough; it was far too short for that. De Kock sensed more runs but his pull shot was poorly executed. He hit the ball quite hard but straight towards mid-wicket and Crawley held a fine catch above his head.</p> <p>Then came a little moment of magic. Stuart Broad was trying some leg-cutters, most of which were met with the dead bat of Van der Dussen. Someone decided \u2013 and in these circumstances the captain must take the credit \u2013 that Anderson should move from silly mid-on to leg slip, a position rarely employed in the modern game.

      "bodyText": "Ben Stokes had a very satisfactory 2019. Well, 2020 has not started too badly either. With the shadows lengthening under Table Mountain late on the fifth afternoon of a memorable match it was, inevitably, Stokes who sealed a famous England victory by 189 runs. He was the man to snatch the last three wickets just when it seemed that a determined South Africa side might hang on for a draw. Hard-fought victories are the most satisfying and England had to toil for 137.4 overs for this one. They were hampered by an injury to Jimmy Anderson, a pitch that stubbornly declined to deteriorate under a hot sun and some gutsy batting from the home side. With 12 overs remaining South Africa were 241 for seven and Stokes had a ball that was 54 overs old as he ran in from the Wynberg End. Throughout an arduous day England had dug out five batsmen but Dwaine Pretorius and Vernon Philander, the batsmen at the crease, were capable obstacles. Stokes, though, has a habit of ignoring conventional hurdles. In he charged for one final spell propelling that old ball at 90 mph. Once again he would not be denied. He beat the bat of Pretorius several times; he snorted and glared down the pitch to indicate he was going to prevail in the end. When Philander rejected a single at the end of an over from Dom Bess, Pretorius was still exposed. In came Stokes again, for an edge and a diving catch from Joe Root on a day when England seized every chance that came their way and the game had turned yet again. Next came Anrich Nortje, the nightwatchman of Centurion. In steamed Stokes, another edge flew into the slip cordon and Zak Crawley parried the ball with his right hand before falling to the ground to catch it calmly with his left. Kasigo Rabada negotiated the hat-trick ball but England had to wait only four overs more for the final wicket, that of Philander. At last the surface offered some help as Stokes ran in again; this time the ball popped and was sliced to Ollie Pope in the gully. One-all in the series and so much to play for, so much to anticipate as England conjured their first overseas victory since the Test in St Lucia and their best for much longer than that. It always felt this would be a long day, in which patience would be required, even though the nightwatchman, Keshav Maharaj, did not dally long. In the third over he was struck on the pads by a straight delivery from Anderson and so became the first batsman of the match to be lbw. Correctly, He did not consider a review for very long before setting off for the pavilion. Faf du Plessis has yet to fire in this series; here he occupied 18 overs without much bother before a rare attacking shot caused his demise. From outside off-stump he swept at an off-break from Bess and middled the ball straight to Joe Denly at square-leg. Even though this was not a classic dismissal it was no more than Bess deserved, if only for his perseverance. He bowled respectably all day but the pitch was bland, the ball really turned only out of the rough and, when the right-handers were on strike, the bowlers\u2019 footmarks were out of play. His rewards have been slim but he has bowled better than anyone could expect given his lack of preparation. Root took the new ball just before lunch. Anderson bowled one over with it but did not resume after the break. He was a spectator all afternoon, sometimes from the pavilion as it became apparent something was wrong. It transpired he has a problem with his side, a nightmare injury for a fast bowler. After tea he would bowl two more overs but it was soon evident he was struggling. In that afternoon session only one wicket fell, that of Pieter Malan, who batted over six hours for his 84. He was surprised by the extra bounce extracted by Sam Curran and the edge, as ever, was held by the alert Stokes at second slip. Malan had relished batting on his home ground. There was barely an indiscretion during his 288-ball innings and there was no disgrace in the way he played his final delivery. So Malan has proved quite a find, even though he has been around for a decade at domestic level. His judgment of what to leave was impeccable, his technique sound and his concentration sure. Here was the virtue of having a 30-year-old debutant; he clearly knows his game inside out. Rassie van der Dussen, another 30-year-old whose first game was at Centurion, is in the same category. He was happy in defence and not bothered about scoring runs. Quinton de Kock naturally scores more freely and he proceeded without too many alarms to his half-century. Sometimes he was inconvenienced by Denly\u2019s leg-breaks when they pitched in the footmarks outside his off-stump. However, the leg-break that dismissed him did not land in the rough; it was far too short for that. De Kock sensed more runs but his pull shot was poorly executed. He hit the ball quite hard but straight towards mid-wicket and Crawley held a fine catch above his head. Then came a little moment of magic. Stuart Broad was trying some leg-cutters, most of which were met with the dead bat of Van der Dussen. Someone decided \u2013 and in these circumstances the captain must take the credit \u2013 that Anderson should move from silly mid-on to leg slip, a position rarely employed in the modern game. Next ball, Broad propelled a delivery just outside leg-stump; the batsman instinctively glanced and the ball sped straight into the hands of Anderson. A stroke of genius or luck? The Broad version is awaited. This opened the way for the grandstand finish which has, of course, become Stokes\u2019 speciality.",

The reason for coming all this way to meet them is that, while Wild is confined to a wheelchair and no longer well enough to travel, the life and work of the two artists is so intertwined it would be hard to understand one without the other. It\u2019s a pilgrimage that has already been made by the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/sep/23/rosalind-nashashibi-film-art\">Rosalind Nashashibi</a>, whose film Vivian\u2019s Garden was part of her shortlisted 2017 Turner prize entry.</p> <p>Wild was born in Vienna in 1922 to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother, who fled Nazism, ending up in Argentina. While working there as textile designer, she met and married Suter\u2019s factory owner father, before fleeing back to Europe to escape the dictatorship of Juan Per\u00f3n. Settling in Basel with their 12-year-old daughter, they set up a furniture shop where Wild turned her skills to cabinet painting. \u201cI would go to flea markets and find old furniture and restore it,\u201d she says, leafing through an album of exquisitely painted work. </p> <p>Suter recovered from all this uprooting to secure a place at art school in Basel at just 17. Within three years, she had landed her first group show. She made her solo debut a year later. When did Wild first know her daughter was an artist? \u201cAlways,\u201d she says. The closeness between the two women is evident as they chat, gently challenging each other\u2019s versions of history in a mixture of German, English and Spanish. They live yards apart in separate bungalows, with their shared artistic heritage covering the walls of both, from a couple of intricate botanical watercolours by Wild\u2019s grandmother to a scattering of large abstracts painted by Pancho as a child.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I look at my mother's collages and sometimes, when she's not there, I quickly move something. But she always notices</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mother and daughter have exhibited several times together, most recently in Los Angeles, where a critic\u2019s remark that their work was \u201ccompositionally diametric yet chromatically in sync\u201d captured the creative tension between them. While Suter works in a bold freestyle, often very quickly, in collaboration with whatever the weather throws at her, Wild sits at a desk snipping and glueing, composing a small geometric collage every day from architecture and lifestyle magazines. While Suter leaves all her work undated and unsigned, Wild painstakingly signs and logs every piece for storage in a painted chest which is the only piece of her furniture that made the journey to Guatemala.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9965e4e899a89033adb586bb27eb66ba98f33efc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9965e4e899a89033adb586bb27eb66ba98f33efc/0_0_7860_5104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A joint exhibition of Suter and Wild\u2019s work in 2018 at Toronto\u2019s Power Plant gallery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A joint exhibition of Suter and Wild\u2019s work in 2018 at Toronto\u2019s Power Plant gallery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toni Hafkenscheid</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I ask Wild how she would describe her daughter\u2019s work, there is a long silence. \u201cSometimes,\u201d cuts in Suter, \u201cI showed my mother my things and I couldn\u2019t stand her comments so I stopped showing her.\u201d She admits that she too can be judgmental: \u201cI look at my mother\u2019s collages and sometimes, when she\u2019s not there, I quickly move something. But she always notices. We have a relationship, and sometimes individually, without speaking about it, we make similar things. The spirit is the same.\u201d</p> <p>Suter\u2019s response to a question about the impact of her mother\u2019s criticism is to lead me up a perilous flight of stone steps laid into the hillside to a studio that is most definitely not wheelchair-friendly. She does most of her work outside it, squeezed into a narrow gap between its side wall and the encroaching forest, \u201cbecause I really like painting while squished\u201d. Bare white canvases lean against the bright red wall waiting for her to start work on her next big project, a commission from <a href=\"https://art.tfl.gov.uk/\">Art on the Underground</a> for London\u2019s Stratford station. For such big works this seems less than ideal, and the peril of her perch is greatly increased by the mess of old paint cans that litter the ground.</p> <p>For all the nimbleness with which she flits around \u2013 a slight, otherworldly figure with a drift of auburn hair \u2013 there is an anxiety in her relationship with her surroundings. She has fortressed her garden with towering spears of bamboo. One wall of her studio has a built-in cupboard, the door of which stands ajar. \u201cThere\u2019s probably some good paint in there but I haven\u2019t looked for years.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause it\u2019s probably got scary things in it.\u201d Like what? \u201cLike snakes maybe.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>A mudslide covered everything she had created.

In 2005, a hurricane sent a mudslide hurtling over everything she had created. \u201cAt the time I saw it as just a catastrophe,\u201d she says, \u201cbut as they started drying, the colours began to come out, and I realised that I had to start working with nature and not against it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1bff1e7d8ad1b840cd068cf791ed8be1e213e82f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bff1e7d8ad1b840cd068cf791ed8be1e213e82f/0_0_1088_722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A large canvas dries in the \u2018laager\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A large canvas dries in the \u2018laager\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Regen/Courtesy the artist and Gladstone Gallery, New York and Brussels</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThen I started leaving them outside in the rain so that they could get splashed. It was a turning-point which transformed everything. It made all I do into one work \u2013 and that\u2019s how I see it now, not as single pieces but as a whole.\u201d One of the ruined paintings hangs above her bed. It\u2019s a rich burgundy that looks simultaneously cosy and sacramental. In a gesture, perhaps, to her truce with nature, she has hung it upside down so that its top 18 inches, rather than its bottom, is caked with mud.</p> <p>Does she ever tire of the isolation? \u201cWhy would I?\u201d she says. \u201cMy best friend is here. The question is what will happen when she goes.\u201d Towards the end of lunch, when Suter is out of earshot, I ask Wild again what she makes of her daughter\u2019s work. This time there\u2019s no hesitation. She leans back in her chair with a smile and says: \u201cIt\u2019s free \u2013 in a good way.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/vivian-suter\">Vivian Suter\u2019s Nisyros (Vivian\u2019s Bed) is at Tate Liverpool </a>until 15 March; Tintin\u2019s Sofa is <a href=\"https://www.camdenartscentre.org/vivian-suter/\">Camden Arts Centre, London</a>, 16 January-5 April.

On reaching Lake Atitl\u00e1n in Guatemala, she decided to stay, entranced by its fierce beauty and remoteness. \u201cNobody told me there was a war going on,\u201d she says. She fell in love, remarried (again briefly) and gave birth to a son, Pancho, now 34, who lives on the other side of the lake but has recently turned one of the sheds on the slopes of his mother\u2019s garden into a recording studio. Suter is not sure if he will join us for lunch because a Nicaraguan rapper is about to turn up. Pancho has adopted his grandmother\u2019s surname, and she in turn snaps up his cast-off clothes, greeting us for lunch in a badass graffiti T-shirt. Wild, too, has been enjoying a renaissance. A solo show in Dubai in 2019 will next year be followed by a retrospective at Vienna\u2019s Museum of Modern Art. The reason for coming all this way to meet them is that, while Wild is confined to a wheelchair and no longer well enough to travel, the life and work of the two artists is so intertwined it would be hard to understand one without the other. It\u2019s a pilgrimage that has already been made by the artist Rosalind Nashashibi, whose film Vivian\u2019s Garden was part of her shortlisted 2017 Turner prize entry. Wild was born in Vienna in 1922 to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother, who fled Nazism, ending up in Argentina. While working there as textile designer, she met and married Suter\u2019s factory owner father, before fleeing back to Europe to escape the dictatorship of Juan Per\u00f3n. Settling in Basel with their 12-year-old daughter, they set up a furniture shop where Wild turned her skills to cabinet painting. \u201cI would go to flea markets and find old furniture and restore it,\u201d she says, leafing through an album of exquisitely painted work. Suter recovered from all this uprooting to secure a place at art school in Basel at just 17. Within three years, she had landed her first group show. She made her solo debut a year later. When did Wild first know her daughter was an artist? \u201cAlways,\u201d she says. The closeness between the two women is evident as they chat, gently challenging each other\u2019s versions of history in a mixture of German, English and Spanish. They live yards apart in separate bungalows, with their shared artistic heritage covering the walls of both, from a couple of intricate botanical watercolours by Wild\u2019s grandmother to a scattering of large abstracts painted by Pancho as a child. Mother and daughter have exhibited several times together, most recently in Los Angeles, where a critic\u2019s remark that their work was \u201ccompositionally diametric yet chromatically in sync\u201d captured the creative tension between them. While Suter works in a bold freestyle, often very quickly, in collaboration with whatever the weather throws at her, Wild sits at a desk snipping and glueing, composing a small geometric collage every day from architecture and lifestyle magazines. While Suter leaves all her work undated and unsigned, Wild painstakingly signs and logs every piece for storage in a painted chest which is the only piece of her furniture that made the journey to Guatemala. When I ask Wild how she would describe her daughter\u2019s work, there is a long silence. \u201cSometimes,\u201d cuts in Suter, \u201cI showed my mother my things and I couldn\u2019t stand her comments so I stopped showing her.\u201d She admits that she too can be judgmental: \u201cI look at my mother\u2019s collages and sometimes, when she\u2019s not there, I quickly move something. But she always notices. We have a relationship, and sometimes individually, without speaking about it, we make similar things. The spirit is the same.\u201d Suter\u2019s response to a question about the impact of her mother\u2019s criticism is to lead me up a perilous flight of stone steps laid into the hillside to a studio that is most definitely not wheelchair-friendly. She does most of her work outside it, squeezed into a narrow gap between its side wall and the encroaching forest, \u201cbecause I really like painting while squished\u201d. Bare white canvases lean against the bright red wall waiting for her to start work on her next big project, a commission from Art on the Underground for London\u2019s Stratford station. For such big works this seems less than ideal, and the peril of her perch is greatly increased by the mess of old paint cans that litter the ground. For all the nimbleness with which she flits around \u2013 a slight, otherworldly figure with a drift of auburn hair \u2013 there is an anxiety in her relationship with her surroundings. She has fortressed her garden with towering spears of bamboo. One wall of her studio has a built-in cupboard, the door of which stands ajar. \u201cThere\u2019s probably some good paint in there but I haven\u2019t looked for years.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause it\u2019s probably got scary things in it.\u201d Like what? \u201cLike snakes maybe.\u201d She knows from bitter experience how dangerous this environment can be, and her respect for it has become the keystone of her work. In 2005, a hurricane sent a mudslide hurtling over everything she had created. \u201cAt the time I saw it as just a catastrophe,\u201d she says, \u201cbut as they started drying, the colours began to come out, and I realised that I had to start working with nature and not against it. \u201cThen I started leaving them outside in the rain so that they could get splashed. It was a turning-point which transformed everything. It made all I do into one work \u2013 and that\u2019s how I see it now, not as single pieces but as a whole.\u201d One of the ruined paintings hangs above her bed. It\u2019s a rich burgundy that looks simultaneously cosy and sacramental. In a gesture, perhaps, to her truce with nature, she has hung it upside down so that its top 18 inches, rather than its bottom, is caked with mud. Does she ever tire of the isolation? \u201cWhy would I?\u201d she says. \u201cMy best friend is here. The question is what will happen when she goes.\u201d Towards the end of lunch, when Suter is out of earshot, I ask Wild again what she makes of her daughter\u2019s work. This time there\u2019s no hesitation. She leans back in her chair with a smile and says: \u201cIt\u2019s free \u2013 in a good way.\u201d Vivian Suter\u2019s Nisyros (Vivian\u2019s Bed) is at Tate Liverpool until 15 March; Tintin\u2019s Sofa is Camden Arts Centre, London, 16 January-5 April. She is part of En Plein Air at the High Line, New York, until March.",

      "bodyText": "Spain will be led by a coalition government for the first time in 80 years after the acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, narrowly secured parliamentary approval for a joint administration between his Socialist party and the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance. The investiture vote on Tuesday, which S\u00e1nchez won by 167 votes to 165, with 18 abstentions, ends the nine months of political deadlock resulting from two inconclusive general elections last year. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE), which finished first in both elections but fell well short of a majority on each occasion, moved quickly to reach a governing pact with Unidas Podemos after the poll in November. Key to S\u00e1nchez\u2019s tight victory was the abstention of the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party (ERC), which agreed to sit out the investiture vote after S\u00e1nchez vowed to find a solution to the \u201cpolitical conflict\u201d that has dogged Spain since Catalonia\u2019s separatist regional government tried to secede in 2017. S\u00e1nchez and his party have insisted that the negotiations will have to respect the constitution and stressed their commitment to maintaining Spain\u2019s territorial unity. The ERC soon made it very clear the new central government should not take its support for granted, with the MP Montserrat Bassa telling congress she \u201cdidn\u2019t give a damn about the governability of Spain\u201d. Bassa\u2019s sister, Dolors Bassa, was one of the Catalan leaders jailed in October by Spain\u2019s supreme court over their roles in the failed push for regional independence in autumn 2017. Nevertheless, the ERC kept its word and abstained from the lunchtime vote. The PSOE and Unidas Podemos have promised their joint government will increase the minimum wage, raise taxes on higher earners and big companies, and overhaul some of the labour changes introduced eight years ago when the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) was in power. In a tweet sent after the vote, S\u00e1nchez wrote: \u201cWith the progressive coalition government, Spain is entering a time for the defence of dialogue and useful politics. A government for all people that broadens rights, restores co-existence and fights for social justice. Today is the dawn of a time of moderation, progress and hope.\u201d S\u00e1nchez\u2019s opponents argue his \u201cFrankenstein government\u201d will be too beholden to Catalan separatists and pose an existential threat to Spain\u2019s national unity. While the Socialist leader appealed for calm and consensus, and called on MPs across the political spectrum to \u201covercome the atmosphere of irritation\u201d, his adversaries again went on the offensive. The PP leader, Pablo Casado, accused S\u00e1nchez of being an egotistical \u201cextremist\u201d who had left the country\u2019s future in the hands of \u201cterrorists and coup-mongerers\u201d from Catalonia and the Basque country. \u201cMr S\u00e1nchez, your only homeland is yourself. Instead of being a statesman, you\u2019ve chosen to become a straw man for nationalism,\u201d he said. During the weekend\u2019s intemperate first investiture debate, Casado had branded S\u00e1nchez a \u201csociopath\u201d. The PSOE and Unidas Podemos said the PP, the far-right Vox and the centre-right Citizens party were indulging in hyperbole and scaremongering. Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Unidas Podemos, called on his governing partner to respond to such intolerance with courtesy and \u201cdemocratic resolve\u201d. The session on Tuesday, however, was again largely lacking in the former. MPs from the pro-independence Together for Catalonia abandoned the chamber when Vox spoke, while Vox boycotted the address by the leftwing separatist Basque party EH Bildu. But Tom\u00e1s Guitarte, the sole MP for Teruel Exists \u2013 a party that campaigns to improve conditions in the overlooked eponymous region of eastern Spain \u2013 received an ovation for voting after receiving threats over his decision to back the coalition. Aina Vidal, an MP from Catalonia who took part in the vote despite having cancer, was also honoured with tributes and an ovation. The PSOE took power in June 2018 after using a motion of no confidence to unseat the PP government of Mariano Rajoy, which was tarnished by a series of corruption scandals. But the Socialists have also been tainted by corruption. Nine days after the PSOE\u2019s election victory in November, two of its former presidents in the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda were found guilty of misconduct and misuse of public funds over their roles in a decade-long, \u20ac680m (\u00a3580m) fraud that led to one of Spain\u2019s biggest corruption trials. Despite the new coalition\u2019s ambitious social agenda, it is likely to find itself more preoccupied with the Catalan question and facing aggressive opposition from rightwing parties in a dramatically fragmented political landscape. Last April\u2019s election was triggered after the ERC and Together for Catalonia sided with their enemies on the Spanish right to torpedo the PSOE\u2019s national budget. The PSOE won 120 seats in November - three fewer than in April. The PP rallied in the second election of 2019, to take 89 seats, while Vox\u2019s seat count more than doubled in November, rising from 24 to 52. Podemos came fourth with 35 seats, followed by the ERC with 13 seats. Citizens slumped to sixth place, the 57 seats it picked up in April dwindling to just 10.",

      "bodyText": "It was another torrid year for Britain\u2019s retail industry. Thousands of high street jobs were lost in 2019 as a number of major retailers or restaurant groups collapsed into administration, including Karen Millen, Mothercare\u2019s UK business and Jamie Oliver\u2019s UK restaurant empire. Some firms were rescued out of administration but resorted to shop closures to survive. Retailers were under pressure from weak consumer spending, the shift to online shopping and rising costs resulting from higher business rates and the minimum wage. Fashion chains offered bigger than ever clothing discounts in the run-up to Christmas this year, slashing prices by as much as 50% to lure shoppers. Others, such as Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, which owns chains including Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, closed stores and negotiated rent cuts by using an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), enabling them to stay in business. December The online and pop-up bookseller The Book People went into administration a week before Christmas, putting almost 400 jobs at risk. The online boutique furniture brand Swoon was bought out of administration by its co-founders, Brian Harrison and Debbie Williamson. The camera retailer Jessops called in administrators to its property arm, putting 500 jobs at risk. Clintons, the card retailer, fell into administration but was bought by its existing owners in a pre-agreed deal that protects its 332 stores and 2,500-strong workforce. November Mamas &amp; Papas fell into administration and was immediately bought back by other firms controlled by Bluegem Capital, its private equity owner. Six shops are closing with the loss of nearly 130 jobs. Mothercare announced it is to close all 79 UK stores in \u201cweeks or months\u201d, putting 2,500 retail jobs at risk after collapsing into administration. October Regis, the owner of Supercuts hair salons, went into administration, putting 220 salons and 1,200 staff at risk. Bonmarch\u00e9 had 318 stores and 2,887 employees when it collapsed. The fashion chain is still trading and is set be rescued by Peacocks, which was named by administrators as the preferred bidder in late November but at least 30 Bonmarch\u00e9 stores are to close with the loss of 240 jobs. Thirteen of those have been shut so far with the rest to close in the new year. The Scottish department store chain Watt Brothers had 11 stores and 306 employees when it fell into administration. All the stores have closed and the majority of staff have lost their jobs. With 35 stores and 350 staff, the jewellery chain Links of London went into administration but its sites are still trading to clear stock, while a buyer is sought. Khaadi Fashion, an Asian clothing retailer founded in 2013, was bought out of administration by Weaves UK Trading, saving six of 10 stores and the majority of its 100 staff. The Wiltshire-based Lingerie Outlet Store fell into administration but administrators sold the majority of the online retailer to LF Retail and Book Library, saving 26 jobs. The German womenswear brand Gerry Weber closed its last six UK stores after creditors in Germany approved an insolvency plan in September. September Forever 21 had three stores and about 290 employees in the UK when it called in administrators. Stores are open to clear stock. The pawnbroker chain Albemarle &amp; Bond suddenly shut its 116 stores with the loss of about 400 jobs, even though it did not call in administrators. Albemarle sold its pledge books to rival H&amp;T. The Restaurant Group said it would close at least 88 of its Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s and Chiquito branches over the next six years, and nearly 100 more longer term. August Karen Millen and Coast had 32 stores and 177 concessions, employing 1,100 people, when they went into administration. All sites were closed and the vast majority of staff made redundant. The online brands were bought out by Boohoo.com. Jack Wills had about 100 stores and 1,700 staff in the UK when it went into administration. It was bought by Sports Direct and 98 stores are still trading in the UK and Ireland. Spudulike closed all 37 stores with the loss of about 300 jobs when it entered administration. Tesco said it would cut 4,500 jobs at 153 high street Tesco Metro supermarkets, adding to the 9,000 roles the UK\u2019s biggest retailer warned were at risk in January. Laura Ashley is to shut a further 34 stores after six closures, with the loss of hundreds of jobs. July Waitrose is closing seven supermarkets, putting nearly 700 jobs at risk. The supermarket chain is cutting costs amid tough conditions on the high street. However, it will have to invest heavily in its online grocery service as it prepares to end a long-term distribution deal with Ocado next year. June Bathstore had 132 stores and 529 staff when it went into administration in June. Homebase bought 44 stores, saving 154 jobs. The brand now trades from 28 stores. Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia retail empire staved off collapse after winning the backing of creditors for a rescue plan that involves the closure of 50 stores and 1,000 job losses. The Italian womenswear brand Stefanel\u2019s UK business was placed into administration following the collapse of its parent company and shut its two London stores. Boots said it would close 200 stores from its 2,485-strong chain in the UK to cut costs. The Money Shop, a pawnbroking and loan firm, had 98 shops and 427 staff when it ceased trading. More than 130 people lost their jobs after the Yorkshire Linen Company went into administration. It ran 19 stores across the north of England, selling towels, bedding and curtains. May The fashion retailer Select had 180 stores and 2,000 employees when it went into administration. In June, administrators carried out a CVA to close 11 stores with the loss of about 200 jobs. All but three of celebrity chef Jamie Oliver\u2019s 25 UK restaurants closed with the loss of 1,000 jobs after the business appointed administrators. The three surviving sites at Gatwick Airport were bought by the owner of Upper Crust in June. Marks &amp; Spencer is to close a further 72 stores, on top of the 48 it has already shut. ProCook decided to close the Steamer Trading chain of kitchenware shops it bought out of administration in January. It will rebrand 13 stores as ProCook while the remaining eight Steamer Trading stores and its head office in Brighton will be shut down, leading to 34 job losses. April Debenhams had 166 stores and more than 25,000 employees when it went into administration in April. No stores closed immediately and the chain is now owned by its lenders but 19 are to close in January when the group completes a restructure expected to result in the loss of 660 jobs. March Pretty Green had 12 stores and about 170 employees when Liam Gallagher\u2019s fashion outlet went into administration. All but one store and 33 concessions closed with 100 jobs lost, but 67 roles were saved when the brand was bought by JD Sports in April. All 94 Office Outlet stores closed with the loss of 1,170 jobs after the stationery retailer went into administration. LK Bennett had 41 stores and 500 employees when it entered administration. The brand was bought by its Chinese franchise partner, Rebecca Feng, saving 21 stores, all of the group\u2019s concessions and 325 jobs. But more than 100 jobs were lost with the closure of 15 stores. Better Bathrooms collapsed into administration with a loss of 325 jobs. February HMV was bought out of administration by the Canadian retailer Sunrise Records, saving 100 stores and nearly 1,500 jobs. However, 27 HMV and four Fopp stores closed, including the flagship Oxford Street shop, resulting in about 580 job losses.

At the time of the deal, tReds had 21 stores and 160 jobs but since then shops in Ipswich and Canterbury have shut. January Patisserie Valerie had 200 cafes employing nearly 3,000 people when an accounting scandal prompted the chain to call in administrators in January. About 70 of the group\u2019s 200 stores closed immediately with the loss of 900 jobs.

      "bodyText": "Prosecutors in Japan have issued an arrest warrant for the wife of Carlos Ghosn for alleged perjury, as Nissan vowed to pursue its former chairman over his \u201cserious misconduct\u201d while head of the carmaker. Tokyo prosecutors\u2019 special investigation squad said Carole Ghosn \u2013 a vocal supporter of her husband during his long detention in Japan \u2013 was suspected of making a false statement during testimony to the Tokyo district court last April, according to Kyodo news agency. Details of the allegation were not immediately available. Carole Ghosn, who was born in Beirut, is thought to have been reunited with her husband last week after he skipped bail and fled to Lebanon on 29 December. He had been freed on bail after agreeing to strict conditions, with prosecutors arguing he posed a flight risk. The conditions included restrictions on contact with his wife, which was reportedly among the reasons why he decided to jump bail. A spokesperson for the Ghosn family called the warrant \u201cpathetic\u201d and implied it was a response to a highly anticipated press conference the tycoon is due to give in Beirut on Wednesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Nissan described Carlos Ghosn\u2019s escape from Japan as \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d and vowed to pursue legal action against its former chairman over his \u201cserious misconduct\u201d. In its first public comment since Ghosn fled Japan, the carmaker said its \u201crobust, thorough internal investigation\u201d had \u201cincontrovertible evidence of various acts of misconduct\u201d by its fugitive former boss. It added: \u201cThe company will continue to take appropriate legal action to hold Ghosn accountable for the harm that his misconduct has caused to Nissan.\u201d The company said Ghosn\u2019s escape \u201cin violation of his bail conditions is an act that defies Japan\u2019s judicial system. Nissan finds it extremely regrettable.\u201d Ghosn claimed he had fled, months before he was due to stand trial on financial misconduct charges, because he did not expect to receive a fair trial under Japan\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d justice system. The 65-year-old fugitive has consistently denied charges of financial misconduct, claiming he had been the victim of a \u201ccoup\u201d by former colleagues opposed to his plans to deepen the alliance between Nissan and the French carmaker Renault. Nissan said in its statement its internal investigation had determined that Ghosn, who rescued the firm from near-bankruptcy 20 years ago, \u201cwas not fit to serve as an executive\u201d, adding that the inquiry had uncovered \u201cincontrovertible evidence of various acts of misconduct by Ghosn, including misstatement of his compensation and misappropriation of the company\u2019s assets for his personal benefit\u201d. It added: \u201cGhosn\u2019s flight will not affect Nissan\u2019s basic policy of holding him responsible for the serious misconduct uncovered by the internal investigation.\u201d The details of his escape remain sketchy, with officials in Japan saying this week they were still investigating how he managed to slip past strict security measures imposed as part of his bail conditions. Citing people involved in the investigation, Nippon TV reported that Ghosn had boarded a Shinkansen bullet train from Tokyo\u2019s Shinagawa station on 29 December. He got off at a station in western Osaka, arriving about 7.30pm, and took a taxi to a hotel near Kansai airport, the network said. He is thought to have taken a private jet the same day from the airport, bound for Istanbul, where he switched planes and continued to Beirut. The Wall Street Journal reported that Ghosn was loaded on to the flight from Osaka in a large audio equipment case that was not checked by airport customs staff. The case was later found at the back of the aircraft\u2019s cabin. The newspaper cited unnamed sources close to the investigation in Turkey as saying holes had been drilled into the bottom of the container so he could breathe. Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to enter Lebanon on a French passport, according to airport documents seen by Agence France-Presse. He is expected to offer an account of his escape at a press conference in Beirut on Wednesday.",

Responses from 3,000 academic and non-academic staff \u2013 a quarter of Cambridge\u2019s total workforce \u2013 found that nearly one in three had either been the victims of bullying and other forms of victimisation or had seen it directed against colleagues in the previous 18 months. The survey found that the largest group to have suffered bullying and harassment were women and assistant staff \u2013 Cambridge\u2019s term for non-academic support staff \u2013 while the largest group to exhibit bullying and harassment were academics. The results are revealed as the Office for Students, the higher education regulator for England, prepares to set out new requirements for how universities handle harassment and sexual misconduct affecting students and staff, including intervention by the regulator in cases of ineffective procedures. The Cambridge survey was jointly conducted by the university and the three main campus unions \u2013 Unite, Unison, and the University and College Union \u2013 after the unions said they were concerned about persistent levels of toxic and intimidating behaviour, including shouting, degrading comments and targeting of individuals. Will Smith, the secretary of Unite\u2019s Cambridge branch, said he had pushed for the survey to be carried out because he had seen no signs of it being tackled by the university\u2019s central administration. \u201cWe all knew that bullying and harassment was a big issue and we\u2019ve known for years, but it wasn\u2019t until the survey was carried out that it started to be taken seriously,\u201d Smith said.

I\u2019ve been here 30 years and can\u2019t think of anyone being dismissed \u2013 some have left but not dismissed,\u201d Smith said. Twenty-one percent of staff said they had been subjected to bullying or harassment, while 23% reported having witnessed such behaviour towards other staff. More than half of those who experienced bullying and harassment said they did not report the incidents, with many believing that nothing would be done, while others said it was because they feared the perpetrator would retaliate or their careers would be affected. A majority of those that did report incidents were not satisfied with the outcome, with some saying their complaints \u201cwere ignored, dismissed or brushed aside\u201d. A spokesperson for Cambridge said a larger university-wide survey also found that 11.5% of staff reported being the victims of bullying or harassment. \u201cThe university strives at all times to provide an inclusive and supportive working environment where staff are \u2013 and feel \u2013 trusted and valued. This includes being open about issues such as bullying and harassment, listening to staff concerns and responding appropriately,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWork in this area is at various stages but includes the introduction of improved support services for staff, such as new dignity at work contacts and professional mediators, the delivery of culture change and inclusive leadership training, and a review of the university\u2019s investigations process.\u201d The initial survey was carried out in July 2018 but was only released on the university\u2019s internal network in 2019. A summary of the results include comments by Stephen Toope, Cambridge\u2019s vice-chancellor, who wrote: \u201cTo be a leading institution, we must accept that this type of behaviour has no place at Cambridge.

Torsten M\u00fcller-Otv\u00f6s, the chief executive, said he was \u201cvery smiley, very happy\u201d as he announced an \u201cextraordinary year\u201d of global sales. M\u00fcller-Otv\u00f6s said sales had increased by 25% on the 4,107 cars sold in 2018, driven mostly by demand for the Cullinan, its three-tonne sports utility vehicle. The SUV, named after the biggest diamond, costs upwards of \u00a3264,000 and was launched in May 2018. \u201cWorldwide demand last year for our Cullinan SUV has driven this success and is expected to stabilise in 2020,\u201d M\u00fcller-Otv\u00f6ssaid. \u201cIt is a ringing testament to the quality and integrity of our products, the faith and passion of our customers and, above all, the skill, dedication and determination of our exceptional team in Goodwood and around the world and our dedicated global dealer network.\u201d Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, as the company is officially known to distinguish it from jet-engine maker Rolls-Royce, said sales were strongest in the US. About a third of its cars were delivered to customers in North America, followed by China, which accounted for about a quarter. \u201cWe are not really in the car business \u2013 we are in the luxury goods business,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cAll our clients have multiple cars in their garages. It is more that you look for something that\u2019s very special.

      "bodyText": "Nikki Haley, formerly ambassador to the United Nations and in many eyes a future Republican presidential candidate, has claimed the \u201conly\u201d people \u201cmourning the loss\u201d of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, killed by a US airstrike last week, are \u201cDemocrat leadership and our Democrat presidential candidates\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t see anyone standing up for Iran,\u201d Haley told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday night. \u201cYou\u2019re not hearing any of the Gulf [states], you\u2019re not hearing China, you\u2019re not hearing Russia. The only ones that are mourning the loss of Suleimani are Democrat leadership and our Democrat presidential candidates.\u201d The assassination of Suleimani, ordered by Donald Trump, has fueled a crisis in US relations with Iran and the Middle East in general. Tehran has promised to retaliate. Democrats in the race for the presidential nomination and congressional leadership have reacted cautiously to the Suleimani strike, making clear their belief the general was responsible for malign activity by Iran and American deaths but criticising the president\u2019s decision-making. Congress was not notified in advance of the strike in Baghdad and the notification sent subsequently, under the War Powers Act of 1973, was classified. As administration figures, including the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, sought to justify the strike without saying what threat had prompted it, or how imminent that threat was, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called for \u201can immediate, comprehensive briefing of the full Congress on military engagement related to Iran and next steps under consideration\u201d. Pelosi and the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, a presidential candidate, have introduced legislation to stop Trump attacking Iran without congressional approval. Defense chiefs are expected to brief Congress behind closed doors on Wednesday. Some Democratic responses to the strike have been more explicitly political. On Sunday, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren told NBC: \u201cWe\u2019ve been at war for 20 years in the Middle East and now, [Trump is] talking about expanding that war.\u201d Warren also accused Trump of carrying out the strike on Suleimani to distract from his own impeachment. \u201cWe know that Donald Trump was very upset about this upcoming impeachment trial, but look what he\u2019s doing now. He is taking us to the edge of war,\u201d she said Fox News host Hannity is a stalwart Trump supporter, closely tied to the White House. On Tuesday morning, CNN\u2019s Oliver Darcy considered Hannity\u2019s monologue on Iran on Monday\u2019s show, which seemed to betray detailed knowledge of US plans. Saying the US \u201cwon\u2019t be going with boots on the ground in Iran. That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Hannity listed potential targets for future strikes. \u201cThey got three major oil refineries and we know where they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have nuclear facilities, we know where they are.\u201d Darcy asked: \u201cHas Hannity been briefed? Does he know more about the US\u2019s plans with regard to Iran than some members of Congress?\u201d Haley followed her partisan attack over a matter of foreign policy by telling Hannity \u201cpartisan politics should stop when it comes to foreign policy\u201d. \u201cThis is about America United,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be completely behind the president [and] what he did, because every one of those countries are watching our news media right now, seeing what everyone is saying. \u201cThis is a moment of strength for the United States. It\u2019s a moment of strength for President Trump.\u201d There has been speculation that Haley, who has published a book and toured TV studios making claims that play well with the Republican base, could replace Mike Pence as Trump\u2019s running mate in this year\u2019s election. Amid criticism of her remarks to Hannity, former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer wrote: \u201cTranslation: Please put me on the ticket, Mr President.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "U smoke? U vape? Then good luck getting a job at U-Haul; the US moving and storage company recently became the latest employer to introduce a nicotine-free hiring policy. To be clear: that doesn\u2019t mean no smoking on the job; it means that if you have the occasional fag at home it won\u2019t hire you. From February, U-Haul will join the likes of Alaska Airlines and Scotts Miracle-Gro in no longer hiring nicotine users in the 21 US states \u2013 including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas \u2013 where there aren\u2019t any laws preventing employers from discriminating against smokers. In the 17 states that allow nicotine tests, applicants will have to take one. U-Haul has said the smoker-free policy comes from a place of love. \u201cWe are deeply invested in the wellbeing of our team members,\u201d it explained in a press release. \u201cNicotine products \u2026 pose a variety of serious health risks. This policy is a responsible step in fostering a culture of wellness at U-Haul.\u201d Let\u2019s translate that corporatespeak, shall we? What it is actually saying is: \u201cWe are deeply invested in extracting every possible ounce of productivity from our employees until the glorious day when we can replace them all with robots. Smokers take more sick days and cost more money. This policy lets us use \u2018wellness\u2019 as an excuse to monitor and control our employees\u2019 lives.\u201d Forget the nanny state; over the past decade, we have seen the rise of the nanny employer. Companies are increasingly encouraging \u2013 and sometimes borderline mandating \u2013 healthy habits among their employees, providing everything from on-site yoga classes to subsidised Fitbits. Corporate wellness programmes are particularly common in the US because most people get health insurance through their employer; a healthy workforce means lower premiums. However, they are becoming more widespread in Britain and are being actively encouraged by a government that seems keen on shifting the burden of healthcare from the NHS to employers. A 2018 government green paper called for \u201cjobs that actively support and nurture health and wellbeing\u201d and praised the likes of Barclays for its internal mental health campaign. And, last year, Boris Johnson proposed tax incentives to companies that support their employees\u2019 mental health. In theory it sounds brilliant that companies are doing more to foster better mental and physical health \u2013 even if it is for financial reasons. However, there is a thin line between helpful and intrusive. A report in the Washington Post last year found that employers such as Activision Blizzard, a videogame company, were offering financial incentives for employees to use family-planning apps \u2013 and then monitoring these apps to see how many of their employees were pregnant or facing high-risk pregnancies. A company executive boasted to the Post that its employees were growing used to the company mining their data. \u201cEach time we introduced [a digital monitoring tool], there was a bit of an outcry: \u2018You\u2019re prying into our lives,\u2019\u201d the executive said. \u201cBut we slowly increased the sensitivity of stuff and eventually people understood it\u2019s all voluntary.\u201d Just how voluntary are these wellness programmes, though? There have been lawsuits in the US over whether employers are offering such high incentives to disclose their private health data that employees feel there\u2019s no choice but to acquiesce. Not to mention, companies are collecting increasing amounts of sensitive information from their workforce without explicit consent. A friend of mine used to work at a startup. While she was there, the company installed sensors in the bathroom \u2013 apparently, it was tracking how many times people went to wee at work.

While he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/12/chelsea-win-premier-league-title-west-bromwich-albion-match-report\" title=\"\">steered the club to the Premier League title</a> in his first season in England, he was fired a year later after Chelsea finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/19/chelsea-manchester-united-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Victory against Manchester United in the FA Cup</a> was not enough to save Conte, who had 12 months left on his contract when he was fired.</p> <p>Conte\u2019s relationship with the Chelsea hierarchy was far from smooth. There were regular disagreements over transfer policy and a legal battle ensued over Conte\u2019s pay-off in the wake of his dismissal. Conte, who brought an 11-strong backroom team, won the case last year and the full extent of the payout has now emerged. It means that Chelsea, who had argued the former Juventus manager was in breach of his contract, have paid out more than \u00a390m in compensation to sacked managers since Abramovich took ownership of the club in 2003.</p> <p>The accounts, published on Tuesday and covering the financial year ending 30 June 2019, read: \u201cExceptional items in the current year of \u00a326.6m relate to changes in respect of the men\u2019s team management and coaching staff, together with associated legal costs.\u201d Sarri left in June last year for Juventus but his move was agreed by the clubs.</p> <p>Chelsea, whose turnover increased from \u00a3422.6m to \u00a3423.6m, cited increased wages and reduced profit on player sales as the principal reason for their \u00a396m loss. They now have the sixth highest wage bill in Europe and their accounts also showed that growth in commercial income was offset by a \u00a37m fall in match-day revenue and a \u00a34m fall in broadcasting revenue, which the club attributed to the impact of playing in the Europa League rather than the Champions League.</p> <p>However, there was a renewed show of commitment from Abramovich, whose future at Chelsea has been questioned since the British government delayed renewing his Investor (Tier 1) visa in May 2018. The Russian <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44332603\" title=\"\">abandoned his UK application</a> after the delay and took Israeli citizenship for which, being Jewish, he qualifies automatically. In the 20 months since the delay he is not thought to have been to a Chelsea match in the UK.</p> <p>Chelsea have dismissed the prospect of a sale, however, and can now point to a vast increase in funding from Abramovich. The accounts read: \u201cFunding is provided by the parent company, Fordstram Limited, which is supported by the ultimate controlling party, Mr R Abramovich. The group has received an increase in funding of \u00a3247m during the last financial year [2018: an increase in funding of \u00a369.1m].

      "bodyText": "Chelsea have announced they paid out more than \u00a326m over the sacking of Antonio Conte, a figure revealed in accounts which also show the club received an increase in funding of \u00a3247m from Roman Abramovich, the owner, during the last financial year. The club\u2019s accounts showed they paid a total of \u00a326.6m in compensation and legal costs to Conte and their former manager\u2019s backroom staff. Chelsea, who have made overall losses of \u00a396m and seen their annual wage bill rise by 17% to \u00a3285m, fired the Italian and replaced him with Maurizio Sarri in the summer of 2018. Conte, who has since returned to Italy to manage Internazionale, spent two fractious years at Chelsea after joining in 2016. While he steered the club to the Premier League title in his first season in England, he was fired a year later after Chelsea finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Victory against Manchester United in the FA Cup was not enough to save Conte, who had 12 months left on his contract when he was fired. Conte\u2019s relationship with the Chelsea hierarchy was far from smooth. There were regular disagreements over transfer policy and a legal battle ensued over Conte\u2019s pay-off in the wake of his dismissal. Conte, who brought an 11-strong backroom team, won the case last year and the full extent of the payout has now emerged. It means that Chelsea, who had argued the former Juventus manager was in breach of his contract, have paid out more than \u00a390m in compensation to sacked managers since Abramovich took ownership of the club in 2003. The accounts, published on Tuesday and covering the financial year ending 30 June 2019, read: \u201cExceptional items in the current year of \u00a326.6m relate to changes in respect of the men\u2019s team management and coaching staff, together with associated legal costs.\u201d Sarri left in June last year for Juventus but his move was agreed by the clubs. Chelsea, whose turnover increased from \u00a3422.6m to \u00a3423.6m, cited increased wages and reduced profit on player sales as the principal reason for their \u00a396m loss. They now have the sixth highest wage bill in Europe and their accounts also showed that growth in commercial income was offset by a \u00a37m fall in match-day revenue and a \u00a34m fall in broadcasting revenue, which the club attributed to the impact of playing in the Europa League rather than the Champions League. However, there was a renewed show of commitment from Abramovich, whose future at Chelsea has been questioned since the British government delayed renewing his Investor (Tier 1) visa in May 2018. The Russian abandoned his UK application after the delay and took Israeli citizenship for which, being Jewish, he qualifies automatically. In the 20 months since the delay he is not thought to have been to a Chelsea match in the UK. Chelsea have dismissed the prospect of a sale, however, and can now point to a vast increase in funding from Abramovich. The accounts read: \u201cFunding is provided by the parent company, Fordstram Limited, which is supported by the ultimate controlling party, Mr R Abramovich. The group has received an increase in funding of \u00a3247m during the last financial year [2018: an increase in funding of \u00a369.1m]. The company is reliant on its parent undertaking, Fordstram Limited, for its continued financial support. The company has received confirmation from its parent undertaking that sufficient funds will be provided to finance the business for the foreseeable future. The directors have therefore adopted the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.\u201d Chelsea are free to spend this month after their transfer ban was lifted and Frank Lampard, the manager, is thought to have a budget of \u00a3150m. Lampard\u2019s main targets include Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho, Crystal Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha, Lyon\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Red Bull Leipzig\u2019s Timo Werner and Bournemouth\u2019s Nathan Ak\u00e9. Danny Drinkwater has joined Aston Villa on loan for the rest of the season. The former Leicester midfielder returned to Chelsea last week after Burnley decided not to extend his initial six-month spell last week and Villa have acted quickly to bring him in. Drinkwater appears to have no future at Chelsea. Villa had inquired about taking Michy Batshuayi or Olivier Giroud on loan but the signing of Drinkwater means they cannot borrow another player from Chelsea.",

He didn\u2019t die in the How to Train Your Dragon films, he didn\u2019t die in Spooks: The Greater Good and, while his character didn\u2019t die in the animated adaptation of Julia Donaldson\u2019s beloved children\u2019s book Zog, the story was set a long time ago, so it only stands to reason that he\u2019s definitely dead, possibly after a long and painful illness. Harington\u2019s penchant for death is such that he\u2019s more than 20% likely to die onscreen than his Game of Thrones father Sean Bean, a man who dies so frequently that #Don\u2019tKillSeanBean became a trending hashtag in 2014. And yet he is a fraud. Compared to Kit Harington, Sean Bean positively thrums with a gleeful zest for life. If you had the choice of crossing a busy motorway with either Sean Bean or Kit Harington, you\u2019d pick Sean Bean every time. Maths doesn\u2019t lie. Harington would be pancaked before he\u2019d even left the hard shoulder. Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking at this point. You\u2019re thinking that Kit Harington cannot possibly die in The Eternals, because it is a film about a bunch of eternal people, and eternal people by definition are incapable of experiencing death. But to that I say: ha! You\u2019ve made the mistake of underestimating what a death-happy klutz Kit Harington is. You\u2019ll be laughing on the other side of your face when, three minutes into the film, his horse will skid on some wet leaves and throw him down a concrete staircase into a burning pile of discarded medical syringes. Because that will happen. Even Kit Harington the Eternal will die. The maths don\u2019t lie. Are you calling Buzz Bingo a liar?",

They just give up.\u201d Grant and a crew of helpers spent Tuesday carrying out the grisly task of burying about 200 sheep killed on his property near Cobargo near the New South Wales coast when fires tore through the area in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day. As he spoke to the Guardian, more of the lambs who survived the blaze dropped to the ground. \u201cThe only water I\u2019ve got for the ones who are left is what\u2019s in the troughs, and we\u2019ve got very little feed,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are about 10 cattle we still haven\u2019t found. If they do show up I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to feed them.\u201d \u201cA lot of them were our breeding stock for next season. We lost all four rams, too. It\u2019s roughly $36,000 to $40,000. We\u2019re insured though, so don\u2019t feel too sorry for us.\u201d A white pony which Grant had dressed as a unicorn for his grandchildren recently was also among the dead animals collected on Tuesday. Grant was one of dozens who lost his home in the blaze. As he used a tractor to lift sheep carcasses into a truck that then dumped them into graves dug with an excavator, his son Paul explained that Grant and his wife had built the home together as part of their retirement. \u201cI think this will be it for them now,\u201d Paul Grant said. \u201cThey\u2019d talked about downsizing in the future and I think this will just speed that up. It\u2019s pretty heartbreaking, though. Mum\u2019s really gutted but I suppose at the end of the day it\u2019s just things. Funny how life has a way of changing your plans for you, though.\u201d All across the southern part of NSW, similar scenes are playing out as the clean-up continues. More than 1,500 homes have been destroyed in the state since the start of the unprecedented fire season, and a record-breaking area of land \u2013 4.9m hectares (12.1m acres), an area larger than Denmark \u2013 has been burned, according to the latest figures released by the Rural Fire Service. Almost 118 fires continue to burn across NSW with 50 uncontained. About 100km north, in the beachside suburb of North Rosedale, Dafydd Gwynn-Jones and his daughter Caitlin had driven down from their home in Canberra to find the ruins of the holiday house his parents built 41 years ago. As they dug through the rubble \u2013 \u201cthat was the door, that was the fridge\u201d \u2013 searching for mementos that might have survived the fierce blaze that has levelled about 75% of this holiday suburb near Batemans Bay, they reflected on something that had always been there but now was not. \u201cFor my sister and I this house was pretty much the one constant,\u201d Caitlin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived in different cities, Sydney and Canberra, and different houses, but this was the one place that was constant.

The panoramic views across the Pacific Ocean that drew holidaymakers are now offset by a brutal carnage. \u201cIt will take a long time to rebuild this place, a long time,\u201d Dafydd Gwynn-Jones said. \u201cBut we absolutely will.\u201d The bushfire emergency gripping the east coast of Australia did not begin with the New Year\u2019s Day fires, and with more dangerous conditions expected this week it probably will not end with them either. But across hundreds of kilometres, the first week of 2020 has seen a trail of destruction. On Saturday, as thousands of Rural Fire Service volunteers battled an onslaught of emergencies sparked by blazing heat and relentless winds, the Guardian watched as the sky in the Snowy Mountains town of Adaminaby turned black by 3pm. As the fire peaked over a ridge near the town and headed towards properties defended by thinly stretched fire crews, the RFS group captain, Scott Lonard, simply did not have the resources to protect all of them. \u201cWe\u2019ll do our best but five trucks for this much space isn\u2019t going to be enough,\u201d he said. While milder conditions on Sunday brought a reprieve for the mountains, a strong southerly wind only exacerbated things in the far south coast town of Eden. When it was evacuated on Sunday many in the town fled about half an hour north to Merimbula or west to Bega. When the evacuation centres in those towns began to fill, people began camping along the waterfront or under overpasses, a flood of people left with nowhere to stay and nothing to do but wait. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll get back into Eden and to be honest I wouldn\u2019t want to go back yet,\u201d John Ironmonger said near the water at Merimbula on Sunday. \u201cEveryone here has just been shuffled around from place to place.\u201d When the Guardian spoke to Shelley Caban in her makeshift shelter on a bus on the Eden wharf, she had no idea whether the historic 150-year-old home she lived in with her husband and three daughters just south of the town had survived. By Tuesday it was still standing, but with conditions expected to deteriorate again the family are not out of the woods yet. \u201cIt came to literally within a paddock of the house and then the rain started,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a weird way I\u2019m kind of at peace with whatever happens now. I just want it to be over one way or the other.\u201d",

Over the past four years more than 3,400 people have died early during periods of extreme temperature in England. Global heating is increasing the frequency of heatwaves and a cross-party committee of MPs warned in July that the UK was \u201cwoefully unprepared\u201d for this impact of the climate emergency. All regions of England were affected except the south-west, and almost all the premature deaths were among people aged 65 or over. The frail elderly with heart or kidney problems are most at risk in a heatwave and dehydration can also lead to dizziness and falls. \u201cHeatwaves continue to result in significant health impact,\u201d said the PHE report. It reported the \u201cexcess deaths\u201d during the heatwaves, ie the additional mortalities compared with the long-term average for those dates. Two heatwaves accounted for the 892 deaths.

Some 142 people are still waiting for conditions to ease for an airlift.</p> <p>Premier Daniel Andrews warned there would be more emergency alerts in the coming week, including for already fire-ravaged East Gippsland and northeast Victorian regions.</p> <p>In celebrity bushfire news, actor Chris Hemsworth gave $1m.</p> <p>That\u2019s it for now. </p> <p>As we keep saying, this bushfire crisis is not over yet.

I\u2019ve got an update \u2013 the numbers are a lot bigger now. </p> <p>Back then, data from Dr Niels Andela, a scientist at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Centre, suggested the enormous pulse of CO2 from the fires was equivalent to almost half Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas footprint.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/13/australias-bushfires-have-emitted-250m-tonnes-of-co2-almost-half-of-countrys-annual-emissions\">Australia's bushfires have emitted 250m tonnes of CO2, almost half of country's annual emissions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andela is a collaborator in the <a href=\"https://www.globalfiredata.org/\">Global Fire Emissions Database</a> and he\u2019s just sent me an update.</p> <p>Now that pulse of CO2 has jumped by 99 million tons to a massive 349 million tonnes. Broken down by state, since 1 August 2019 the data shows emissions of:</p> <ul> <li>260 million tonnes of CO2 emissions for NSW.</li> <li>9 mt CO2 for Victoria.</li> <li>4 mt CO2 for South Australia.</li> <li>76 mt CO2 for Queensland. </li> </ul> <p>As my original story explains, the data does come with some uncertainties. Also, generally, emissions from bushfires are not counted because it\u2019s presumed that as forests and grasslands regrow, all the CO2 is reabsorbed.</p> <p>But there are concerns that as the climate warms, and forests get stressed with higher temperatures and drops in rainfall especially in the south, those presumptions may not hold. </p> <p>NASA\u2019s MODIS satellite can also detect fire hotspots, and also shows the huge jump in fires in NSW compared to the previous 17 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/readfearn/status/1214344421434486784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NASA&#39;s MODIS satellite can detect fires from hot spots.

So, in some ways it\u2019s been a good thing, but it\u2019s not enough to put these fires out.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked how long it would take for the fires to return to full strength, when the dangerous conditions return at the end of the week, Freeman says:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look, it won\u2019t take much at all. The underlying dryness, because of the drought, is pretty severe. So, this little bit of rain will quickly evaporate once we get those warmer conditions on Thursday and Friday, and that little bit of wind, of course, and those fires will take off again.

A quick summary. In South Australia, the Kangaroo Island Ravine fire complex that has burnt a third of the island has six areas still burning. The fire has killed two people and destroyed 56 homes across 160,00 hectares. The Country Fire Service says the fire is not yet under control and forecast high temperatures in the coming days are causing concern. The fire has also taken a heavy toll on the island\u2019s unique wildlife. In NSW, as we updated a few minutes ago, there are no longer any missing persons from bushfire-affected areas after two men reported missing were found alive. A funeral was held for NSW RFS volunteer Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, who died when his truck overturned while fighting fires before Christmas. In Victoria, where the mercury is rising again, 200 people were evacuated from Mallacoota on HMAS Choules, joining more than 1,500 other people from the town. Some 142 people are still waiting for conditions to ease for an airlift. Premier Daniel Andrews warned there would be more emergency alerts in the coming week, including for already fire-ravaged East Gippsland and northeast Victorian regions. In celebrity bushfire news, actor Chris Hemsworth gave $1m. That\u2019s it for now. As we keep saying, this bushfire crisis is not over yet. Please stay safe, check alerts if you\u2019re in fire prone areas, and keep being kind to each other. Some very good news: two men - one aged in his 70s - who has been missing on NSW\u2019s fire-ravaged far south coast have been found alive, police say. AAP reports authorities on Tuesday used heavy machinery to clear the road to Kiah, south of Eden, where one of the missing men lived. The other, a 70-year-old from Lower Towamba, west of Eden, had not been seen for several days. \u201cThere are no current reports of missing people in bushfire-affected areas,\u201d NSW Police subsequently said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon. The Victorian Aboriginal heritage council is calling for consideration of traditional owners\u2019 perspectives and relationship to country \u201cwhen the smoke clears\u201d. Rodney Carter, chairperson, said: As Victoria\u2019s first peoples we will stand together with all Victorians in this time of great trauma \u2013 trauma to our country, trauma to our people and trauma to our culture. Before Victoria, this place was our peoples\u2019 country and had been for many thousands of years. It is still our peoples\u2019 country, it is our mother and it can nurture us, but today we grieve for all those who have been harmed whilst sharing her with us. Our people manage our culture and our heritage, not just for the benefit of our own mob but for all people who call this place home. We want all people, all families, all animals and all country to be safe but, in this state of disaster, it cannot be guaranteed. Our ancestors, though all the struggles they faced living their life ways, were masters of living and loving our land. Through looking to our ancestors, we will lead our truest life. As best we can be leaders in our own mobs, to the advantage of our people, we should bring calmness and guidance in this time of disaster. We ask you, the broad, diverse, distressed Victorian community to work with traditional owners. Together we can understand the devastating effects of climate change and implement Country management strategies that will help heal our fire and drought ravaged land. There\u2019s more about traditional burning practices in this article from two bushfire experts at the University of Tasmania. There is a new fundraising effort to support south coast Aboriginal families who have lost their homes. We know all that bushfire smoke has been turning New Zealand\u2019s skies orange, and turning snow peaks brown. The ash might also accelerate glacial melt. But the ash cloud didn\u2019t stop there, and has made it all the way to Chile \u2013 about 11,000 kilometres away. AAP reports that usually cloudless skies in central Chile have turned hazy. Meteorologist Edita Amador, of Chile\u2019s Weather Directorate, told AAP: \u201cIn the coming days probably it will head toward Argentina.\u201d Afternoon all. Graham Readfearn here taking over from Amy Remeikis. A few weeks ago I wrote about the carbon dioxide emissions from Australia\u2019s bushfires. I\u2019ve got an update \u2013 the numbers are a lot bigger now. Back then, data from Dr Niels Andela, a scientist at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Centre, suggested the enormous pulse of CO2 from the fires was equivalent to almost half Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas footprint. Andela is a collaborator in the Global Fire Emissions Database and he\u2019s just sent me an update. Now that pulse of CO2 has jumped by 99 million tons to a massive 349 million tonnes. Broken down by state, since 1 August 2019 the data shows emissions of: 260 million tonnes of CO2 emissions for NSW. 9 mt CO2 for Victoria. 4 mt CO2 for South Australia. 76 mt CO2 for Queensland. As my original story explains, the data does come with some uncertainties. Also, generally, emissions from bushfires are not counted because it\u2019s presumed that as forests and grasslands regrow, all the CO2 is reabsorbed. But there are concerns that as the climate warms, and forests get stressed with higher temperatures and drops in rainfall especially in the south, those presumptions may not hold. NASA\u2019s MODIS satellite can also detect fire hotspots, and also shows the huge jump in fires in NSW compared to the previous 17 years. I am going to hand the blog over to Graham Readfearn now. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow \u2013 and a reminder that firefighters are still bracing for dangerous fire conditions on Thursday and Friday, so take care of you, and keep following your local authorities updates, if you are in any of the fire zones. Canberra\u2019s emergency services agency has released another update: Heavy smoke from the bushfires in NSW is predicted to re-enter the ACT at around 4pm this afternoon. The smoke is not by fire activity in the ACT. The Hospital Hill Fire has been controlled and continues to be patrolled and monitored. Our advice to the community remains that it is best to avoid exposure to the smoke by staying indoors where possible and not using evaporative air conditioners which draw air into the house from outside. ACT One small bushfire burning in Namadgi National Park. NORTHERN TERRITORY No bushfires burning. Five homes confirmed destroyed. QUEENSLAND 30 bushfires burning in the far north, central, southeast and Central Highlands. 2.5m hectares burned. 48 homes confirmed destroyed. WESTERN AUSTRALIA 32 bushfires burning, in the Goldfield-Esperance region, Wheatbelt, Pilbara, Perth region and southeast. 1.7 m hectares burned. Three home confirmed destroyed. TASMANIA 14 bushfires burning across the state\u2019s north, east and south. More than 32,000 hectares burned. Two homes confirmed destroyed. State by state update: (Via AAP) NSW 20 people dead, two missing. 130 bushfires burning on the South Coast, Snowy Mountains, Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Mid North Coast. Almost five million hectares burned - equal to the metro areas of the five mainland state capitals. 1,588 homes confirmed destroyed but number expected to rise. VICTORIA Two people dead. 14 bushfires burning in Gippsland, northeast and alpine regions. More than 1.2 million hectares burned. More than 200 homes confirmed destroyed but number expected to rise. SOUTH AUSTRALIA Three people dead. Five bushfires burning (four on the mainland, one on Kangaroo Island). About 270,000 hectares burnt. 161 homes confirmed destroyed. It\u2019s been an other big day, so I\u2019ll do my best to summarise some of the main parts: There are two people missing in New South Wales. Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, a NSW RFS volunteer killed when the truck he was in rolled while fighting fires, has been laid to rest. 130 fires are still burning across NSW, while 14 are still burning in Victoria, including several watch and act alerts. At least 6.2m hectares have been burnt in NSW and Victoria alone \u2013 five million in NSW alone. The Ravine fire is still burning out of control on Kangaroo Island, having burned through at least one-third of the island so far. 161 homes have been confirmed as destroyed on the island. The recovery mission has begun. More than 1,800 insurance claims have been lodged totally $700m \u2013 so far. Craig Kelly has created international furore by continuing to deny the climate change, most recently on UK television. Hazard reduction burning is \u201cnot a silver bullet\u201d says Daniel Andrews. Two people remain missing in NSW, after fire swept through their region, south of Eden. The official death toll remains at 20.

Graham Readfearn has looked at some of the wildlife potentially lost in the Kangaroo Island fire: Ecologists have grave concerns for the future of unique and endangered wildlife on Kangaroo Island where bushfires have killed thousands of koalas. Fires on the island, in South Australia, have so far burned through 155,000 hectares \u2013 about one third of the island\u2019s entire area \u2013 with blazes concentrated in the biodiversity-rich western areas. Concerns are greatest for the unique and endangered mouse-like marsupial the Kangaroo Island dunnart, and the glossy black cockatoo, which have both seen extensive areas of critical habitat burned. Australian actor Chris Hemsworth and his family have donated $1m to the bushfire crisis The SA CFS chief, Greg Nettleton provided this update: This is still a large fire which is not controlled. I visited the island this morning and witnessed many fires are still burning there. I also, however, met lots of people who have been badly affected by the fire and the spirit of the people on the island is magnificent. The fire continues, the recovery mission has commenced. There are many military personnel on the island helping out SES and CFS staff, and the island is resilient and is starting to rebuild. However, the emergency part of this incident is not over. We wish to emphasise to people to follow warnings on Thursday, to go in the CFS website and continue to seek safety advice in the event the fires do break containment lines. Corey Wingard, the South Australian emergency services minister is delivering an update on the damage to Kangaroo Island from a bushfire: I can also further update to say that 233 properties have been assessed and 56 of those properties and homes have been destroyed. Which is very sad, of course, for all the people involved and those on Kangaroo Island. 10 buildings have had major damage, 18 had minor damage. 236 outbuildings have been damaged and 257 vehicles damaged as well. The upside is that more than 150 have been saved. So 150 were not damaged by fires. More than 150 in fact, the count is 167 homes weren\u2019t damaged by fire. So that is a testament to a great effort of all involved, in particular, the emergency services, and we thank them very much for that work. The fire is still out of control. CFA fire chief Steve Warrington also comments on the hazard reduction burn commentary: So there\u2019s a fair amount of emotion in the landscape at the moment about fuel reduction burning. \u201cAs the premier said, this is not a silver bullet. There\u2019s [areas where we have had] burns go right through it and it hasn\u2019t slowed it up at all. The emotive argument is that fuel reduction burning will fix all our problems. ...Yes, burning is important. Some of the hysteria that this is the solution to all our problems is an emotional load of rubbish, to be honest. It\u2019s needs to be part of an integrated plan about protecting life and property. That\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing the real terms in Gippsland and the north-east of this state, where we\u2019ve done well in many ways to make sure we\u2019re protecting life and property as part of an overall integrated township protection plan strategy. He is a *current* fire chief too, for anyone who wants to push the \u201cgreens funding former fire chief\u201d agenda. But they are all saying the same thing. Daniel Andrews is again discussing the issues with hazard reduction burns, and why the idea that fuel reduction burns would have stopped this crisis, is not logical: The number of days in each day that we can safely put fire in the landscape and still call it a controlled burn, that is to say, avoid what happened in Lancefield a couple of years ago where it started off as a controlled burn and next thing we had to apologise to people having burnt their houses down, the number of days we can safely backburn is getting less and less each year. Even if you can do lot more backburning, it\u2019s not a silver bullet. It\u2019s part of an integrated strategy about protecting life and property. I think there\u2019s some good examples of where land that had been backburned quite hard, quite heavy few reduction burning only three or four years ago, burnt pretty hot last weekend. To add to my answer, because I think I have answered this question a number of times, logic tells me it\u2019s not a silver bullet. The number of days we can safely back burn is getting less and less every year. Surely no one is advocating we put fire into the landscape in an unsafe way. That would be dangerous. Andrew Crisp: Speaking with the incident controller here at Bairnsdale a short time ago, some of our concern is the fires up in the alpine area, around Omeo, and the potential for them to travel south with the northerly and join the fires down in this part of the world. We saw, only a few days ago, where there were more than 300 people on the oval at Omeo where some helicopters were there to take people out. We\u2019re focused on Omeo, Swift Creek, down into Tambo Crossing. We need to remain vigilant across the whole state. We talk a lot about East Gippsland but there are potential for other parts of our state. The rest of our state is really dry as well. We cannot afford to be complacent but we must remain vigilant no matter where we are. The Victorian emergency commissioner, Andrew Crisp, has an update: There are three communities we haven\u2019t been able to drive in. When I say \u2018drive\u2019 even with those other communities it is basically bushtracks and emergency vehicles to get in, it is where there is no real road access. We\u2019ve been able to get helicopters and sat phones in to make sure people have supplies. In terms of getting people in and getting people out, at Mallacoota at the moment we have HMAS Choules off the coast there. We have 342 people that are registered that want to get out of Mallacoota. At the community meeting at about midday today, where the option of the Choules was put to the community, 200 people have taken up that option to get on the Choules and to take that sea trip back to Melbourne. On Kangaroo Island, at least 56 homes have been destroyed by a bushfire. It has burnt through at least one third of the island. Two men were killed as they fled the blaze. More on hazard reduction from a former Victorian environment minister, who says he does not recall having been lobbied by green groups to stop fuel reduction burns. The Australian actor Yael Stone has announced she is giving up her American green card because she no longer believes it is ethical to have a life on two continents, given the carbon emissions from her air travel. Stone has found success in the US as part of the Orange is the New Black cast. Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, the NSW RFS volunteer who was killed when his truck overturned while fighting fires before Christmas, has been laid to rest. Anyone who has insurance questions can contact 1800 734 621, for information on claims and recovery. Volunteer and professional firefighting organisations are coming together tomorrow, calling for a royal commission into the bushfires. The announcement will be made on Wednesday, and involves: Leighton Drury - state secretary, Fire Brigade Employees\u2019 Union (NSW) John Oliver - state secretary, United Firefighters\u2019 Union of Queensland Lea Anderson - state secretary, United Firefighters\u2019 Union of Western Australia Max Adlam - state secretary, United Firefighters\u2019 Union of South Australia Stewart Little - general secretary, Public Service Association of NSW Mick Holton - president, NSW Volunteer Fire Fighters Association This is in relation to the BBC interview Catherine King and Craig Kelly did on Saturday, where this exchange occurred between Kelly and the host \u2013 which is why Piers Morgan wanted to talk to Kelly on Good Morning Britain in the first place. Host: So just to be clear, Mr Kelly. I want to be clear in what you\u2019re saying, you are saying there is no link between these fires in your view and global climate change? Kelly: Well firstly there is no link, the facts that cause the fires are the drought and the drying of the environment and on this our climate scientists down here have been very clear and they have said that there is no link between drought and climate change. We\u2019re showcasing stories from the bushfires in our Full Story podcast, have you been affected? Or have you been helping those affected by the bushfires? We\u2019d love to hear from you, give us a call on (02) 8076 8550 and leave us a voicemail. If you missed them we\u2019ve already done two episodes on the fires, one with Murph on why Scott Morrison can\u2019t talk about climate change and another with Lisa Cox discussing how the fire seasons have changed. Government ministers have come out against Craig Kelly\u2019s comments this morning. From AAP: Emergency management minister David Littleproud described his comments as a \u201csideshow\u201d. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t represent the views of the government\u201d, Mr Littleproud told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give a rats what he said, it\u2019s irrelevant, let\u2019s just focus on those people that are out there that need our help.\u201d Mr Kelly said the suggestion the government could have reduced the bushfires by bringing down carbon emissions was nonsense. Instead, he made disputed claims that fuel loads were largely to blame for the spread of the fires. Scientists have disputed claims a lack of hazard reduction burns have led to the size of the bushfires, with former fire chiefs blaming the effects of climate change. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg also put Mr Kelly at arms length from the government. \u201cOur view of climate change is that it\u2019s real. We accept the science\u201d, Mr Frydenberg said. While Mr Frydenberg said fuel loads had been a factor in the bushfires, he said climate change was causing hotter, drier summers. NSW police have confirmed two people are unaccounted for south of Eden. Getting to some areas has been almost impossible because of the damage and potential danger from falling trees. On reports NSW police have taken action against 183 people for arson this bushfire period, is some context from deputy NSW police commissioner, Gary Worboys: I know that all of those people aren\u2019t arsonists in a sense, I know a lot of them were doing things like using fireworks or lighting fires to camp or cook food or young children, in fact, that got the benefits of the Young Offenders Act and quite rightly so. I know all of those people are not people out there trying to kill people or destroy houses and so we need to get that in some perspective. Still, what it does, what it does show me and the community is that police are well aware that we need to take action against people, whatever that might be, in this time and it is particularly a heightened risk of fire activity and we\u2019ve seen the devastation it causes. We make no apologies for being so vigilant about that. On Monday, NSW police confirmed 24 people had been charged with deliberately lighting fires. NSW Emergency Services minister David Elliot on anyone ignoring the total fire ban in the state: ...You had to have come from Mars in a bubble not to realise that the state is at a tinder-box situation at the moment. That\u2019s why the Government decided to increase the penalties for people putting cigarette butts out of the car window and in my mind, anybody that lights a fire either necessarily or unnecessarily against the total fire ban is putting the community at risk and that needs to be pulled up, called out and in many cases, lit be put before the court. This of course, after he went to Europe in the middle of the crisis. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) wants people to contact their doctor if they start to feel unwell because of the air pollution \u2013 not an ambulance (unless it is life threatening). From its statement: RACGP President Dr Harry Nespolon said people should turn to their GP in the first instance for non-life threatening health concerns. If it\u2019s not life threatening, call your local GP \u2013 they are best placed to assess your health concerns, review any current treatment and optimise care in the current conditions. We know paramedics have seen a spike in calls from people suffering from respiratory conditions related to bushfire smoke. Emergency lines should be used when there are genuine emergencies, it\u2019s important that they are not tied up. Ambulance Victoria reportedly said there was a 51% increase in people calling for help for breathing problems on Monday, when the air quality in Melbourne deteriorated to \u201cvery poor\u201d. NSW police are also getting very serious about looters: What we\u2019ve shown today over the last couple of days is that the police will take action. We have police both in plain clothes and uniform, specialist police, right up and down the south coast, night and day, looking around these areas, not just where homes are but where people have been evacuated, looking at suspicious behaviour, looking for the community to make reports of that behaviour, so we can go to those locations and here are three really good examples of the last 48 hours, of those people who want to take advantage of what is a dreadful time for so many people. It\u2019s disgusting behaviour, behaviour that we won\u2019t tolerate, simply because the community will not tolerate it either. The PMO tells us that Donald Trump called Scott Morrison a little earlier \u201cto offer his support to Australia and all the bushfire-affected communities\u201d. \u201cThe prime minister thanked him and also thanked him for the support the US has already provided, specifically the US firefighters that have come out here. \u201cThe prime minister also thanked the president for the support of the American people who have been sending their well-wishes to Australians at this time.\u201d The prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, has also called Morrison today to offer Fiji\u2019s support and condolences. The leaders of the UK, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu were in touch yesterday, and there have also been offers of support from Singapore and New Zealand. In Victoria: Almost 450 buildings have been gutted in bushfires raging across eastern Victoria with cooler weather offering some reprieve and authorities refusing to rest on their laurels. Fourteen active fires are burning across the state on Tuesday after several joined up with more than 1.2m hectares in Victoria razed. All warnings are at a watch-and-act level or lower, with most of the active fires in East Gippsland and the state\u2019s northeast. (Via AAP) Rod Sims says the ACCC is dealing with \u201cnumerous\u201d reports of fundraising scams in relation to bushfire appeals. \u201cSome low life characters will take advantage of the fact that many people want to donate\u201d, he told the ABC. \u201cThey want to donate quickly, and many are doing it for the first time. We have come across a range of different scams.\u201d Sims says the most common way of scamming people is the old cold call and text seeking donations, with social media campaigns also being roped in. \u201cThirdly, and perhaps the most egregious, people impersonating relatives of people who have died, perhaps on a Facebook page, saying join me and fund me, when it is fake.\u201d Sims says the GoFund Me fundraisers \u201chave a range of tools\u201d to try and ensure fundraisers hosted on its site are legit. He suggest lodging any questionable donation requests to the SCAMwatch website. But prosecutions can be tricky \u2013 under Australian law, you have to have misled people to be taken to the federal court. Sims says: The penalties can be up to $1.1m per breach, or a quarter of a million for individuals. It is not large.\u201d The best thing we can do is warn people. EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO VICTORIA\u2019S DEADLY BUSHFIRES: * A DAY ON THE GREEN: The concert, featuring Cold Chisel, Birds of Tokyo and Magic Dirt, was set to take place at Rutherglen on Tuesday but has been cancelled due to smoke from the bushfires. * KARKAROOK PARKRUN: The annual run at Heatherton scheduled for January 4 has been cancelled due to poor air quality. * COUTA BOAT CLASSIC RACE: Accounting firm KPMG cancelled the annual Sorrento race, which was to be held on January 3, out of respect for those facing bushfires across the country. * FIREWORKS: RACV\u2019s Healesville Country Club cancelled its New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display out of respect for communities battling fires. Fireworks displays were also cancelled at other events. * FALLS FESTIVAL: The music festival, on Victoria\u2019s Great Ocean Road in Lorne, was cut short due to extreme weather. * RAINBOW SERPENT: The three-day festival is set to go ahead with some changes in late January after its Lexton site was affected by bushfires in December. (Via AAP) Murals are still popping up around Melbourne. Craig Kelly has deleted his \u201cweather girl\u201d facebook post. He is now sharing a 2013 story, which News Corp columnist Miranda Devine has also been putting on social media, where a retired Monash University researcher disputed the link between climate change and worsening bushfires, with the comment \u201clisten to the experts\u201d. The experts have said it is linked. On the impacts to the water supply in fire-ravaged areas, Andrew Colvin says fixing it is a priority: We\u2019ve got engineers on the ground making those assessments, helping state agencies. Where we\u2019re directed to \u2013 the states still lead this and we\u2019re being directed by them but their expertise that the ADF can provide and they\u2019re providing that. Those critical elements of life are being looked at as priority and the states are prioritising the tasks of the ADF and we\u2019ve already got 14 defence liaison officers in New South Wales and more to go out as we\u2019re asked and there\u2019s also a number of key agencies that are going enshrined with the ADF and in fact the ADF are looking to put small teams into some of the small towns that haven\u2019t seen anybody. Get four or five in a car with a tent, pitch it up there and hopefully even be able to take some Department of Human Services people out there so that people know that they\u2019re being listened to and Australia cares. Five generators have been sent to Victoria to help stabilise power supply there. In the NSW fire zone, there are still thousands of people without power \u2013 David Littleproud says part of the difficulty there, is that authorities still can\u2019t get in. The BBC have put together a brief history of the Coalition\u2019s government position on climate change. Andrew Colvin on where the agency needs to start, given the magnitude of the disaster: I\u2019m working at the moment simply to get my head around the magnitude and breadth of areas affected. As I said before, not every area is affected in the same way. We have tourism-related industries that are terribly affected and small, farming and agriculture areas affected. In other parts of the country they\u2019re through that and now looking for recovery. Prioritising where I go is a big part of what I\u2019ll be doing in the next couple of days and, of course, as I said, I need to get into places like Queensland and northern New South Wales who are probably more ready to receive recovery assistance. I don\u2019t want to get in the way of response. I don\u2019t want to get in the way of those people doing their jobs to save homes, lives and properties. But I need to hear from them. David Littleproud says the recovery mission has begun. He is with Andrew Colvin, the former AFP commissioner, who will head up the disaster recovery agency. Littleproud: I don\u2019t want it to be a Canberra-led recovery. I want it to be a local recovery. And that\u2019s why enter rebuilding lives, it can\u2019t be done from Canberra. It has to be done at a local level and Andrew will be tasked with getting out there on the road, sitting around halls, town halls, kitchen tables, talking to people, understanding. There\u2019ll be whole-of-government responses and programs, but we also want to empower the local community and normally through local governments. They are the ones that are connected more gradually to these communities. It\u2019s important that we empower them to help in that recovery and making sure that the money that the Australian taxpayers are putting out, are investing in this process, the process of recovery and rebuilding of these lives is done appropriately. Queensland SES volunteers will also receive the government\u2019s volunteer payments ($300 a day, up to $6,000) for their work during the fire crisis. As we have reported, there have been about 8,500 insurance claims put in so far, totalling about $700m (with more to come) Josh Frydenberg says of those, about 20% have been assessed and half of that 20% have been settled. Frydenberg: The insurance industry\u2019s taken a number of steps already to get support to those who need it. They have been providing emergency accommodation to their customers, who have been affected. They have been providing some cash support, because when you lose everything, what you do need is some cash to go out and buy just the basics that we take for granted. They have increased their staffing levels, including bringing in assessors from overseas. They will continue to take steps to ensure that they have the adequate number of people who are there to process these claims and to assess the damage. These insurance companies are providing a 24/7 service for those who have been affected. Importantly, the insurance companies have already lined up builders to start the rebuild process, and what is very pleasing \u2013 and I underline this point to the insurance companies today \u2013 to prioritise the use of local tradespeople. The meeting with the insurance heads has broken. Josh Frydenberg will hold a short press conference on that in the next 20 minutes. The defence force is now being deployed to help remove livestock carcasses from the fire zones \u2013 much as they did following the north Queensland floods early last year. Farmers who need assistance with assessing or disposing of livestock disposal should contact their relevant state agency. \u00b7 Victoria: Emergency Victoria on 1800 226 226 \u00b7 NSW: Department of Primary Industries Agricultural and Animal Services Hotline on 1800 814 647 or their local Land Services office. \u00b7 South Australia: PIRSA hotline on 1800 255 556 The areas impacted represent about 9% of Australia\u2019s cattle stock and about 12% of our sheep stock. There is no number on how many animals have been killed as yet. You may remember that in the lead-up to the election, Craig Kelly, who had been about to be dumped by his branch as the preselected candidate, but was saved by Scott Morrison\u2019s intervention, was banned from appearing on Q&amp;A. Later the backbencher, who appeared so regularly on Sky News, was dubbed the MP for Sky, while colleagues joked about looking for his office when the organisation opened its new Parliament House studio, was also noticeably absent from their screens as well. Looks like he decided he was needed again, even without the PMO\u2019s approval. Sigh. Humans are going to human. That means we see the best of us, but also this. Josh Frydenberg will have an update on the outcome of his meeting with Australia\u2019s insurance industry very soon. David Littleproud has called a press conference for midday. Andrew O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s funeral is today. He is the second NSW RFS firefighter to be laid to rest. The 36-year-old was father to 19-month-old Charlotte. Former prime minister John Howard has been turning up almost everywhere \u2013 including the ABC Grandstand cricket commentary box \u2013 talking about Scott Morrison and the bushfires. Morrison said he spoke to Howard earlier this week. Howard has defended Morrison\u2019s actions, most recently on Sky News this morning. I think a lot of the criticism is completely misplaced,\u201d said the man who once helped launch an \u201canti-warmist\u201d book aimed at children. He has done all the right things. He dealt with the issue of his holiday, and since he has been back, he has hardly drawn breath. ... I think the last thing you could ever say about Scott Morrison is, that he lacks compassion and empathy. I have always found him as someone who looks to people as individuals and cares about the human impact on individuals and their families. On climate change, Howard says there are \u201ca range of opinions\u201d. I am not in politics now, and I will leave it to those who are in politics. But provided arguments are put with honest and intellectual rigour, then it is within the capacity of our political system to reach the right decisions. And in the end of course, all of those decisions are remitted to the Australian people.\u201d There may be a range of opinions about climate change, but the only thing that really matters is the facts. And the facts are, it is happening. It is having an impact on the severity of things like droughts and bushfires, just as it was predicted to do. Anthony Albanese was asked about one of Eden-Monaro MP Mike Kelly\u2019s proposals for a war-like mobilisation in response to the climate crisis, while on Studio Ten a little earlier today: He was asked if there should be a national service set up: One of the things we could do is set up, even if it was on a voluntary basis, there are people out there who would want to contribute, and we can see that. I met a bloke on Saturday at Cudlee Creek in the Adelaide Hills. I said to him, \u2018How long have you been fighting fires for here, because it has been going for a few weeks there?\u2019 But he had already spent over a month in NSW. One of the things that has happened and my concern and the reason for a national response is the volunteer firefighters, who I have met on the north coast of NSW, you would say, \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 And they would say \u2018Bendigo\u2019 or \u2018Adelaide; or \u2018Perth\u2019 or \u2018Auckland\u2019 for that matter. We need to get better at it. We need to use the reconstruction period as well. How do we increase the skills base? How do we bring people in who might be in these regional communities? They are looking for a trade or to do things. We will be reconstructing roads, houses, bridges, whole communities, schools, hospitals. They have all gone. How do we get something positive out of what is a devastating crisis? There is talk about delaying the Australian Open because of the air quality concerns in Melbourne. Novak Djokovic was asked about it after a win in the ATP Cup in Brisbane overnight. That\u2019s probably the very, very last option. If it comes down to \u2026 the conditions affecting the health of players, you have to consider it. The Australian Open is due to start on 20 January. Just a reminder that the more favourable weather conditions does not mean this is over. The end of the week will see a return to dangerous fire conditions and we have multiple blazes still going. And this is still happening on the sidelines. Some pointed out yesterday that fire-ravaged Snowy Valley had not been included on a list of local government areas eligible for the Australian government disaster recovery payment. These are payments of $1,000 to people who have been seriously impacted by the fires \u2013 they may have been injured or returned to find their homes destroyed. Guardian Australia put this to the Home Affairs department yesterday and last night a spokeswoman confirmed Snowy Valley had been added to the list. \u201cImpact assessments have begun in NSW and once direct bushfire damage to homes is confirmed in a local government area, the payment is being authorised as quickly as possible,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cAustralian government disaster recovery payment is available in the Snowy Valley local government area.\u201d AAP have a summary of the Victorian situation: Almost 450 buildings have been destroyed in bushfires raging across eastern Victoria with a drizzle of rain and cooler conditions offering some respite. Fourteen active fires are burning across the state on Tuesday with more than 1.2 million hectares in Victoria scorched. All warnings are at a watch-and-act level or lower, with most of the active fires in East Gippsland and the state\u2019s northeast. There were 204 residential properties and 243 outbuildings razed in the blazes, the State Control Centre told AAP on Tuesday. Two people have died and millions of wild animals have been killed or injured. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has issued a warning to anyone who is pregnant: Exposure to air pollution in pregnancy has been linked to increased rates of preterm birth, decreased birth weight, hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and gestational diabetes,\u201d president Dr Vijay Roach said: We would reiterate that these risks are increased when there has been exposure over a long time period. As our cities and communities are enveloped in smoke as a result of the current bushfires, we would encourage pregnant women to heed advice from authorities, take precautions, limit outdoor activities and try to spend more time indoors. For those unable to avoid prolonged exposure to inhaled air pollution, masks may have a role. The fire on Kangaroo Island, which has burned through about a third of the South Australian icon, is still going. SA authorities have just released this advice: The current fire edge extends from the West of Vivonne Bay to the North Coast at Stokes Bay, and West of Parndana. Crews are currently attending to multiple smoke plumes East of the existing fire in the Parndana Conservation Park, at the Cape Borda Lighthouse and in the Snug Cove Road area on the Northern side of the Island. At the moment these fires pose no threat to the public. There may be areas of uncontrolled fire within the fire ground.If you are in this area stay alert, monitor local conditions and decide what you will do if the situation changes. At this time there is no threat to life or property and firefighters are attending this fire. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has rejected freedom of information requests about Scott Morrison\u2019s Hawaiian holiday. We now have to include WhatsApp messages in requests, because so many within the government use it for communications. And then that\u2019s used as a reason to reject the requests, because it would be too difficult to go through those messages. If you have missed the latest Craig Kelly saga, Sarah Martin has written on it here. Laura Tobin, who challenged Craig Kelly over his [wrong] climate comments on UK breakfast television, has responded to Kelly\u2019s \u201cPommie weather girl\u201d comment. It is worth noting that even though Piers Morgan also challenged Kelly, cutting him off and then cutting short the interview, he did not get a mention. No, Kelly only singled out Tobin. Who is now the subject of misogynistic abuse on his official MP facebook page. The mayor of the Shoalhaven council, Amanda Findlay, says all the fire evacuees have been moved into temporary accommodation: No one is sleeping in an evacuation centre down south here. They\u2019ve all been relocated into local accommodation, those who registered with us. Some people are staying with friends and relatives at this moment, you know, it\u2019s really important for them to be surrounded by the love and kindness of people that they trust and feel comfortable with. I know that some of our people are saying in that kind of accommodation and we\u2019ll be doing our best to make sure that everyone gets the accommodation that they need and that is suitable for them as we, you know, continue to go through the recovery process now of this terrible disaster. That is being paid for by the NSW state government. Given just how much false information is out on social media, this is just a small step. VicEmergency also has a brief update on the recovery: Fires continue to burn in East Gippsland with more than 900,000 hectares impacted. There have been unconfirmed reports of property losses in areas, including Reedy Flat, Buchan, Bruthen, Sarsfield, Gelantipy and areas between Nicholson and Swan Reach. Residents will be let back into the area once it is determined to be safe. We understand residents are anxious about their properties and communities, however, the full impact of these fires won\u2019t be known until thorough assessments have been carried out. Rapid Impact Assessment teams have arrived in East Gippsland, while aircraft is also being used to gather information. Information about losses will be provided to residents as soon as possible and once available. This may take place in a series of public meetings as well as one-on-one sessions. NSW RFS has issued a building impact assessment. The number of homes saved, given what they were facing, just shows how lucky we are to have the volunteer force we do. I bet Tourism Australia is really kicking itself spending $15m on the Kylie Minogue ad when it could have had Craig Kelly publicise Australia in the UK for free. Both NSW and Victorian authorities are starting to open up fire-ravaged communities \u2013 but if you are in a fire zone, check with your local authorities. HMAS Adelaide is off the NSW south coast. It has been helping with supplies and refueling the airfleet being used to waterbomb the fires. There is so much misinformation surrounding these fires, a lot of it being pushed across social media. That these fires are mostly the fault of arsonists is one of the biggest ones. Hazard reduction is another. The former Australian tennis champ Pat Cash followed Craig Kelly on to Piers Morgan\u2019s UK breakfast TV show, and had a *slightly different* take to the Morrison government backbencher. The Business Council of Australia has written to all its members encouraging them to offer at least 20 days of paid leave to any volunteer firefighters. It says: It has also established the Australian Volunteer Support Trust to provide financial support to the families of volunteer firefighters who lose their lives while on duty. It aims to raise $25m as an initial sum. \u201cThe trust will be a permanent and ongoing fund to support the children of volunteers who have died fighting these fires and in future disasters,\u201d president Tim Reed said. The primary focus of the trust will be on supporting children to adulthood with a particular emphasis on their education. It will be effective from 1 July 2019 to include the current bushfires and be administered by independent trustees to respond to the current situation and future emergencies. The Business Council has also announced a community rebuilding initiative to \u201cbe the first point of contact for companies to coordinate during this crisis and will work as an interface with federal and state authorities\u201d. It is being set up as a five-year initiative, so far, and will work in conjunction with the National Bushfire Recovery Agency set up by the government and headed by the former AFP commissioner Andrew Colvin. Smoke from the Australian bushfires has again travelled over 10,000km to South America and can now be seen in Chile. That happened in November as well. Comedian and Instagram star Celeste Barber\u2019s bushfire fundraiser has now hit $40m. The last bids on Shane Warne\u2019s baggy green was over $300,000 (in less than a day) before the website crashed. AAP reports that a barge is on its way to Mallacoota to evacuate the remaining people who want to leave the town, after fire tore through it: A barge is on its way to an isolated Victorian holiday town to rescue the remaining few hundred people cut off after fires destroyed access. About 300 people who want to leave Mallacoota near the NSW border remain in the fire-ravaged town. \u201cWe know it\u2019s frustrating for them, we made several attempts yesterday to get Blackhawks into them but visibility was too poor and it was too dangerous,\u201d state response controller Gavin Freeman told Nine on Tuesday. \u201cWe have got a barge on its way in there now so we will be able to get some people out. That should arrive early this morning and we will be able to get people on a boat and get them out.\u201d On Sunday more than 400 people were rescued from the town by military helicopter. Supplies such as food, water and diesel for power generators have also been delivered. On Saturday the MV Sycamore and HMAS Choules helped about 1,100 people escape the town. Firefighters and the defence force are working to open up the roads and clear access to the community. About 4,000 people became stranded on the Mallacoota beach last week when fire suddenly cut off the town. Communities across East Gippsland had been told to get out before fire hit, but Mallacoota was not one of them. Josh Frydenberg has told the ABC it is too early to even begin putting a figure on the economic cost of the fires to the nation: Because clearly all those businesses in those communities who have been impacted, been hit at exactly the wrong time of the year, when they\u2019re the busiest time. So there\u2019s going to be a very significant economic impact, but it is too early to tell what that full impact will be but, like I said, our priority, with the unprecedented call-out of the defence force, with the movement of Chinook helicopters and Black Hawks ferrying the firefighters to the most difficult terrain, the use of amphibious vessels to evacuate people from places like Mallacoota, the delivery of 18,000 litres of fuel, which the ADF did the other day to people in need, this is what we\u2019re focusing on, getting the Australian Tax Office to give a two-month reprieve to people to put in payments, the work that we\u2019re doing with Centrelink. We want to get money out into these communities as fast as possible, because we want to help them rebuild, to recover and to be more resilient for the future. The UK has also offered Australia support. The state response controller, Gavin Freeman, spoke to the ABC about the Victorian fire situation, stressing that small rainfall is not enough: Look, we don\u2019t want to sound ungrateful. Any rain is very welcome. But we need significantly more rain to make any impact on these fires. What it has done over the last 24 hours is calmed and slowed fire behaviour and stopped the forward progress of the fire. So, that\u2019s a good thing. But the flipside of that is, unfortunately, as I mentioned, it makes it difficult to get our air assets up because of the cloud cover and the smoke, and it can make fire trails just a little bit slippery for trucks when they get back in there. So, in some ways it\u2019s been a good thing, but it\u2019s not enough to put these fires out. Asked how long it would take for the fires to return to full strength, when the dangerous conditions return at the end of the week, Freeman says: Look, it won\u2019t take much at all. The underlying dryness, because of the drought, is pretty severe. So, this little bit of rain will quickly evaporate once we get those warmer conditions on Thursday and Friday, and that little bit of wind, of course, and those fires will take off again. They are in that alpine country, in heavy fuel. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s light fuel that can easily be put out. Yup. Also \u201cweather girl\u201d. Laura Tobin has a degree in physics and meteorology from the University of Reading. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg will meet with the Insurance Council of Australia today, as well as bank CEOs, to discuss the response to the bushfire crisis. The Insurance Council estimates the disaster has surpassed $700m in claims. So far, 8,985 claims have been submitted. At least 1,830 homes have been destroyed. Asked if Scott Morrison\u2019s initial response to the crisis was embarrassing for the nation, Craig Kelly says: Absolutely not. In fact, what has been disappointing is that we are a very stoic nation. We have had disasters in the past. Everyone has got behind the leader, we have got in there, done our best to clean it up. But unfortunately, during an international tragedy, we have seen people actually trying to exploit it for political advantage. \u201cThere is no denialist cult,\u201d Craig Kelly says, about views about climate change within the Morrison government. He says the debate should be about hazard reduction. Which has already been explained about a million times. \u201cThe weather girl had no idea what she was talking about,\u201d Craig Kelly says. \u201cShe says the Australia continent is drying out and that is just not true.\u201d On what Craig Kelly says his colleagues will think: I think they will think that I have been out there, defending our nation. Craig Kelly is on ABC radio now, making the same points he made on the BBC and British television. He denies he embarrassed the prime minister and says he will continue to defend Scott Morrison. Cold Chisel, Birds of Tokyo and Magic Dirt have cancelled their Day on the Green concert at Rutherglen in Victoria because of the hazardous air quality. From the promoter Michael Newton\u2019s statement: We are extremely disappointed to cancel today\u2019s event at All Saints Estate but the unsafe conditions give us no other option. Our first priority is the safety of patrons, staff and artists and with air quality on the site and in surrounding areas now at a hazardous level, we have no other option but to cancel today\u2019s show. All tickets will be refunded but that could take up to a week. Friday\u2019s and Saturday\u2019s shows are still planned to go ahead, at this stage. The Coalition backbencher Craig Kelly has been trending on Twitter most of the night after agreeing to this interview with Piers Morgan on UK breakfast television. Morgan has been critical of Scott Morrison\u2019s response to the bushfire crisis, so it only makes sense that Kelly decided to go on his show and speak to him, and reinforce all of his anger. Kelly was saved during a pre-selection battle by Morrison\u2019s intervention. He\u2019s repaid him by consistently going on UK media and undermining the prime minister\u2019s attempts to pretend that his government has always believed in the link between climate change and worsening natural disasters, like the drought and bushfires. Good morning. Firefighters in NSW and Victoria are seizing another day of cooler temperatures and lower winds to try to get ahead of the fires which have blazed across at least 4.9m hectares. There are no emergency alert fires as we begin today, but Victoria still has watch and act alerts.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cLabor lost the election because of a weak strategy that could not adapt to the change in [government] leadership, a cluttered policy agenda that looked risky and an unpopular leader. Not one of these shortcomings was decisive but in combination they explain the result.\u201d</p> <p>Only a few weeks after Labour\u2019s general election disaster, this seems a fair analysis of what went wrong. Except that it is no such thing. It is the Australian Labor party\u2019s <a href=\"https://alp.org.au/media/2043/alp-campaign-review-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">internal review</a> after its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/19/scott-morrison-credits-the-quiet-australians-for-miracle-election-victory\" title=\"\">shock general election defeat</a> last May. It is an honest assessment, available to all, of why and how democratic leftwing parties lose elections. Given what unfolded in the UK election, it is unlikely that anyone close to the Labour leadership had read it. Or if they had, they ignored its central findings.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn has promised to stay on as party leader to allow a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/devastating-exit-poll-triggers-bitter-blame-game-within-labour\" title=\"\">period of reflection</a>\u201d. He is right that reflection is needed, but so is a review of how Labour lost, why it lost, and how to ensure those mistakes are never repeated. The former leader Ed Miliband has now joined a group of MPs and other party members to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/23/labour-mps-from-all-wings-of-party-launch-inquiry-into-election-defeat\" title=\"\">carry this out</a>.</p> <p>This review desperately needs to consider what the future holds for progressive politics in Boris Johnson\u2019s Britain. However, it cannot be rushed through before a spring leadership election.</p> <p>The Australian Labor review took five months. This was done in the context of a parliament with three-year terms and an election that everyone expected Labor to win, which ultimately left the party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2019/may/18/live-results-for-the-2019-australian-election-track-the-votes\" title=\"\">eight seats short</a> of a majority government. In contrast, Britain has five-year terms, Labour lost hugely, and at no stage did the polls predict that Corbyn would be elected.</p> <p>Only three Labour leaders since 1945 have won elections: Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Tony Blair. All three were highly able political leaders, but all only won their first election after long periods of Conservative rule. That is a stark lesson for Labour. Not only must you have a highly competent leader, you also need years of Conservative misrule for the public to take a chance on you.</p> <p>Labour might not win an election until 2025. That would be 20 years since Blair\u2019s third election victory. None of the subsequent Labour leaders have come close. If they are not in with a reasonable prospect of winning in 2025, Labour\u2019s very survival will be in question, for what is the point of a political party that cannot win elections?</p> <p>Labour\u2019s review cannot be a partisan one, controlled by one particular faction at the expense of another. It has to be transparent and brutal in its honesty about mistakes. Factionalism can have no place. The review must also have the gravitas to direct Labour away from repeating its electoral failings.</p> <p>The Australian Labor party\u2019s approach \u2013 forming a review body of six respected party figures, including political grandees \u2013 is, of course, one way it could be done. However, the British party\u2019s problems could quickly become existential if it refuses to engage effectively with the recent past.</p> <p>That is why its review needs not only its political, trade union and community figures, but also a well-respected legal presence, such as a retired high court judge or a senior lawyer. This is the best way of ensuring the review has the skills necessary to gather evidence, record and categorise it. That legal presence needs to be independent of the past and current Labour leadership. Failure to source this legal skill set risks the review becoming a broad exchange of political perspectives that lacks a detailed analysis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/labour-unity-leadership-race\">After years of division, Labour unity is now a real possibility | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, a review is just the start. Many may ask what the point is of a review, given that those in control of the Labour movement may choose to ignore it. However, even if that dispiriting prospect should prove true, a high-quality, transparent review would still give an analytical guide to those progressive voices that are fed up with losing over and over again.</p> <p>The Labour party deserves better than post-election polemics, and so do those working-class voters who felt they had no choice but to vote Conservative.</p> <p>The Australian Labor party has many more years left in it. Does the British Labour party care enough about winning to safeguard its future? How it engages with a review will go a long way to answering that question.</p> <p>\u2022 Ed Williams QC is a barrister at Cloisters chambers, and a former prospective parliamentary candidate for Labour</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cLabor lost the election because of a weak strategy that could not adapt to the change in [government] leadership, a cluttered policy agenda that looked risky and an unpopular leader. Not one of these shortcomings was decisive but in combination they explain the result.\u201d Only a few weeks after Labour\u2019s general election disaster, this seems a fair analysis of what went wrong. Except that it is no such thing. It is the Australian Labor party\u2019s internal review after its shock general election defeat last May. It is an honest assessment, available to all, of why and how democratic leftwing parties lose elections. Given what unfolded in the UK election, it is unlikely that anyone close to the Labour leadership had read it. Or if they had, they ignored its central findings. Jeremy Corbyn has promised to stay on as party leader to allow a \u201cperiod of reflection\u201d. He is right that reflection is needed, but so is a review of how Labour lost, why it lost, and how to ensure those mistakes are never repeated. The former leader Ed Miliband has now joined a group of MPs and other party members to carry this out. This review desperately needs to consider what the future holds for progressive politics in Boris Johnson\u2019s Britain. However, it cannot be rushed through before a spring leadership election. The Australian Labor review took five months. This was done in the context of a parliament with three-year terms and an election that everyone expected Labor to win, which ultimately left the party eight seats short of a majority government. In contrast, Britain has five-year terms, Labour lost hugely, and at no stage did the polls predict that Corbyn would be elected. Only three Labour leaders since 1945 have won elections: Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Tony Blair. All three were highly able political leaders, but all only won their first election after long periods of Conservative rule. That is a stark lesson for Labour. Not only must you have a highly competent leader, you also need years of Conservative misrule for the public to take a chance on you. Labour might not win an election until 2025. That would be 20 years since Blair\u2019s third election victory. None of the subsequent Labour leaders have come close. If they are not in with a reasonable prospect of winning in 2025, Labour\u2019s very survival will be in question, for what is the point of a political party that cannot win elections? Labour\u2019s review cannot be a partisan one, controlled by one particular faction at the expense of another. It has to be transparent and brutal in its honesty about mistakes. Factionalism can have no place. The review must also have the gravitas to direct Labour away from repeating its electoral failings. The Australian Labor party\u2019s approach \u2013 forming a review body of six respected party figures, including political grandees \u2013 is, of course, one way it could be done. However, the British party\u2019s problems could quickly become existential if it refuses to engage effectively with the recent past. That is why its review needs not only its political, trade union and community figures, but also a well-respected legal presence, such as a retired high court judge or a senior lawyer. This is the best way of ensuring the review has the skills necessary to gather evidence, record and categorise it. That legal presence needs to be independent of the past and current Labour leadership. Failure to source this legal skill set risks the review becoming a broad exchange of political perspectives that lacks a detailed analysis. Of course, a review is just the start. Many may ask what the point is of a review, given that those in control of the Labour movement may choose to ignore it. However, even if that dispiriting prospect should prove true, a high-quality, transparent review would still give an analytical guide to those progressive voices that are fed up with losing over and over again. The Labour party deserves better than post-election polemics, and so do those working-class voters who felt they had no choice but to vote Conservative. The Australian Labor party has many more years left in it. Does the British Labour party care enough about winning to safeguard its future? How it engages with a review will go a long way to answering that question. \u2022 Ed Williams QC is a barrister at Cloisters chambers, and a former prospective parliamentary candidate for Labour",

      "body": "<p>Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson were at a Spice Girls concert last spring, just two figures in a sea of people. As they gazed around the stadium, Kay broke down in tears. Not because of anything the Spice Girls were singing, but because the two chefs were consumed by the thought of their own followers; they have more than 900,000 on Facebook. \u201cWhen we go to a gig, it\u2019s like: \u2018We could fill this space so many times!\u2019 It becomes very, very scary,\u201d Featherstone says.</p> <p>They got the same feeling at Fleetwood Mac. Featherstone has sweaty palms just thinking about it. She and Allinson, who are business as well as life partners, try to \u201cforget the noughts\u201d and imagine a community of 900, but it\u2019s still a long way from the days when they had their own restaurant with customers who came in every Sunday and even brought the pair presents if they went on a cruise.</p> <p>No wonder Allinson, 48, and Featherstone, 34, sound bewildered, if not downright terrified. Their success as the chef duo <a href=\"https://pinchofnom.com/\" title=\"\">Pinch of Nom</a> has been sudden. Last spring, their first book of simple slimming recipes sold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/27/slimming-cookbook-becomes-fastest-selling-non-fiction-book-since-records-began\" title=\"\">500,000 copies in just five weeks</a> (and recently passed the 1m mark). Last month\u2019s follow-up, Everyday Light, sold nearly 130,000 in its first week, knocking David Walliams from the top of the bestseller list.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a little bit crazy,\u201d Featherstone whispers, as if danger lurks nearby. They have had offers for TV shows \u2013 \u201coffers for everything\u201d \u2013 but have declined them all because they are \u201creally shy\u201d, says Featherstone, although she is \u201cthe gobbier half because Kate doesn\u2019t usually like to talk\u201d. (\u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d says Allinson, whose T-shirt is emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cIntroverts unite \u2013 separately in your own homes\u201d.) When I ask if they might choose to meet their followers \u2013 I\u2019m thinking of events \u2013 they say that they did bump into some once, and you can\u2019t say it won\u2019t happen again. \u201cBut it has never been about us,\u201d Featherstone says, and Allinson, a sort of quiet chorus, echoes her words. \u201cIt\u2019s never been about us.\u201d</p> <p>This is something of a mantra for Featherstone and Allinson, and I\u2019m intrigued by their wish to deny they are protagonists in their own enterprise. After all, many of their recipes are autobiographical. \u201cTin of praters\u201d, a bacon, potato and onion bake, is lifted straight from Featherstone\u2019s childhood, while the entire Pinch of Nom adventure took off when the two went along to their local Slimming World in Wirral four years ago, then began to post their own recipes to a growing Facebook community.</p> <p>Their personal story is at the heart of their business \u2013 but so is their disavowal of it. \u201cWe don\u2019t spout about ourselves. We\u2019re not that sort,\u201d Featherstone says. They don\u2019t take selfies; even on their first date, the only picture they took was of a gull. Photographs of them are rare.</p> <p>Neither of them has ever followed a specific diet; not Atkins, 5:2, keto nor intermittent fasting. In many ways, they are unlikely authors of a diet book. And this, I suspect, is at the heart of the pressure they feel \u2013 a double bind in which the story of their efforts to lose weight speaks to their community, but also creates an expectation for a narrative of progress. \u201cI sometimes worry what people will think of us. Like, why the hell are you pushing a diet book when you\u2019re not a skinny minny?\u201d Featherstone says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the accepted norm that people lose weight, [then] they do a book. But we\u2019re still in that process.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3609fc543dc32ef5a59fb9403f694a83451a566e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3609fc543dc32ef5a59fb9403f694a83451a566e/0_64_2500_3123/801.jpg\" alt=\"Pinch of Nom\u2019s katsu scotch eggs.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pinch of Nom\u2019s katsu scotch eggs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike English</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In newspaper articles, Allinson and Featherstone are often described as \u201ctwo fat chefs\u201d. They laugh uproariously when I point this out. \u201cDo you know we have a little list of the things we have been described as?\u201d Featherstone says. \u201cFat. Middle-aged. Jolly.\u201d Allinson chuckles. \u201cWe found it really funny,\u201d Featherstone says. Then the tone abruptly shifts.</p> <p>\u201cSadly, it is the way that some people talk about people of our size. \u2018Fat\u2019 is a word that people will use willy-nilly to describe people of size. And I personally hate it,\u201d Featherstone says. \u201cIt makes me angry deep inside \u2026\u201d</p> <p>In March, the pair revealed they were aiming to lose 190kg (30 stone) between them. Featherstone had so far lost 44kg and Allinson 31kg. I\u2019m curious as to how they divvied up the target. Featherstone says: \u201cWe came up with that between us.\u201d They didn\u2019t figure out how much each wanted to lose? \u201cWe\u2019ve never really had a target,\u201d Allinson says. \u201cBecause I think that can put a lot of pressure on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t do pressure,\u201d Featherstone adds. But surely two books in the space of a year put pressure on them? \u201cWe don\u2019t intentionally put pressure on ourselves,\u201d Allinson says. \u201cIs a better way of putting it,\u201d Featherstone nods.</p> <p>I\u2019m curious to know if they have lost more weight since the first book, but Featherstone says that the numbers are still what they were.</p> <p>The body of any diet author will always be taken as a measure of success. Is that on their mind? \u201cIt can\u2019t not be,\u201d Featherstone says. \u201cWe think about things a lot. It\u2019s why we\u2019re both so anxious all the time \u2026 We still struggle. Even now. We kind of fluctuate. We have a steady loss.\u201d And while fluctuation and steadiness may seem at odds with each other, no doubt those who are sharing their weight loss \u201cjourney\u201d will relate to the apparent contradiction.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always been really honest and open about it,\u201d Allinson says.</p> <p>They have had an intense and challenging year, adjusting not just to huge public interest, but also to the loss of Allinson\u2019s mum.

I assume she is asking for Allinson, but she quickly adds: \u201cBecause I\u2019m wearing mascara and I know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Allinson fishes in her bag and passes her one. They happily rattle off their differences \u2013 Allinson is organised, decisive and likes strong tea; Featherstone is disorganised, indecisive, talkative and takes her tea milky.

      "bodyText": "Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson were at a Spice Girls concert last spring, just two figures in a sea of people. As they gazed around the stadium, Kay broke down in tears. Not because of anything the Spice Girls were singing, but because the two chefs were consumed by the thought of their own followers; they have more than 900,000 on Facebook. \u201cWhen we go to a gig, it\u2019s like: \u2018We could fill this space so many times!\u2019 It becomes very, very scary,\u201d Featherstone says. They got the same feeling at Fleetwood Mac. Featherstone has sweaty palms just thinking about it. She and Allinson, who are business as well as life partners, try to \u201cforget the noughts\u201d and imagine a community of 900, but it\u2019s still a long way from the days when they had their own restaurant with customers who came in every Sunday and even brought the pair presents if they went on a cruise. No wonder Allinson, 48, and Featherstone, 34, sound bewildered, if not downright terrified. Their success as the chef duo Pinch of Nom has been sudden. Last spring, their first book of simple slimming recipes sold 500,000 copies in just five weeks (and recently passed the 1m mark). Last month\u2019s follow-up, Everyday Light, sold nearly 130,000 in its first week, knocking David Walliams from the top of the bestseller list. \u201cIt has been a little bit crazy,\u201d Featherstone whispers, as if danger lurks nearby. They have had offers for TV shows \u2013 \u201coffers for everything\u201d \u2013 but have declined them all because they are \u201creally shy\u201d, says Featherstone, although she is \u201cthe gobbier half because Kate doesn\u2019t usually like to talk\u201d. (\u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d says Allinson, whose T-shirt is emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cIntroverts unite \u2013 separately in your own homes\u201d.) When I ask if they might choose to meet their followers \u2013 I\u2019m thinking of events \u2013 they say that they did bump into some once, and you can\u2019t say it won\u2019t happen again. \u201cBut it has never been about us,\u201d Featherstone says, and Allinson, a sort of quiet chorus, echoes her words. \u201cIt\u2019s never been about us.\u201d This is something of a mantra for Featherstone and Allinson, and I\u2019m intrigued by their wish to deny they are protagonists in their own enterprise. After all, many of their recipes are autobiographical. \u201cTin of praters\u201d, a bacon, potato and onion bake, is lifted straight from Featherstone\u2019s childhood, while the entire Pinch of Nom adventure took off when the two went along to their local Slimming World in Wirral four years ago, then began to post their own recipes to a growing Facebook community. Their personal story is at the heart of their business \u2013 but so is their disavowal of it. \u201cWe don\u2019t spout about ourselves. We\u2019re not that sort,\u201d Featherstone says. They don\u2019t take selfies; even on their first date, the only picture they took was of a gull. Photographs of them are rare. Neither of them has ever followed a specific diet; not Atkins, 5:2, keto nor intermittent fasting. In many ways, they are unlikely authors of a diet book. And this, I suspect, is at the heart of the pressure they feel \u2013 a double bind in which the story of their efforts to lose weight speaks to their community, but also creates an expectation for a narrative of progress. \u201cI sometimes worry what people will think of us. Like, why the hell are you pushing a diet book when you\u2019re not a skinny minny?\u201d Featherstone says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the accepted norm that people lose weight, [then] they do a book. But we\u2019re still in that process.\u201d In newspaper articles, Allinson and Featherstone are often described as \u201ctwo fat chefs\u201d. They laugh uproariously when I point this out. \u201cDo you know we have a little list of the things we have been described as?\u201d Featherstone says. \u201cFat. Middle-aged. Jolly.\u201d Allinson chuckles. \u201cWe found it really funny,\u201d Featherstone says. Then the tone abruptly shifts. \u201cSadly, it is the way that some people talk about people of our size. \u2018Fat\u2019 is a word that people will use willy-nilly to describe people of size. And I personally hate it,\u201d Featherstone says. \u201cIt makes me angry deep inside \u2026\u201d In March, the pair revealed they were aiming to lose 190kg (30 stone) between them. Featherstone had so far lost 44kg and Allinson 31kg. I\u2019m curious as to how they divvied up the target. Featherstone says: \u201cWe came up with that between us.\u201d They didn\u2019t figure out how much each wanted to lose? \u201cWe\u2019ve never really had a target,\u201d Allinson says. \u201cBecause I think that can put a lot of pressure on.\u201d \u201cAnd we don\u2019t do pressure,\u201d Featherstone adds. But surely two books in the space of a year put pressure on them? \u201cWe don\u2019t intentionally put pressure on ourselves,\u201d Allinson says. \u201cIs a better way of putting it,\u201d Featherstone nods. I\u2019m curious to know if they have lost more weight since the first book, but Featherstone says that the numbers are still what they were. The body of any diet author will always be taken as a measure of success. Is that on their mind? \u201cIt can\u2019t not be,\u201d Featherstone says. \u201cWe think about things a lot. It\u2019s why we\u2019re both so anxious all the time \u2026 We still struggle. Even now. We kind of fluctuate. We have a steady loss.\u201d And while fluctuation and steadiness may seem at odds with each other, no doubt those who are sharing their weight loss \u201cjourney\u201d will relate to the apparent contradiction. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been really honest and open about it,\u201d Allinson says. They have had an intense and challenging year, adjusting not just to huge public interest, but also to the loss of Allinson\u2019s mum. Or, as Featherstone puts it: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a great year, but we\u2019ve also had a shit year.\u201d Allinson\u2019s mother died in January, the day after the couple told her they were going to publish a book.

      "body": "<p><strong>Fighting fires may harm Australians\u2019 freedoms</strong><br>Your opening weekly teaser summary on the catastrophic Australian bushfires poses an important question: \u201cWith the planet at a climate tipping point, will large-scale disasters such as these help push even climate-sceptical governments into taking major action?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/01/welcome-to-the-roaring-2020s-inside-the-3-january-edition-of-guardian-weekly\" title=\"\">(3 January)</a>. Our Australian experience suggests that it will \u2013 but too slowly and at some cost to our liberty.</p> <p>We are now seeing an increasingly authoritarian tone in recent moves to combat the current bushfire crisis by our climate-sceptical federal government.</p> <p>It recently announced it is overriding the states and dictating the action it is taking in response to the fires. At the same time it is now deploying not only regular troops but, in a move unprecedented in peacetime, reservist troops as well.</p> <p>Given that our fire services are organised along quasi-military lines, Australia has a militaristic feel last seen on the home front in the second world war. So, the question is not so much whether climate-sceptical governments can find the resolve to effectively combat short-term specific climatic contingencies, but to what degree as a matter of practicality this can happen with the longer-term measures needed to avert disaster while still remaining a free society.<br><em>Terry Hewton</em><br><em>Adelaide, South Australia</em></p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson faces grave challenges</strong><br>Andrew Rawnsley may think the jury is out on Boris Johnson (Now we will see what Boris Johnson thinks and believes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/15/we-willl-now-find-out-what-triumphant-boris-johnson-really-wants-and-believes\" title=\"\">20 December</a>), but given the total failure of the succession of promises made on the NHS since 2010, only a fool would expect the Johnson administration to deliver on his more recent shopping list. What\u2019s more, there is virtually no chance that it will be held to account \u2013 government\u2019s congenital tendency to obfuscate and manipulate figures and Johnson\u2019s legendary parsimony with the truth will guarantee it.</p> <p>However, I am shocked, but not surprised, given the flakiness of our commentariat on climate issues, that Rawnsley does not identify the really inescapable challenge that Johnson will face \u2013 that of the climate. The next five years will be as crucial as any, and unless massive steps are taken to make a deep cut in emissions and to shift the global economy into a radically more sustainable path there will be nowhere to hide, as Australia\u2019s Scott Morrison is beginning to find out.<br><em>Neil Blackshaw </em><br><em>Barbizon, France</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your post-UK election summary (20 December) offers little optimism for those who had hoped for an outcome that reflected the evident discontent with Boris Johnson\u2019s government, shown in the recent mass protests across the nation. Commentators including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/14/eu-membership-european-england-brexit\" title=\"\">Timothy Garton Ash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/britains-new-political-landscape\" title=\"\">Robert Ford</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/boris-johnson-one-nation-tory-or-raging-populist\" title=\"\">Tim Bale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/inside-labours-campaign-behind\" title=\"\">Heather Stewart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/14/labour-meltdown-decades-govern-votes\" title=\"\">Aditya Chakrabortty</a> quite rightly lay the blame on a dysfunctional and wishy-washy Labour campaign under Jeremy Corbyn, which failed to consolidate the opposition to Brexit, instead trying to straddle both sides of an imaginary fence.</p> <p>However, they all fail to identify a new set of policies that might unify the now demoralised Labour party, while capturing the votes of the growing bloc of younger voters. This could embody more emphasis on social justice, a fair wage and immediate action on climate change. Sounds rather like the platform of the Greens? This is where the future of a progressive Labour party lies, though we may have to wait for the almost inevitable failure of the Johnson government to revive the British economy, as well as a possible fragmentation of the UK, before the penny drops.

      "bodyText": "Fighting fires may harm Australians\u2019 freedoms Your opening weekly teaser summary on the catastrophic Australian bushfires poses an important question: \u201cWith the planet at a climate tipping point, will large-scale disasters such as these help push even climate-sceptical governments into taking major action?\u201d (3 January). Our Australian experience suggests that it will \u2013 but too slowly and at some cost to our liberty. We are now seeing an increasingly authoritarian tone in recent moves to combat the current bushfire crisis by our climate-sceptical federal government. It recently announced it is overriding the states and dictating the action it is taking in response to the fires. At the same time it is now deploying not only regular troops but, in a move unprecedented in peacetime, reservist troops as well. Given that our fire services are organised along quasi-military lines, Australia has a militaristic feel last seen on the home front in the second world war. So, the question is not so much whether climate-sceptical governments can find the resolve to effectively combat short-term specific climatic contingencies, but to what degree as a matter of practicality this can happen with the longer-term measures needed to avert disaster while still remaining a free society. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia Boris Johnson faces grave challenges Andrew Rawnsley may think the jury is out on Boris Johnson (Now we will see what Boris Johnson thinks and believes, 20 December), but given the total failure of the succession of promises made on the NHS since 2010, only a fool would expect the Johnson administration to deliver on his more recent shopping list. What\u2019s more, there is virtually no chance that it will be held to account \u2013 government\u2019s congenital tendency to obfuscate and manipulate figures and Johnson\u2019s legendary parsimony with the truth will guarantee it. However, I am shocked, but not surprised, given the flakiness of our commentariat on climate issues, that Rawnsley does not identify the really inescapable challenge that Johnson will face \u2013 that of the climate. The next five years will be as crucial as any, and unless massive steps are taken to make a deep cut in emissions and to shift the global economy into a radically more sustainable path there will be nowhere to hide, as Australia\u2019s Scott Morrison is beginning to find out. Neil Blackshaw Barbizon, France \u2022 Your post-UK election summary (20 December) offers little optimism for those who had hoped for an outcome that reflected the evident discontent with Boris Johnson\u2019s government, shown in the recent mass protests across the nation. Commentators including Timothy Garton Ash, Robert Ford, Tim Bale, Heather Stewart and Aditya Chakrabortty quite rightly lay the blame on a dysfunctional and wishy-washy Labour campaign under Jeremy Corbyn, which failed to consolidate the opposition to Brexit, instead trying to straddle both sides of an imaginary fence. However, they all fail to identify a new set of policies that might unify the now demoralised Labour party, while capturing the votes of the growing bloc of younger voters. This could embody more emphasis on social justice, a fair wage and immediate action on climate change. Sounds rather like the platform of the Greens? This is where the future of a progressive Labour party lies, though we may have to wait for the almost inevitable failure of the Johnson government to revive the British economy, as well as a possible fragmentation of the UK, before the penny drops. Brexit may constitute the bitter remedy that brings this about. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia Disaster tourists deserve no special protection Tourists who ignore their own governments\u2019 warnings against travel to Syria so that they can \u201cmingle with locals while also passing destroyed villages\u201d, should be offered no assistance whatsoever by those governments when they find themselves in trouble (6 December). Chances are some of those locals will object to tourists taking selfies in front of a smashed home or bombed-out family business: and who could blame them? Ken Burns Edmonton, Alberta, Canada Please don\u2019t confuse the bell with the tower I was taught the bell is Big Ben, while the tower, alluded to in Dan Hancox\u2019s article on London\u2019s proposed MSG Sphere, is the Elizabeth tower to commemorate Queen Elizabeth\u2019s diamond jubilee (3 January).

      "body": "<p>For Italian football, the decade began with a little bit of history repeating. It was Mario Balotelli who scored the first Serie A goal of the 2010s, and on Sunday he delivered the opening strike of the 2020s as well: spinning away from his marker in the 18th minute of Brescia\u2019s game at home to Lazio, before dispatching Stefano Sabelli\u2019s long pass <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB687kkA70Y\">with a first-time finish off his left boot</a>.</p> \n<p>Why always him? In truth, the slogan no longer feels apt. Balotelli has dazzled us only intermittently, the highs of a Premier League win and European Championship final in 2012 obscured by too many nondescript seasons since.</p> \n<p>There have been positive stretches \u2013 at Milan and Nice, most notably \u2013 but nothing close to what was imagined for him on 6 January 2010. Still a teenager, he had already played more than 50 senior games for Inter before he opened the year by scoring the only goal in a win over Chievo. He finished that season as a treble-winner.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/mario-balotelli-accuses-lazio-fans-racism\">\u2018Shame on you\u2019: Mario Balotelli accuses Lazio fans of racism</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The context is very different for Balotelli today. Brescia, his hometown club, would be delighted simply to avoid relegation. And yet, some aspects of playing in Italy remain grimly familiar. Balotelli claimed he was racially abused during that Inter-Chievo game, and suffered abuse by Lazio supporters on Sunday.</p> \n<p>At least this time the issue was acknowledged \u2013 both by the match official, who suspended the game for a short time after a warning from the stadium PA went unheeded, and Lazio, who issued a statement threatening legal action against fans who \u201cbetray their sporting passion and cause great damage to the image of the club\u201d. In 2010, the Chievo president Luca Campedelli had flatly rejected the accusations of racism, saying that: \u201cBalotelli must not dare to insult the people of Verona.\u201d</p> \n<p>Still, this was a grim note on which to start the new year. The game itself had been compelling, Lazio coming back to win in second-half injury time. Ciro Immobile scored both goals for the visitors, taking his tally to 19 already in a league campaign that has not reached its halfway stage. Born in the same year as Balotelli, he has had his share of lost seasons, too, but there is no question whose star is shining brighter as they approach their 30th birthdays.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1214293261973643264\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udd35\u26ab Lautaro Martinez restores Inter's two goal lead!<br><br>\ud83d\ude4c The Nerazzurri's deadly duo up front have tormented Napoli tonight <a href=\"https://t.co/aqAeTDmwPn\">pic.twitter.com/aqAeTDmwPn</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1214293261973643264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 6, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Victory moved Lazio \u2013 who began the weekend with a game in hand \u2013 to within three points of Juventus and Inter at the top. Both responded with emphatic wins of their own. Cristiano Ronaldo decimated Cagliari with his first Serie A hat-trick, before Romelu Lukaku\u2019s brace inspired Inter to victory at Napoli.</p> \n<p>Both players profited from the generosity of opponents. Cagliari had delivered an obstinate first-half performance at the Allianz Stadium, only for Ragnar Klavan to play a thoughtless pass across the edge of his own box at the start of the second. Ronaldo reacted faster than Sebastian Walukiewicz, the 19-year-old making his debut for the Sardinians at centre-half, seizing possession and rounding Robin Olsen to score.</p> \n<p>Cagliari unravelled thereafter, but the champions were ruthless as well. Ronaldo looked as sharp as he has all season, supplementing his three strikes with an assist for Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. This was the Portuguese player\u2019s fifth consecutive game with at least one goal, lending credence to Maurizio Sarri\u2019s claim that he is finally getting over his knee injury.</p> \n<p>A win at home to Cagliari was expected, even in a season when Rolando Maran\u2019s team have punched far above their weight. For Inter to triumph in Naples was more significant. They had not taken three points from the Stadio San Paolo since 1997.</p> \n<p>Napoli gave them plenty of assistance in ending that hex. Giovanni Di Lorenzo lost his footing in the 14th minute \u2013 leaving space for Lukaku to intercept Mario Rui\u2019s pass before marauding 50 yards upfield and crashing a left-footed shot in off the post. Napoli\u2019s keeper, Alex Meret, then allowed a shot from the Belgian to go straight through him for Inter\u2019s second.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"771a906e537534a10617ad6b29b4115fd4edaa69\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/771a906e537534a10617ad6b29b4115fd4edaa69/0_0_3500_2479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Romelu Lukaku celebrates after scoring Inter\u2019s second goal during the 3-1 win over Napoli.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Romelu Lukaku celebrates after scoring Inter\u2019s second goal during the 3-1 win over Napoli.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Lingria/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The hosts were not out of the game yet, and pulled a goal back through Arkadiusz Milik before the break. But a further misjudgement from Kostas Manolas finished them, his attempt to cut out a Mat\u00edas Vecino cross instead ending with him sliding the ball straight into the path of Lautaro Mart\u00ednez. The Argentinian buried it to seal a 3-1 win.</p> \n<p>It was a game that encapsulated both teams in their present state. Napoli are a side in transition \u2013 working to find a new identity after replacing Carlo Ancelotti with Gennaro Gattuso. The restoration of Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n to a more advanced role, on the right of a 4-3-3, was rewarded on their goal: the Spaniard providing the assist after being picked out on himself on a back-post run that called back to Sarri\u2019s time in charge.</p> \n<p>Inter, meanwhile, are effective uneven: a stodgy midfield compensated for by the brilliance of those two centre-forwards. Lukaku and Lautaro have already scored 30 goals between them this season. With Stefano Sensi and Nicol\u00f2 Barella both easing their way back from injury, and the club expected to make a move for Arturo Vidal imminently, there are reasons to believe they can play better, but they continue to win games in the meantime.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/06/cristiano-ronaldo-hits-first-juventus-hat-trick-in-cruise-past-cagliari\">Ronaldo hits first Juventus hat-trick in cruise past Cagliari; Inter beat Napoli</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The challenge remains, as it ever was, to maintain this relentless pace through a full campaign. Inter were top of Serie A at the start of January 2016 under Roberto Mancini, and finished that season in fourth place. It was a similar story two seasons later under Luciano Spalletti, when the collapse started in mid-December.</p> \n<p>Antonio Conte joked on Monday that he had been warned about a \u2018Fantozzi cloud\u2019 \u2013 a reference to the 1970s cult movie Fantozzi, in which the central character is followed around by his own personal rainstorm \u2013 which comes to drown Inter every winter. He then reiterated a line he has pushed all season, that he has \u201casked my team not to be crazy any more\u201d.</p> \n<p>History repeated for Balotelli this weekend. Conte is doing all that he can to prevent the striker\u2019s former club from heading down its own familiar path.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Next up for Inter: Atalanta, who sunk Parma 5-0, thus becoming the first team to win by that many goals in consecutive Serie A matches since, well, Inter \u2013 all the way back in 1960. It\u2019s hard to keep finding superlatives for this team but if you haven\u2019t watched at least the highlights yet, make time. All five goals were beautiful.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The other great blast from the past was, of course, Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The hype surrounding his return to Milan has been quite something, but reality bit for the almost 60,000 in attendance at San Siro after his second-half introduction. Ibrahimovic has something to offer, and he did lay on a chance for Rafael Leao soon after coming on, but at 38 he is very far from being a solution to all that ails this team. In fairness, few Milan fans ever expected such a thing. Many would be grateful, at this point, just to see someone in their colours score a goal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

      "bodyText": "For Italian football, the decade began with a little bit of history repeating. It was Mario Balotelli who scored the first Serie A goal of the 2010s, and on Sunday he delivered the opening strike of the 2020s as well: spinning away from his marker in the 18th minute of Brescia\u2019s game at home to Lazio, before dispatching Stefano Sabelli\u2019s long pass with a first-time finish off his left boot. Why always him? In truth, the slogan no longer feels apt. Balotelli has dazzled us only intermittently, the highs of a Premier League win and European Championship final in 2012 obscured by too many nondescript seasons since. There have been positive stretches \u2013 at Milan and Nice, most notably \u2013 but nothing close to what was imagined for him on 6 January 2010. Still a teenager, he had already played more than 50 senior games for Inter before he opened the year by scoring the only goal in a win over Chievo. He finished that season as a treble-winner. The context is very different for Balotelli today. Brescia, his hometown club, would be delighted simply to avoid relegation. And yet, some aspects of playing in Italy remain grimly familiar. Balotelli claimed he was racially abused during that Inter-Chievo game, and suffered abuse by Lazio supporters on Sunday. At least this time the issue was acknowledged \u2013 both by the match official, who suspended the game for a short time after a warning from the stadium PA went unheeded, and Lazio, who issued a statement threatening legal action against fans who \u201cbetray their sporting passion and cause great damage to the image of the club\u201d. In 2010, the Chievo president Luca Campedelli had flatly rejected the accusations of racism, saying that: \u201cBalotelli must not dare to insult the people of Verona.\u201d Still, this was a grim note on which to start the new year. The game itself had been compelling, Lazio coming back to win in second-half injury time. Ciro Immobile scored both goals for the visitors, taking his tally to 19 already in a league campaign that has not reached its halfway stage. Born in the same year as Balotelli, he has had his share of lost seasons, too, but there is no question whose star is shining brighter as they approach their 30th birthdays. Victory moved Lazio \u2013 who began the weekend with a game in hand \u2013 to within three points of Juventus and Inter at the top. Both responded with emphatic wins of their own. Cristiano Ronaldo decimated Cagliari with his first Serie A hat-trick, before Romelu Lukaku\u2019s brace inspired Inter to victory at Napoli. Both players profited from the generosity of opponents. Cagliari had delivered an obstinate first-half performance at the Allianz Stadium, only for Ragnar Klavan to play a thoughtless pass across the edge of his own box at the start of the second. Ronaldo reacted faster than Sebastian Walukiewicz, the 19-year-old making his debut for the Sardinians at centre-half, seizing possession and rounding Robin Olsen to score. Cagliari unravelled thereafter, but the champions were ruthless as well. Ronaldo looked as sharp as he has all season, supplementing his three strikes with an assist for Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. This was the Portuguese player\u2019s fifth consecutive game with at least one goal, lending credence to Maurizio Sarri\u2019s claim that he is finally getting over his knee injury. A win at home to Cagliari was expected, even in a season when Rolando Maran\u2019s team have punched far above their weight. For Inter to triumph in Naples was more significant. They had not taken three points from the Stadio San Paolo since 1997. Napoli gave them plenty of assistance in ending that hex. Giovanni Di Lorenzo lost his footing in the 14th minute \u2013 leaving space for Lukaku to intercept Mario Rui\u2019s pass before marauding 50 yards upfield and crashing a left-footed shot in off the post. Napoli\u2019s keeper, Alex Meret, then allowed a shot from the Belgian to go straight through him for Inter\u2019s second. The hosts were not out of the game yet, and pulled a goal back through Arkadiusz Milik before the break. But a further misjudgement from Kostas Manolas finished them, his attempt to cut out a Mat\u00edas Vecino cross instead ending with him sliding the ball straight into the path of Lautaro Mart\u00ednez. The Argentinian buried it to seal a 3-1 win. It was a game that encapsulated both teams in their present state. Napoli are a side in transition \u2013 working to find a new identity after replacing Carlo Ancelotti with Gennaro Gattuso. The restoration of Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n to a more advanced role, on the right of a 4-3-3, was rewarded on their goal: the Spaniard providing the assist after being picked out on himself on a back-post run that called back to Sarri\u2019s time in charge. Inter, meanwhile, are effective uneven: a stodgy midfield compensated for by the brilliance of those two centre-forwards. Lukaku and Lautaro have already scored 30 goals between them this season. With Stefano Sensi and Nicol\u00f2 Barella both easing their way back from injury, and the club expected to make a move for Arturo Vidal imminently, there are reasons to believe they can play better, but they continue to win games in the meantime. The challenge remains, as it ever was, to maintain this relentless pace through a full campaign. Inter were top of Serie A at the start of January 2016 under Roberto Mancini, and finished that season in fourth place. It was a similar story two seasons later under Luciano Spalletti, when the collapse started in mid-December. Antonio Conte joked on Monday that he had been warned about a \u2018Fantozzi cloud\u2019 \u2013 a reference to the 1970s cult movie Fantozzi, in which the central character is followed around by his own personal rainstorm \u2013 which comes to drown Inter every winter. He then reiterated a line he has pushed all season, that he has \u201casked my team not to be crazy any more\u201d. History repeated for Balotelli this weekend. Conte is doing all that he can to prevent the striker\u2019s former club from heading down its own familiar path. Talking points \u2022 Next up for Inter: Atalanta, who sunk Parma 5-0, thus becoming the first team to win by that many goals in consecutive Serie A matches since, well, Inter \u2013 all the way back in 1960. It\u2019s hard to keep finding superlatives for this team but if you haven\u2019t watched at least the highlights yet, make time. All five goals were beautiful. \u2022 The other great blast from the past was, of course, Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The hype surrounding his return to Milan has been quite something, but reality bit for the almost 60,000 in attendance at San Siro after his second-half introduction. Ibrahimovic has something to offer, and he did lay on a chance for Rafael Leao soon after coming on, but at 38 he is very far from being a solution to all that ails this team. In fairness, few Milan fans ever expected such a thing. Many would be grateful, at this point, just to see someone in their colours score a goal.",

While snooty New York bookish types were amusing to poke fun at, the Los Angeles macrobiotic-vegan-guru-movie-type feels overused, and a little less clever, though this does allow the writers to ramp up the silliness of the humour. In order to hide from Candace, Joe assumes a new identity. But old habits die hard, or at least harder than his ex-girlfriends, and he soon has a new object of his affections, Love. (What is it with this show\u2019s semantic tangles? Joe loves love, and Love, and boy do they love labouring the point.) Love, played by The Haunting of Hill House\u2019s Victoria Pedretti, is a recent widow and compulsive baker all too eager to let herself love again via Joe/Will, the self-styled Perfect Boyfriend, even if he is lying about his identity, and how he knows so much about her, and that telescope pointed directly at her house.</p> <p>Once again, nothing makes a lot of sense. This time, I found myself borderline apoplectic at the idea that police would ignore Candace\u2019s reports that her sociopathic ex-boyfriend attempted to murder her, and buried her while she was still alive, due to a lack of physical evidence, advising her instead to pretend to be dead. Joe can\u2019t text from Delilah\u2019s phone because it\u2019s covered in blood and smashed? Put the sim in another phone! But these moments of frustration are curated and deliberate; it\u2019s the reason the young people in horror movies, trapped in a house stalked by a serial killer, run upstairs rather than out of the front door.</p> <p>While season two is certainly funnier than season one, its amusements eventually wear thin, particularly when it comes to the fate of poor, doomed Delilah, a decent human being caught up in the nasty Joe and Love sideshow. In attempting to redeem his past actions, we see the queasy spectacle of Joe the Saviour \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t hurt women\u201d \u2013 rewiring his misdeeds into a Dexter-shaped narrative. There\u2019s even a mention of Dexter, the serial killer with a heart, to force the point home, and flashbacks of Joe\u2019s difficult childhood, so we know it was his mother that made him the way he is. It was enough to make me want to throw the towel in, having sufficiently gorged myself on its shlocky charms. But of course, there was a twist, the twist to end all twists, and Joe had met his match. </p> <p>When going through my notes, I found one that read, \u201cI hate this show\u201d, scribbled at around the halfway point. Yet I watched it until the end, from start to finish, in two days straight. I now realise that being frustrated by every single implausible twist, by its nauseating lurches from dark humour to horror, is part of the You experience, like cheering on your favourite team even when you know they\u2019re doomed to lose. At the risk of sounding like a Joe Goldberg voiceover, to hate You is to love it, Love.</p>",

In order to hide from Candace, Joe assumes a new identity. But old habits die hard, or at least harder than his ex-girlfriends, and he soon has a new object of his affections, Love. (What is it with this show\u2019s semantic tangles? Joe loves love, and Love, and boy do they love labouring the point.) Love, played by The Haunting of Hill House\u2019s Victoria Pedretti, is a recent widow and compulsive baker all too eager to let herself love again via Joe/Will, the self-styled Perfect Boyfriend, even if he is lying about his identity, and how he knows so much about her, and that telescope pointed directly at her house. Once again, nothing makes a lot of sense. This time, I found myself borderline apoplectic at the idea that police would ignore Candace\u2019s reports that her sociopathic ex-boyfriend attempted to murder her, and buried her while she was still alive, due to a lack of physical evidence, advising her instead to pretend to be dead. Joe can\u2019t text from Delilah\u2019s phone because it\u2019s covered in blood and smashed? Put the sim in another phone! But these moments of frustration are curated and deliberate; it\u2019s the reason the young people in horror movies, trapped in a house stalked by a serial killer, run upstairs rather than out of the front door. While season two is certainly funnier than season one, its amusements eventually wear thin, particularly when it comes to the fate of poor, doomed Delilah, a decent human being caught up in the nasty Joe and Love sideshow. In attempting to redeem his past actions, we see the queasy spectacle of Joe the Saviour \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t hurt women\u201d \u2013 rewiring his misdeeds into a Dexter-shaped narrative. There\u2019s even a mention of Dexter, the serial killer with a heart, to force the point home, and flashbacks of Joe\u2019s difficult childhood, so we know it was his mother that made him the way he is. It was enough to make me want to throw the towel in, having sufficiently gorged myself on its shlocky charms. But of course, there was a twist, the twist to end all twists, and Joe had met his match. When going through my notes, I found one that read, \u201cI hate this show\u201d, scribbled at around the halfway point. Yet I watched it until the end, from start to finish, in two days straight. I now realise that being frustrated by every single implausible twist, by its nauseating lurches from dark humour to horror, is part of the You experience, like cheering on your favourite team even when you know they\u2019re doomed to lose. At the risk of sounding like a Joe Goldberg voiceover, to hate You is to love it, Love.",

      "bodyText": "The Guardian has today announced Candice Carty-Williams, the bestselling novelist of the acclaimed book Queenie, is to write her first ever regular books column, in the Guardian. In her weekly column for the Guardian Review, Candice will share her thoughts on a wide range of topics, including books, theatre, arts and the literary world. On her appointment, Candice Carty-Williams said: \u201cAs a writer and a reader I am obsessed with how stories draw us in and shape our world. So when the Guardian approached me to write a column about literature in its many forms I was honoured and excited. I\u2019m looking forward to expanding my own reading, as well as readers\u2019, and enriching our understanding of what books mean to us.\u201d Carty Williams\u2019 appointment coincides with some updates to the Guardian\u2019s Review section, including a new column, \u201cHow I Wrote\u201d, in which leading authors including Sarah Perry and Chuck Palahniuk will reveal the stories behind their breakthrough novels. Review has also introduced a new regular feature, \u201cNotes From\u201d, in which foreign correspondents reveal the bestsellers, surprise hits and books making headlines in countries around the world. The first two instalments in this series have covered France and Germany. Charlotte Northedge and Liese Spencer, co-editors of Review said: \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to be working with Candice Carty-Williams on her first column \u2013 a new adventure for her and for Review. Every week, she will be writing a short piece about what she\u2019s been reading, watching and thinking about that week. \u201cWe are also excited to take Guardian readers behind the scenes of some of their best loved novels - from Sarah Perry\u2019s The Essex Serpent, to Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s Fight Club \u2013 as well as the latest books news from around the world.\u201d Carty-Williams\u2019 bestselling debut Queenie was shortlisted for the Costa First Novel Award. It was also shortlisted for the Waterstones, Foyles and Goodreads Book of 2019, and was selected as the Blackwell\u2019s Debut of the Year. She is currently writing her second novel. In 2016, Carty-Williams created and launched the Guardian and 4th Estate BAME Short Story Prize, the first inclusive initiative of its kind in book publishing. She has written for the Guardian, i-D, Vogue International and the Sunday Times. -ends- For more information please contact: media.enquiries@theguardian.com or 020 3353 3696 Notes to editors About Guardian News &amp; Media Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM) publishes theguardian.com, one of the world\u2019s leading English-language newspaper websites.

She squeezed her way in through a hole in the chain-link fence, and spent the day clearing the weeds and brambles.</p> <p>Then she pitched the first tent.</p> <p>\u201cEvery single day for the past decade I lived here, I walked on my way to work past this vacant lot, this eyesore, this blight that was never put to good use to the community,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn, 32, told the Guardian. \u201cMeanwhile, you would see the tents grow just a half a block down there. You see people literally sleeping on the side of the street, on the side of freeways.</p> <p>\u201cHere, we at least have a little sanctuary.\u201d</p> <p>Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn didn\u2019t start 37MLK with the intention of it lasting for as long as it has. She wanted to bring attention to her friends and longtime neighbors who were now in need of housing, in hopes of securing them some space for a tiny house. Her friend and longtime neighbor Skinny, for example, lost her housing because her partner got behind on the mortgage payments after suffering health issues.</p> <p>The community began as an all-women\u2019s encampment. Four months later, the lot has grown to house 21 people, including the male partners of some of the women. All the residents are black or Latinx, their ages ranging from 30 to 60. All are longtime neighborhood or Oakland residents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"022f519917e12884b254eda38f55b575b01a3920\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/022f519917e12884b254eda38f55b575b01a3920/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mini white picket fence lines the entrance to the homeless encampment at 37th Street and Martin Luther King Jr Way in Oakland, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mini white picket fence lines the entrance to the homeless encampment at 37th Street and Martin Luther King Jr Way in Oakland, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Talia Herman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn experienced homelessness herself. As a queer teenager growing up in New York, her conservative parents kicked her out and she had to navigate the shelter system through her youth. When she moved to the San Francisco Bay area for a fellowship at University of California, Berkeley, in 2009, she struggled to find an apartment, even with a documented source of income, because she had no rental history.</p> <p>\u201cThis neighborhood, it was my stepping stone out of homelessness,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I came out here in 2009, there were still landlords willing to rent cheap apartments, no questions asked. I could get an apartment for $800 with a $500 security deposit, a one-bedroom, and I still live in that apartment to this day because I have rent control. Now, identical units to mine go for over $2,000 a month. I see just the way I climbed out of homelessness, that door has closed behind me.\u201d</p> <p>In the decade since Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn moved to Oakland, cities in the Bay Area have seen a rapid transformation. Tech money flooded the region, changing the landscape irrevocably. Amid rapid gentrification, San Francisco saw<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/16/san-francisco-homeless-increase-tech-ipo\"> a 17% increase</a> in its homeless population last year . Oakland saw <a href=\"http://everyonehome.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019HIRDReport_Oakland_2019-Final.pdf\">a 47% increase</a> from 2017 \u2013 and an 85% increase from 2015.<strong> </strong>The uptick in numbers meant more people were visibly homeless, inciting tensions between the housed and unhoused, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/02/san-francisco-boulder-homeless-crisis\">on a local level</a> all the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/19/trump-attacks-californias-homeless-crisis-with-false-environmental-trope\">to the White House</a>. In July, a real estate developer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/12/oakland-developer-homeless-bribe\">tried to shoot $1,000</a> in dollar bills over a homeless encampment in Oakland in a humiliating attempt to get the residents to leave \u2013 despite the fact that they had nowhere else to go.</p> <p>In the shadow of staggering tech wealth, housed and unhoused residents, local lawmakers and housing advocates have been looking for drastic solutions for the immediate crisis at hand. Oakland rolled out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/14/oakland-homelessness-crisis-cabin-tiny-tuff-sheds-does-it-work\">its controversial \u201ctuff shed\u201d experiment</a>, housing homeless people in makeshift structures that resemble basic toolsheds. The Oakland city council president last month <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Councilwoman-says-a-cruise-ship-at-Oakland-s-14897717.php\">proposed docking a cruise ship</a> in the city\u2019s port to act as emergency housing akin to a refugee crisis after a disaster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"53ebb8a3c427f35fa91da5fc9a43157fed142b0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53ebb8a3c427f35fa91da5fc9a43157fed142b0c/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracy Lee, 36, lives at 37MLK.

(Under Martin v Boise, the ninth circuit court of appeals held that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/dec/16/supreme-court-wont-revive-homeless-camping-ban\">it constituted cruel and unusual punishment</a> to enforce criminal laws against homeless people living on the street if a city did not offer enough shelters.) Blight complaints tend to drive response, and garbage and vermin are serious issues in some camps, as is access to public restrooms.</p> <p>Not at 37MLK. The camp has a solar shower, camping toilets and a pump sink. It has a garden, a dining table, a kitchen and common couch area. \u201cThe number one thing is we have access to the resources that housed people have because I am housed,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn said. She and other housed neighbors work together to take care of the camp garbage, to empty the camp toilets in their apartments, to make sure the camp has clean water.</p> <p>\u201cSo often there are the allegations that homeless people are dirty or don\u2019t keep the space clean,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn said. \u201cNo, there\u2019s only one reason why we\u2019re clean and other encampments are dirty: we have actual access to trash facilities and we have access to running water that other encampments don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The police came twice, at the very beginning. The lot belongs to a not-for-profit that was suspended following apparent financial difficulties, including outstanding tax bills \u2013 a group that was a redevelopment organization specializing in low-income housing. But after the first two visits, the police never returned again. \u201cIt speaks to the severity of the crisis that the city hasn\u2019t shut us down yet,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn said. \u201cI think they\u2019re just putting out fires in so many arenas that we have been safe here because we don\u2019t cause problems in the neighborhood.\u201d</p> <h2>Not enough places for people to go</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0d53138b3f9937c74924a9d5f4cfb293a0b744a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d53138b3f9937c74924a9d5f4cfb293a0b744a9/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Skinny, 60, lives at the 37MLK homeless encampment after her partner suffered health issues that caused them to get behind on mortgage payments.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skinny, 60, lives at the 37MLK homeless encampment after her partner suffered health issues that caused them to get behind on mortgage payments.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Talia Herman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oakland city council member Nikki Fortunato Bas is one of the local lawmakers calling for turning vacant land into self-governed or co-governed encampments, something that would look a lot like 37MLK.</p> <p><em><strong>\u201c</strong></em>We simply don\u2019t have enough places for people to go,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough shelter beds. We don\u2019t have enough transitional housing. In the interim, as we\u2019re building deeply affordable housing, we need to have transitional spaces.\u201d</p> <p>Oakland already provides some services to some encampments that include picking up garbage, portable toilets and wash stations. But Bas believes more needs to be done, and has allocated $600,000 to pilot a project similar to 37MLK in Oakland. \u201cThese are spaces that people may need to stay in for two to five years, not a matter of months,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we need to be able to house them in a way that\u2019s healthy and safe and dignified.\u201d</p> <p>Some housing advocates have embraced the idea. They argue people are already living in squalid conditions in encampments that do not have the necessary resources to function in a safe and healthy manner. Some encampments are dealing with overcrowding, with too many people squeezed into too small a space. And every encampment that the city removes is just pushing people to form other encampments elsewhere under similar conditions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a problem that\u2019s not going to go away tomorrow,\u201d said Candice Elder, founder and executive director of the not-for-profit East Oakland Collective. \u201cWe understand that there\u2019s blight, and there are safety issues. But in the absence of adequate and enough housing, what can we do?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b1b8d3b98b7a9363e7981be569e2d77d9dcfca4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b1b8d3b98b7a9363e7981be569e2d77d9dcfca4/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"37MLK in Oakland features a garden, dining table, common kitchen and lounge area.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">37MLK in Oakland features a garden, dining table, common kitchen and lounge area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Talia Herman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rayetta Delores Simon, 50, found 37MLK after the city threw away all her belongings in a sweep. \u201cIt was cleaning time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were cleaning the streets. They put nice memos up saying we\u2019re going to do a street clean on this and that date, but I had a job lined up that day and I wasn\u2019t there. That\u2019s what I get for doing something half-assed good. I lost all my shit.\u201d</p> <p>She was walking down the street, crying, \u201cfeeling lower than low\u201d and not sure of her next move when she ran into a nephew who told her about 37MLK around the corner. \u201cIt was like the doors of heaven,\u201d Simon said. \u201cI came in and came to find out my friend Brittany was here. They gave me a cot, they gave me a tent. They told me that if I needed anything, they were here for me. They really made me feel good. I really got a chance to take the load off myself and to be free for that moment and get some good-ass rest and not worry about nothing because I knew that I was safe.\u201d</p> <p>The camp is at capacity, but before, current residents vouched for incoming ones. \u201cIt was a lot of people I knew before we started this project,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn said. \u201cThe homeless crisis has always been in this neighborhood.\u201d</p> <p>They keep each other in check, knowing that if the camp gets too messy or if they get too rowdy, their housed neighbors will complain and that would be the end of 37MLK. They hold meetings over someone leaving a mess in the kitchen. They decorate for the holidays. They are a community.</p> <p>\u201cI felt like I didn\u2019t have a youth, not just because of the material circumstances I was in, but you can\u2019t bring anyone over to the shelter,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn said. \u201cYou\u2019re so ashamed to let people know what\u2019s going on with you. This is just a nice space where people can hang out, where people can be social. There are people who are living with their adult kids here. There are people who have their younger kids visit them here, and it doesn\u2019t feel like a depressing sad place the way that other encampments do.\u201d</p> <p>Policymakers need to learn from communities like 37MLK, Bas said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ccf3e3975b27d91969be7b69acbd18a8a358607\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ccf3e3975b27d91969be7b69acbd18a8a358607/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracy Lee, left, and Ashley Davidson serve themselves from the common kitchen at 37MLK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tracy Lee, left, and Ashley Davidson serve themselves from the common kitchen at 37MLK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Talia Herman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe homelessness and housing affordability crisis has grown to an extent that we can no longer ignore it and we can\u2019t call it a crisis without actually acting on it,\u201d Bas said. \u201cYou juxtapose that and the visibility of homelessness right now with stories like 37MLK being an incredibly creative and inspiring and successful story of unsheltered older black women. I think it\u2019s a moment where we have to draw from the human resilience and creativity we\u2019re seeing from people who are in deep crisis and respond with that same level from government, respond with that same level of creativity and urgency.\u201d</p> <p>Simon has been homeless for 12 years, and has struggled with drug addiction for almost her entire life. It\u2019s been a tough 12 years. People on the street can be unpredictable. Unhoused people are facing more violence than ever. \u201cPeople were setting fire to people\u2019s sleeping bags,\u201d she said.</p> <p>One recent winter evening, she laid out garbage bags on the community couch to protect guests from the damp of earlier rains, and proudly showed off the bricks she put down as a pathway in the mud. \u201cI\u2019m not a perfect role model,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I\u2019m not on drugs, I\u2019m an A+ mom. Everybody wanted to come to my house.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s learned a lot about herself in the three months since she\u2019s moved into the camp with her husband. She likes to garden. She enjoys taking on little projects all over, whether it\u2019s making signs or just picking up around the common areas.</p> <p>\u201cI would rather have a home, but since I couldn\u2019t have a home, I don\u2019t mind this,\u201d Simon said. \u201cThis is like a home to me. When I talk to people and they say, \u2018Where you going, girl?\u2019 I say, \u2018I\u2019m going to go home\u2019. I don\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to go to my tent\u2019. I say, \u2018I\u2019m going home\u2019. This is my home.\u201d</p>",

At least four homeless encampments sit along the mile of boulevard leading up to 37MLK from the city\u2019s downtown, but where the other camps are shrouded in darkness after sunset, lawn lanterns provide light along paths at 37MLK. Whorls of decorative fake ivy dangle over the chain-link fence, mixing in with potted plants and splashes of art, adding beauty to the ugliest of situations. \u201cWelcome to our home,\u201d read a small paper heart near the entrance, before the winter rains washed it away. With California\u2019s housing crisis culminating in a surge in homelessness unseen in recent history, the question of home has been increasingly met with answers of desperation. Wait lists for temporary shelter beds total in the thousands in some jurisdictions. Overpacked vehicles and RVs, out of which a growing number now live, line certain streets in cities across the state. In Oakland, where rapid gentrification has led to the widespread displacement of black residents, there are more encampments within city limits than there are square miles in the city \u2013 90 sites versus about 78 sq miles \u2013 according to the most conservative estimates. Amid this city of makeshift shelters, churned together in a sea of hopeless necessity, stands 37MLK, a tent village created out of deliberate and coordinated intent; by community organizers taking over a vacant lot for the sole purpose of setting up a homeless encampment. It\u2019s a community response to a housing crisis that has led to many black elders being pushed out of the neighborhoods they call home. \u201cYou leave this land fallow during one of the greatest humanitarian crises in Oakland, pretty much ever, this mass homelessness?\u201d said Stefani Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn, one of the organizers, in a Facebook video announcing her intentions. \u201cI will not abide by that. You can arrest me, but I\u2019ll come back the next day, and I\u2019ll bring more people.\u201d As homeless encampments throughout Oakland continue to get shut down or swept up, some local lawmakers are looking at the 37MLK camp as a model. And in many ways, it\u2019s deeply troubling that policymakers in one of the richest regions in the world are left to advocate for actively building homeless encampments. But not enough affordable housing is currently available for the growing need, and the crisis before Oakland requires immediate and drastic action, housing advocates say. People with nowhere else to go will end up forming encampments regardless of the conditions, they say, and the least policymakers can do is make sure that the ones that exist are safe. A little sanctuary 37MLK saw its start on a summer day in August, when Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn left her rent-controlled apartment and walked two houses down the street to an overgrown lot at the corner of 37th Street and Martin Luther King Jr Way. She squeezed her way in through a hole in the chain-link fence, and spent the day clearing the weeds and brambles. Then she pitched the first tent. \u201cEvery single day for the past decade I lived here, I walked on my way to work past this vacant lot, this eyesore, this blight that was never put to good use to the community,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn, 32, told the Guardian. \u201cMeanwhile, you would see the tents grow just a half a block down there. You see people literally sleeping on the side of the street, on the side of freeways. \u201cHere, we at least have a little sanctuary.\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn didn\u2019t start 37MLK with the intention of it lasting for as long as it has. She wanted to bring attention to her friends and longtime neighbors who were now in need of housing, in hopes of securing them some space for a tiny house. Her friend and longtime neighbor Skinny, for example, lost her housing because her partner got behind on the mortgage payments after suffering health issues. The community began as an all-women\u2019s encampment. Four months later, the lot has grown to house 21 people, including the male partners of some of the women. All the residents are black or Latinx, their ages ranging from 30 to 60. All are longtime neighborhood or Oakland residents. Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn experienced homelessness herself. As a queer teenager growing up in New York, her conservative parents kicked her out and she had to navigate the shelter system through her youth. When she moved to the San Francisco Bay area for a fellowship at University of California, Berkeley, in 2009, she struggled to find an apartment, even with a documented source of income, because she had no rental history. \u201cThis neighborhood, it was my stepping stone out of homelessness,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I came out here in 2009, there were still landlords willing to rent cheap apartments, no questions asked. I could get an apartment for $800 with a $500 security deposit, a one-bedroom, and I still live in that apartment to this day because I have rent control. Now, identical units to mine go for over $2,000 a month. I see just the way I climbed out of homelessness, that door has closed behind me.\u201d In the decade since Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn moved to Oakland, cities in the Bay Area have seen a rapid transformation. Tech money flooded the region, changing the landscape irrevocably. Amid rapid gentrification, San Francisco saw a 17% increase in its homeless population last year . Oakland saw a 47% increase from 2017 \u2013 and an 85% increase from 2015. The uptick in numbers meant more people were visibly homeless, inciting tensions between the housed and unhoused, on a local level all the way to the White House. In July, a real estate developer tried to shoot $1,000 in dollar bills over a homeless encampment in Oakland in a humiliating attempt to get the residents to leave \u2013 despite the fact that they had nowhere else to go. In the shadow of staggering tech wealth, housed and unhoused residents, local lawmakers and housing advocates have been looking for drastic solutions for the immediate crisis at hand. Oakland rolled out its controversial \u201ctuff shed\u201d experiment, housing homeless people in makeshift structures that resemble basic toolsheds. The Oakland city council president last month proposed docking a cruise ship in the city\u2019s port to act as emergency housing akin to a refugee crisis after a disaster. Meanwhile, the city routinely dismantles homeless camps for violations of fire and health codes. (Under Martin v Boise, the ninth circuit court of appeals held that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment to enforce criminal laws against homeless people living on the street if a city did not offer enough shelters.) Blight complaints tend to drive response, and garbage and vermin are serious issues in some camps, as is access to public restrooms. Not at 37MLK. The camp has a solar shower, camping toilets and a pump sink. It has a garden, a dining table, a kitchen and common couch area. \u201cThe number one thing is we have access to the resources that housed people have because I am housed,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn said. She and other housed neighbors work together to take care of the camp garbage, to empty the camp toilets in their apartments, to make sure the camp has clean water. \u201cSo often there are the allegations that homeless people are dirty or don\u2019t keep the space clean,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn said. \u201cNo, there\u2019s only one reason why we\u2019re clean and other encampments are dirty: we have actual access to trash facilities and we have access to running water that other encampments don\u2019t.\u201d The police came twice, at the very beginning. The lot belongs to a not-for-profit that was suspended following apparent financial difficulties, including outstanding tax bills \u2013 a group that was a redevelopment organization specializing in low-income housing. But after the first two visits, the police never returned again. \u201cIt speaks to the severity of the crisis that the city hasn\u2019t shut us down yet,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn said. \u201cI think they\u2019re just putting out fires in so many arenas that we have been safe here because we don\u2019t cause problems in the neighborhood.\u201d Not enough places for people to go Oakland city council member Nikki Fortunato Bas is one of the local lawmakers calling for turning vacant land into self-governed or co-governed encampments, something that would look a lot like 37MLK. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t have enough places for people to go,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough shelter beds. We don\u2019t have enough transitional housing. In the interim, as we\u2019re building deeply affordable housing, we need to have transitional spaces.\u201d Oakland already provides some services to some encampments that include picking up garbage, portable toilets and wash stations. But Bas believes more needs to be done, and has allocated $600,000 to pilot a project similar to 37MLK in Oakland. \u201cThese are spaces that people may need to stay in for two to five years, not a matter of months,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we need to be able to house them in a way that\u2019s healthy and safe and dignified.\u201d Some housing advocates have embraced the idea. They argue people are already living in squalid conditions in encampments that do not have the necessary resources to function in a safe and healthy manner. Some encampments are dealing with overcrowding, with too many people squeezed into too small a space. And every encampment that the city removes is just pushing people to form other encampments elsewhere under similar conditions. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem that\u2019s not going to go away tomorrow,\u201d said Candice Elder, founder and executive director of the not-for-profit East Oakland Collective. \u201cWe understand that there\u2019s blight, and there are safety issues. But in the absence of adequate and enough housing, what can we do?\u201d Rayetta Delores Simon, 50, found 37MLK after the city threw away all her belongings in a sweep. \u201cIt was cleaning time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were cleaning the streets. They put nice memos up saying we\u2019re going to do a street clean on this and that date, but I had a job lined up that day and I wasn\u2019t there. That\u2019s what I get for doing something half-assed good. I lost all my shit.\u201d She was walking down the street, crying, \u201cfeeling lower than low\u201d and not sure of her next move when she ran into a nephew who told her about 37MLK around the corner. \u201cIt was like the doors of heaven,\u201d Simon said. \u201cI came in and came to find out my friend Brittany was here. They gave me a cot, they gave me a tent. They told me that if I needed anything, they were here for me. They really made me feel good. I really got a chance to take the load off myself and to be free for that moment and get some good-ass rest and not worry about nothing because I knew that I was safe.\u201d The camp is at capacity, but before, current residents vouched for incoming ones. \u201cIt was a lot of people I knew before we started this project,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn said. \u201cThe homeless crisis has always been in this neighborhood.\u201d They keep each other in check, knowing that if the camp gets too messy or if they get too rowdy, their housed neighbors will complain and that would be the end of 37MLK. They hold meetings over someone leaving a mess in the kitchen. They decorate for the holidays. They are a community. \u201cI felt like I didn\u2019t have a youth, not just because of the material circumstances I was in, but you can\u2019t bring anyone over to the shelter,\u201d Echeverr\u00eda-Fenn said. \u201cYou\u2019re so ashamed to let people know what\u2019s going on with you. This is just a nice space where people can hang out, where people can be social. There are people who are living with their adult kids here. There are people who have their younger kids visit them here, and it doesn\u2019t feel like a depressing sad place the way that other encampments do.\u201d Policymakers need to learn from communities like 37MLK, Bas said. \u201cThe homelessness and housing affordability crisis has grown to an extent that we can no longer ignore it and we can\u2019t call it a crisis without actually acting on it,\u201d Bas said. \u201cYou juxtapose that and the visibility of homelessness right now with stories like 37MLK being an incredibly creative and inspiring and successful story of unsheltered older black women. I think it\u2019s a moment where we have to draw from the human resilience and creativity we\u2019re seeing from people who are in deep crisis and respond with that same level from government, respond with that same level of creativity and urgency.\u201d Simon has been homeless for 12 years, and has struggled with drug addiction for almost her entire life. It\u2019s been a tough 12 years. People on the street can be unpredictable. Unhoused people are facing more violence than ever. \u201cPeople were setting fire to people\u2019s sleeping bags,\u201d she said. One recent winter evening, she laid out garbage bags on the community couch to protect guests from the damp of earlier rains, and proudly showed off the bricks she put down as a pathway in the mud. \u201cI\u2019m not a perfect role model,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I\u2019m not on drugs, I\u2019m an A+ mom. Everybody wanted to come to my house.\u201d She\u2019s learned a lot about herself in the three months since she\u2019s moved into the camp with her husband. She likes to garden. She enjoys taking on little projects all over, whether it\u2019s making signs or just picking up around the common areas. \u201cI would rather have a home, but since I couldn\u2019t have a home, I don\u2019t mind this,\u201d Simon said. \u201cThis is like a home to me. When I talk to people and they say, \u2018Where you going, girl?\u2019 I say, \u2018I\u2019m going to go home\u2019. I don\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to go to my tent\u2019. I say, \u2018I\u2019m going home\u2019. This is my home.\u201d",

Some news organisations, including the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50381728?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/crm5plqk980t/deepfakes&amp;link_location=live-reporting-map\">BBC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/the-weekly/deepfake-joe-rogan.html\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/obama-jordan-peele-deepfake-video-debunk-buzzfeed\">Buzzfeed</a> have made their own \u201cdeepfake\u201d videos, ostensibly to spread awareness about the techniques. Those videos, while of varying quality, have all contained clear statements that they are fake.</p> \n<p>The most damaging examples of manipulated media in recent years have tended to be created using simple video-editing tools. During the UK election, the Conservative party came under fire for a video edited to make it appear as though the Labour MP Keir Starmer had no answer to a question about Brexit. Facebook at the time confirmed the video <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/07/facebook-we-would-let-tories-run-doctored-starmer-video-as-ad\">satisfied </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/07/facebook-we-would-let-tories-run-doctored-starmer-video-as-ad\">its policies on misinformation</a>, and since there was no AI involved in its creation, it would still be allowed today.</p> \n<p>In the US, a doctored video that seemed to show the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, slurring her way through a speech was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/24/facebook-leaves-fake-nancy-pelosi-video-on-site\">similarly allowed by Facebook</a>. The video, spread by Trump supporters including Rudy Giuliani, was edited, but not using any technique more complex than slowing down the raw footage and pitch-shifting the audio.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"87f812b8-2dda-4e44-bac0-a7c407f304c6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F7_DBM7OIfM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The removal policy is just one branch of Facebook\u2019s attempt to fight misinformation, Bickert argued. \u201cVideos that don\u2019t meet these standards for removal are still eligible for review by one of our independent third-party fact-checkers, which include over 50 partners worldwide fact-checking in over 40 languages,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a photo or video is rated false or partly false by a fact-checker, we significantly reduce its distribution in news feed and reject it if it\u2019s being run as an ad. And critically, people who see it, try to share it, or have already shared it, will see warnings alerting them that it\u2019s false.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/23/to-fix-the-problem-of-deepfakes-we-must-treat-the-cause-not-the-symptoms\">To fix the problem of deepfakes we must treat the cause, not the symptoms | Matt Beard</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThis approach is critical to our strategy and one we heard specifically from our conversations with experts. If we simply removed all manipulated videos flagged by fact-checkers as false, the videos would still be available elsewhere on the internet or social media ecosystem. By leaving them up and labelling them as false, we\u2019re providing people with important information and context.\u201d</p> \n<p>The company also has a separate policy that allows any content that breaks its other rules to remain online if it is judged \u201cnewsworthy\u201d \u2013 and that all content posted by politicians is automatically seen as such.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf someone makes a statement or shares a post which breaks our community standards we will still allow it on our platform if we believe the public interest in seeing it outweighs the risk of harm,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/19/facebook-hires-nick-clegg-as-head-of-global-affairs\">Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice-president of global affairs and communications</a>, when he introduced the policy last September. \u201cFrom now on we will treat speech from politicians as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard.\u201d That policy means that even an AI-created deepfake video expressly intended to mislead could still remain on the social network, if it was posted by a politician.</p> \n<p>Facebook did not give a reason as to why it limited its policy exclusively to those videos manipulated using AI tools, but it is likely that the company wanted to avoid putting itself in a situation where it had to make subjective decisions about intent or truth. Facebook has struggled to settle on a policy about what to do about deepfakes for a number of years, with the company publicly acknowledging the potential damage such videos could inflict, while also standing by a prior decision \u2013 thought to be a direct policy of teh founder, Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 to avoid ruling on whether or not content on the site is true or false.</p>",

But the policy explicitly covers only misinformation produced using AI, meaning \u201cshallow fakes\u201d \u2013 videos made using conventional editing tools \u2013 though frequently just as misleading, are still allowed on the platform. The new policy, announced on Monday by Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of global policy management, will result in the removal of misleading video from Facebook and Instagram if it meets two criteria: \u201cIt has been edited or synthesised \u2026 in ways that aren\u2019t apparent to an average person and would likely mislead someone into thinking that a subject of the video said words that they did not actually say.\u201d \u201cIt is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning that merges, replaces or superimposes content onto a video, making it appear to be authentic.\u201d To date, there have been no major examples of content that would break such rules. Some news organisations, including the BBC, New York Times and Buzzfeed have made their own \u201cdeepfake\u201d videos, ostensibly to spread awareness about the techniques. Those videos, while of varying quality, have all contained clear statements that they are fake. The most damaging examples of manipulated media in recent years have tended to be created using simple video-editing tools. During the UK election, the Conservative party came under fire for a video edited to make it appear as though the Labour MP Keir Starmer had no answer to a question about Brexit. Facebook at the time confirmed the video satisfied its policies on misinformation, and since there was no AI involved in its creation, it would still be allowed today. In the US, a doctored video that seemed to show the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, slurring her way through a speech was similarly allowed by Facebook. The video, spread by Trump supporters including Rudy Giuliani, was edited, but not using any technique more complex than slowing down the raw footage and pitch-shifting the audio. The removal policy is just one branch of Facebook\u2019s attempt to fight misinformation, Bickert argued. \u201cVideos that don\u2019t meet these standards for removal are still eligible for review by one of our independent third-party fact-checkers, which include over 50 partners worldwide fact-checking in over 40 languages,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a photo or video is rated false or partly false by a fact-checker, we significantly reduce its distribution in news feed and reject it if it\u2019s being run as an ad. And critically, people who see it, try to share it, or have already shared it, will see warnings alerting them that it\u2019s false. \u201cThis approach is critical to our strategy and one we heard specifically from our conversations with experts. If we simply removed all manipulated videos flagged by fact-checkers as false, the videos would still be available elsewhere on the internet or social media ecosystem. By leaving them up and labelling them as false, we\u2019re providing people with important information and context.\u201d The company also has a separate policy that allows any content that breaks its other rules to remain online if it is judged \u201cnewsworthy\u201d \u2013 and that all content posted by politicians is automatically seen as such. \u201cIf someone makes a statement or shares a post which breaks our community standards we will still allow it on our platform if we believe the public interest in seeing it outweighs the risk of harm,\u201d said Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice-president of global affairs and communications, when he introduced the policy last September. \u201cFrom now on we will treat speech from politicians as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard.\u201d That policy means that even an AI-created deepfake video expressly intended to mislead could still remain on the social network, if it was posted by a politician. Facebook did not give a reason as to why it limited its policy exclusively to those videos manipulated using AI tools, but it is likely that the company wanted to avoid putting itself in a situation where it had to make subjective decisions about intent or truth. Facebook has struggled to settle on a policy about what to do about deepfakes for a number of years, with the company publicly acknowledging the potential damage such videos could inflict, while also standing by a prior decision \u2013 thought to be a direct policy of teh founder, Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 to avoid ruling on whether or not content on the site is true or false.",

I want to see, want to see them dancing!\u201d the comedian croons, curious guests looking up from expensive cappuccinos. He chuckles, reclines into a taupe sofa and reminisces. \u201cI used to sing that when I was a drag act. It was a bit like Billy Elliot: working on a building site during the week, tight-fitting sequin dress and Disney songs at weekends.\u201d</p> <p>As journeys to becoming the star of a primetime BBC One sitcom go, Davis\u2019s is pretty unusual. King Gary, a new six-part comedy about a family striving for social acceptance, is very much rooted in the tradition of mass-appeal humour \u2013 centred on family life, trauma-free and with a distinct lack of effing and jeffing.

Its setting \u2013 Successville \u2013 was a fictional town where all the local dignitaries were comic actors pretending to be famous people.

We went from thinking: \u2018This is crazy, we\u2019ll never be able to pull it off\u2019 to winning a Bafta,\u201d smiles Davis. \u201cThe BBC took such a risk with it. And then once it was over, they went: \u2018Do you want to do a sitcom now?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Hence King Gary, Davis and De Frond\u2019s first BBC show where they are not making it up as they go along. It isn\u2019t the first fully scripted TV show they have created \u2013 that honour belongs to the follow-up to Successville, the overlooked spoof ITV spy series Action Team, which saw Davis lose 4st in weight training to do all his own stunts with Sylvester Stallone\u2019s stuntman. \u201cHe was nuts,\u201d smiles Davis. \u201cHe just kept telling me I wasn\u2019t as cool as Sly.\u201d It is, however, the first time he has attempted to create something that fits into a classic comedy mould \u2013 a family-friendly sitcom.</p> <p>Davis plays Gary King, a hapless family man who has taken over his dad\u2019s building firm. It\u2019s a story about everyday life in the outer London suburbs. Plots involve building-site pranks, the strain of managing a local kids\u2019 football team and attempts at sophisticated soirees that descend into a drunken dancefloor soundtracked by early-00s chart garage. There are plenty of knowing references to the mores of that life \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s coming home\u201d tattoos, holidays on the English Riviera \u2013 and it\u2019s all done with the warmth that you\u2019d expect given that it\u2019s based on the world Davis grew up in. \u201cThe working class \u2013 they\u2019re some of the greatest people in this country,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to show them positively on TV, because a lot of them feel they\u2019re not being spoken for.\u201d</p> <p>While it\u2019s that kind of erasure from mainstream discourse that some claim led to 2016\u2019s Brexit outcome, political tensions do not feature in King Gary. Instead, the plan is to offer \u201cthe escapism that lets people switch off for half an hour as we\u2019re living in a pretty scary world right now\u201d. Not that this has stopped some viewers from reading their own Brexit-based agenda into it. \u201cWhen the pilot came out, some guy was tweeting that it was propaganda,\u201d sighs Davis. \u201cHe just assumed that Gary was a Brexiteer. There are a lot of generalisations made about who people are, based on Brexit, and it\u2019s so off.\u201d</p> <p>The show also features a stellar support cast including Romesh Ranganathan and The Fast Show\u2019s Simon Day, comic actors selected because of their upbringing in similar places to where King Gary is set, even if it is a generic depiction of the outer London boroughs. Effort was also made to avoid one-dimensional female roles, with Gary\u2019s wife Terri (Laura Checkley) having as many goofy plotlines as her foil. \u201cThat\u2019s my pet hate,\u201d sighs Davis. \u201cIn recent years you see too many wives with wacky husbands that are just there to go: \u2018Oh god, you\u2019re so embarrassing!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0d0e07339edfec3e81ac751c8816c7a5657b482\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0d0e07339edfec3e81ac751c8816c7a5657b482/0_220_4281_2569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"King Gray\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fair enough...

A lot of my family and my close friends are builders.\u2019 I find that a pretty shitty generalisation.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, he has had an eclectic selection of roles that have seen him branch out from just comedy. He starred as a prisoner in Paddington 2, even if the crew didn\u2019t offer him star treatment. \u201cWhen shooting would finish, me and [co-star] Jamie [Demetriou] would try to head backstage with Hugh Grant and the team would be like: \u201cNo! Extras this way!\u201d he laughs. And after Shane Meadows became a fan of Successville, Davis ended up playing a barman in a raucous pub scene in the director\u2019s gritty Channel 4 drama The Virtues. \u201cWe were in a real pub in Sheffield full of drunk locals and Shane said: \u2018I\u2019m just going to tell people that you\u2019re a new barman,\u2019\u201d he chuckles. \u201cAt one point, I had to say to a guy: \u2018That\u2019s enough, mate\u2019 and someone else goes: \u2018Be careful of him. He\u2019s just been to prison for stabbing his missus.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>King Gary is the first part Davis has written where he plays a relatively straight lead character who actually looks like him (\u201cAlthough I did beg James to give me a wig,\u201d he smiles). Does that feel weird? \u201cYeah, even playing DI Sleet in Successville, I thought: \u2018You\u2019ll never be the main man. You\u2019ll always be the goofy big friend who farts and is awful with women.\u2019 So to be the centre point of a BBC One sitcom is pretty incredible.\u201d Surely he must be used to being well known by now, though? \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. The main reason I get stopped in the street has nothing to do with my comedy. It\u2019s because people want a photo with someone so big.\u201d When King Gary airs, that is likely to change \u2013 and hopefully it will let him use some underutilised skills from earlier in his career. \u201cIt would have been nice to get a call about playing Ariel in The Little Mermaid remake,\u201d he sighs. \u201cOr the Beast from Beauty and the Beast. One day, maybe I\u2019ll do Disney.\u201d Fingers crossed. It\u2019s hardly a tall order.</p> <p><em>King Gary starts Friday 10 January, 9.30pm, BBC One</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In an upmarket London hotel lobby, Tom Davis is singing a number from The Little Mermaid. \u201cI want to be where the people are. I want to see, want to see them dancing!\u201d the comedian croons, curious guests looking up from expensive cappuccinos. He chuckles, reclines into a taupe sofa and reminisces. \u201cI used to sing that when I was a drag act. It was a bit like Billy Elliot: working on a building site during the week, tight-fitting sequin dress and Disney songs at weekends.\u201d As journeys to becoming the star of a primetime BBC One sitcom go, Davis\u2019s is pretty unusual. King Gary, a new six-part comedy about a family striving for social acceptance, is very much rooted in the tradition of mass-appeal humour \u2013 centred on family life, trauma-free and with a distinct lack of effing and jeffing. And Davis\u2019s warm, down-to-earth charm makes him entirely believable as the lead in the kind of sitcom that unites parents and kids on the sofa.

      "body": "<p>At the start of Kiley Reid\u2019s standout first novel, a security guard accosts a young black babysitter as she strolls the aisles of an upscale Philadelphia supermarket with her pint-size white charge. It\u2019s late, the babysitter having been summoned from a party so the child\u2019s affluent parents can deal with a domestic emergency, and a meddlesome fellow shopper has decided that something about the pair doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel right\u201d. A tense standoff ensues, the guard refusing to let the babysitter leave and all but accusing her of kidnapping while a bystander films it on his phone. Eventually, the babysitter has to summon the child\u2019s father to collect them.</p> <p>It\u2019s a flawlessly paced scene, at once funny and menacing, its every rippling nuance captured with precision and acuity. It\u2019s also a far more straightforward example of racism in action than anything that follows, because the focus of this book is an altogether more slippery and underexamined type of prejudice: liberal racism.</p> <p>The babysitter\u2019s name is Emira Tucker and she\u2019s a college grad edging into her mid-20s. While her ambitious friends are beginning to make their way in the world, she\u2019d be quite content to continue as a part-time babysitter, if only she weren\u2019t about to age out of her parents\u2019 health insurance. Empathic and pragmatic, Emira is the novel\u2019s star, though Reid uses additional viewpoints to tell her story, among them that of Emira\u2019s employer, Alix Chamberlain.</p> <p>Alix is older and married to a local news anchor, with a social media career that has sprung from her knack for soliciting freebies via politely written letters. Having scored a book deal, she has hired Emira to help out with her two kids, three-year-old Briar and baby Catherine, though in truth, it\u2019s really just inquisitive, chatterbox Briar that she\u2019d rather not have to spend time with.</p> <p>In the wake of the supermarket incident, Alix sets out to make a project of Emira, becoming borderline obsessed in the process. Her response is galvanised by the reappearance of someone from her past, who brings unwelcome reminders of another racially charged episode, and as the novel powers forward, her apparent gaucheness takes on a very different aspect.</p> <p>There\u2019s something a touch too tidy about the way Alix\u2019s character develops, and it\u2019s true that the plot pivots on an almighty coincidence. All the same, Reid writes with a confidence and verve that produce magnetic prose, and she\u2019s a whiz at dialogue, whether it\u2019s the African-American vernacular that Emira slips into with her girlfriends or Briar\u2019s bold toddler-talk. There are some memorable set pieces of exquisite social awkwardness, too, including a Thanksgiving lunch with ironically kitsch trimmings.</p> <p>While race dominates, Reid is far too engaged a writer to let it define a narrative that has equally incisive observations to share about everything from maternal ambivalence to dating mores and dining fads.

      "bodyText": "At the start of Kiley Reid\u2019s standout first novel, a security guard accosts a young black babysitter as she strolls the aisles of an upscale Philadelphia supermarket with her pint-size white charge. It\u2019s late, the babysitter having been summoned from a party so the child\u2019s affluent parents can deal with a domestic emergency, and a meddlesome fellow shopper has decided that something about the pair doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel right\u201d. A tense standoff ensues, the guard refusing to let the babysitter leave and all but accusing her of kidnapping while a bystander films it on his phone. Eventually, the babysitter has to summon the child\u2019s father to collect them. It\u2019s a flawlessly paced scene, at once funny and menacing, its every rippling nuance captured with precision and acuity. It\u2019s also a far more straightforward example of racism in action than anything that follows, because the focus of this book is an altogether more slippery and underexamined type of prejudice: liberal racism. The babysitter\u2019s name is Emira Tucker and she\u2019s a college grad edging into her mid-20s. While her ambitious friends are beginning to make their way in the world, she\u2019d be quite content to continue as a part-time babysitter, if only she weren\u2019t about to age out of her parents\u2019 health insurance. Empathic and pragmatic, Emira is the novel\u2019s star, though Reid uses additional viewpoints to tell her story, among them that of Emira\u2019s employer, Alix Chamberlain. Alix is older and married to a local news anchor, with a social media career that has sprung from her knack for soliciting freebies via politely written letters. Having scored a book deal, she has hired Emira to help out with her two kids, three-year-old Briar and baby Catherine, though in truth, it\u2019s really just inquisitive, chatterbox Briar that she\u2019d rather not have to spend time with. In the wake of the supermarket incident, Alix sets out to make a project of Emira, becoming borderline obsessed in the process. Her response is galvanised by the reappearance of someone from her past, who brings unwelcome reminders of another racially charged episode, and as the novel powers forward, her apparent gaucheness takes on a very different aspect. There\u2019s something a touch too tidy about the way Alix\u2019s character develops, and it\u2019s true that the plot pivots on an almighty coincidence. All the same, Reid writes with a confidence and verve that produce magnetic prose, and she\u2019s a whiz at dialogue, whether it\u2019s the African-American vernacular that Emira slips into with her girlfriends or Briar\u2019s bold toddler-talk. There are some memorable set pieces of exquisite social awkwardness, too, including a Thanksgiving lunch with ironically kitsch trimmings. While race dominates, Reid is far too engaged a writer to let it define a narrative that has equally incisive observations to share about everything from maternal ambivalence to dating mores and dining fads. Hypocrisy and forgiveness get a look in, and in some respects, this is a novel that\u2019s as much about money and class as anything. All in all, it\u2019s a cracking debut \u2013 charming, authentic and every bit as entertaining as it is calmly, intelligently damning. \u2022 Such a Fun Age by Kiley Reid is published by Bloomsbury Circus (\u00a312.99).

      "body": "<p>Earnie Stewart already had a busy 2020 in store when news broke at the end of December that <a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2019/12/27/chicago-fire-fc-hire-raphael-wicky-new-head-coach\">Raphael Wicky had been hired</a> as the Chicago Fire\u2019s new head coach. Wicky had only been the United States\u2019 Under-17 men\u2019s national team boss since March but the Swiss still decided to jump ship, leaving Stewart with yet another position at US Soccer to fill heading into the new year.</p> <p>In fact Stewart, US Soccer\u2019s sporting director, has no fewer than five head coach positions to fill. The United States\u2019 men\u2019s soccer programme currently has vacancies at U-20, U-19, U-18, U-17 and U-16 level with Gregg Berhalter and Jason Kreis the only two head coaches on the books at this moment. The landscape is much the same on the women\u2019s side, with five head coach positions also to be filled in the youth ranks.</p> <p>US Soccer is currently a shell and Wicky\u2019s departure continues a trend that should worry Stewart. The federation is finding it increasingly difficult to keep its coaches from the clutches of Major League Soccer clubs with Tab Ramos also recently leaving his long-term role as USA U-23s head coach for a job with the Houston Dynamo.</p> <p>This is a trend that can be traced all the way back to 2009 when the Philadelphia Union poached then USA U-23s head coach and national team assistant Piotr Nowak. His successor, Caleb Porter, then used the same springboard to earn a job with the Portland Timbers with Brad Friedel the U-19s head coach for two years before taking over at the New England Revolution. Ramos held the fort for a number of years, switching between various youth positions, before leaving for Texas in October.</p> <p>At least Friedel, Nowak, Porter and Ramos all had a background in American soccer before taking up a position with the USSF. Wicky played a handful of games for Chivas USA, but had no real track record to speak of in the States before being named manager of the USA\u2019s U-17s side, and only ever coached in his native Switzerland. So did Wicky take the job in the first place as a stepping stone to MLS? Is that a route coaches can now plot in advance?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/03/diego-alonso-inter-miami-david-beckham\">Who is Diego Alonso, David Beckham's new manager at Inter Miami?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If indeed that is the case, US Soccer has a problem. While the club game is generally a short-term arena where teams sometimes chop and change their manager more frequently than they change their kit, federation coaching positions should be filled with the medium- to long-term in mind. National development is gauged over decades, not years and certainly not months, and so it\u2019s important that are invested in the future.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just top-level MLS jobs that US Soccer coaches are being lured to either. The Chicago Fire and Houston Dynamo both endured disappointing seasons in 2019. Ramos and Wicky have taken on challenging jobs with absolutely no guarantee of success, only adding to the indictment served by their decision to leave the national set up.</p> <p>The argument could feasibly be made that the traffic between US Soccer and MLS hints at a productive environment for coaching cultivation. That US Soccer is successfully producing the next generation of homegrown coaches and from homegrown coaches come homegrown players. But at youth level coaches are there to service players. At times over the past few years, particularly in this current MLS off-season, it has appeared the other way round.</p> <p>The one exception to the trend, of course, is Berhalter who was hired as USMNT head coach from the Columbus Crew just over a year ago.

      "bodyText": "Earnie Stewart already had a busy 2020 in store when news broke at the end of December that Raphael Wicky had been hired as the Chicago Fire\u2019s new head coach. Wicky had only been the United States\u2019 Under-17 men\u2019s national team boss since March but the Swiss still decided to jump ship, leaving Stewart with yet another position at US Soccer to fill heading into the new year. In fact Stewart, US Soccer\u2019s sporting director, has no fewer than five head coach positions to fill. The United States\u2019 men\u2019s soccer programme currently has vacancies at U-20, U-19, U-18, U-17 and U-16 level with Gregg Berhalter and Jason Kreis the only two head coaches on the books at this moment. The landscape is much the same on the women\u2019s side, with five head coach positions also to be filled in the youth ranks. US Soccer is currently a shell and Wicky\u2019s departure continues a trend that should worry Stewart. The federation is finding it increasingly difficult to keep its coaches from the clutches of Major League Soccer clubs with Tab Ramos also recently leaving his long-term role as USA U-23s head coach for a job with the Houston Dynamo. This is a trend that can be traced all the way back to 2009 when the Philadelphia Union poached then USA U-23s head coach and national team assistant Piotr Nowak. His successor, Caleb Porter, then used the same springboard to earn a job with the Portland Timbers with Brad Friedel the U-19s head coach for two years before taking over at the New England Revolution. Ramos held the fort for a number of years, switching between various youth positions, before leaving for Texas in October. At least Friedel, Nowak, Porter and Ramos all had a background in American soccer before taking up a position with the USSF. Wicky played a handful of games for Chivas USA, but had no real track record to speak of in the States before being named manager of the USA\u2019s U-17s side, and only ever coached in his native Switzerland. So did Wicky take the job in the first place as a stepping stone to MLS? Is that a route coaches can now plot in advance? If indeed that is the case, US Soccer has a problem. While the club game is generally a short-term arena where teams sometimes chop and change their manager more frequently than they change their kit, federation coaching positions should be filled with the medium- to long-term in mind. National development is gauged over decades, not years and certainly not months, and so it\u2019s important that are invested in the future. It\u2019s not just top-level MLS jobs that US Soccer coaches are being lured to either. The Chicago Fire and Houston Dynamo both endured disappointing seasons in 2019. Ramos and Wicky have taken on challenging jobs with absolutely no guarantee of success, only adding to the indictment served by their decision to leave the national set up. The argument could feasibly be made that the traffic between US Soccer and MLS hints at a productive environment for coaching cultivation. That US Soccer is successfully producing the next generation of homegrown coaches and from homegrown coaches come homegrown players. But at youth level coaches are there to service players. At times over the past few years, particularly in this current MLS off-season, it has appeared the other way round. The one exception to the trend, of course, is Berhalter who was hired as USMNT head coach from the Columbus Crew just over a year ago. But the duty of Berhalter is not to develop the American game for future generations, but to get results in the here and now. The criteria of is job is very different to that of the coaches working under him down the youth ranks. Turnover of coaches at the top level isn\u2019t as damaging as it is beneath the surface. Going on the interviews given by Wicky upon his appointment at the Chicago Fire, he was drawn by the vision and ambition of Georg Heitz, the sporting director the former FC Basel boss will now work alongside. \u201cI felt that we all shared a similar vision for the club and how to move it forward,\u201d Wicky explained. \u201cThat was important to me.\u201d Meanwhile, Stewart has yet to demonstrate his vision for US Soccer beyond rearranging the office at US Soccer House so that all the coaches face each other and demanding all staff move to Chicago. Could it be that Wicky simply saw an organisation with a plan and an idea of what it wants to be as opposed to one that doesn\u2019t? American soccer as a whole finds itself at a critical juncture. Questions were rightly asked after the USMNT\u2019s failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, with a presidential election offering the chance of a comprehensive overhaul of US Soccer. So far, though, very few answers and new ideas have been forthcoming. People like Ramos and Wicky were just as integral in ensuring soccer\u2019s future in the country as Berhalter and yet they have left at this crucial point.

Finley is one of millions of Americans who avoid medical treatment due to the costs every year. A December 2019 poll conducted by Gallup found 25% of Americans say they or a family member have delayed medical treatment for a serious illness due to the costs of care, and an additional 8% report delaying medical treatment for less serious illnesses. A study conducted by the American Cancer Society in May 2019 found 56% of adults in America report having at least one medical financial hardship, and researchers warned the problem is likely to worsen unless action is taken. Dr Robin Yabroff, lead author of the American Cancer Society study, said last month\u2019s Gallup poll finding that 25% of Americans were delaying care was \u201cconsistent with numerous other studies documenting that many in the United States have trouble paying medical bills\u201d. US spends the most on healthcare Despite millions of Americans delaying medical treatment due to the costs, the US still spends the most on healthcare of any developed nation in the world, while covering fewer people and achieving worse overall health outcomes. A 2017 analysis found the United States ranks 24th globally in achieving health goals set by the United Nations. In 2018, $3.65tn was spent on healthcare in the United States, and these costs are projected to grow at an annual rate of 5.5% over the next decade. High healthcare costs are causing Americans to get sicker from delaying, avoiding, or stopping medical treatment. Anamaria Markle, of Port Murray, New Jersey was diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer in 2017.

She shouldn\u2019t have had to make the decision to stop her treatment based on financial costs.\u201d Families \u2018should not have to make these choices\u2019 A 2009 study conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School found 45,000 Americans die every year as a direct result of not having any health insurance coverage.

Healthcare is one of the most contentious issues surrounding the 2020 presidential election as Democratic candidates battle over policies to expand healthcare access and lower costs, from Bernie Sanders\u2019 medicare for all bill which would create a government funded healthcare system providing universal coverage to all Americans, while eliminating surprise medical bills, deductibles, and copays, to healthcare plans that focus on creating a public option under the Affordable Care Act. As Democrats debate solutions to America\u2019s healthcare crisis, the Trump administration is delaying any plans for repealing the Affordable Care Act passed under Obama until after the 2020 election. Several people the Guardian interviewed are currently avoiding medical treatment for serious illnesses or struggling to treat illnesses worsened by delaying medical care due to costs. Substitute teacher Gretchen Hess Miller, 48, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with oral cancer in 2009 while pregnant. She has had surgery to remove the cancer, but is supposed to receive annual scans to monitor the cancer, but hasn\u2019t received one in four to five years because her family can\u2019t afford it. \u201cMy doctor told me this is an aggressive form of cancer that will come back someday and I need to stay on top of it, but the deductible and the difficulty with dealing with the insurance keeps me from having it done,\u201d said Hess-Miller. Her insurance coverage currently requires a $5,000 deductible. She says she has previously had to fight to receive coverage because medical care is constantly denied because insurance classifies oral care as dental rather than medical care. \u201cI have kids. I worry about our future. I want to be here for them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re very thankful to have insurance at all, but families should not have to compromise on if I\u2019m going to pay for my kid\u2019s college or pay for a test to see if I have cancer. People shouldn\u2019t be put in a position to make choices like that.\u201d Amy Keeling, 51, a paralegal in New Hampton, Iowa, avoided seeing a doctor for over a year due to her partner\u2019s surgery costs in 2018 for triple bypass surgery. \u201cI hadn\u2019t felt good for awhile, but I just thought it was my age. In September 2019, I got the flu, and ended up in the emergency room because I couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d said Keeling. She was diagnosed with Grave\u2019s Disease, an autoimmune disorder. \u201cIf I had been going in to the doctor and checking on this a lot sooner, we may have been able to do other alternatives and get a handle on this before it got this serious. I\u2019m at the point where medication won\u2019t control it and my only option is surgery,\u201d she said. Her insurance requires a $5,000 deductible. Having met it in 2019, she scrambled to have her surgery scheduled before 2020, when it would reset. All while her partner is looking to file for bankruptcy because he currently has around $40,000 in medical debt.",

I\u2019ve</strong> <strong>never had an issue in previous relationships with staying sexually aroused</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>but </strong><strong>since being with him </strong><strong>I\u2019ve struggled to do so. He is the</strong> <strong>only guy I\u2019ve been with who is younger than me.</strong> <strong>I\u2019ve always dated men who are eight to 10 years older</strong><strong>. At first, I thought it was me</strong> <strong>and that maybe I was going through</strong> <strong>a premenopausal stage, but I\u2019m finding that</strong> <strong>other older men</strong> <strong>still arouse me.</strong> <strong>How can I direct this love affair without hurting his feelings?</strong></p> <p>This is a new chapter in your sexual growth: teaching someone exactly how to please you. In the past, you may have relied on the experience of your partners, but now it\u2019s up to you. Embrace this opportunity to become the architect of your own pleasure. Try to be confident enough to ask and learn what pleases him. Your new partner\u2019s age is not the issue; many people under 30 are pretty good lovers. In any case, it is often the ability to communicate well that makes one appear to be a genius in the erotic arts.

      "bodyText": "I am a 32-year-old woman who is dating a 28-year-old man. I am trying my best not to give up on this young man who loves me dearly, but I\u2019m not enjoying the sex at all and sex is very important to me. I\u2019ve never had an issue in previous relationships with staying sexually aroused, but since being with him I\u2019ve struggled to do so. He is the only guy I\u2019ve been with who is younger than me. I\u2019ve always dated men who are eight to 10 years older. At first, I thought it was me and that maybe I was going through a premenopausal stage, but I\u2019m finding that other older men still arouse me. How can I direct this love affair without hurting his feelings? This is a new chapter in your sexual growth: teaching someone exactly how to please you. In the past, you may have relied on the experience of your partners, but now it\u2019s up to you. Embrace this opportunity to become the architect of your own pleasure. Try to be confident enough to ask and learn what pleases him. Your new partner\u2019s age is not the issue; many people under 30 are pretty good lovers. In any case, it is often the ability to communicate well that makes one appear to be a genius in the erotic arts. Somehow, your 28 year-old has missed out on some important information and is too shy to ask you how you like it.

A total of 4.9m hectares \u2013 an area larger than Denmark \u2013 has been destroyed in the state during the nationwide fire crisis. The total area burned across NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania has now reached 8.4m hectares \u2013 an area larger than Scotland. At least 25 people have been killed, including three volunteer firefighters, and thousands of homes destroyed. In NSW alone, 4.9m hectares burned was the largest area destroyed in the state since records began, Associate Professor Owen Price from the University of Wollongong said. According to data collected by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage, the previous NSW record was 3.54m hectares burned in the widespread grassfires of 1974\u201375. Figures compiled by the 2004 National Inquiry into Bushfire Mitigation and Management record that 4.5m hectares were burned in 1974\u201375 \u2013 higher than the NSW OEH figures, but still below this year\u2019s record. As well as setting a record for area burned, Price said this year\u2019s fires were burning through a large amount of forest, rather than grasslands. This has made the current fires more devastating, harder to fight and more dangerous to people and to wildlife, he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe 1974 fires were 4.5m, and that was mostly in the arid and semi-arid grasslands,\u201d Price said. \u201cThe actual impact of that was far less.

In December, the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said up to 30% of the koala population on the NSW mid-north coast could have been killed in the fires, and a NSW government inquiry heard from an expert that the fires were so large \u201cwe will probably never find the bodies\u201d. In January, the bureau of meteorology confirmed that 2019 was Australia\u2019s hottest year on record, while the record for the hottest day across the country was broken two days in a row \u2013 on Tuesday 16 December and Wednesday 17 December. In its annual climate statement, released on Tuesday, the Bureau of Meteorology said 2019 was also Australia\u2019s driest with a national average rainfall total of 277mm \u2013 the lowest on record. \u201cThe immediate reason [for these fires] is the drought,\u201d Price said. \u201cBasically all the moisture has been sucked out of the landscape and the plants.

According to the national inquiry\u2019s figures, which date back to 1926, 4m hectares were burned in 1951-52 and 3.5m in 1984-85. Price added that Australia only had \u201cgood records\u201d for area burned as far back as 1970, and that other written records only go back as far as European colonisation. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything beyond about 200 years.

The cost/benefit arithmetic is less than compelling, even on the new official estimates, but Boris Johnson\u2019s government will be terrified of doing anything that could upset the mantra that the north will receive an \u201cinfrastructure revolution\u201d.

Lord Berkeley, the dissenting member of the panel reviewing HS2, is now being rubbished by government officials for suggesting the true cost will rise to \u00a3108bn at 2015 prices. Why? His estimate looks as credible as any produced by HS2 and its lobbyists over the years. The chances of the mega-project being scrapped, however, look slim. The cost/benefit arithmetic is less than compelling, even on the new official estimates, but Boris Johnson\u2019s government will be terrified of doing anything that could upset the mantra that the north will receive an \u201cinfrastructure revolution\u201d. The sensible solution, though, would surely be to build HS3 first \u2013 that\u2019s the Northern Powerhouse Rail project to upgrade links between major northern cities. Would northern mayors be so keen on a fast railway to London if they were offered earlier rail improvements on their own patch instead? We\u2019ll probably never find out, but it\u2019s the right question to ask. The danger with HS2 is that it could suck spending from rail projects that will deliver more benefits to more people more quickly.",

      "bodyText": "As Australia\u2019s bushfires have kept burning and growing, smoke has descended on Australia\u2019s biggest city, Sydney, as well as Melbourne, the nation\u2019s capital and much of regional Australia. In recent days, Canberra has claimed an undesirable honour: the city with the worst air quality in the world. While the consequences have been far worse for people living in fire-ravaged parts of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, the impact of the fire crisis has stretched well beyond those areas. Sports matches have been abandoned, one of the country\u2019s most popular music festivals was called off and, in one city, the mail stopped. Some are now asking whether the bushfire haze over Melbourne might delay the Australian Open. To track the impact of the fires on daily life outside the fire zone, the Guardian has compiled this list. November 12 November: The Australian leg of the World Rally Championship, a major sporting event, on the Coffs Coast is axed over concerns around smoke from neighbour bushfires. 21 November: On the Central Coast, poor air quality forces the Central Coast council to call off two Christmas events, planned for 23 November and 29 November. December 2 December: In a sign of things to come this summer, the Subsonic music festival at Riverwood Downs is postponed until next year. 6 December: As a blanket of smoke descends over Cessnock, a town in the Hunter region of NSW, the council says it will also have to cancel its annual Christmas carols. 10 December: On a particularly bad day in Sydney, Transport for NSW suspends the Sydney Ferries network over the thick smoke that is hanging over the city. The SOLAS Big Boat Challenge, a Sydney to Hobart pre-race event, is also cancelled. 19 December: A harness racing meet at Tamworth will not go ahead, organisers say. They blame poor air quality from the NSW bushfires. 22 December: At Manuka Oval, Canberra\u2019s smoky air forces players off the ground in a Big Bash League match between Sydney Thunder and Adelaide Strikers. The game is abandoned. 29 December: Events ACT announces that Canberra\u2019s annual fireworks will not go ahead, citing poor air quality and danger from hot conditions. By New Year\u2019s Eve, the entire \u2018New Year\u2019s Eve\u2019 in the city celebrations are called off. In Victoria, organisers of the annual Falls festival at Lorne say the rest of the festival will be abandoned. In a statement, they say the forecast for the Otways region will create a \u201crisk to health and safety due to potential fires, smoke, severe winds and tree hazards\u201d. January 2 January: In perhaps the most pointed demonstration that daily life has come to a halt in smoke-filled Canberra, Australia Post suspends all postie and van services. At the city\u2019s hospital, staff are unable to use the MRI machines. The Australian War Memorial remains open, but the Last Post is also moved inside and the cafe is closed. Other outdoor sections are closed over the next few days. Also on the same day, a four-game baseball series between the Canberra Cavalry and Adelaide Giants is called off. 3 January: Sporting events in Canberra continue to be affected by the poor air quality. As the city\u2019s air quality is ranked the worst in the world, Tennis Australia announces it is moving the Canberra International to Bendigo. Other matches are also impacted. A W-League football match between Canberra and Newcastle is postponed, while a contest between the Canberra Capitals and the Perth Lynx at the indoor AIS Arena is also scrapped. 4 January: The Karkarook Parkrun, an annual event at Heatherton in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, fails to proceed over concerns about air quality. Meanwhile, in Tasmania, the Bridport triathlon is abandoned after smoke from fires in that state. 5 January: To avoid damage to the art \u2013 as well as safety risks to staff and patrons from smoke \u2013 the National Gallery says it will be shutting its doors. It reopens on 7 January. Air-quality issues also forced the Department of Home Affairs and Australian Border Force to shutter its Canberra headquarters for two days. 6 January: The Sydney festival\u2019s flagship production, Opening Night, is cancelled due to heath concerns from poor air quality. It was set to be held on 21 January but the production company behind the show pulled out, despite safety assurances from organisers. 7 January: In the Victorian town of Rutherglen, near Albury, a leg of the popular A Day on the Green festival is abandoned.

      "body": "<p>One summer night in 1980, Adrienne Brodeur was woken up by her self-obsessed, larger-than-life mother, Malabar; Adrienne was then a 14-year-old schoolgirl, her mother a cookery writer in her late 40s. What was the problem? In a state of high excitement, Malabar whispered her confession: \u201cBen Souther just kissed me.\u201d Sounding like a teenager, she repeated herself: \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. He kissed me, Rennie.\u201d</p> <p>In the seconds that followed, a Faustian pact was struck between parent and child. Brodeur tacitly agreed to help facilitate the affair on which her mother was about to embark, even though the man in question was her beloved stepfather\u2019s best friend. \u201cYou deserve this,\u201d she reassured Malabar, as if they were college friends talking of new boyfriends over a bottle of cheap chardonnay. In return, she was duly elevated to the position of Malabar\u2019s confidante-in-chief, a role she longed for, in spite of the likelihood that it would involve lying to everyone. How else could she hope to get nearer to the centre of Malabar\u2019s world?</p> <p>The next day, she offered her first piece of assistance, enabling her mother to slip away from her stepfather, Charles, and Ben Souther from his wife of 35 years, Lily. \u201cWho wants to go clamming?\u201d she called out, knowing full well that only two of the four adults present would be tempted by the prospect. Out on the Cape Cod marshes, Brodeur looked at her mother and Souther, their heads dipped together, and understood there was now no going back.</p> <p>Malabar\u2019s affair would continue for the next decade. Born, at least in part, of the physical frailties of their respective partners \u2013 Charles had suffered a series of strokes even before Malabar married him; Lily was ever delicate, having been treated for cancer \u2013 it was acted out not only clandestinely, in a series of New York hotel rooms, but also in plain sight of their families during weekends on Cape Cod. Malabar even came up with the idea of a cookbook \u2013 Wild Game \u2013 on which the two couples would work together (Souther was a keen hunter). The plan was not to hurt anyone; neither one of them wanted to leave their spouse. Nevertheless, for Malabar, there was always hope. She was Ben\u2019s heart\u2019s choice, whatever that meant \u2013 and in any case, wouldn\u2019t they both outlive their partners?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Though we hear about Malabar\u2019s affair, we never really see it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Having pinched her mother\u2019s title, in <em>Wild Game</em>, Brodeur gives a fairly clear-eyed account of her affair, and its complicated repercussions. Charles does indeed die, but when Lily subsequently discovers her husband\u2019s infidelity, Ben doesn\u2019t leave her for his friend\u2019s widow. Rather, he insists he has made a mistake \u2013 something that is agony not only for Malabar, but for her daughter, too, who has unaccountably become engaged to Ben\u2019s son, Jack (alas, she neglected to tell Jack about their parents when she had the chance). But then Lily dies, too, and two months afterwards, Ben finally moves in with Malabar. Amazingly, it\u2019s only after this that Brodeur begins to register the full extent of her mother\u2019s narcissism. Later, when she and Jack visit their parents to announce that they are to divorce \u2013 Malabar and Ben have by now been married for four years \u2013 it makes less impression on them than the lamb chops Malabar has served for dinner.</p> <p>All this is fascinating \u2013 at times, gruesomely so. I found myself quite mesmerised by Malabar; like some desperate old actress, she\u2019s permanently ready for her closeup.</p> <p>But Brodeur\u2019s memoir is somehow a lot less gripping than it should be.

A gauzy veil hangs over Brodeur\u2019s narrative; people\u2019s essence, like their motivation, eludes her.

Top stories After Boris Johnson urged them to end three years of parliamentary conflict and \u201cdiscard the old labels of leave and remain\u201d, the Commons passed the PM\u2019s Brexit bill with a majority of 124, setting the UK on course to leave the EU on 31 January. The EU immediately welcomed the vote as an \u201cimportant step in the article 50 ratification process\u201d but warned it would demand fair competition in exchange for a free-trade agreement with zero tariffs and zero quotas. Stripped of several commitments since MPs last voted on it, including promises on workers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 rights, parliament\u2019s role in scrutinising the future trade negotiations, and protecting child refugees, the legislation also made it unlawful for the government to extend trade talks beyond the end of 2020. Johnson, who has also ruled out adhering to Brussels\u2019 rules after the transition period ends, dodged accusations from the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, that he was planning a \u201charder Brexit than we anticipated\u201d which would aim to undercut EU member states on food, health and product safety. But as it emerged that London would co-host the next stage of the talks with Brussels after 31 January, the new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the UK should reconsider its refusal to extend the 11-month transition period. Von der Leyen said she had \u201cserious concern\u201d about the limited time available for the talks, which must cover far more than just a free trade deal (see below): \u201cWe must ask ourselves seriously if all these negotiations are feasible in such a short time.\u201d The commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, promised a warm welcome back into the bloc should attitudes in Britain ever change, and in his new year message, Johnson pledged to represent remainers and work with them as \u201cfriends and equals\u201d. But the talks on the future relationship, which can only formally begin after 31 January when the UK leaves, are expected to be tough \u2013 as Von der Leyen and the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, are likely to make clear at a preliminary meeting with the prime minister in London this week. What next? The Brexit deal is expected to complete its progress through the Commons and Lords by the middle of the month, and be ratified by the European parliament by the end of January. Trade talks proper are expected to begin in late February or early March. During the transition period, the UK will remain in the bloc\u2019s customs union and single market until the end of 2020, with an option to stay within those arrangements for a further two years. Johnson has said he will not agree to such an extension, claiming there is ample time to negotiate a comprehensive deal covering all aspects of the current EU-UK relationship, from trade to internal security, transport and data-sharing. The moment of truth will arrive on 1 July, by which time both sides have to have agreed to prolong the transition period or face running out of time and ending up without a deal. Should no trade deal have been reached, Britain would face major disruption to its economy, with tariffs and quantity restrictions being immediately applied to goods being sold into the EU market. Early in the transition period the EU will also have to declare UK regulations \u201cadequate\u201d to ensure the free flow of data after Brexit, and to allow UK financial service providers to continue operating within the bloc. Intellectual property, public procurement, fisheries and a level playing field on fiscal, environmental and social standards must also be addressed, as must dispute resolution, road and air transport, security, foreign policy, space, energy, citizens\u2019 mobility, and future British involvement in EU programmes such as higher education.

She has researched period stigma in schools and believes it is a major problem. \u201cIt underpins every experience girls have with menstruation. It acts as a gender barrier between boys and girls.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4c7cd0d44e9c82502fa83baa81841393cf72167\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4c7cd0d44e9c82502fa83baa81841393cf72167/0_104_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"Molly with supplies for girls at school.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Molly with supplies for girls at school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Fenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When she asked pupils why they had taken time off school while menstruating, many talked about fear and embarrassment rather than medical need. They also reported poor access to toilets and products at school. \u201cThey spoke about smuggling tampons and pads to each other during lessons and feeling unable to put their hand up and ask a teacher if they could go to the toilet.\u201d</p> <p>Even at breaktime, pupils said they felt stressed about using toilets if the sound of a packet opening could be heard outside the cubicle. \u201cIf boys were stood outside the toilet, they worried about going in.\u201d</p> <p>Fenton\u2019s attitude changed in March after she read a stirring interview with the 20-year-old period poverty campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amika-georg\" title=\"\">Amika George</a>. \u201cI was so angry afterwards, mainly at myself for contributing to the period stigma in my school and in society in general.\u201d</p> <p>She decided to talk to her school\u2019s senior leadership team. At the meeting, she handed out what appeared to be a box of Quality Street. \u201cI will never forget that day,\u201d says her headteacher, Sarah Parry. Instead of chocolates, the box contained sanitary products in a rainbow of colours. Parry says: \u201cI\u2019ve got quite a male-orientated senior leadership team \u2026 they all had to pick one. And then they didn\u2019t know what to do with it. It was hilarious.\u201d</p> <p>After that, Fenton was given permission to talk about period poverty and stigma to all the year groups in her school. She launched a campaign, Love Your Period, online and in school and put posters up at school advertising classrooms where girls could get free sanitary products and spare uniform items.</p> <p>Inspired by Fenton and wanting to set an example for boys in the school, a male member of the senior leadership team volunteered to give talks in assemblies to both boys and girls about the menstrual cycle and sanitary products. \u201cHe felt it would be very powerful for a male teacher to use the vocabulary [and] talk about the practicalities,\u201d says Parry.</p> <p>Parry thinks that, as a result, pupils are less anxious and embarrassed: \u201cGirls have even said openly to male teachers in class, \u2018sir, I really do need to go to the toilet, I\u2019m on my period\u2019.\u201d Fenton has observed this increase in confidence too: \u201cLoads of people have said: \u2018now you\u2019ve spoken about it, I\u2019m going to speak about it.\u2019\u201d She has been contacted by schools around the world about her campaign through her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/loveyourperiod/\" title=\"\">@LoveyourPeriod </a>Instagram page. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3558060d7010a533dc216fee836215c7467faca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3558060d7010a533dc216fee836215c7467faca0/0_141_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"leaflets\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Llanishen high school in Cardiff has embraced the campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Parry says girls\u2019 attendance has significantly increased since the campaign began and she is introducing changes to cement the impact Fenton has made. For example, she is installing floor-to-ceiling doors on the cubicles of new toilets with washbasins inside. \u201cThese may seem like small details, but they are important for the girls.\u201d</p> <p>Lori Fogle and Ellie Smith, both 15, students at Park View school in Tottenham, north London, also decided to take action. With the help of their maths teacher, Laura Katan, they created a workshop for younger girls about period poverty and stigma. </p> <p>\u201cBy letting the year 7 girls talk about periods in the workshops and showing them they can be open and comfortable about it, we were letting them know there was nothing to be embarrassed about,\u201d Smith says.</p> <p>Katan says the workshop had a noticeable impact. \u201cA lot of the year 7s were stressed by the idea that their period might start in school when they weren\u2019t expecting it, and weren\u2019t comfortable to speak about that, or deal with it. Loads of them said it was their first time talking about periods in such an open way. There was an atmosphere of relief.\u201d </p> <p>She plans permanently to incorporate a student-led workshop into the school\u2019s curriculum. \u201cI\u2019m sure the reason the workshop was so successful at destigmatising periods was because it was peer-led by girls that the early years respected.</p> <p>At Stirling high school, the principal pupil support teacher, Vicki Wilson, has set up a club of students, the \u201cpanda posse\u201d, to remove period stigma. One student \u2013 typically a boy \u2013 puts on a panda head, while girls accompany him round the school giving out free sanitary products.</p> <p>\u201cThrough making it a fun activity, the boys have learnt a lot,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cUsing a panda puts a non-threatening face on it. We didn\u2019t want our mascot to be a six-foot tampon.\u201d Now 84% of girls at the school report feeling more comfortable talking about periods.</p> <p>However, for Bowen-Viner, clubs and peer workshops will never be enough and she is calling on the government to tackle period stigma nationally in schools. \u201cTeachers need to feel confident using language around menstruation \u2013 and to have the resources and knowledge to do that. And that is where training and support from policymakers is really important,\u201d she says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For most of her life, Molly Fenton had dreaded getting her period. Every month, the 17-year-old student at Llanishen high school in Cardiff would feel ashamed: uncomfortable, untouchable, unclean. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even say the word \u2018period\u2019 without feeling embarrassed,\u201d she says. She is not the only girl to have felt anxious about attending school when she was menstruating. A 2019 survey by the girls\u2019 rights charity Plan International UK found that more than half of girls aged 14-21 have missed school because they are embarrassed or worried about being on their period. Nearly six in 10 (57%) say they have experienced negative comments \u2013 being told periods were \u201cdirty\u201d or \u201cdisgusting\u201d, being mocked for their perceived mood or behaviour while menstruating, or being teased about leaking and sanitary products. As free sanitary products are set to be introduced to schools, teachers and students want to know: what is being done to tackle the stigma around periods in schools? Not enough, says Kate Bowen-Viner, a senior associate at the Centre for Education and Youth thinktank. She has researched period stigma in schools and believes it is a major problem. \u201cIt underpins every experience girls have with menstruation. It acts as a gender barrier between boys and girls.\u201d When she asked pupils why they had taken time off school while menstruating, many talked about fear and embarrassment rather than medical need. They also reported poor access to toilets and products at school. \u201cThey spoke about smuggling tampons and pads to each other during lessons and feeling unable to put their hand up and ask a teacher if they could go to the toilet.\u201d Even at breaktime, pupils said they felt stressed about using toilets if the sound of a packet opening could be heard outside the cubicle. \u201cIf boys were stood outside the toilet, they worried about going in.\u201d Fenton\u2019s attitude changed in March after she read a stirring interview with the 20-year-old period poverty campaigner Amika George. \u201cI was so angry afterwards, mainly at myself for contributing to the period stigma in my school and in society in general.\u201d She decided to talk to her school\u2019s senior leadership team. At the meeting, she handed out what appeared to be a box of Quality Street. \u201cI will never forget that day,\u201d says her headteacher, Sarah Parry. Instead of chocolates, the box contained sanitary products in a rainbow of colours. Parry says: \u201cI\u2019ve got quite a male-orientated senior leadership team \u2026 they all had to pick one. And then they didn\u2019t know what to do with it. It was hilarious.\u201d After that, Fenton was given permission to talk about period poverty and stigma to all the year groups in her school. She launched a campaign, Love Your Period, online and in school and put posters up at school advertising classrooms where girls could get free sanitary products and spare uniform items. Inspired by Fenton and wanting to set an example for boys in the school, a male member of the senior leadership team volunteered to give talks in assemblies to both boys and girls about the menstrual cycle and sanitary products. \u201cHe felt it would be very powerful for a male teacher to use the vocabulary [and] talk about the practicalities,\u201d says Parry. Parry thinks that, as a result, pupils are less anxious and embarrassed: \u201cGirls have even said openly to male teachers in class, \u2018sir, I really do need to go to the toilet, I\u2019m on my period\u2019.\u201d Fenton has observed this increase in confidence too: \u201cLoads of people have said: \u2018now you\u2019ve spoken about it, I\u2019m going to speak about it.\u2019\u201d She has been contacted by schools around the world about her campaign through her @LoveyourPeriod Instagram page. Parry says girls\u2019 attendance has significantly increased since the campaign began and she is introducing changes to cement the impact Fenton has made. For example, she is installing floor-to-ceiling doors on the cubicles of new toilets with washbasins inside. \u201cThese may seem like small details, but they are important for the girls.\u201d Lori Fogle and Ellie Smith, both 15, students at Park View school in Tottenham, north London, also decided to take action. With the help of their maths teacher, Laura Katan, they created a workshop for younger girls about period poverty and stigma. \u201cBy letting the year 7 girls talk about periods in the workshops and showing them they can be open and comfortable about it, we were letting them know there was nothing to be embarrassed about,\u201d Smith says. Katan says the workshop had a noticeable impact. \u201cA lot of the year 7s were stressed by the idea that their period might start in school when they weren\u2019t expecting it, and weren\u2019t comfortable to speak about that, or deal with it. Loads of them said it was their first time talking about periods in such an open way. There was an atmosphere of relief.\u201d She plans permanently to incorporate a student-led workshop into the school\u2019s curriculum. \u201cI\u2019m sure the reason the workshop was so successful at destigmatising periods was because it was peer-led by girls that the early years respected. At Stirling high school, the principal pupil support teacher, Vicki Wilson, has set up a club of students, the \u201cpanda posse\u201d, to remove period stigma. One student \u2013 typically a boy \u2013 puts on a panda head, while girls accompany him round the school giving out free sanitary products. \u201cThrough making it a fun activity, the boys have learnt a lot,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cUsing a panda puts a non-threatening face on it. We didn\u2019t want our mascot to be a six-foot tampon.\u201d Now 84% of girls at the school report feeling more comfortable talking about periods. However, for Bowen-Viner, clubs and peer workshops will never be enough and she is calling on the government to tackle period stigma nationally in schools. \u201cTeachers need to feel confident using language around menstruation \u2013 and to have the resources and knowledge to do that. And that is where training and support from policymakers is really important,\u201d she says.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong: Marriage Story is a brilliant film. It\u2019s nuanced, it\u2019s real, the acting is excellent, and it has some interesting stuff to say about relationships and families, and how they can evolve during periods of intense, soul-battering conflict.</p> <p>But balanced? Pull the other one. In all kinds of subtle and not-so-subtle ways, Marriage Story only tells half the story \u2013 the husband\u2019s half. We see Nicole, the wife, refuse to take part in mediation; we see her appoint a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/golden-globes-marriage-story-star-laura-dern-praises-noah-baumbach-speech-1266913\" title=\"\">rapacious (female) lawyer</a>; we see her force the long-suffering Charlie to move to LA in order to maintain contact with his son. We are shown a divorce industry that is skewed towards Nicole\u2019s rights (it is mentioned \u2013 very much in passing \u2013 that this is in order to protect the many women whose husbands leave them with the kids and then refuse to pay up).</p> <p>Meanwhile we never see, and are told a minimal amount about, the dynamics that drove Nicole to seek a divorce in the first place: the fact that Charlie had had an affair, and that he had insisted on staying in New York to further his career, at the expense of hers. In the publicity for the film Baumbach has made it clear that the story is partially based on his own divorce from the actor Jennifer Jason Leigh. He assured one interviewer that he showed the film to Jason Leigh prior to its release, and that she \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/jennifer-jason-leigh-likes-marriage-story-according-to-noah-baumbach\" title=\"\">likes it a lot</a>\u201d. Perhaps that\u2019s true, but if so I\u2019d like to hear it from her. In fact, I\u2019d like to watch a film about a disintegrating marriage, written, produced and directed by her. I have no doubt that it would be very different.</p> <p>Perhaps it is unfair to pick on Marriage Story, which does at least try to engage with questions about power, and who controls the narrative. Its limitations only bother me because I have reached middle age with a serious deficiency in my cinematic diet. I could probably count on my hands the number of films I\u2019ve seen that explore women\u2019s experiences with anything like this level of nuance and complexity \u2013 whereas I couldn\u2019t begin to count the films in which women are overlooked, stereotyped, or treated as little more than eye candy. It was for this reason that cartoonist Alison Bechdel first devised a <a href=\"http://bechdeltest.com/\" title=\"\">test</a> to measure women\u2019s representation in fiction; a story passes the Bechdel test if it has two named female characters who talk to each other about something other than a man.

I was watching an animated Christmas film with my boys the other day in which Mrs Claus \u2013 as in, the middle-aged, grey-haired wife of Santa \u2013 was depicted with a physique that would make Barbie look like the Vicar of Dibley. I just couldn\u2019t stop myself imagining the conversations that must have underpinned that creative decision. \u201cHey, guys, could we make Mrs Claus sexier? This is a film for preschoolers, after all.\u201d</p> <p>My allergic reaction is not to any one film, but to an entire creative sector that has so utterly failed not only to admit women as equals, and to reflect and represent our experiences, but even on the most basic level to acknowledge us as human beings with a valid perspective \u2013 as the #MeToo scandal made abundantly clear. In this respect, film has much to learn from publishing. The books sector is far from perfect \u2013 witness the \u201cJonathan Franzen effect\u201d, by which male writers are given a canonical status that is much harder for female writers to achieve, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/01/books-by-women-priced-45-lower-study-finds\" title=\"\">lower pricing of books by women </a>than books by men. Nonetheless, fiction in particular is an artistic form in which women can thrive. In 2017, Haruki Murakami was the only male writer to make the top 10 bestselling literary authors in the UK \u2013 quite a contrast to the measly <a href=\"https://womenandhollywood.com/resources/statistics/2018-statistics/\" title=\"\">4%</a> of female directors on the top 100 grossing films of 2018.</p> <p>So my resolution this year is to make sure I get a more balanced and nutritious cinematic diet.

      "bodyText": "I bought four San Remo toilet seats from B&amp;Q\u2019S Luton branch at the end of 2016. A year later they began to come loose \u2013 they are still operational but very noisy. Slowly they started to come away from the hinges, so they would slam down and need tapping back in. B&amp;Q customer services advised me to speak to the store. The store then advised me to contact the manufacturer, which I did. It said that as it was an \u201cobsolete item\u201d, I had to go back to the store. Eventually, someone advised me that, as they were more than two years old, I had no right to a replacement. They are bottom-fixing, so they\u2019re nearly impossible to tighten. A top-fixing replacement would cost \u00a335. I came across your article on the same issueand wondered if you could help.Now the hinges have started to twist and it seems B&amp;Q doesn\u2019t care. DP, Luton, Bedfordshire This is from B&amp;Q\u2019s own brand, Cooke &amp; Lewis, which has popped up here before regarding replacement parts. Wear and tear is one thing, but we would expect a toilet seat to last longer than two years \u2013 particularly if your house has four rather than one! It sounds as though they were not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, so B&amp;Q is, apparently, technically, in breach of the Consumer Rights Act (although this is arguably difficult to prove). B&amp;Q says that it \u201ccan confirm that we are in contact with the customer to reach a resolution\u201d. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write to Consumer Champions, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU. Please include a daytime phone number. Submission and publication of all letters is subject to our terms and conditions",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Tuesday morning.</p> \n<p>An Indonesian man described by police as the most prolific rapist in British history is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-jailed-life-drugging-raping-men-manchester\">after being found guilty of 136 rapes against young men</a>. Reynhard Sinaga, a postgraduate student from Indonesia, is believed by police to have committed at least 196 assaults over a two-and-a-half-year period after luring people to his flat in the centre of Manchester, drugging them and then raping them when they were asleep. Sinaga\u2019s crimes were revealed after a marathon legal process that involved four separate trials, with details subject to a reporting ban until the final verdicts at Manchester crown court on Monday. Judge Suzanne Goddard QC described Sinaga as a \u201cdangerous, deeply disturbed and perverted individual with no sense of reality\u201d. The home secretary, Priti Patel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/06/priti-patel-urges-review-of-date-rape-drugs-after-reynhard-sinaga-case\">called for a review of the availability of \u201cdate-rape\u201d drugs</a> such as GHB.</p> \n<p>He was eventually caught when one victim woke up during an attack and phoned 999. The court heard how Sinaga <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-serial-rapist-posed-good-samaritan-lure-men\">preyed on young men as they left nightclubs in the city</a>, often while they were inebriated or confused after losing their phone or lacking money for a taxi home. Sinaga filmed the attacks on his phone and police found hours of footage stored in his flat. Some victims can be heard snoring while the attacks take place. The slightly built, bespectacled Sinaga first came to Britain in 2007 from his home in Sumatra and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-peter-pan-phd-student-who-raped-scores-of-men\">eked out his studies for years while living off money from his father, a banker</a>. He never hid his sexuality in Manchester\u2019s vibrant gay scene and friends said they had no knowledge of his crimes. However, some had heard him describe \u201cturning\u201d heterosexual men as a sport and they joked about finding dead bodies in his bedroom.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Middle East tension \u2013 </strong>Confusion surrounds the fate of US troops in Iraq <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/06/us-allies-trump-suleimani-killing-reaction-response\">after contradictory messages from the US military and the Trump administration</a> in the aftermath of last week\u2019s assassination in Baghdad of Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani. The US-led coalition of forces fighting Isis wrote to the Iraqi defence ministry saying it was preparing to pull out troops, but then the defence secretary Mark Esper said it was not happening. US allies distanced themselves from the confusion in Washington as mourning for the dead general continues this morning with the return of his body to his home town of Kerman.

An estimated 25,000 koalas have perished and there are fears for an endangered mouse-like marsupial, the Kangaroo Island dunnart, and the glossy black-cockatoo, which have both seen extensive areas of critical habitat burned.

The court heard how Sinaga preyed on young men as they left nightclubs in the city, often while they were inebriated or confused after losing their phone or lacking money for a taxi home. Sinaga filmed the attacks on his phone and police found hours of footage stored in his flat. Some victims can be heard snoring while the attacks take place. The slightly built, bespectacled Sinaga first came to Britain in 2007 from his home in Sumatra and eked out his studies for years while living off money from his father, a banker. He never hid his sexuality in Manchester\u2019s vibrant gay scene and friends said they had no knowledge of his crimes. However, some had heard him describe \u201cturning\u201d heterosexual men as a sport and they joked about finding dead bodies in his bedroom. * * * Middle East tension \u2013 Confusion surrounds the fate of US troops in Iraq after contradictory messages from the US military and the Trump administration in the aftermath of last week\u2019s assassination in Baghdad of Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani. The US-led coalition of forces fighting Isis wrote to the Iraqi defence ministry saying it was preparing to pull out troops, but then the defence secretary Mark Esper said it was not happening. US allies distanced themselves from the confusion in Washington as mourning for the dead general continues this morning with the return of his body to his home town of Kerman. Fears about a widening conflict in the Middle East sent oil prices soaring to $70 on Monday although it has slipped back to $68 in overnight trading. * * * And then there were six \u2013 Rebecca Long Bailey has confirmed her widely anticipated candidacy for the Labour leadership with an article in Tribune magazine criticising the party\u2019s election strategy. Positioning herself as the heir to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leftwing legacy, the MP for Salford and Eccles said she would stick with the current socialist policies with \u201cunwavering determination\u201d. She wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t just agree with the policies, I\u2019ve spent the last four years writing them.\u201d She becomes the sixth candidate to declare along with Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, Clive Lewis, Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips. Here\u2019s where they stand. * * * Wildlife fire fears \u2013 There are grave concerns for unique wildlife on Kangaroo Island in South Australia after bushfires ripped through the area at the weekend, destroying biodiversity-rich bushland. An estimated 25,000 koalas have perished and there are fears for an endangered mouse-like marsupial, the Kangaroo Island dunnart, and the glossy black-cockatoo, which have both seen extensive areas of critical habitat burned. The island\u2019s population of endangered glossy black-cockatoos \u2013 a unique subspecies \u2013 has been the subject of two decades of community conservation work to bring numbers from as low as 150 in the 1990s to as high as 400 in latest counts. Dr Gabriel Crowley has been working on the cockatoo project for 22 years and said every bird lost was a tragedy. \u201cI\u2019m a bit desperate actually.\u201d The crisis continues to rage in many other parts of Australia with the insurance bill already at \u00a3350m. * * * Chain reaction \u2013 Creditors to Jamie Oliver\u2019s failed restaurant chain stand to lose most of the \u00a380m owed by the business, according to the firm\u2019s administrators. KPMG said secured and unsecured creditors would lose out after it had tried but failed to chase debtors for the money owed when the business collapsed in May. The celebrity chef\u2019s holding company was owed \u00a357m while councils and HSBC were among other creditors. Oliver said: \u201cI appreciate how difficult this is for everyone affected.\u201d * * * Going green \u2013 Britain enjoyed its greenest ever year for energy production in 2019 as power provided by renewables outstripped fossil fuel generation on 137 days. A study by the Carbon Brief website found that renewables \u2013 wind, solar, hydro and biomass projects \u2013 grew by 9% last year and was the UK\u2019s largest electricity source in March, August, September and December. Coal and gas generation fell 6% and is now half the level it was 10 years ago. * * * Grave matter \u2013 Archaeologists have hailed the discovery of high-status Roman graves in Somerset as a \u201csignificant\u201d find after the remains were unearthed during building work for a new school. Adults and children were included in the tombs along with grave goods such as pottery and brooches. Some of the bodies clearly belonged to important people, experts said, with one covered by a tent-like structure of stone slabs while others were buried wearing hobnail boots. The form of the burials was unusual and sheds lights on the transition between Iron Age and Roman society.

Lunchtime read: Taking the slow boat to Canada \u2026 If you have considered taking a leaf out of Greta Thunberg\u2019s book and eschewing air travel, this is the read for you. Will Vibert, a Canadian, worked out he had emitted 14 tonnes of carbon in the past two years from flights alone, cancelling out efforts to reduce his footprint by cycling to work and limiting food waste. So when he had to leave Europe for home, he took a berth on a cargo ship at $100 a day (including food) and took a slow voyage back, enjoying vast ocean views and the company of crew and fellow environmentally minded travellers.

      "bodyText": "The future of the US military presence in Iraq is in question amid scenes of confusion in Washington, as the Trump administration scrambled to respond to Iraqi demands for the troops to leave after last week\u2019s assassination in Baghdad of Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani. The US-led coalition taskforce fighting Isis in Iraq delivered a letter to the Iraqi defence ministry on Monday saying preparations would begin right away \u201cto ensure that movement out of Iraq is conducted in a safe and efficient manner\u201d. But soon afterwards, the defence secretary, Mark Esper, told journalists in the Pentagon: \u201cThat letter is inconsistent with where we are right now\u201d and insisted that no decision had been taken to evacuate Iraq. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, said the letter had been sent in error. \u201cThat letter is a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released,\u201d Milley said, adding that it was \u201cpoorly worded, implies withdrawal, that is not what\u2019s happening\u201d. Early on Tuesday, Sulemani\u2019s body arrived in his home town, the south-eastern city of Kerman in the final stage of his funeral processions. State TV broadcast live images of thousands of people in the streets, many dressed in black, to mourn the death of the general. Hossein Salami, the leader of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard, threatened to set ablaze places supported by the US, sparking anti-Israel chants from the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019re here today to pay respects to the great commander of the holy defence,\u201d said one of the mourners, who came from the southern city of Shiraz to attend the funeral. A withdrawal of the US-led taskforce from Iraq would dramatically weaken the effort to stop Isis regrouping, marking a strategic victory for Iran and a serious setback for the Trump administration, which urged Baghdad not to expel its counter-terrorist forces. The evident confusion in Washington added to an impression among US allies and enemies alike that the decision to assassinate Suleimani without a clear plan of what to do next had weakened the US in the region. US allies have continued to distance themselves from the decision, as millions of Iranians took to the streets to mourn and demand revenge for the assassination of the country\u2019s top general. Both Israel and Nato stressed they were not involved in the airstrike on Friday. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has already expressed disappointment in the lukewarm reaction of Washington\u2019s European allies. But the response of Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was particularly striking, as he has been one of Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters on the world stage. He told a meeting of his security cabinet on Monday: \u201cThe assassination of Suleimani isn\u2019t an Israeli event but an American event. We were not involved and should not be dragged into it.\u201d The Saudi deputy defence minister, Khalid bin Salman, was in Washington on Monday to urge restraint, joining a growing international chorus. France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, insisted there was still time for diplomacy but warned that without urgent action to defuse rising tensions there was a real risk of a new Middle East war. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who spoke to Pompeo on Monday, said that the region\u2019s \u201ccauldron of tensions is leading more and more countries to take unpredicted decisions with unpredictable consequences and a profound risk of miscalculation\u201d. The Trump administration refused a visa to the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to come to New York to address the UN security council on Thursday, violating the UN headquarters agreement, the Foreign Policy website reported. A spokesman for the Iranian mission said it had not been informed of any decision, and a UN spokesman declined to comment. The US letter to the Iraqi military was signed by the US commanding general in Iraq, Brig Gen William Seely, and said that US forces \u201cwill be repositioning over the coming days and weeks to prepare for onward movement\u201d. The taskforce would try keep disruption to a minimum and do much of the airlift at night \u201cto alleviate any perception\u201d that the US was bringing more troops into Baghdad\u2019s fortified Green Zone. In London, the foreign office would not confirm or deny reports that the UK was scaling back staff at its embassies in Iran and Iraq to a minimum level, saying only that both sites were open and \u201cthe safety and security of our staff is of paramount importance and we keep our security posture under regular review\u201d. Boris Johnson is to chair a meeting of the national security council as Britain continued to urge all sides in the crisis to draw back from all-out conflict. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, spoke on Tuesday to Zarif to stress the need for a diplomatic resolution. Iran has threatened a severe response to the US killing of Suleimani by drone strike in Baghdad last week. Brig Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of Iran\u2019s aerospace division, said on Monday that the only appropriate response would be the \u201cthe complete destruction of America in the region\u201d. While beginning to withdraw counter-Isis forces from Iraq, the Pentagon, meanwhile, continued to pour reinforcements into the region in case of a direct conflict with Iran. US defence officials said the roughly 2,500-strong marine force onboard the Bataan amphibious ready group, equipped with Cobra helicopters and Harrier jets, would be sent to the Middle East from its current position in the Mediterranean. Three thousand airborne troops are already on the way to Kuwait, and CNN reported that B-52 bombers were being sent to the Indian Ocean base of Diego Garcia, for potential use over the Middle East. On Monday, Iraq\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, had summoned the US ambassador, Matthew Tueller, and called on the two countries to cooperate in arranging the US withdrawal. However, Abdul-Mahdi did not give a deadline for the US departure. Trump faced condemnation on Monday for his threat to strike Iranian culture sites among 52 targets that the US would bomb in reprisal for any future Iranian attack. The number, he explained, was the same as the number of Americans taken hostage when the US embassy in Tehran was seized after the Islamic revolution in 1979. Trump was also under continued pressure from Democrats on Monday for the lack of transparency over his justification for the assassination of Suleimani, who commanded the elite Quds force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards. Trump and Pompeo have claimed the general was plotting imminent attacks against US targets. Abdul-Mahdi said the Iranian military leader had flown to Iraq to negotiate, and he claimed Trump had asked the Iraqi government to mediate. Trump did not consult Congress or US allies before ordering the strike in the early hours of the morning in Baghdad. On Saturday, the White House delivered a formal notification to Congress as required by the 1973 War Powers Act, but its contents were classified. Normally such notifications are public documents with a classified section if required. The Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Bob Menendez wrote to Trump on Monday, demanding the war powers notification be declassified. \u201cWe did not see anything here that he deemed required such a classification,\u201d a Senate staffer said. \u201cThe War Powers Act provision requiring the 48-hour notification was included partly for transparency purposes with the American people during these delicate moments. [It\u2019s] pretty self-defeating to hide something meant to be transparent.\u201d The White House has suggested it will brief selected members of Congress this week, but Kellyanne Conway, a Trump adviser, said the decision on timing was up to the Pentagon. US allies in Europe and the Middle East have stressed that Suleimani had been a destabilising and destructive presence in the region, but they have largely stopped short of supporting Trump\u2019s decision, calling for restraint on all sides. The US briefed Nato ministers on Monday on the Suleimani killing. Speaking to journalists later, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, distanced the alliance from the operation. \u201cThis is a US decision, it is not a decision taken by either the global coalition nor Nato, but all allies are concerned about Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region, Iran\u2019s support to different terrorist groups,\u201d Stoltenberg said. He also confirmed the suspension of the Nato training mission in Iraq. \u201cIn everything that we do, the safety of our personnel is paramount. As such, we have temporarily suspended our training on the ground,\u201d the secretary general said. There is mounting concern that the more cautious stance by the US-led coalition would make it much less effective and allow Isis to regenerate. \u201cThe bottom line is that there won\u2019t be much counter-terrorism going on in Iraq and Syria any time soon,\u201d wrote Luke Hartig, former senior director for counter-terrorism on the national security council, now at the New America foundation. \u201cTrump\u2019s counter-terrorism legacy in Iraq and Syria may be a series of dead bodies but nothing that addresses the core of the problem and no partners willing to help us root it out.\u201d",

But then she picked up the telephone, and called one of her attackers. \u201cI think that first engagement was out of anger, honestly. There was this egoistic element, this wish to clarify things. But then it was a really positive conversation. I noticed how much good it did \u2013 for me, but also for the other person.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"17b4392dd151e898670811ea1edca26594d03414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17b4392dd151e898670811ea1edca26594d03414/215_172_4272_1873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 1,000-year Reich triptych, 1933-38, by Dresden painter Hans Grundig.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"438\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local heritage \u2026 The 1,000-year Reich triptych, 1933-38, by Dresden painter Hans Grundig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Albertinum | Galerie Neue Meister, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bolstered, Wagner went on to call every single individual who had targeted her with hate mail or calls. All but one was a man. \u201cThere was no explicit sexism,\u201d she notes, \u201cbut it\u2019s certainly part of the situation.\u201d</p> <p>The conversations continued to prove constructive. People were surprised that she had got in touch. They talked, and listened. There were incremental steps towards reciprocal understanding. \u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily reach a point of agreement, but we cleared up misconceptions. I understood some of the grievances better.\u201d</p> <p>Other German arts institutions have adopted a firm shut-door policy on the far right. In Leipzig, an AfD-sympathising artist was excluded from an annual painting exhibition. In Berlin, the director of the Friedrichstadt-Palast theatre stated that AfD voters were not welcome at his venue.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We had shouting, door slamming, a lot of arguments and accusations. But it did develop in a positive direction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But in Dresden, where the far right courses through all strata of society, Wagner sees the duties of a public institution differently.<strong> </strong>\u201cPegida and AfD voters are everywhere here. They\u2019re among families, colleagues and our network of sponsors. Where are we if we simply say we\u2019re not talking to one another?\u201d</p> <p>Wagner implemented a roster of dialogue events and strategies across the Albertinum. The first step was an open-invitation discussion series. In the museum\u2019s airy central atrium, long central tables were set up, flanked by curved rows of seating. Up to 600 people showed up at the events, including Pegida members, as well as many of the individuals who had attacked Wagner.</p> <p>\u201cIt was initially very difficult,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe had shouting, door slamming, a lot of arguments and accusations. But it did develop in a positive direction.\u201d One of the men who had previously sent Wagner hate mail stood up and apologised. Another said the Albertinum had come to feel \u201clike our living room\u201d.</p> <p>This domestic atmosphere was key for Wagner, who titled the discussion series We Need to Talk. \u201cI found it important to establish this feeling of personal relationship. We had participants from across the social and political spectrum, with a range of attitudes. And we learned a lot from each other.\u201d</p> <p>Then came curatorial strategies. Like many places porous to far-right extremism, Dresden\u2019s identity is punctured by experiences of erasure. Capital of the state of Saxony, the city was once a major economic centre, flush with trade and baroque architecture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"de44ebec4b0ab298441bbb4e0d2b1bf855a296ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de44ebec4b0ab298441bbb4e0d2b1bf855a296ba/0_0_2982_3498/852.jpg\" alt=\"Loss \u2026 Dresden in ruins after Allied bombing raids in 1945.\" width=\"852\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loss \u2026 Dresden in ruins after Allied bombing raids in 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Peter Snr/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In February 1945, 90% of the city centre was destroyed by allied air raids, killing up to 25,000 residents \u2013 the majority women and children. Then, after a period of architectural and industrial revival under the East German government, reunification saw Dresden lose much of its employment, ownership and young people to the west.</p> <p>Wagner seeks to retrieve periods of artistic energy from these successive waves of loss \u2013 not least Dresden\u2019s lively interwar abstraction scene. \u201cKandinsky, Mondrian, Lissitzky were all extremely active here in the 1920s. I want to remind Dresdeners of that modernist history, and nurture their openness to and pride in what happened here.\u201d</p> <p>Through the dialogue series, it also became clear that her public wanted to see more imagery from the East German era, as well as paintings depicting the wartime destruction of Dresden. This presented a dilemma: both genres have been leveraged by the AfD to goad a sense of civic victimhood.</p> <p>Wagner\u2019s solution was not to deny her visitors\u2019 wishes, but to challenge any simplistic victim narrative with additional nuance and context. Paintings depicting Dresden\u2019s destruction were presented alongside international anti-war works by Maria Lassnig and Marlene Dumas. An installation by Wolfgang Tillmans showed the destruction of Dresden alongside that of Coventry. \u201cI wanted to make sure we weren\u2019t isolating these works, that we were showing them on eye level with other perspectives.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"484e787cab693066ea44e9a63a8997b0cf1859f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/484e787cab693066ea44e9a63a8997b0cf1859f3/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eye level \u2026 Hilke Wagner opens an exhibition of East German art at the Albertinum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eye level \u2026 Hilke Wagner opens an exhibition of East German art at the Albertinum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wagner also honoured the request for more East German art, but deflected the patriarchal discourse of the AfD with an emphasis on the country\u2019s female practitioners. An exhibition curated by <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/488985/radical-women-artists-prove-medea-never-dies/\">Susanne Altmann</a> showed 36 female artists from East Germany and other former Soviet states. Next year, a thematic show will emphasise East Germany\u2019s inclusive ideals, exploring its allegiances with South Africa, Mozambique and India.</p> <p>Not everyone is persuaded by Wagner\u2019s measures. Shortly before last Christmas, she was moved to hear a refugee and migrant organisation gathered in the museum\u2019s atrium, singing festive songs. As she watched from the gallery above, a nearby German man tutted disapprovingly at the multiethnic chorus. \u201cPoor Germany,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It was a depressing reminder of the challenges she faces. But Wagner isn\u2019t giving up. For her, it is exactly this kind of personal exposure that might lead to better social cohesion. \u201cAs a museum,\u201d she says, \u201cwe are one of the few places where such direct encounters can still happen.\u201d</p> <p>There are signs her determination is paying off. Wagner hasn\u2019t received any hate mail since January. The other day she bumped into one of her former critics in the street. \u201cHe said he owed me a nice letter.\u201d</p>",

They really try to deepen this divide between east and west Germany.\u201d Wagner\u2019s initial reaction erred towards distance. \u201cAt first, I thought, I can\u2019t stay here,\u201d she recalls. But then she picked up the telephone, and called one of her attackers. \u201cI think that first engagement was out of anger, honestly. There was this egoistic element, this wish to clarify things. But then it was a really positive conversation. I noticed how much good it did \u2013 for me, but also for the other person.\u201d Bolstered, Wagner went on to call every single individual who had targeted her with hate mail or calls. All but one was a man. \u201cThere was no explicit sexism,\u201d she notes, \u201cbut it\u2019s certainly part of the situation.\u201d The conversations continued to prove constructive. People were surprised that she had got in touch. They talked, and listened. There were incremental steps towards reciprocal understanding. \u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily reach a point of agreement, but we cleared up misconceptions. I understood some of the grievances better.\u201d Other German arts institutions have adopted a firm shut-door policy on the far right. In Leipzig, an AfD-sympathising artist was excluded from an annual painting exhibition. In Berlin, the director of the Friedrichstadt-Palast theatre stated that AfD voters were not welcome at his venue. But in Dresden, where the far right courses through all strata of society, Wagner sees the duties of a public institution differently. \u201cPegida and AfD voters are everywhere here. They\u2019re among families, colleagues and our network of sponsors. Where are we if we simply say we\u2019re not talking to one another?\u201d Wagner implemented a roster of dialogue events and strategies across the Albertinum. The first step was an open-invitation discussion series. In the museum\u2019s airy central atrium, long central tables were set up, flanked by curved rows of seating. Up to 600 people showed up at the events, including Pegida members, as well as many of the individuals who had attacked Wagner. \u201cIt was initially very difficult,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe had shouting, door slamming, a lot of arguments and accusations. But it did develop in a positive direction.\u201d One of the men who had previously sent Wagner hate mail stood up and apologised. Another said the Albertinum had come to feel \u201clike our living room\u201d. This domestic atmosphere was key for Wagner, who titled the discussion series We Need to Talk. \u201cI found it important to establish this feeling of personal relationship. We had participants from across the social and political spectrum, with a range of attitudes. And we learned a lot from each other.\u201d Then came curatorial strategies. Like many places porous to far-right extremism, Dresden\u2019s identity is punctured by experiences of erasure. Capital of the state of Saxony, the city was once a major economic centre, flush with trade and baroque architecture. In February 1945, 90% of the city centre was destroyed by allied air raids, killing up to 25,000 residents \u2013 the majority women and children. Then, after a period of architectural and industrial revival under the East German government, reunification saw Dresden lose much of its employment, ownership and young people to the west. Wagner seeks to retrieve periods of artistic energy from these successive waves of loss \u2013 not least Dresden\u2019s lively interwar abstraction scene. \u201cKandinsky, Mondrian, Lissitzky were all extremely active here in the 1920s. I want to remind Dresdeners of that modernist history, and nurture their openness to and pride in what happened here.\u201d Through the dialogue series, it also became clear that her public wanted to see more imagery from the East German era, as well as paintings depicting the wartime destruction of Dresden. This presented a dilemma: both genres have been leveraged by the AfD to goad a sense of civic victimhood. Wagner\u2019s solution was not to deny her visitors\u2019 wishes, but to challenge any simplistic victim narrative with additional nuance and context. Paintings depicting Dresden\u2019s destruction were presented alongside international anti-war works by Maria Lassnig and Marlene Dumas. An installation by Wolfgang Tillmans showed the destruction of Dresden alongside that of Coventry. \u201cI wanted to make sure we weren\u2019t isolating these works, that we were showing them on eye level with other perspectives.\u201d Wagner also honoured the request for more East German art, but deflected the patriarchal discourse of the AfD with an emphasis on the country\u2019s female practitioners. An exhibition curated by Susanne Altmann showed 36 female artists from East Germany and other former Soviet states. Next year, a thematic show will emphasise East Germany\u2019s inclusive ideals, exploring its allegiances with South Africa, Mozambique and India. Not everyone is persuaded by Wagner\u2019s measures. Shortly before last Christmas, she was moved to hear a refugee and migrant organisation gathered in the museum\u2019s atrium, singing festive songs. As she watched from the gallery above, a nearby German man tutted disapprovingly at the multiethnic chorus. \u201cPoor Germany,\u201d he said. It was a depressing reminder of the challenges she faces. But Wagner isn\u2019t giving up. For her, it is exactly this kind of personal exposure that might lead to better social cohesion. \u201cAs a museum,\u201d she says, \u201cwe are one of the few places where such direct encounters can still happen.\u201d There are signs her determination is paying off. Wagner hasn\u2019t received any hate mail since January. The other day she bumped into one of her former critics in the street. \u201cHe said he owed me a nice letter.\u201d",

The individuals were evidently of some status. Most graves in Roman Britain are pretty much a rectangular cut with someone laid on their back. They\u2019ve actually built these graves. There\u2019s been a lot more care taken over these.\u201d</p> <p>Membery believes the people who have been found would have lived and worked in a nearby Roman villa. The villa has yet to be discovered but what is believed to be an outhouse and a barn associated with it have been found.</p> <p>Evidence has also been uncovered of an iron-age settlement predating the Roman cemetery. Membery said one of the most interesting elements of the cemetery was that it showed how local people adopted Roman burial customs. Bodies were squashed into the oldest graves but laid flat, in the Roman style, in the later ones, and grave goods were placed close to the head.</p> <p>DNA analysis will be carried out to try to learn more about the people who were buried at Somerton. It is thought likely they were British people who had adopted Roman customs after the invasion.</p> <p>But analysis of remains found at Hinkley Point found evidence people buried there had origins in east Asia. \u201cThey probably made their way to the eastern Roman empire and then their descendants came to Britain,\u201d Membery said. The find means archaeologists in Somerset are hesitant to make assumptions about the possible origins of people whose remains are unearthed.</p> <p>The Somerton cemetery was found on land owned by Somerset county council during building work for a new junior and infant school. Work had to be halted but will restart later this month.</p> <p>Cllr Faye Purbrick, the cabinet member for education, said: \u201cThe findings are both exciting and extraordinary, providing us with valuable insight into Somerset\u2019s early history. We will be able to understand so much more about the lives of Roman people in Somerton thanks to these discoveries.\u201d</p> <p>The site\u2019s archaeology has been gathered for further scientific analysis. A full report of the findings will be published in due course.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The resting places of more than 50 adults and children have been found in an unusual Roman cemetery unearthed during building work for a new school in Somerset. Archaeologists say the discovery at Somerton, near Glastonbury, sheds significant light on life and death in the south-west of Britain after the Roman invasion. Some of the people buried in the Romano-British cemetery were clearly of high status, with the position of one woman\u2019s skull indicating her head was initially resting on a pillow. Tiny nails were also found at the foot of the graves, suggesting most of the people were buried wearing hobnail boots. But it is the structure of the graves that is fascinating. The majority were lined with local stone and capped and sealed with the same sort of slabs used to create roofs in the area 2,000 years ago. In one particularly unusual grave, slabs were used to create a tent-like structure above the person who was buried. A similar setup was recently discovered at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station construction site on the Somerset coast \u2013 25 miles (40km) north-west of Somerton \u2013 and it has echoes of grave profiles in Spain and Italy. Other finds include \u201cgrave goods\u201d such as pottery and jewellery, while one pot that was dug up contained a chicken wing. A coin from the time of Emperor Vespasian, who ruled from AD69 to AD79, and a piece of carved bone, most likely from a knife handle, were also uncovered. Steve Membery, an archaeologist and member of the South West Heritage Trust, which has overseen the excavations, said: \u201cThis site is a significant discovery. The individuals were evidently of some status. Most graves in Roman Britain are pretty much a rectangular cut with someone laid on their back. They\u2019ve actually built these graves. There\u2019s been a lot more care taken over these.\u201d Membery believes the people who have been found would have lived and worked in a nearby Roman villa. The villa has yet to be discovered but what is believed to be an outhouse and a barn associated with it have been found. Evidence has also been uncovered of an iron-age settlement predating the Roman cemetery. Membery said one of the most interesting elements of the cemetery was that it showed how local people adopted Roman burial customs. Bodies were squashed into the oldest graves but laid flat, in the Roman style, in the later ones, and grave goods were placed close to the head. DNA analysis will be carried out to try to learn more about the people who were buried at Somerton. It is thought likely they were British people who had adopted Roman customs after the invasion. But analysis of remains found at Hinkley Point found evidence people buried there had origins in east Asia. \u201cThey probably made their way to the eastern Roman empire and then their descendants came to Britain,\u201d Membery said. The find means archaeologists in Somerset are hesitant to make assumptions about the possible origins of people whose remains are unearthed. The Somerton cemetery was found on land owned by Somerset county council during building work for a new junior and infant school. Work had to be halted but will restart later this month. Cllr Faye Purbrick, the cabinet member for education, said: \u201cThe findings are both exciting and extraordinary, providing us with valuable insight into Somerset\u2019s early history. We will be able to understand so much more about the lives of Roman people in Somerton thanks to these discoveries.\u201d The site\u2019s archaeology has been gathered for further scientific analysis. A full report of the findings will be published in due course.",

      "bodyText": "Civilians killed or injured in Libya by explosive weapons rose by 131% last year, with the number of incidents at its highest since 2011, the year of the Benghazi uprising, according to new data seen by the Guardian. Most of the 900 people who died or were hurt in explosions in the country in 2019 \u2013 up from 392 in 2018 \u2013 were victims of airstrikes, according to statistics from Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), a charity based in London. Libya was one of several countries to buck the downward global trend in civilian casualties from explosive weapons. The worst places for civilian killings and maimings were Libya, Afghanistan and Somalia, but increases were also recorded in Sri Lanka, India, Philippines, Turkey, Gaza, Egypt, Colombia, and Myanmar. While Syria remained the country worst impacted by explosive weaponry in 2019, casualties decreased by about a quarter: 7,268 compared to the previous year, at 9,587. AOAV recorded 29,499 deaths and injuries by explosive weapons in 2019, 66% of which (19,407) were innocent civilians. When explosive weapons were used in populated areas, 91% of those killed were civilians, compared to 15% of civilians in other areas. The group\u2019s executive director Iain Overton said: \u201cWhile the general shift is towards a reduction in explosive harm globally, some countries are seeing concerning increases in violence. As 2020 shows a real potential for renewed war in the Middle East, 2019 reminds us how fragile peace can be.\u201d At least 28 people died in an attack on a military academy in the Libyan capital of Tripoli in the first weekend of 2020 and there are fears fighting will escalate further in Libya with Turkey\u2019s parliament voting to send in troops in support of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord, which is facing an offensive by Khalifa Haftar\u2019s Libyan National Army. Overton, author of The Price of Paradise: how the suicide bomber shaped the modern age, predicted an uptick in Shia suicide bombings this year. There were 133 suicide attacks last year, one every three days, he said, largely by Salafist groups. Overall, IEDs account for 49% of civilian harm. \u201cThere is a constant and this constant shows us that our data is pretty robust,\u201d said Overton. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are asking for a political commitment through the UN member states to sign up to a declaration to prevent the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.\u201d In October, Amnesty International reported scores of civilian casualties in Libya as \u201cboth sides use everything from Gaddafi-era unguided rockets to modern drone-launched guided missiles in attacks that could amount to war crimes\u201d. Airstrikes accounted for 72% of civilian casualties in Libya in 2019 and shelling, 19%, AOAV said. Despite the rising number of incidents, 125 in 2019, compared to 134 in 2011, the death toll in 2019 is far lower than in 2011, when 2,108 civilians died. Donatella Rovera, crisis response adviser at Amnesty International who worked on the report, said: \u201cWe are seeing fewer casualties compared to other conflicts in the region, of course every one civilian casualty is one too many.\u201d She said, however, in Libya, it was difficult to accurately interrogate data. For instance, one of the biggest attacks reported on civilians was on the migrant detention centre in July, when between 40 and 50 people were reportedly killed. \u201cThe reality is we have not found evidence to substantiate the numbers. The only thing we saw was a handful of body bags in an image,\u201d she said. Somalia also saw a 14% rise in civilian harm from explosives, mostly improvised explosive devices, from 832 in 2018 to 945 in 2019, while Afghanistan, which has seen record numbers of civilian casualties over the last four years, continued on its violent trajectory upwards. Unlike in 2018, when the surge in Afghan violence was attributed to an increasing Isis presence, last year saw a \u201cnotable\u201d increase in Taliban violence. There was a 9% rise in the killing and maiming of civilians from explosives, from 4,268 to 4,638 in 2019. AOAV recorded a 187% increase in civilian casualties from Taliban use of explosive weapons, to 1,896 this year. UN member states are currently taking part in a political process run by the Irish government to adopt stronger rules in urban areas, including halting the use of certain weapons. Laura Boillot, co-ordinator of the International Network of Explosive Weapons (Inew), said: \u201cWe have been looking at the data AOAV has been producing for 10 years. We\u2019ve seen a consistent pattern of harm, because conflict is increasingly in populated areas.\u201d \u201cAircraft bombs are inaccurate.

It says people often have little contact with other generations outside their own families. Divisions have grown, it says, partly as a result of housing market trends, with wealth concentrated among older generations who tend to live in towns and rural areas while younger people gravitate towards cities. United for All Ages, which was set up in 2010, supports intergenerational projects as a way of tackling key social and economic issues, including housing, anxiety and loneliness. Its report, Together in the 2020s, highlights recent progress with a growing number of intergenerational initiatives, including projects which bring together children in schools and nurseries with older people in care homes. The report calls for care homes to become community hubs; for schools to extend their opening hours to provide community spaces for intergenerational activities and an increase in home-sharing schemes to promote intergenerational living. Other proposals include designating a bank holiday as a national day of unity to help bring the country together and a new government department for connection dedicated to supporting intergenerational action. Stephen Burke, a director at United for All Ages, said: \u201cBringing Britain together is one of the biggest challenges for the new decade.

This thorough and harrowing two-part doc examines Jones\u2019s rise from fervent San Francisco preacher for wayward youth in the late 1960s to cult leader who was forced to flee the US. A deeply disturbing account of the destructive potential of belief. Ammar Kalia Silent Witness 9pm, BBC One A 23rd series of this sometimes slightly generic but incredibly hardy forensic drama. In this opening episode, there\u2019s a plane crash carrying the former US ambassador to Britain. An accident?

He is the surgeon at the Comfort Zone clinic in Turkey, which promises its mainly British customers cut-price surgery. Can it help women such as 25-year-old Summer, who has sold one of her pets to fund her op? Ali Catterall Hollyoaks Later 11pm, Channel 4 Ahead of its 25th anniversary later this year, the daytime TV stalwart gets some post-watershed treatment in a double bill special.

Morgan savaged Kelly for his remarks, saying he was taking a \u201cnothing to see here, nothing to worry about\u201d approach as \u201cyour entire country is eviscerated by fires\u201d. \u201cYou are facing now one of the greatest crises you have ever faced, and there is you Mr Kelly, with respect, a senior politician who still doesn\u2019t think this has anything to do with a heating-up planet,\u201d Morgan said. Tobin accused Kelly of denying the science which showed that 2019 was Australia\u2019s hottest and driest year on record. \u201cAt the moment we want everyone to commit in the world to be one and a half degrees to lower our global temperature rise,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cYou can\u2019t even commit to two degrees. \u201cYou have the second highest carbon emissions per person on Earth and you are burying your head in the sand.

Climate change and global warming are real and Australia right now is showing the entire world just how devastating it is. \u201cAnd for senior politicians in Australia to still pretend there\u2019s no connection is absolutely disgraceful.\u201d Kelly also used the interview to defend Scott Morrison for taking a holiday to Hawaii during the bushfire crisis, saying the management of fires was primarily the states\u2019 responsibility. The remarks came after the conservative backbencher appeared on the BBC on Saturday, claiming that there was no link between climate change and Australia\u2019s drought. \u201cThere is no link, the facts that cause the fires are the drought and the drying of the environment,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cOn this, climate scientists down here have been very clear and they have said there is no link between drought and climate change.\u201d \u201cPeople here in Australia understand \u2013 if they look at the evidence and look at the signs \u2013 there is nothing that we can do here in Australia by sending billions more off to China to buy solar panels to replace our coal-fired electricity generators,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not going to change the weather here in Australia one iota and is not going to stop one bushfire.\u201d Speaking on ABC\u2019s Radio National on Tuesday morning, Kelly doubled down on the remarks, saying Morgan did \u201cnot want to hear the facts\u201d and arguing that hazard reduction was more important than taking action on climate change. He said people were exploiting the bushfire tragedy \u201cfor ideology\u201d, and the cause of the fires was \u201cthe dryness of the atmosphere and the landscape\u201d, while rejecting suggestions that the Coalition was home to a group of denialist MPs. \u201cThere is no denialist cult,\u201d Kelly said. He also referred to Tobin as a \u201cweather girl\u201d who \u201chad no idea what she was talking about\u201d. \u201cShe says the Australia continent is drying out and that is just not true.\u201d Tobin responded to the criticism on Twitter on Tuesday morning, pointing to her degree in physics and meteorology, and her four years\u2019 experience as an aviation forecaster at the Royal Air Force. The remarks come as Morrison defends the government\u2019s climate change policy, while stressing there is \u201cno dispute\u201d in Australia about the impact of global warming on Australia\u2019s climate. \u201cI have seen a number of people suggest that somehow the government does not make this connection,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThe government I lead has always made that connection and that has never been in dispute.\u201d Kelly, who established the Parliamentary Friends of Coal Exports for likeminded MPs, has been a longstanding internal critic of government attempts to reduce carbon emissions, and was a vocal critic of the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s attempt to introduce a national energy policy. He has also argued against any government investment into renewable energy, calling for subsidies for households and businesses to be scrapped. After Morrison became leader, Kelly was told to rein in media appearances, particularly on Sky News, where he had become a frequent guest of conservative commentators. Kelly has twice had his preselection threatened but in 2016 Turnbull intervened to prevent a moderate challenging him for the seat of Hughes, and before the 2019 election Morrison also moved to ensure his incumbency was protected.",

The agreement, which signs the Pacific nation up to China\u2019s belt and road initiative, comes after Kiribati severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established them with China in September last year. Xi met Kiribati\u2019s president, Taneti Maamau, in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and thanked him for visiting China. \u201cLast September, China and Kiribati restored diplomatic relations based on the one-China principle and have ushered in a new chapter of bilateral cooperation,\u201d said Xi, according to video of the meeting released by the Chinese state broadcaster CGTN. \u201cWe welcome Kiribati back to the big family of China-Pacific island cooperation.\u201d \u201cMr President and the Kiribati government stand on the right side of history,\u201d Xi told Maamau, according to CGTN.

Over the decades, dozens of countries \u2013 including the US and most western nations \u2013 have switched recognition to Beijing, leaving just a handful of countries loyal to Taiwan, largely in Latin America and the Pacific. The south Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where, until this week, formal ties with six island nations made up more than a third of its total alliances. The Solomon Islands and Kiribati (pronounced Kiribas) were the largest of Taiwan\u2019s Pacific allies, with populations of 600,000 and 115,000 respectively. The decision of the two nations to establish relations with China has left Taiwan with four remaining Pacific allies: Tuvalu, Nauru, Palau and Marshall Islands, as well as allies in the Caribbean and Latin America. China\u2019s concerted attempt to peel allies away from Taipei could be seen as putting pressure on Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen, who is pro-Taiwanese sovereignty, ahead of elections in Taiwan this weekend. Tsai is favoured to win a second term in Saturday\u2019s election, an outcome that would likely intensify Chinas economic, diplomatic and military pressure over her refusal to accept its insistence that Taiwan is a part of China. Since her election, China has increasingly sought to isolate Taiwan diplomatically while ramping up its threat to use force to annex the self-governing island republic.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian actor Yael Stone has vowed to give up her green card, which allows her to work in the United States, as a \u201cpersonal sacrifice\u201d aimed at reducing carbon emissions in what she called the \u201cclimate war\u201d. In a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday and Instagram on Sunday, the actor and star of Netflix\u2019s Orange is the New Black said she came to the decision to give up her green card \u201cafter a long, considered process\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to understand that it\u2019s unethical for us to set up a life in two countries, knowing what we know,\u201d Stone said in the video, calling such frequent travelling \u201cenvironmentally unjust\u201d. \u201cThe carbon emissions alone from that flying \u2013 it\u2019s unethical. It\u2019s not right. So I will be going through the process of giving up my green card, and saying goodbye to a life in America. I\u2019m going to be here in Australia doing the the work I can to make a difference here. Because the time is now.\u201d In an earlier video posted to Instagram on Sunday, Stone expressed horror at the political response to Australia\u2019s ongoing and months-long bushfire crisis. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in a dark room wondering what the hell is happening. Our country is on fire \u2026 and our prime minister has done absolutely nothing. Cold, calculated nothing. We don\u2019t have leaders, we have cowards,\u201d she said. The actor, who recently starred in Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s production of The Beauty Queen of Leenane, also implored others to act. \u201cThe leaders we have are the people around us. And that\u2019s what we have to become. \u201cWe have to step up because this is war. This is a climate war. And for the first time our enemy is not wearing a uniform that we\u2019ll be able to recognise.

The Islands Business magazine, a regional publication based in Fiji, said Ardern had shown a commitment to the Pacific region by advocating for urgent action on climate change at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu last year.

      "bodyText": "Ecologists have grave concerns for the future of unique and endangered wildlife on Kangaroo Island where bushfires have killed thousands of koalas. Fires on the island, in South Australia, have so far burned through 155,000 hectares \u2013 about one third of the island\u2019s entire area \u2013 with blazes concentrated in the biodiversity-rich western areas. Concerns are greatest for the unique and endangered mouse-like marsupial the Kangaroo Island dunnart, and the glossy black-cockatoo, which have both seen extensive areas of critical habitat burned. The island\u2019s population of endangered glossy black-cockatoos \u2013 a unique subspecies \u2013 has been the subject of two decades of community conservation work to bring numbers from as low as 150 in the 1990s to as high as 400 in latest counts. \u201cA lot of the key feeding and breeding areas on the north coast [of Kangaroo Island] have been lost,\u201d said Daniella Teixeira, a scientist researching the birds at the University of Queensland. Dr Gabriel Crowley, of the Centre of Biodiversity and Conservation Science at the University of Queensland, has been working on the cockatoo project for 22 years. She said there was hope at least one flock may have escaped the fires on to Dudley Peninsular in the north-east, but information was still coming in. Those birds may struggle to find food, she said. The fires had come through at the start of the breeding season when some females would have been sitting on an egg and reluctant to fly away. She told Guardian Australia: \u201cThey have few places to nest and have lost their food supply. Their survival will depend on an intensive recovery effort. \u201cI\u2019m a bit desperate actually. It\u2019s a very endearing species and each individual is different. Because there are so few, every bird lost is a tragedy. Every breeding female is so important.\u201d The fires on Kangaroo Island started with lightning strikes in the Flinders Chase national park. Two people have been killed in the fires on the 160km long island, and its farming and tourism industry will be hard hit. The Kangaroo Island Land for Wildlife organisation has eight sites on private land protecting several endangered species, including dunnarts, goannas, echidnas, bandicoots and the glossy black-cockatoos. Ecologist at Land for Wildlife, Heidi Groffen, said all eight sites were extensively burned. Cameras used for monitoring had melted. \u201cPeople call this place a little Noah\u2019s Ark. The island is a refuge. This is the largest fire we have seen in a long time,\u201d she said. She said they were already trying to get to conservation sites to find if there were any unburned patches where dunnarts and other species might have survived. \u201cWe are trying to be positive,\u2019\u201d she added. Sam Mitchell, co-owner of the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park, told Guardian Australia residents had been delivering injured animals to them, including about 50 koalas. \u201cAt least a third of what has been brought in we\u2019ve had to euthanise unfortunately,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing many burns to hands and feet \u2013 fingernails melted off. For some the burns are just too extreme.\u201d Injured kangaroos, wallabies and pygmy possums had also been brought to the park, which was in the process of setting up larger treatment areas for the injured animals. Koalas were introduced to the island in the 1920s in response to a drop in numbers on the mainland from the fur trade. The introduced koalas were free from chlamydia \u2013 a disease prevalent among mainland populations that can cause blindness, infertility and death. Koalas thrived on the island, and there is a government program to reduce their numbers. Mitchell said some islanders had considered the koalas a pest as their numbers had grown as high as 50,000. He said \u201cprobably more than half\u201d of the island\u2019s koalas would have perished in the fires, but it was \u201ca guessing game\u201d. Prof Corey Bradshaw, an ecologist at Flinders University, has been speaking to scientific colleagues on the ground and said they had grave concerns for the dunnarts and the cockatoos. \u201cHow this is going to impact the long-term efforts is unknown,\u201d he said, but added: \u201cWe have been predicting this for so long. \u201cIt is extreme events \u2013 whether it\u2019s drought, flood, cyclones or fires \u2013 that drives things to extinction.\u201d Dr Richard Glatz, an entomologist at the University of Adelaide who lives on the island, said he was also concerned for the rare green carpenter bee. \u201cAll that\u2019s left of the bees are on Kangaroo Island and a few in the ranges near Sydney.\u201d He said the bees made nests in yacca trees and in the trunks of dead banksias and he was concerned that fire had burned many of the areas where the insect lives. Glatz, chief editor or the journal Austral Entomology, said he had moved to the island because of its beauty and its stretches of virtually unspoilt habitats that had ancient lineages. \u201cI\u2019m still processing all this,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a way I\u2019ve been thinking more about the people \u2013 we\u2019ve lost something like 50 houses and for a small community, that\u2019s huge.\u201d",

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has defended his threat to target Iranian cultural sites \u2013 widely seen as a war crime \u2013 if Tehran retaliates for the killing of General Qassem Suleimani. On bellicose form, the US president also lashed out at Iraq following its parliament\u2019s demand for American troops to be expelled from that country, and vowed to respond with crippling sanctions. Trump\u2019s comments suggest he was making no idle threat when, on Saturday night, he tweeted that the US has \u201ctargeted 52 Iranian sites ... some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.\u201d Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One a day later, he sought to offer a justification. \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to kill our people,\u201d Trump said, according to a pool report. \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to torture and maim our people. They\u2019re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we\u2019re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d Targeting cultural sites is prohibited by international conventions signed in Geneva and at the Hague. In 2017, the United Nations security council passed unanimously a resolution condemning the destruction of heritage sites. The action previewed by Trump would almost certainly involve the deaths of civilians. The Pentagon, however, sought to distance itself from Trump\u2019s threats, with defense secretary Mark Esper saying on Monday that the US will \u201cfollow the laws of armed conflict\u201d, including those that ruled out targeting cultural sites. Esper\u2019s public comments reflected the private concerns of other defense and military officials, who cited legal prohibitions on attacks on civilian, cultural and religious sites, except under certain, threatening circumstances. Trump\u2019s statements come after secretary of state Mike Pompeo defended the assertion that the drone strike against Suleimani in Baghdad prevented an imminent attack on US interests. \u201cWe would have been culpably negligent had we not taken this action,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday. When host Chuck Todd asked if retaliation against US citizens should now be expected, Pompeo admitted: \u201cIt may be that there\u2019s a little noise here in the interim.\u201d US-Iran tensions are escalating following last Friday\u2019s drone strike \u2013 ordered by Trump without congressional authorisation \u2013 in Iraq that killed Suleimani, commander of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force. On Monday morning in Tehran, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei presided over prayers for the slain general, and Suleimani\u2019s daughter Zeinab told a huge crowd at his funeral ceremony that the US and its ally Israel faced a \u201cdark day\u201d for his death. \u201cCrazy Trump, don\u2019t think that everything is over with my father\u2019s martyrdom,\u201d Zeinab Suleimani said in an address broadcast on state television. \u201cThe families of US soldiers in the Middle East will spend their days waiting for death of their children.\u201d Before the ceremony, mourners had packed the streets around Tehran university, chanting \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d. One man held up a placard reading \u201chard\u2013revenge\u201d. The ceremony followed a turbulent weekend that saw the Iraqi parliament pass a resolution calling on the government to expel US troops, of which about 5,000 remain, most in an advisory capacity. On Sunday, Iran\u2019s government said the country would no longer observe limitations on uranium enrichment, stockpiles of enriched uranium or nuclear research and development. The statement noted that the steps could be reversed if Washington lifted its sanctions on Tehran. On Sunday, Human Rights Watch condemned the president\u2019s latest threat to Iran\u2019s culture sites: \u201cPresident Trump should publicly reverse his threats against Iran\u2019s cultural property and make clear that he will not authorise nor order war crimes,\u201d said Andrea Prasow, its acting Washington director. \u201cThe US Defense Department should publicly reaffirm its commitment to abide by the laws of war and comply only with lawful military orders.\u201d She added: \u201cTrump\u2019s threat to attack Iran\u2019s cultural heritage shows his callous disregard for the global rule of law. Whether refusing to condemn the brutal murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi or pardoning convicted war criminals, Trump has shown little respect for human rights as part of US foreign policy.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump\u2019s drone strike \u201cprovocative and disproportionate\u201d and said legislation would be introduced this week to halt the president\u2019s military actions regarding Iran unless Congress is involved. She told Democrats: \u201cWe are concerned that the administration took this action without the consultation of Congress and without respect for Congress\u2019s war powers granted to it by the Constitution.\u201d Trump spoke to reporters on Sunday as he flew back to Washington from another eventful holiday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. He showed no hint of regret. Asked about vows of vengeance from Iran, the president said simply: \u201cIf it happens it happens.

It\u2019ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks look set to trigger another political firestorm amid concerns that he has not considered the consequences of the strike against Suleimani and may even be seeking to distract from his upcoming impeachment trial. Brett McGurk, the former US presidential envoy to the global coalition to counter Isis, tweeted: \u201cTrump\u2019s comments tonight regarding Iran and Iraq are not only unacceptable, they\u2019re unAmerican. American military forces adhere to international law. They don\u2019t attack cultural sites. And they\u2019re not mercenaries.

Countless lives have been affected and we know there is more to come. The most important thing right now is to protect as much life and property as possible. But looking beyond the immediate crisis, we need to start an honest discussion about something none of us want to admit \u2013 that these unprecedented, catastrophic fires may indeed mark the beginning of Australia\u2019s new normal. As the world and Australia fail to make meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, it is clear that we are entering the next phase of climate change \u2013 that is, increasingly frequent and severe weather events, occurring in places that have never been affected before. It\u2019s a scary and confronting reality to reckon with; perhaps that\u2019s why some of us find it easier to write off scientists and bushfire survivors speaking hard truths as part of a \u201cclimate cult\u201d. Thankfully, our emergency services have chosen not to shy away from the truth, preparing themselves for a horror summer while knowing that they did not have enough personnel, volunteers, equipment or funding to deal with the scale of the crisis. Influential figures in our financial system have also confronted the issue head-on. With worsening extreme weather events sending premiums soaring to the point that some regions are effectively uninsurable, the insurance industry is reviewing whether traditional insurance models can remain tenable. Meanwhile, banks such as NAB are developing \u201cresilience investment\u201d products to assist local governments to build infrastructure such as emergency centres and seawalls. This is encouraging, given the scale of the work needed to ensure local food, energy, water, transportation and communications systems can withstand extreme and prolonged weather events and recover quickly with minimal external assistance. But while some are facing the crisis, there has been a glaring lack of leadership from the federal government on a coordinated plan to support the growing numbers of families, business owners and communities affected by extreme weather. The announcement by the prime minister of a new National Bushfire Recovery Agency and a $2bn package to assist those affected by the bushfire crisis is a step in the right direction.

And to do this, we need much more than reactive measures from government that are propped up by generous donations from the public. Without a doubt, adaptation will be expensive. But not as expensive as the cost of inaction. Of course the billion-dollar question remains: where will the money come from? An obvious place to start the search is at the doorstep of the industry that is the most responsible for climate change: the fossil fuel industry. It is unconscionable that as Australia burns, the taxpayer subsidises this industry to the tune of $1,728 per person per year. What if instead we channelled the $41.8bn worth of fossil fuel subsidies into a transitions fund, to support not only disaster preparedness and relief, but also workers and communities to transition to new jobs and industries? A second option is found in the Australia Institute\u2019s calls for a national climate disaster fund to be established. The Australia Institute\u2019s modelling shows that a levy of $1 per tonne of embodied emissions from all coal, oil and gas mined in Australia would raise approximately $1.5bn per year. Both approaches would go a long way towards addressing the needs of the victims of this climate crisis, while also stopping it from getting worse in the future.

If our government can show some leadership by listening to the experts and working with different industries to find a way forward, maybe we will come to see climate adaptation as less of a cost and more of an investment in a liveable future.

So far, Australia\u2019s bushfires have burned through more than 8.4m hectares. \u201cTo put [the California fires] up to scale with what\u2019s happening in Australia right now, it\u2019s not even comparable.\u201d</p> <p>Ward explains that she is offering something people were already prepared to pay for. \u201cI already use my Twitter platform to make money by selling nude photos \u2026 I have a loyal fan base who buys content from me and that\u2019s how I pay my bills.\u201d </p> <p>However, she was unprepared for the \u201coverwhelming\u201d amount of attention she has received and is struggling to keep up with the demand. \u201cI\u2019m still a little bit in shock about how much positivity I\u2019ve received from this.\u201d</p> <p>Ward\u2019s efforts have inspired other sex workers to offer naked photographs in exchange for donations to Australia\u2019s bushfire relief funds.</p> <p>Katie Day, a Vancouver-based sex worker, says she saw the Naked Philanthropist\u2019s tweet and \u201cthought it was a really great way to encourage people to donate\u201d. She tweeted on 6 January that she was joining Ward\u2019s efforts.

If people are doing that successfully it makes me so happy.\u201d</p> <p>But not all of the attention has been positive. Since posting the viral tweet, Ward has faced criticism for previous posts she has made on social media. \u201cMostly it\u2019s not people saying anything negative about what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s more people trying to dig and find out who I am, and try to find out anything they can about me that\u2019s negative.

So far, Australia\u2019s bushfires have burned through more than 8.4m hectares. \u201cTo put [the California fires] up to scale with what\u2019s happening in Australia right now, it\u2019s not even comparable.\u201d Ward explains that she is offering something people were already prepared to pay for. \u201cI already use my Twitter platform to make money by selling nude photos \u2026 I have a loyal fan base who buys content from me and that\u2019s how I pay my bills.\u201d However, she was unprepared for the \u201coverwhelming\u201d amount of attention she has received and is struggling to keep up with the demand. \u201cI\u2019m still a little bit in shock about how much positivity I\u2019ve received from this.\u201d Ward\u2019s efforts have inspired other sex workers to offer naked photographs in exchange for donations to Australia\u2019s bushfire relief funds. Katie Day, a Vancouver-based sex worker, says she saw the Naked Philanthropist\u2019s tweet and \u201cthought it was a really great way to encourage people to donate\u201d. She tweeted on 6 January that she was joining Ward\u2019s efforts. She hoped to raise a couple of hundred dollars, and has already surpassed that goal, raising more than $1,000 in 24 hours, mostly from \u201cpeople I\u2019ve never heard of before\u201d. Ward is flattered that others are following in her footsteps. \u201cI think what\u2019s important is raising as much money as possible. If people are doing that successfully it makes me so happy.\u201d But not all of the attention has been positive. Since posting the viral tweet, Ward has faced criticism for previous posts she has made on social media. \u201cMostly it\u2019s not people saying anything negative about what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s more people trying to dig and find out who I am, and try to find out anything they can about me that\u2019s negative. It\u2019s become almost an obsession to a few of these people.\u201d Ward has also been upset that her Instagram account, which had more than 60,000 followers and was a significant source of revenue, has been deleted. \u201cEvery time I try to make a new account it\u2019s deactivated, and what\u2019s concerning is there are a few fake accounts who are impersonating me that haven\u2019t got deleted. People are stealing my identity through Instagram.\u201d Ultimately, Ward remains upbeat about the situation. \u201cPeople are always going to have their opinions especially if you\u2019re in this line of work\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing it for a good cause and you know deep down you\u2019re a good person, never let anybody get to you or make you feel that you\u2019re less-than. \u201cIt is a little bit overwhelming that I\u2019m so vulnerable and everybody\u2019s staring at me. Especially because I\u2019m naked on the internet right now. [But] I\u2019m only one person and I\u2019m helping so many other people, so I\u2019m not the most important thing right now.\u201d",

Here are today\u2019s top events to make note of: Republican Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona tweeted out a photoshopped image of president Barack Obama shaking hands with Hassan Rouhani that was quickly debunked as fake. A memo was apparently mistakenly released implying potential withdrawal of US troops from Iraq. Officials said the letter had been sent in error, drawing confusion. The Trump administration has reportedly blocked an Iranian diplomat from addressing the UN this month Pete Buttigieg is heading back to Iowa on Jan. 12 to do more campaigning ahead of the upcoming caucus there, his team announced on Monday. According to the announcement, Buttigieg has now visited Iowa 21 times, with visits to 49 counties to hold 100 events across the state. Donald Trump will hold a rally in Wildwood, New Jersey on Jan. 28, his campaign announced Monday. Wildwood is in the district of Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who left the Democratic Party to join Trump in the GOP late last year. Republican congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona tweeted out a photoshopped image of former president Barack Obama and Iranian president Hassan Rouhani that was quickly debunked. \u201cThe world is a better place without these guys in power,\u201d the caption Gosar tweeted to accompany the fake photo said. Obama and Rouhani reportedly never met in person, and Rouhani is also still in power. The two did speak by phone in September 2013, a landmark moment reflecting the highest level of contact between a US and Iranian president in 30 years. As of the time of publishing this post, the inaccurate tweet is still live on Gosar\u2019s account. Donald Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump, Jr. posted an image on Sunday of himself holding an AR-15 style rifle with an image of former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on its magazine. In response to some backlash online, a spokesperson for Trump Jr. gave the following statement to The Hill: \u201cInstagram post was strictly about him using a famous meme to mock Hillary Clinton, as he and many others have done on numerous occasions and will surely do again in the future, so long as it continues triggering humorless liberals\u201d. The image appears to be a reference to the phrase \u201clock her up\u201d, which has frequently been chanted at Trump campaign rallies. The creator of the magazine said the company has seen an uptick in business in response to the photo. The future of the US presence in Iraq is in question after a military memo seemed to indicate a potential withdrawal of American troops from the country. The memo stated troops would begin \u201conward movement\u201d from Iraq. However, secretary of defense Mark Esper said the memo was inaccurate \u201cThere\u2019s been no decision whatsoever to leave Iraq.\u201d The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, said the letter had been sent in error. The back-and-forth began as the Trump administration scrambled to respond to Iraqi demands for the troops to leave after last week\u2019s assassination in Baghdad of Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani. Allies to the US are responding in kind, with British officials are now pointing to Esper\u2019s clarification, describing the original letter from the US-led coalition circulating in Iraq as \u201cvery unclear\u201d and \u201cnot what it seems\u201d without giving further details. For more information, read our latest report. Mitt Romney said he would \u201clike to hear\u201d from John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, but stopped short of saying he would subpoena him. Bolton previously said he would testify in a Senate impeachment trial if he were subpoenaed, but a majority of the Republican-controlled Senate would have to approve a subpoena. The Trump administration made a move Monday to block Iran\u2019s top diplomat from addressing the UN security council, Foreign Policy reports. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has been blocked from obtaining a visa to attend a Jan. 9 Security Council meeting on the importance of upholding the UN Charter, sources told Foreign Policy. The block violates the terms of a 1947 headquarters agreement requiring Washington to permit foreign officials into the country to conduct UN business and marks another escalation in the continued tension between the US and Iran. Hello, Kari Paul on the West Coast here, taking over the blog for the next few hours. Stay tuned for updates. That\u2019s it from me today. I\u2019m handing the blog off to my west coast colleague, Kari Paul, for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: A memo from the US military seemed to indicate a potential withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, but secretary of defense Mark Esper then said the memo was inaccurate. \u201cThere\u2019s been no decision whatsoever to leave Iraq,\u201d Esper said. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, said he would testify in a Senate impeachment trial if he were subpoenaed, but a majority of the Republican-controlled Senate would have to approve a subpoena. Democratic congressional leaders, including Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, called on Republicans to support a Bolton subpoena, arguing any other course of action would constitute a \u201ccover-up.\u201d Bolton\u2019s statement could delay the transmission of the articles of impeachment to the Senate, which previously seemed likely to occur this week. Kari will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Secretary of defense Mark Esper said the letter indicating a potential US troop withdrawal from Iraq is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the Pentagon\u2019s current position. Secretary of defense Mark Esper has now said the memo on US troops\u2019 \u201conward movement\u201d from Iraq is not accurate. \u201cThere\u2019s been no decision whatsoever to leave Iraq,\u201d Esper said. It appears US troops in Iraq are being moved out of a base in the Green Zone and relocated to other bases across the country after the Iraqi parliament voted to expel the American troops. The US military has sent a letter to the Iraqi military announcing the \u201conward movement\u201d of American forces after the Iraqi parliament voted to expel the troops, indicating a withdrawal. It\u2019s unclear whether the letter indicates a full or partial withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, but the military has confirmed its authenticity, dispelling previous claims that it was fake. Republican senator Josh Hawley has introduced his resolution to update Senate rules to allow for the dismissal of the impeachment charges against Trump. The measure would allow senators to dismiss the charges if the House does not transmit the articles of impeachment within 25 calendar days. That date would fall next week, but again, it\u2019s unclear whether Hawley\u2019s proposal will gain any momentum in the Senate. Trump called in to conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh\u2019s show to criticize House Democrats\u2019 handling of impeachment and defend the US drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. The president also seemed to brush off concerns about John Bolton testifying to the Senate after his former national security adviser said he would do so if he receives a subpoena. At least one Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, has said he would not support issuing a subpoena to John Bolton, arguing the Senate impeachment trial should be based on the existing evidence gathered by the House. Another Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, indicated he would not necessarily be opposed to calling Bolton to testify, but he predicted the former national security adviser would actually help Trump\u2019s case during the trial. The Democratic-controlled House sought Bolton\u2019s testimony, but the committee chairs leading the impeachment inquiry chose not to subpoena him after the former official made clear he would join a lawsuit seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether to comply with a congressional subpoena or White House guidance not to cooperate with the investigation. Americans narrowly approve of the US drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani last week, according to a new poll. The HuffPost/YouGov survey found that 43% of Americans agree with Trump\u2019s decision to order the strike, compared to 38% who disapprove. But Americans narrowly disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of the strike. According to the poll, 43% of Americans say the president did not plan well enough before the strike, compared to 35% who say he did. Respondents also said, 44% to 34%, that Trump should have received congressional approval before ordering the strike. And perhaps most worryingly for the president, 47% of Americans think Trump does not have a clear strategy for dealing with Iran, compared to 32% who say he does. Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat facing a difficult reelection race in Alabama this year, said in a tweet that he supported calling John Bolton to testify in the impeachment trial. In order to issue a subpoena to Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, minority leader Chuck Schumer would need every Senate Democrat and four Senate Republicans to sign on to the request, so he will need to win over some moderate Democratic senators who have previously seemed hesitant on impeachment. With the news of John Bolton\u2019s willingness to testify, it appears probable that Nancy Pelosi will further delay transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate, although one of her aides said the House speaker had not decided on a timeline. Before Bolton released his statement, most Capitol Hill reporters were predicting Pelosi would transmit the articles at some point this week, but that no longer seems likely. John Bolton\u2019s willigness to testfiy in the impeachment trial if subpoenaed could give Democrats more leverage over the parameters of the Senate proceedings, after it seemed House speaker Nancy Pelosi would have to trasmit the articles without any agreement on witnesses. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has issued a statement about John Bolton\u2019s willingness to testify in a Senate impeachment trial, echoing Chuck Schumer\u2019s argument that Republicans would be enabling a \u201ccover-up\u201d if they did not call Trump\u2019s former national security adviser to testify. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, similarly said the Senate should call Bolton and other White House officials, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, to testify. House Democrats previously tried to get Bolton to testify during their impeachment hearings, but they backed off from a potential subpoena after the former official signaled he would join a lawsuit seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether to comply with a congressional subpoena or the White House guidance not to cooperate with the investigation. Chuck Schumer is out with a statement about John Bolton\u2019s willingness to testify in the impeachment trial if subpoenaed by the Senate, heralding what he calls \u201cmomentum for uncovering the truth in a Senate trial\u201d and adding: Given that Mr Bolton\u2019s lawyers have stated he has new relevant information to share, if any Senate Republicans oppose issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we have requested they would be absolutely clear they are participating in a coverup. Schumer also mentions, again, the need for four Republicans to support bringing Bolton and the other witnesses Democrats want into the Senate trial. The other witnesses Democrats want for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial are acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget, and Robert Blair, assistant to the president and senior adviser to Mulvaney. Here\u2019s our report from the day Mulvaney admitted there was a quid pro quo for military aid to Ukraine and memorably told reporters to \u201cget over it\u201d: Choice quote: \u201cBut that\u2019s it. That\u2019s why we held up the money \u2026 I have news for everybody. Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy. Elections have consequences.\u201d And here\u2019s part of his statement issued later the same day: \u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, said he would testify in the impeachment trial if he were subpoenaed by the Senate, but issuing a subpoena would require a majority level of support in the Republican-controlled chamber. Trump insisted Iran \u201cWILL NEVER HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON\u201d as fears mount about fallout from the killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Former Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro endorsed Elizabeth Warren\u2019s White House bid, just days after suspending his own campaign. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Following the news of John Bolton\u2019s willingness to testify in a Senate impeachment trial, a senior House Democratic aide touted speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to delay the transmission of the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Some Republicans have criticized Pelosi for delaying the articles\u2019 transmission, arguing it disproves Democrats\u2019 claims that they needed to advance the inquiry quickly because of the \u201curgent\u201d nature of the accusations stemming from the Ukraine controversy. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, reportedly gave Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell advance notice about his statement saying he would testify in an impeachment trial if subpoenaed. It appears John Bolton is currently dodging questions about whether he would comply with a House subpoena seeking his testimony related to the Ukraine controversy. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser said he would testify in the Senate impeachment trial if subpoenaed, but it\u2019s unclear whether Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer can attract enough Republican support to get a subpoena approved. After John Bolton issued a statement saying he would testify in the impeachment trial if the Senate issues a subpoena, some commentators wondered if Trump\u2019s former national security adviser would similarly comply with a subpoena from the Democratic-controlled House. The House previously sought Bolton\u2019s testimony, but the former official did not appear before lawmakers at the time, citing an ongoing lawsuit seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether to comply with a congressional subpoena or the White House guidance not to cooperate with the investigation. It\u2019s important to note that John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, is only saying he will testify if the Republican-controlled Senate issues a subpoena. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has called for a handful of Trump administration officials, including Bolton, to testify, but he would need four Republicans to sign on to his request to have it approved. \u201cI hope, pray, and believe there\u2019s a decent chance that four Republicans will join us. If they do, we will have a fair trial,\u201d Schumer said yesterday. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, has confirmed he intends to testify in the Senate impeachment trial if he is subpoenaed. In a statement explaining his new position, Bolton noted that he previously joined a lawsuit seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether to comply with a congressional subpoena or the White House\u2019s guidance not to cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry. \u201cThe House has concluded its Constitutional responsibility by adopting Articles of Impeachment related to the Ukraine matter. It now falls to the Senate to fulfill its Constitutional obligation to try impeachments, and it does not appear possible that a final judicial resolution of the still-unanswered Constitutional questions can be obtained before the Senate acts,\u201d Bolton said in the statement. \u201cAccordingly, since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify.\u201d John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, has reportedly said he would testify in a Senate impeachment trial if he were subpoenaed. Bolton is one of four Trump administration officials that Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer listed as potential witnesses for the trial, but it\u2019s unclear whether enough Republicans will sign on to Schumer\u2019s request to get it approved. Bolton reportedly criticized other administration officials, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, for getting involved in efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. The department of defense and the state department reportedly plan to brief members of Congress Wednesday on the drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. After news of the strike broke, Democratic leaders in Congress complained that they were not given advance notice of the strike. Even members of the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d the group of lawmakers who are supposed to be regularly briefed on classified intelligence matters, do not appear to have received information about the strike before it occurred. Senator Lindsey Graham, a close congressional ally of Trump\u2019s, said he would oppose a War Powers resolution aimed at limiting the president\u2019s military actions in Iran. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues yesterday that members would soon vote on a War Powers resolution, similar to the one proposed by Democratic senator Tim Kaine. \u201cLast week, the Trump administration conducted a provocative and disproportionate military airstrike targeting high-level Iranian military officials,\u201d Pelosi wrote in the letter. \u201cThis action endangered our servicemembers, diplomats and others by risking a serious escalation of tensions with Iran. \u201cAs members of Congress, our first responsibility is to keep the American people safe. For this reason, we are concerned that the administration took this action without the consultation of Congress and without respect for Congress\u2019s war powers granted to it by the Constitution.\u201d The Constitution clearly gives Congress the power to declare war, which makes Graham\u2019s comment about \u201c535 Commanders in Chief\u201d all the more curious. Echoing comments he made Friday on the Senate floor, majority leader Mitch McConnell said senators would \u201ccontinue the ordinary business of the Senate\u201d as they await the transmission of the articles of impeachment. It\u2019s unclear when Nancy Pelosi will transmit the two articles of impeachment passed by the House last month, but many expect the speaker to do so later this week. While campaigning in Iowa this weekend, former vice president Joe Biden once again falsely represented his past support for the Iraq War. The former Delaware senator\u2019s 2002 vote in favor of using force in Iraq has been back in the news this month, following the US drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. CNN reports: Biden was responding Saturday to a voter in Des Moines, Iowa, who told him, \u2018I\u2019m with you 90% of the way\u2019 but questioned his judgment in part because \u2018you were for the second Gulf War, which was a mess.\u2019 Biden said that \u2018from the very moment\u2019 President George W. Bush launched his \u2018shock and awe\u2019 military campaign, and \u2018right after\u2019 that occurred, \u2018I opposed what he was doing, and spoke to him.\u2019 It\u2019s false that Biden opposed the war from the moment Bush started it in March 2003. Biden repeatedly spoke in favor of the war both before and after it began. Republican senator Josh Hawley is expected to introduce a measure today aimed at dismissing the impeachment charges that the House has approved against Trump. According to Axios, Hawley\u2019s resolution \u201cwould allow the Senate to dismiss for lack of prosecution any articles of impeachment that the House of Representatives has delayed transmitting for 25 calendar days or more.\u201d But it\u2019s worth noting that the Senate has been out of session since the House passed the articles of impeachment, and House speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to transmit the articles at some point this week. Hawley\u2019s resolution seems unlikely to gain momentum, but it underscores the possible political perils of House Democrats continuing to delay a Senate trial. Trump has just sent out another tweet, this one claiming that Iran will \u201cnever\u201d have a nuclear wepon after the country\u2019s top general was killed by a US drone strike. In response to the Suleimani strike, Tehran announced yesterday that it would no longer limit itself to the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear deal, which the Trump administration had already been chipping away at by reimposing strict sanctions. The announcement sparked concerns that Iran would race toward ramping up their nuclear development, but Tehran did not entirely abandon the deal. In a statement, Iran said it would \u201ccontinue to work with international nuclear agencies and will return to JCPOA limits once all sanctions are removed from the country.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has announced she will appear alongside Juli\u00e1n Castro tomorrow, after her former primary opponent endorsed her White House bid. The pair will host an event at Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, tomorrow evening. The event will come less than a week after Castro suspended his own presidential campaign. Castro announced this morning that he was endorsing Warren. \u201cTheres one candidate I see who\u2019s unafraid to fight like hell to make sure America\u2019s promise will be there for everyone,\u201d Castro said in a new video. \u201cWho will make sure that no matter where you live in America or where your family came from in the world, you have a path to opportunity too. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to endorse Elizabeth Warren for president.\u201d Trump has again weighed in on the looming impeachment trial over Twitter, dismissing the controversy as a \u201ccon game\u201d and calling for a rapid end to the matter. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet transmitted the aricles of impeachment to the Senate, but many expect her to do so this week. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has made clear the delay will not affect his handling of the trial. Once the articles are transmitted, the Republican-controlled Senate will need to determine the parameters of the trial, which is expected to end in the president\u2019s acquittal. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has been demanding that White House advisers testify during the trial, but that request will not be approved unless he can get four Republican senators to sign on to it. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Democratic presidential candidate who ended his White House bid last week, announced he is endorsing Elizabeth Warren in the race. A newly released video showed Castro and Warren having a conversation at the Massachusetts senator\u2019s home, alongside her golden retriever Bailey. Warren applauded Castro for the way he ran his campaign, and he in turn said his bid was driven by the \u201csame vision that I see in you and your campaign.\u201d \u201cNobody is working harder than you are,\u201d Castro told Warren. Judge Judy Sheindlin, the star of the popular daytime court show \u201cJudge Judy,\u201d has announced she is endorsing Michael Bloomberg in the Democratic presidential primary. \u201cI like to say you can judge someone\u2019s character by what they\u2019ve done. Mike Bloomberg has done amazing things and will be a truly great president,\u201d Sheindlin says in a new video released by the billionaire candidate\u2019s campaign. \u201cNo one comes close to Mike Bloomberg\u2019s executive achievement, government experience, and impactful philanthropy.\u201d The former New York mayor will run the ad, which is titled \u201cJudge Him,\u201d across 26 states. Bloomberg has already spent more than $100 million on advertising, and that figure is expected to increase to between $300 million and $400 million by the time Super Tuesday states vote in early March. Good morning, live blog readers! Members of Congress have returned to Washington to resume work, but the impeachment of Donald Trump remains stalled, as House speaker Nancy Pelosi has still not transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Pelosi has delayed transmitting the articles in the hope of gaining leverage over the procedures adopted for the trial, but Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has shown no sign of allowing the strategy to affect his approach to impeachment. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has been trying to pressure McConnell to call White House advisers to testify during the trial, but the New York Democrat would need four Republican senators to join his cause to have that request approved. \u201cI hope, pray, and believe there\u2019s a decent chance that four Republicans will join us. If they do, we will have a fair trial,\u201d Schumer said yesterday. Pelosi could transmit the articles as soon as tomorrow, but it remains entirely unclear whether she will. Until then, Democrats and Republicans will continue to clash over a trial that currently lacks a timeline. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will participate in a credentialing ceremony for newly appointed ambassadors to Washington and have lunch with the vice president. Republican senator Josh Hawley is expected to introduce a resolution to dismiss the impeachment charges against Trump, but that seems unlikely to gain momentum. Progressive groups will hold a Washington protest calling for Trump\u2019s removal from office at 12 p.m. ET. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned.",

Featuring African American people in colourful costumes with Ku Klux Klan style hoods, the series provokes white audiences into thinking about racism. Black audiences often see the humour in the parody, says Foley, but that the hypothesis of the work is to provoke white audiences into imagining what it would be like to be the object of hatred. \u201cIt makes many of them uncomfortable\u201d, Foley says. \u201cI asked myself, what if the tables were turned? I wanted to provoke a conversation about racism.\u201d It\u2019s an important provocation in Australia where many people do not want to even acknowledge that racism is still culturally pervasive. Foley\u2019s most recent works relate to her interest in the experiences of Aboriginal people under the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 (QLD). She is particularly focused on the area around Maryborough, where she was born. Based on her PhD research into the connections between opium addiction and attempts to create a controllable Aboriginal workforce, the images reflect a deep understanding of the connections between addiction, control, assimilation and exploitation. Foley\u2019s tableau photography meanwhile speak to the control of Aboriginal people by the state through the \u201cProtector\u201d, such as portraits of Aboriginal women dressed in long white lace dresses who do not so much embrace the colonial garb but transform it, making it their own in a subversive act of defiance. Complementing these images are a series of curated tableaux recreating the interior of opium dens. Here, evoking the period, Foley positions the women in ways that reflect their position within that society: ornamental and subjugated, juxtaposed against the sleazy, unkempt masculinity of the space. When asked how it feels to have a \u201cmid-career\u201d retrospective, Foley gives a gentle, playful laugh. \u201cIt makes me feel old,\u201d she says. The Sydney festival exhibition is mostly focused on photography, but it is accompanied by a film, Out of the Sea Like Cloud. The film contains the sole surviving verse of an important Badtjala song, composed by Foley\u2019s ancestors about the passing of Cook\u2019s ship \u2013 unknown to them at the time but which would later have a cataclysmic effect on them \u2013 which they saw from an outcrop of land (a place that Cook would later call Indian Head). The retrospective takes its name from this song. Foley talks of her practice as taking the objects from her Badtjala culture and piecing them together like a jigsaw puzzle as she creates. This process, she says, allows for future generations of Badtjala people to continue to build the vibrancy and continuation of their culture. It\u2019s a vision her mother also had. \u201cMy mother devoted her life to her children\u2019s education,\u201d says Foley. \u201cAlong with my father, she worked shifts to support her family and she understood that if her children were educated, they were breaking the cycle of poverty and providing opportunities for the next generation.\u201d \u2022 Fiona Foley: Who are these strangers and where are they going? is showing at the National Art School from 10 January\u20138 February as part of the Sydney festival \u2022 This article was edited on 8 January 2020 to remove a confusing reference to No Shades of White, an exhibition in which the series HHH was shown",

      "bodyText": "The NSW Rural Fire Service says it will consult its members before deciding how to spend the extraordinary influx of bushfire donations, as it tries to weigh the intentions of those who have given money. The head of the RFS, Shane Fitzsimmons, said allocating the \u201cextraordinary\u201d influx of donations from the public, now into the tens of millions of dollars, would be a challenge for the organisation, but that it was a \u201cnice challenge to have\u201d. He pledged to spend the donations \u201cwhere it was intended\u201d, directing the money towards fire victims as well as the fire service itself. The RFS, which has been the main focus of donations in the wake of the bushfires, is primarily funded by the state government, as Michael Eburn, an expert in emergency management at the Australian National University, has noted. \u201cPeople should understand, before they make their donation, that fundamentally they are making a donation to the NSW government,\u201d Eburn wrote on Monday. The online fundraising campaign run by comedian Celeste Barber has alone raised more than $33m, which will be distributed, not only to the NSW\u2019s RFS, but its interstate equivalents, including Victoria\u2019s Country Fire Authority and South Australia\u2019s Country Fire Service. Millions more have flowed to the RFS through private donations and other fundraising efforts. Fitzsimmons said the depth and breadth of donations \u201creflects the best we\u2019ve got in humanity\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite extraordinary and extremely generous,\u201d he said. Fitzsimmons said the organisation did not yet know how it would spend the donations, and that allocating the additional money would be a challenge, \u201cbut a nice challenge to have\u201d. \u201cWe will consult with members, we will make sure we understand firstly, what was the intention behind people contributing to that fund: was it to go to disaster victims, was it to go to make better arrangements and better conditions for volunteers? We will need to target the money to where people intended it to go. \u201cWe need to make sure that we get something tangible, and we get some real benefit out of this, and we don\u2019t want to lose sight of the fact that that extraordinary generosity will make a massive difference.\u201d The amount committed to the NSW RFS donations fund has dwarfed the donations raised in previous years. The most recent donations fund annual report \u2013 from 2017-18 \u2013 showed gifts of $768,044 to the RFS, of which $546,000 was donated to individual brigades, and $222,000 to the central fund for distribution. The largest single donation was $25,000. The central donations fund exists \u201csolely for the purpose of supporting the volunteer-based fire and emergency service activities of the brigades\u201d. It is unclear how the money will, or could, be divided with other fire services or with bushfire victims, if it has been donated to the Trustee for NSW Rural Fire Service and Brigades Donations Fund. But the trust deed allows the trustees to disburse funds as recommended by the RFS executive committee. The service is also running dedicated fundraising appeals for the families of volunteer firefighters Samuel McPaul, Geoffrey Keaton and Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, killed fighting fires this bushfire season. The NSW RFS budget for this financial year is $424m, funded by the NSW state government. Writing in The Big Smoke Australia, Eburn said donating to the RFS was commendable given the vital work it performs, but stressed that the organisation was a government funded and run agency. \u201cThe RFS is not an organisation run by volunteers and funded by community donations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe RFS is not a volunteer organisation, it is a government organisation that relies on volunteers. \u201cNo doubt the trustees, the RFS, and brigades that benefit \u2026 and the trustees of the fund, will do their best to ensure that it is well spent to advance the RFS abilities in coming years but people should understand, before they make their donation, that fundamentally they are making a donation to the NSW government.\u201d In the wake of devastating fires in that state, the Victorian government has established a new government agency \u2013 Bushfire Recovery Victoria \u2013 to coordinate the state\u2019s fire recovery. The agency, headed by former police chief commissioner Ken Lay, has been given a budget of $50m. Lay said the new agency would work with local communities to guide their own recoveries. \u201cWhen disasters happen in local communities, the answers are generally in their community, so I\u2019ll be looking for local people to give local advice, local resources to address these issues.\u201d Premier Daniel Andrews asked those wanting to help not to donate clothing, goods, or food, but money to the state government-run bushfire appeal. \u201cI know it\u2019s tough to watch this all unfold and feel helpless. I know a lot of people want to get stuck in and lend a hand. But it\u2019s important to remember that the emergency relief effort is being run by experienced organisations, and they don\u2019t have space to sort or store donations. \u201cIf you want to help, please consider donating to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal. Every dollar raised will go towards immediate support for those who have lost everything. \u201cVictorians have been incredibly generous already. After just a few days, the appeal is sitting at $2m, and our government will match the current amount raised.\u201d",

Seven helicopters and two planes are working to combat the largest blaze, in the Waipatiki forest outside of Napier, with about 70 firefighters on the ground, Fire and Emergency said. Strong winds are exacerbating risky conditions, with thousands around the country also losing power due to damaged lines. Campers in some parts of Hawke\u2019s Bay have been warned to prepare for an evacuation if windy conditions persist through Tuesday. Fire and Emergency said it was \u201cconfident\u201d it had enough resources to battle the blazes, despite more than 150 New Zealand firefighters being stationed in Australia to face the unprecedented fire crisis there. On New Year\u2019s Day the lower half of the South Island was smothered in a thick layer of smoke from Australia, which saw the sky turn orange and visibility significantly reduced, as mountain ranges disappeared under a smoky grey fog, described as \u201capocalyptic\u201d by locals. Later in the week the smoke cloud moved further north, turning skies above Auckland vibrant orange, and the sun red. Although New Zealand has a much lower fire risk than Australia, research has shown the fire season in New Zealand could become longer and more intense due to climate change, with the frequency of high fire-risk days potentially doubling or tripling. Last year a number of places in New Zealand experienced their hottest year on record, including the Chatham Islands, Blenheim, Dunedin, Rotorua and Invercargill. In early 2019 a huge bushfire in Nelson spread to 2,000ha of land and caused 700 people to flee, while in 2017 the Port Hills fire destroyed nine houses and led to the death of one person. The rising scale of summer fires in New Zealand has led to fears the country is becoming more \u201cflammable\u201d.

The report by the Carbon Brief website found that renewable energy \u2013 from wind, solar, hydro and biomass projects \u2013 grew by 9% last year and was the UK\u2019s largest electricity source in March, August, September and December. The rise of renewables helped drive generation from coal and gas plants down by 6% from the year before, and 50% lower from the start of the decade. Meanwhile, the number of coal-free days has accelerated from the first 24-hour period in 2017 to 21 days in 2018 and 83 days last year.
