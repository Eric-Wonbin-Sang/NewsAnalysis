      "bodyText": "As the crisis escalates, here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s key events: - The doctor who tried to raise the alarm about coronavirus in the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan died after contracting the disease. Early reports of the death of Li Wenliang were retracted, only for the doctor to succumb later in the day - More than 28,000 people have now contracted the virus. The vast majority of cases are in China. Chinese state television today reported the death toll to have risen by 69 to 618 people. All deaths from the virus have so far been in mainland China with the exception of one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. - The number of cases in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, is now 22,112 - President Xi Jinping declared a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d against the virus as companies worldwide warned of the impact on business - Two docked cruise ships with thousands of passengers and crew members remained under 14-day quarantines in Hong Kong and Japan. Japan reported 10 more infections among passengers aboard the luxury cruise liner Diamond Princess, which is quarantined outside Yokohama - Hospitals in Wuhan said they were struggling to find enough beds for thousands of newly infected patients - There were warnings that Hong Kong\u2019s economy risked being plunged deeper into recession as the virus wrought havoc in the territory, with consumers panic-buying staple goods and airlines stopping flights - China\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, warned against \u201crumours and panic\u201d and called on the UK government to support. It is understood that police officers were used to seal off a section of the hospital in Derry tonight where a suspected case of coronavirus is being investigated. A mother and baby have been put into quarantine where they have been tested for symptoms of the virus. The hospital however remains open to all other patients with no one being discouraged to turn up to Altnagelvin. An Italian citizen has tested positive for coronavirus. The 29-year-old man was among the 56 Italians repatriated from Wuhan on Monday and quarantined at a military facility near Rome. Italy\u2019s higher health council confirmed that the man had tested positive for the virus and is being treated at Rome\u2019s Lazzaro Spallanzani institute for infectious diseases. This is the third confirmed coronavirus case in Italy. A Chinese couple, who arrived in Italy on 23 January, are also being treated at the Spallanzani hospital. An investigation at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, Northern Ireland, is under way tonight over a suspected case of coronavirus involving a mother and baby. It is understood that the mother and child recently returned to the city from Hong Kong and reported to Derry\u2019s main hospital A&amp;E department earlier today. Northern Ireland\u2019s Public Health Agency said they \u201care not commenting on individual cases at the moment\u201d. A spokesperson for the PHA said no cases had yet been diagnosed in Northern Ireland. As millions of Brazilians prepare to take to the streets for their country\u2019s annual carnival, Brazil\u2019s health minister has said his country currently has no specific plans for a coronavirus awareness campaign. But Luiz Henrique Mandetta has called on Brazilian revellers to exercise \u201crespiratory etiquette\u201d when the festivities kick off later this month. \u201cWhat we are suggesting is respiratory etiquette,\u201d he told reporters, according to the Valor Econ\u00f4mico newspaper, Brazil\u2019s answer to the FT. \u201cWash your hands several times a day; if you sneeze, put your elbow out in front.\u201d So far there have been no confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil, but health authorities are preparing themselves for its arrival. On what has been a day of fast-moving developments, here is a round-up of the key events from the Guardian\u2019s Sarah Boseley, Denis Campbell and Simon Murphy. My colleague Emma Graham-Harrison has written this profile of Li Wenliang and his role in raising the alarm about coronavirus. The whistleblowing Chinese doctor who tried to raise the alarm about the coronavirus outbreak died in the early hours of Friday, a Communist party-controlled newspaper has now confirmed. Li Wenliang, 34, was declared dead at 2.58am on Friday after \u201cemergency treatment\u201d at a hospital in Wuhan, the Global Times reported, following hours of confusion over the ill doctor\u2019s fate. Earlier reports of his death had triggered an outpouring of grief and anger in Chinese social media, with many hailing Li\u2019s decision to speak out over the virus despite the risks of doing so in his authoritarian country. The Global Times was among the heavily controlled state-run newspapers that stepped back from their initial reports of the ophthalmologist\u2018s death on Thursday. \u201cWe profoundly regret and mourn this death,\u201d the Wuhan City central hospital said in a brief statement on its official social media account. Tom Phillips, our Latin America correspondent, reports that two Brazilian air force jets are on their way to China to rescue a group of about 34 Brazilian citizens from the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. Brazil\u2019s state-run news agency, Agencia Brasil, says the planes are currently in Poland waiting for clearance from Chinese authorities to continue their flight to Wuhan. The delay is reportedly the result of the high number of international repatriation missions trying to fly into the Chinese city. Once back in Brazil those being evacuated from Wuhan will be placed in quarantine for 18 days at a military base in the city of An\u00e1polis, in Brazil\u2019s midwest. According to the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, Argentina has asked Brazil for help in evacuating 15 of its citizens. My colleague Mario Koran in Oakland reports that four of the 167 passengers aboard a quarantine flight from Wuhan to a Marine Corps air station near San Diego were sent to local hospitals shortly after their plane touched down yesterday morning. The San Diego Union-Tribune said that none of the American citizens returning to the US showed any symptoms when they boarded the flight, but medical screenings done after their arrival revealed that four people (three adults and one child) showed symptoms that may have been caused by the coronavirus that has caused 25,000 people worldwide to fall ill and killed nearly 500 in China. So far there have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus infection among the passengers; the most recent tally of confirmed cases includes six in California and 11 nationwide. The San Diego air station is one of three military bases in California being used as a quarantine site. Three additional bases outside California are also designated quarantine locations. While the common flu remains a more significant threat to public health in the United States, the novel nature of the coronavirus has fuelled global attention, writes the Union-Tribune. Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that experts are warning the travel restrictions issued by the Trump administration and quarantine of roughly 200 people in California \u2014 the first mass quarantine in the US in more than 50 years \u2014 may backfire. A quarantine can be counterproductive if it appears to be overly strict and broad and diminishes the public\u2019s trust in authorities, one expert told Sam Levin, adding that the government should use the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d options available and not \u201climit people\u2019s rights and liberty to a greater extent than is necessary\u201d. \u201cWe should do the utmost to protect public health. But we have to make sure the measures we\u2019re implementing aren\u2019t worse than the virus itself,\u201d Jennifer Nuzzo, the senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Levin. Good evening all. Hannah Mays here signing on. We have now updated our piece on Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who tried to raise the alarm about coronavirus and later contracted the disease. State media said earlier today that he had died, before backtracking on those reports. Travellers who have returned to the UK from a series of Asian countries in the last two weeks and are showing coronavirus symptoms should self-isolate and seek medical advice over the phone, the country\u2019s chief medical officer has warned in updated advice. People who have returned from locations including mainland China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia or Macau and are experiencing a cough, shortness of breath or fever are being advised to stay indoors and contact NHS 111. The Government advice says: \u201cThe UK chief medical officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath, to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild. \u201cThese countries have been identified because of the volume of air travel from affected areas, understanding of other travel routes and number of reported cases. This list will be kept under review.\u201d The circumstances of how or where the British national caught coronavirus in Singapore remain unknown. However, it does follow concerns being raised about at least three Asian businessmen catching the disease after attending a meeting of more than 100 international delegates at a hotel in the country. Other attendees are also showing symptoms of the disease, according to Reuters. The first British national has tested positive for coronavirus after travelling back to the UK from Singapore, according to government sources. It emerged earlier that a third case of the disease had been confirmed in the UK but England\u2019s chief medical officer refused to disclose the patient\u2019s nationality or specify which country in Asia they caught the disease. But the Guardian understands that the individual is British and contracted the coronavirus in Singapore. It comes after Downing Street indicated the patient was British, with a spokesman saying earlier they \u201cbelieved they are, yes\u201d. It follows an unnamed Chinese student from York University and his mother being diagnosed with the disease this week. The pair are being treated in Newcastle. There is now confusion surrounding earlier reports that Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who tried to raise the alarm about the coronavirus outbreak, had died. A Communist party-controlled newspaper, the Global Times, reported that Li had died earlier today \u2013 prompting outrage among many Chinese citizens. But the state-run newspaper subsequently deleted the report from its official Twitter account and has now claimed Li is still alive. \u201cLi Wenliang is currently in critical condition,\u201d the Global Times claimed in the early hours of Friday, local time. \u201cHis heart reportedly stopped beating at around 21:30. He was then given treatment with ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation],\u201d it added. A post on the official Weibo account of the hospital where Li was reportedly being treated also said he was \u201ccurrently in critical condition\u201d. The Department of Health and Social Care is yet to release its list of Asian countries where it is now advising people who have travelled to and developed symptoms on their return to the UK to immediately self-isolate and call NHS 111 for advice. Asked by the Guardian, the department says it is aiming to do so this evening. The list could include Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia, Philippines, Thailand, Nepal and Sri Lanka, where cases of coronavirus have been confirmed. According to the latest World Health Organzation figures, Japan, Thailand and Singapore all have the most number of cases in Asia outside China. Asked by the Guardian earlier whether the third confirmed case of coronavirus in the UK related to a British national, England\u2019s chief medical officer remained tight-lipped. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re all doctors, we have a pretty strong view on this and we\u2019re not going to do anything that\u2019s in any way going to identify people ... once you start, you don\u2019t stop,\u201d Prof Chris Whitty said. He was also challenged by another journalist who argued it was in the public interest to name the country in Asia where the patient had contracted the disease. Whitty replied: \u201cWhat\u2019s in the public interest is obviously for us to release the list of countries where we think there is actually potentially slightly greater risk than the rest of the world. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be doing later today.\u201d It\u2019s Simon Murphy here taking over the live blog after hot-footing it back from the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s press conference, at which England\u2019s chief medical officer revealed that the third person to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK caught the disease outside of China. Prof Chris Whitty also said the government was now advising people who had travelled to a number of as yet unspecified Asian countries and had returned to the UK and developed symptoms to immediately self-isolate and call NHS 111 for advice. Anyone displaying symptoms will be tested for the disease. The advice previously only related to those returning from Wuhan. Whitty said: \u201cWe knew this ratchet-up might well happen and this is the moment where we feel it\u2019s prudent, getting ahead of the epidemiology, to make this shift.\u201d He added: What we have got is a situation where very high risk remains in Wuhan and Hubei, a high risk in the rest of China, but much lower than in Wuhan and Hubei and then a much smaller risk in a number of countries, and unsurprisingly countries where the greatest risk is in terms of new cases are the ones which have the greatest international traffic with China, and that is exactly as you would expect.\u201d The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Dr Mike Ryan, the executive director of WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, answered some questions from the press. When asked to comment on the doctors and nurses striking in Hong Kong to protest the government\u2019s decision not to close its borders with mainland China, Ghebreyesus said: \u201cThis is a time of solidarity. There is a common enemy now. A very unknown virus. And I advise all of us to focus on the virus \u2013 the common enemy. \u201cI can understand the pressure on health workers and that\u2019s why Mike said they\u2019re the heroes. I fully agree and I want them to continue being like that.\u201d When asked if the world was nearing the peak of the outbreak, Ghebreyesus said: \u201cIt\u2019s too early right now to make predictions on numbers, although we are pleased it is the first day in which the overall numbers of new confirmed cases reported in China have dropped.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are still in the middle of an intense outbreak and we need to be very careful on making any predictions.\u201d The WHO press conference on the coronavirus has ended. Here are some key takeaways: As of 0500 GMT today, there are 28,060 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China and 564 deaths. Outside China, there are 225 cases in 24 countries and one death. WHO is asking for $675m to stop the outbreak. The organisation doesn\u2019t know the source of the outbreak, doesn\u2019t know what its natural reservoir is, nor does it properly understand its transmissibility or severity. There is also no vaccine to prevent infections nor antibiotics to treat patients. In the meantime, there are simple things everyone can do \u2013 such as washing hands regularly and covering your nose or your mouth with your elbow when you sneeze or cough \u2013 to help contain the outbreak. WHO called on countries to invest in prevention and research. The World Health Organization is bringing together global scientists to tackle the coronavirus. On 11 and 12 February the WHO is convening a global research and innovation forum to identify research priorities and coordinate an international effort into developing vaccines and medicines for the disease. WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced the event at a press conference on Thursday: \u201cWe\u2019re shadow boxing, we need to bring this virus out into the light so we can attack it properly.\u201d He also announced that Japan has donated $10m USD to go towards tackling the outbreak. The third person to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK contracted the disease outside of China, it has emerged. The patient, who it is understood was diagnosed in Brighton but is being transferred to a London hospital, did not contract the disease in the UK or mainland China but another country in Asia. The details have been confirmed by England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, who refused to disclose whether the individual was a British national or which specific country they contracted the disease in. Speaking about the new case, Whitty said: The person who caught this did not catch it in China, they caught it elsewhere in Asia. That\u2019s an important point from an epidemiological point of view because [...] there is now evidence of some limited transmission in a number of Asian countries. NHS doctors are being advised to widen the pool of countries to look out for returning individuals who display symptoms. Whitty explained: \u201cIf a doctor in the NHS sees a patient who has travelled from Asia, now they will start thinking about testing from a wider geographical area than would have been the case before. So we are shifting geography for NHS doctors to test.\u201d The countries will be confirmed later on Thursday. The Chinese doctor who tried to warn other medics about the coronavirus has been reported dead after contracting the infection in Wuhan. According to local media, Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist, died from the virus on Thursday. Li was summoned by police when he tried to warn others about the virus in December. He sent a message to fellow medics in a group chat on 30 December, and days later was summoned to the Public Security Bureau to sign a letter in which he was accused of making \u201cfalse comments\u201d. Li was one of eight people being investigated by police for \u201crumour-mongering\u201d. A virus expert has said it is \u201cnot surprising\u201d that a third case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the UK, as the infection has spread across China and could infect more people returning from the country. Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said: It isn\u2019t surprising that a third case has been identified. Whilst most infections are focused in Wuhan and the Hubei province, the virus has spread to all regions of China and therefore the likelihood of someone returning or visiting the UK with an infection has been real. He said the overall number of infections in the UK was still low and crucially therehad not been any significant human-to-human transmission. He added: We are at a key juncture in this outbreak and it is difficult to tell if the control efforts in China will be enough to bring this outbreak to an end. If not, we can expect to see the virus cropping up in many parts of the world, including here. Meanwhile, Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading, said: The important thing is that it did not arise within the country. It didn\u2019t come from the two cases that are already here but came from outside. It has been identified quickly, it has been isolated, and in all probability, it will not lead to any further cases generally. Two more coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 30. One of the new patients is a close contact of one of those previously confirmed to have the virus, while the other has no recent travel history to mainland China and does not appear to be linked with previous cases, the Straits Times reports. The previously confirmed cases were all either Chinese nationals from Hubei, or individuals with links to travellers who are Chinese nationals. All UK hospitals have been told to prepare secure coronavirus zones to \u201cavoid a surge\u201d in emergency departments, a leaked NHS letter has shown. The letter, dated 31 January, tells hospitals to set up \u201ccoronavirus priority assessment pods\u201d, which can be decontaminated after each use. All chief executives and medical directors are instructed to have the pods up and running by Friday 7 February. Prof Keith Willett, who is leading the NHS\u2019s response to coronavirus, told NHS bosses in the letter: \u201cPlans have been developed to avoid a surge in emergency departments due to coronavirus. Although the risk level in this country remains moderate, and so far there have been only two confirmed cases, the NHS is putting in place appropriate measures to ensure business as usual services remain unaffected by any further cases or tests of coronavirus. Trusts are being asked to organise a coronavirus priority assessment pod, which will mean people with symptoms indicative of infection will get quick assessment, while other patients also continue to get appropriate care.\u201d Since the letter was written a third coronavirus case has been confirmed in the UK. A third person in the UK has tested positive for the coronavirus, it has been confirmed. The patient was diagnosed in Brighton, the Guardian understands, and is being transferred to an infectious diseases unit in a London hospital. Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said: A further patient has tested positive for coronavirus bringing the total number of cases in the UK to three. The individual did not acquire this in the UK. The patient is being transferred to a specialist NHS centre, and we are using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus. The NHS is well prepared to manage these cases and we are now working quickly to identify any contacts the patient has had. There have been two other confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK - an unnamed Chinese student from York University and his mother, who are being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. The University of York has said the student confirmed to have contracted the virus did not come into contact with other students. China is not prepared for the scale of the coronavirus outbreak it is facing, but has mobilised the entire country to tackle the epidemic, Beijing\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, has said. Answering questions from the media this morning, Liu said: I can\u2019t say China is prepared for this outbreak, we don\u2019t have enough beds or hospitals. That\u2019s why we have built two emergency hospitals in just ten days. He added that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had held a meeting yesterday in which he had instructed medical personnel to work \u201caround the clock\u201d to treat patients. Liu said he could understand the complaints of some residents in locked-down Wuhan, but said it would take some time for them to understand the urgency of the situation. He offered reassurances that all residents\u2019 basic necessities were being provided for. He stressed the rest of China was not in the same locked-down state as the Hubei province, but said some local authorities might have overreacted in their responses to the outbreak. Finally, he said that communication between Xi and Boris Johnson was good, contrary to reports this morning which suggested there were concerns the prime minister had not sent a personal message of support over the coronavirus outbreak. The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, warned against \u201crumours and panic\u201d and called on the UK government to support to support China in its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. It is of hope that governments of all countries, including the UK, should understand and support China\u2019s efforts, avoid overreaction, avoid creating panic, and ensure normal cooperation and exchanges between countries. Some [media] reports are biased and even maintain malicious slander and disinformation. Rumours and panic are more frightening than the virus itself. He defended China\u2019s handling of the outbreak, saying the country had been \u201copen, transparent and responsible with its cooperation with the world\u201d. He emphasised that any impact on China\u2019s economy would be temporary and said the country disapproved of some travel and trade restrictions that had been imposed by other nations. Finally he condemned \u201cinsulting and discriminatory behaviour targeting the overseas Chinese community\u201d fed by panic over the virus. Virgin Atlantic has extended the suspension of its flights between Heathrow and Shanghai due to the coronavirus until 28 March. A spokesman for the airline said: We continue to monitor the coronavirus situation very carefully, including the latest guidance from the World Health Organization and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), which on Tuesday issued new guidance to UK citizens to leave China if they are able to do so. Given this new FCO advice, the increasing entry restrictions on recent visitors to mainland China, and our rigorous focus on safety, Virgin Atlantic has opted to extend the suspension of Heathrow-Shanghai operations until 28 March 2020. They said all passengers booked to travel would receive the option of a refund. They should contact the customer care team via their SMS messaging system on +44 (0)7481 339184. Countries across the globe, including the US, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, continue to impose travel restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Saudi Arabia has announced it is banning its citizens from visiting China, and said expatriates will not be allowed to return to the country if they violate the travel restriction. The kingdom\u2019s General Directorate of Passports also said regulatory provisions on travel documents would be applied to citizens who travel to the coronavirus-hit country. The US is temporarily barring entry to foreign nationals who have travelled to China within the last 14 days, while Japan is refusing entry to foreign nationals who have been to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, within the past fortnight. More than 140 Russians have been evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, to a medical facility in Siberia guarded by members of Russia\u2019s National Guard. Inside, many have taken to Instagram to blog their time in quarantine, snapping photos of their dinner and exercise routines. Pavel Lichman, a model who was evacuated from Wuhan, told the Guardian: The quarantine is pretty hands-off and easy. The only thing is that we\u2019re not allowed to come into contact with the people who are in the neighbouring rooms. We don\u2019t leave our rooms. They bring us food. Doctors come in to test us: check our temperatures, inspect our throats, and measure the amount of oxygen in our blood. If the evacuees leave their rooms, doctors warned, the two-week countdown starts again. In the other rooms, Russians took stock of the bizarre turn of events and planned out their time in lockdown. \u201cPlans for the next two weeks,\u201d one young woman wrote, while firing up a Netflix documentary about the rapper Travis Scott. Another modelled her striped pyjamas on a balcony overlooking a snowy forest of birch. Student Marina Zaitseva was visiting Wuhan when the outbreak occurred. In an interview with the Fontanka.ru website, she described a difficult evacuation from China aboard a military plane with little idea of where they were headed. When they arrived at the medical facility, they were told to give up their clothing for disinfecting. She said: In the hall we were met by people not just in masks, but in full bodysuits. They met us as though we were radiating this virus. The US is continuing to fly hundreds of its citizens out of Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, in what it anticipates to be the last of its chartered flights. On Wednesday, two planes flew 350 citizens back to an air force base in California, and two more flights will arrive from Wuhan this week. The US does not anticipate any further chartered flights after this. Other countries are also airlifting their nationals from the area, including Singapore, which is arranging a second evacuation flight for later this week. The Britons who were evacuated from Wuhan last week have been told they can leave the quarantine facility in the Wirral next Thursday. Matt Raw, who was one of 83 British nationals airlifted out of Wuhan on the first evacuation flight, received the news last night: We have just been advised that we are permitted to leave here on Thursday 13 February. We\u2019ve basically done half our time and as long as the status quo remains and nobody gets sick, then we should be able to leave in a week\u2019s time from now. It\u2019s excellent news to have an end date in sight. Another 11 Britons were evacuated on a French-chartered flight on Sunday, after many failed to make it to the airport in time for the first flight. They are being kept in quarantine separately from those on the first. Chinese officials are reportedly \u201cconcerned\u201d that Boris Johnson has not yet sent a personal message of support to the country over the coronavirus outbreak. Stanley Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s father, met the Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming on Tuesday, and reported back to UK officials \u2013 and accidentally copied in the BBC. The email, to the environment minister Zac Goldsmith and other UK officials, said: Re the outbreak of coronavirus, Mr Liu obviously was concerned that there had not yet \u2013 so he asserted \u2013 been direct contact between the PM and Chinese head of state or government in terms of a personal message or telephone call. A government spokesman said the UK had been in close contact with the Chinese authorities since the outbreak. A former special adviser to the World Health Organization has said he thinks researchers are \u201cweeks away\u201d from testing a coronavirus vaccine on animals, but it could be months before human trials. Speaking on Sky News this morning, David Harper said: \u201cThe researchers around the world are working very hard. \u201cWe feel that we\u2019re within a matter of weeks of the animal tests that are necessary before we go into the trials of the vaccine in humans, which could take some months of course, but still very much shorter than we would normally expect for a vaccine of this type.\u201d A former World Health Organization official who helped lead the response to SARS has said \u201cthe full potential\u201d of the coronavirus is not yet known. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, David Heyman, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene, said: The full potential of this virus is not yet known. Will this virus become a virus which is endemic in humans and continue to transmit in the coming years? We don\u2019t understand the spectrum of the disease. We don\u2019t know how many infections are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms like cold, so it is impossible to identify all cases. He said the disease is spread via droplets, when people are in a close enough area that they can cough on each other, and there is no evidence to suggest it is transmissible over longer distances. A British man who is among 3,700 people under a coronavirus quarantine on a cruise ship in Japan has voiced concerns over ongoing monitoring for the disease on board. David Abel, from Northamptonshire, has praised Princess Cruises for its handling of the situation so far, but said fears remain about efforts to fight the disease on the ship. \u201cWhat health checks have we had in the last three or four days, or since the health check when the quarantine officers came on board? None whatsoever,\u201d Abel said in a Facebook video post. There has been no health check, so we do not know whether there are people on board still who have got symptoms that may have the virus. We do not know. So I am now getting a fraction concerned about the health checks that I believe should be taking place, because if there are more infected people on board they should be taken off. We want a virus-free ship. Health workers in the port city of Yokohama said on Thursday that 10 more people on the Diamond Princess had tested positive to the disease, in addition to 10 others on Wednesday when the ship was first isolated. Those 20 people are receiving treatment at nearby hospitals while the remaining passengers are confined to their cabins. Abel, who along with his wife are believed to be the only two Britons on board, added: \u201cAnd what happens when we finally get back to the UK? Are we going to be put in quarantine yet again for another 14 days?\u201d It is thought the Foreign Office has offered support, but is letting cruise ship staff manage the situation. China has announced it will halve tariffs on $75bn worth of US goods, as the country\u2019s economy comes under additional pressure amid the coronavirus outbreak. Tariffs on some goods will be cut from to from 10% to 5%, and from 5% to 2.5% on others. The announcement is part of a partial resolution of the long-running trade war between the US and China agreed last month, and the US will also roll back some tariffs as part of the agreement. The cuts will take effect on 14 February, but tariffs will remain on $35bn worth of US goods. China\u2019s economy has suffered as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, with factories across the country closed and its manufacturing sector seeing a drop in production. This is Jessica Murray taking over from Alison to track the latest developments with the coronavirus outbreak throughout the day. Global health experts have warned that \u201chidden\u201d coronavirus cases mean that we could just be seeing the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d. Tom Frieden, a former director at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there could be \u201cvastly more cases\u201d than previously thought. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that containment is very unlikely,\u201d Frieden said. \u201cIt probably isn\u2019t worth giving up, but trying to contain Wuhan coronavirus like Sars and Mers is very unlikely, just because of the number of cases and the number of [Chinese] provinces and the ease with which it is ease spreading in families.\u201d He added: It\u2019s a fog of war reality, which is what makes me suspect that what are seeing is the tip of the iceberg. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far today about the spread of the coronavirus. China\u2019s death toll grew to 563, with 28,018 confirmed cases Ten more people have been diagnosed with the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, moored at Yokohama in Japan Canada has told its citizens to leave China by commercial means if their presence in the country is \u201cnot essential\u201d Taiwan has banned all international cruise ships from docking Adidas has closed China stores over virus outbreak Virgin Australia has announced it will cease flying to Hong Kong Shares have risen strongly again on Asian markets Here\u2019s the latest tracker image from Johns Hopkins University on the spread of the coronavirus. If you want to check in on the tracker, you can find it here. A 28-year-old doctor in Hunan province has died after working for 10 days on the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese state media is reporting. As we have reported today, the death doll in China for the coronavirus has passed 560. You can find our latest full report on the story here. For a further exploration of why stock markets are surging ahead despite the prospect of a marked slowdown in China (see this blog post), look no further than this piece by our economics editor Larry Elliott. But he asks whether the outbreak is the kind of freakish, unforeseen event that could yet spark a global economic crisis \u2013 a \u201cblack swan\u201d event in the market parlance. Hong Kong\u2019s economy faces a deepening recession as a result of the virus outbreak. Businesses in the territory have already been hit hard by months of sometimes violent street protests that have forced shops to close and transport to shut down. The economy shrank 1.2% last year and economists at Fitch Solutions reckon it will contract by 2.6% this year with the vital retail sector brought ot its knees as the lucrative flow of Chinese tourists dries up thanks to the government\u2019s new quarantine rules and airlines suspend flights in and out. The sense of crisis has been heightened by panic buying in shops and supermarkets. Read my full report here: China\u2019s People\u2019s Daily is reporting the drug Remdesivir is \u201cofficially\u201d in clinical trial stage on coronavirus patients in Wuhan\u2019s Jinyintan hospital. \u201cThe trial will include 453 critically ill patients and 308 with less severe symptoms, a medical expert said,\u201d the China Daily reported. A couple of Canadian readers in China have got in touch with me to say the Canadian consular service in Beijing is advising Canadians to leave China at their own cost if their presence is not essential. \u201cPlease note that the Travel Advice and Advisory for China has recently been updated to indicate: If your presence in China isn\u2019t essential, you should consider leaving by commercial means,\u201d the advisory says, dated 6 February. The government previously chartered a flight from Wuhan to Canada for Canadian citizens looking to return to Canada. The coronavirus is having a significant impact on sports events. Last week the Chinese Football Association cancelled all domestic games at all levels. Many other events are also being affected: Athletics: The World Athletics Indoor Championships, which had been scheduled for Nanjing from March 13-15, were postponed until next year The Asian Athletics Association cancelled its 12-13 February indoor championships in Hangzhou. Football: Asian Champions League matches involving Chinese clubs Guangzhou Evergrande, Shanghai Shenhua and Shanghai SIPG have been postponed. Guangzhou and the Shanghai clubs will join the competition in April, with their group matches due to be played in May. Shanghai Shenhua and Shanghai SIPG were due to play away at Perth Glory and Sydney FC but Australian officials sought to reschedule matches after their government imposed a travel ban on foreign nationals arriving from China. A four-team women\u2019s Olympic qualifying tournament involving China, Australia, Taiwan and Thailand was moved from Wuhan and rearranged to be held in Australia by the AFC. Vietnam\u2019s government said it would not allow the country to host sporting events in February, meaning home AFC Cup group stage matches for Ho Chi Minh City and Than Quang Ninh will have to be switched to away fixtures. Ho Chi Minh City will now face Yangon United in Myanmar on 11 February while Than Quang Ninh meet Ceres Negros on 25 February in the Philippines. Car racing: The all-electric Formula E motor racing series abandoned plans for a race in Sanya on 21 March. The move puts Formula One in the spotlight, with Shanghai due to host the Chinese Grand Prix on 19 April, now looking in doubt. Badminton: The China Masters tournament in Hainan due to take place 25 February-1 March, was postponed after several players withdrew. The BWF said it hoped the flagship Badminton Asia Championships could still go ahead in Wuhan from 21-26 April. Boxing The International Olympic Committee announced Jordan as hosts of the boxing qualifiers for Asia and Oceania after an event in Wuhan was cancelled. It will now take place in Amman, 3-11 March. Basketball The International Basketball Federation moved the 6-9 February Tokyo Olympics qualifiers to be held in Foshan to Belgrade. The FIBA Asia Cup 2021 qualifying match between China and Malaysia, to be held in Foshan on 24 February, will be rescheduled. Golf The elite women\u2019s LPGA golf tour cancelled the 5-8 March Blue Bay tournament to be held on Hainan. The PGA Tour Series-China moved its 25-28 February global qualifying tournament to Lagoi, Indonesia, from Haikou. Stock markets continue to shrug off the deepening crisis with the Nikkei up a whopping 2.6% with less than an hour of trading to go while Seoul had also gained a healthy 2.55%. Hong Kong was even better, up 2.71%, and Shanghai was up 1.3%. In Sydney, the Australian bourse rallying to its second highest close of all time. The ASX200 was paused at 7,047 points, a rise of 1% on the day and only 43 points off the record high set back in January. Nguyen Trinh, senior economist for emerging Asia at the investment bank Natixis in Hong Kong, said investors were obviously expecting that the disruption seen across China would be temporary and that the policy response by China and Asian central banks would be enough to inject into markets much-needed liquidity. However, she noted that commodities had seen a more turbulent few weeks with oil, for example, down more than 10% for the year. She said: The commodity market is much more aggressive in pricing in a reduction of activity with iron ore, copper, oil, soy beans all dropping more than double digits. Reuters is reporting that a small town in central Canada is preparing to for the arrival of some 200 evacuees from Wuhan. Canada plans to fly the evacuees to the base in Trenton, Ontario, the country\u2019s main military hub for air transport, and hold them in quarantine for two weeks. The evacuees, who are expected to arrive from China on Friday, will be separated from each other and from others on the base, although family units will be kept together, the government has said. They will all stay at Yukon Lodge, a new facility on the base which resembles a small chain hotel. Individuals will only be moved to a hospital if they require acute care, said the local health authority, but local hospitals were prepared, with 21 negative-pressure rooms at four of them. \u201cI was in the military, I know how it works,\u201d said resident Joyce Aucoin, 81. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be people upset about it but once they\u2019re here and once they\u2019re settled and they see what\u2019s going on, I think it will all pass.\u201d Lynn Cao, 60, who owns a tobacco shop in the town, had been concerned about the plane arriving until she received reassuring emails from friends on the base. Cao said she was more anxious about her mother and sister, who live near the Chinese capital Beijing, and had sent them a large number of face masks to limit their chances of infection. The Chinese CGTN network has reported the criteria for patients being admitted to Wuhan\u2019s three new temporary hospitals, including at the city\u2019s international convention centre. They include: People infected with #coronavirus Clinical manifestation that is mild Patients aged 18-65 who are able to take care of themselves Patients with no respiratory diseases, no cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and no psychosis Influenza-virus tested negative The Chinese state tabloid Global Times has published a video showing police monitoring people who are not wearing face masks and telling them to go home and get their masks. The outlet is also reporting that a new laboratory has been built in five days that will have the capacity to carry out 10,000 coronavirus tests per day. In case you missed it yesterday, schools in China\u2019s financial hub of Shanghai have been ordered to stay shut until at least the end of February. Taiwan\u2019s health authority banned all international cruise ships from docking at the island from Thursday amid increasing threat of the coronavirus outbreak, after 10 more people were tested positive for the virus on a quarantined cruise liner in Japan, Reuters is reporting. Taiwan has also said it will suspend entry for all Chinese citizens who live in mainland China from Thursday. Reuters has reported that the Shanghai sports authorities have recommended the suspension of all sporting events in the city due to the coronavirus outbreak, casting further doubt on whether the Chinese Formula One Grand Prix will take place. The fourth grand prix of the season is scheduled for 19 April. The race was expected to be on the agenda at a Formula One Strategy Group meeting on Wednesday amid increasing speculation that it could join the growing list of sports events already postponed or cancelled. The Shanghai Sports General Association called on sports organisers to \u201cstrictly abide by the requirement of the Shanghai Sports Bureau to stop organising sports events during the epidemic.\u201d It said, in a statement translated by Reuters, that all sports events should be suspended \u201cuntil the epidemic is over.\u201d Some Formula One insiders hold out little hope of the race happening. I\u2019ve done a number of posts about the cruise ship in Japan, but passengers on the World Dream, quarantined in Hong Kong\u2019s Kai Tak terminal, with 3,600 people aboard, are also being screened for the virus after three passengers on a previous voyage were diagnosed with the virus. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, has announced that the Ocean and Kai Tak cruise liner terminals, will be closed. Lam has also ordered that anyone arriving from mainland China from Saturday, will be forced to face \u201ccompulsory quarantine\u201d for 14 days in Hong Kong. Associated Press have just published a list of global infections from the virus. Macau: 10 Taiwan: 11 Hong Kong: 21 Japan: 45 Singapore: 28 Thailand: 25 South Korea: 23 Australia: 14 Germany: 12 United States: 11 Malaysia: 10 Vietnam: 10 France: 6 United Arab Emirates: 5 Canada: 4 India: 3 Philippines: 3 cases, including 1 death Russia: 2 Italy: 2 Britain: 2 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Spain: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 In the United States, another 350 American evacuees from Wuhan have been placed under quarantine at two military bases in California, Reuters reports. It brings to nearly 400 the number of people subject to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s first public health quarantine in 50 years. \u201cWe are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary to try to prevent the spread here,\u201d said Dr Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. There were long queues in supermarket across Hong Kong last night, with people panic buying toilet rolls and tissues, largely due to a rumour spreading online saying China will stop manufacturing toilet paper for the next two weeks. There was also a run on vitamins, rice and packet noodles, leaving supermarket shelves empty. Adidas has announced it is closing a \u201csignificant\u201d number of its stores in China over the deadly new coronavirus, and warned it expects further impacts on its operations in the country. It follows a similar move by its US rival Nike, Agence France Presse reports. Adidas has around 500 of its own stores in China and some 11,500 outlets in franchise stores. The German sports wear giant said many of its franchise stores were also closing. \u201cWe can confirm that we are currently experiencing a negative impact on our operations in China,\u201d the statement added. \u201cHowever, at this point in time it is too early to assess the magnitude of this impact.\u201d Nike on Tuesday also said it expected the worsening outbreak of the virus to have \u201ca material impact\u201d on its Chinese business. Here are some of the pictures emerging from the operation to hospitalise infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. The Chinese city of Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi province, will strictly monitor the entry and exit of residents from villages and residential compounds as it steps up its efforts to control the spread of a coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports. The city, which has a population of 5 million people, said on its official Weibo social media account that each family should assign one member to go out once every two days, and that people running fevers must go to a medical facility. Jiangxi province is separated from the virus epicentre of Hubei by the Yangtze river. It had reported 600 infections of the coronavirus by the end of Wednesday, with no fatalities. We are getting confirmation of the nationalities of the 10 new cases of coronavirus on the stricken cruise ship on Japan. The Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, says there are four Japanese, two each from the US and Canada, and one each from New Zealand and Taiwan. Virgin Australia has announced it will cease flights from Australia to Hong Kong because the route was \u201cno longer a commercially viable\u201d Sydney-Hong Kong flights will stop on 2 March. In November, the airline announced the Melbourne-Hong Kong route would stop on 11 February. The airline said growing uncertainty over the coronavirus outbreak and the decline due to civil unrest associated with the pro-democracy protests had prompted the move. Virgin Australia Group chief commercial officer, John MacLeod said: \u201cHong Kong has continued to be a challenging market. With a decline in demand following ongoing civil unrest, and growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak in the wider region, we have made the decision to withdraw services. \u201cWhile the decision to withdraw from the Hong Kong market has been a difficult one, it demonstrates our strong focus on driving greater financial discipline through our network. \u201cCurrent circumstances demonstrate that Hong Kong is no longer a commercially viable route for Virgin Australia to continue operating, however international tourism remains an important part of our strategy through our other international routes and partner airlines,\u201d MacLeod said. Still in Australia, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison has said a further 36 citizens and residents who left Wuhan on the Air New Zealand flight have now been transferred to Christmas Island, where other Australian evacuees from Wuhan are being held in quarantine for 14 days. You can read our full report on evacuees on Christmas Island below. Australia\u2019s universities are going to come under financial pressure in coming weeks when classes start but Chinese students are unable to attend due to the coronavirus crisis, ratings agency S&amp;P says. Students from mainland China are about 38% of tertiary enrolments, S&amp;P says. International students are worth $11.3bn a year in fees, so that puts as much as $4.3bn in revenue at risk. S&amp;P says universities can\u2019t easily cut costs, such as staff wages and building maintenance, to offset the potential revenue plunge. \u201cThe health crisis underscores the risks that stem from the sector\u2019s growing dependence on the lucrative international market, which has flourished against a backdrop of stagnant government funding and heavy investment in the pursuit of higher rankings,\u201d the agency said. S&amp;P also says German carmaker Volkswagen stands to take the biggest hit from factory shutdowns in Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, because it makes almost 40% of its cars and components in China. \u201cWhile the Chinese market maintains its long-term attraction for most global auto manufacturers and suppliers, recent developments may contribute to turning 2020 into an ever more challenging year for global automakers and suppliers than we originally expected,\u201d analyst Vittoria Ferraris said. One Guardian reader in Shandong province, who is a teacher, has got in touch with me to say there\u2019s confusion among UK citizens there about the British foreign office\u2019s advice to leave China if they can. \u201cMy main hesitation with leaving China is I feel I would be more likely to contract the virus whilst in transit to the UK than if I stay in my apartment and wait for things to calm down here. \u201cMy school is closed until at least the 17th of February (our classes have moved online) and I leave the apartment only for supplies and some exercise / fresh air. Whereas travelling to the UK would mean having to go on a train, tube and through at least two airports,\u201d she says. The 10 newly diagnosed Diamond Princess passengers include four Japanese nationals, the health ministry said on Thursday morning. The nationalities of the other six were not immediately available. The 10 patients comprise five people in their 70s, four in their 60s and one in his or her 50s, the ministry said. Shares have risen strongly again on Asian markets where there appears to be more confidence \u2013 helped by another strong day on Wall Street \u2013 that the economic impact of the new coronavirus will not be too damaging. The ASX200 is up 0.55% in Sydney, the Nikkei has surged 1.6% in Tokyo and Seoul has gained 1.27%. Brent crude rose $1.32 yesterday to $55.28 a barrel. On the other side of the ledger, there is more evidence of how companies are being affected by the spread of the virus. Cathay Pacific has asked its entire workforce of 27,000 to take up to three weeks of unpaid leave. It said on Tuesday that it was cutting 30% of its capacity in the coming weeks. Adidas has announced that it is shutting a \u201csignificant\u201d number of its 500 stores in China. Foxconn, which manufactures the Apple iPhone, said it had applied to the Chinese authorities to restart operations at factories in China next week but it could take one to two weeks from then to resume full production due to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reported, quoting a source with knowledge of the matter. However, a full resumption was not possible until late February due to various travel restrictions imposed to curb the virus. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has just interviewed an Australian passenger on the stranded Diamond Princess cruise liner in Yokohama, where 10 more people were diagnosed with coronavirus on the ship (in addition to 10 diagnosed on Wednesday). Vera Koslova said frustration amongst passengers was rising: \u201cThere\u2019s been no announcements made as yet by the captain to let us know that there has been more cases.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m quite patient and have a very positive attitude and know that the Australian government is trying to do everything possible as well as Japan. But, um, just getting a just a little bit more nervous now,\u201d she said. Qantas says it\u2019s suspended a union delegate for telling employees it\u2019s not safe to work on flights from China amid the coronavirus outbreak, Australian Associated Press reports (below). Qantas says an employee has been stood down for spreading misinformation about the safety of working on flights from China amid the coronavirus outbreak, but the Transport Workers\u2019 Union (TWU) says the man was simply providing advice to colleagues on their rights. The airline on Saturday announced it would suspend its two direct services to mainland China from 9 February due to travel restrictions imposed by other countries in the wake of the health crisis. A Qantas employee \u2013 who is also a delegate of the TWU \u2013 was on Sunday stood down pending an investigation. A source has told AAP the worker told other employees it was not safe to work on flights arriving from China \u2013 going against the advice of health authorities. Employees have been provided with additional safety equipment. Qantas Medical\u2019s Dr Russell Brown said the airline would never ask employees to work in unsafe conditions. \u201cThe TWU knows full well that the risk of aviation workers contracting coronavirus as a result of working on an aircraft originating from China is very low,\u201d Dr Brown said in a statement on Thursday. Just back to the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship moored off Yokohama ... the Guardian\u2019s Justin McCurry in Tokyo says health officials now have the results of 102 tests conducted on 273 passengers. A total of twenty were positive. He says the second group of patients found to have been infected will be taken to hospitals in Kanagawa prefecture, where Yokohama is located, according to the health ministry. Just while we are on Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific announced on Wednesday that all 27,000 employees would be asked to take three weeks of unpaid leave over the coming months. The CEO, Augustus Tang, said the airline was facing a crisis in the wake of the virus outbreak. \u201cI am hoping all of you will participate, from our frontline employees to our senior leaders, and share in our current challenges,\u201d Tang said in a video message posted online. Months of pro-democracy protests, including sit-ins at Hong Kong\u2019s international airport, had already taken a toll on the airline. In his video message to employees, Tang warned Cathay was experiencing \u201cone of the most difficult Chinese New Year holidays we have ever had\u201d because of the virus. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know how long it will last,\u201d he added. \u201cWith such an uncertain outlook, preserving our cash is now the key to protecting our business.\u201d He also warned that further steps may need to be taken. The airline has already reduced its flights to the Chinese mainland by 90%. This week United Airlines announced it was suspending all flights to Hong Kong from 8-20 February, days after it cut its flights to mainland China. American airlines also announced it was suspending its flights to Hong Kong form Dallas/Fort Worth and and Los Angeles until 20 February. Given the speed at which this story is moving, keeping track of global figures for the virus is quite a challenge. The Hong Kong government has set up a tracker of cases there \u2013 you can find it here, and I have put a snapshot below, which shows 1 death, 21 confirmed cases, 154 cases hospitalised under investigation and 868 cases ruled out. Interestingly the tracker also gives a geographic location for all cases. Australian evacuees from Wuhan have arrived on Christmas Island where they will be quarantined before being allowed to return to their homes. One of our reporters, Ben Doherty, is on Christmas Island and he has filed this on the arrival of the evacuees. The national health commissions figures for China with regards to the virus have now been released and the headline figures are that as of midnight Wednesday into Thursday, there were 28,018 confirmed cases and 563 deaths in China. It says there are 24,702 suspected cases. A total of 282,813 close contacts have been traced, and 186,354 close contacts are still in medical observation. Of the deaths in the past 24 hours, of the 73 new deaths recorded, 70 were in Hubei Province, and one each in Tianjin, Heilongjiang, and Guizhou. The vast majority of new infections were also in (Hubei 2,987 out of 3,694). The Japanese broadcaster NHK is citing the health ministry saying there are 10 new cases of coronavirus on the Diamond Princess, moored off Yokohama. If the new infections are confirmed, that would bring the total number of coronavirus patients in Japan to 45, Reuters says. The ship was caught up in the global coronavirus epidemic after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man tested positive for the virus after disembarking the ship late last month. Passengers and their relatives took to social media to detail their predicament and conditions on the cruise ship. One passenger has tweeted a number of photos below. We\u2019re getting reports that another 10 people have tested positive for coronavirus onboard the cruise ship that is currently moored off Japan. On Wednesday, it was confirmed that 10 people on board the Diamond Princess had tested positive, prompting authorities to instruct all passengers to remain inside their cabins. Thousands of people on the Diamond Princess face spending the next fortnight stuck off the Japanese port of Yokohama, as officials attempt to prevent further infection. I\u2019ll bring you more details on this as soon as they come in. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, with me Alison Rourke. New death toll figures are beginning to emerge from Hubei on the latest death toll from the coronavirus. The province has reported 70 new deaths, taking fatalities there to 549. It also reported 2,987 new confirmed cases taking cases in Hubei to 19,665. These figures will be updated again when the national total is announced, but for the moment that brings the the death toll in China to 563. Total numbers of confirmed infections in China are over 28,000. Here\u2019s summary of the other key points so far: Chinese authorities say they face a \u201csevere\u201d shortage of hospital beds Global cases have been reported in 20 countries Tokyo\u2019s Olympics chief executive said organisers were \u201cextremely worried about how the virus could affect this year\u2019s games All arrivals to Hong Kong from mainland China will face \u201ccompulsory quarantine\u201d You can get up to date with all our latest coverage here and guide to how to protect yourself from the virus here.

A late, late goal exposed them once more, eliminated from the Copa del Rey in the week in which their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/lionel-messi-barcelona-eric-abidal-patience-snapped\" title=\"\">captain publicly called out their sporting director</a>, divisions coming to the surface, civil war declared, the collapse complete. Lionel Messi had accused Eric Abidal of \u201cdirtying\u201d the players. Here, offered the chance to make a point with their play, they did so themselves. \u201cTalk to me about the football, please,\u201d their coach, Quique Seti\u00e9n, said before this game but, when it came to the football, it was not much better. There was no hiding place on the field. At San Mam\u00e9s their players were thrown to the lions again. And what awaits them now may be even worse.</p> <p>A 94th-minute goal from I\u00f1aki Williams defeated Barcelona in the quarter-final of the Copa del Rey. Obviously they will not win the cup but it takes a leap of faith to believe they will win anything at all. The crisis continues, deeper now. It is institutional but it is sporting, too. Though Unai Sim\u00f3n saved Athletic a couple of times, Barcelona could not really claim they deserved better. They could have won but they could also have been beaten sooner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/real-madrid-sociedad-copa-del-rey-match-report\">Real Madrid dumped out by Real Sociedad in Copa del Rey thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Away from home their results are calamitous, their vulnerability painfully clear, with one coach or the other. There is little to hold on to, little to believe in \u2013 maybe, horrible though it is to hear, not even Messi. For so long they have relied on him to rescue them; here it looked as if he might again. But instead there was impotence, frustration, the smell of failure. At the final whistle the Argentinian held his head in his hands, wearing an all too familiar face. He had the chance to win it \u2013 to win the argument \u2013 and wasted it. Williams on the other hand, did not. <em>He</em> became a hero.</p> <p>It took a long time for the goal to arrive but it could have come earlier. Ansu Fati had two shots in the first eight minutes. What was most striking, though, was how fast Barcelona lost control, how complicit they were in the game tilting away from them, escaping them like so many others this season. Athletic\u2019s best opportunities began at Barcelona\u2019s feet rather than their own, gift-wrapped for them. Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen passed to Athletic players twice in two minutes, Dani Garc\u00eda sending the first opportunity wide, Unai N\u00fa\u00f1ez unable to make the most of the second. Ter Stegen then got away with a third, fear rising.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5508a2d52cf96278c33e59beb7daeb6523d850e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5508a2d52cf96278c33e59beb7daeb6523d850e/0_89_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Messi reacts after Williams\u2019 late winner added to a bad week for Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Messi reacts after Williams\u2019 late winner added to a bad week for Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent West/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Ter Stegen bumped into each other, it was illustrative of their ills. So, too, the moment when Frenkie de Jong, played clean through by Messi, with Sim\u00f3n off his line, took the baffling decision to dive rather than continue past the goalkeeper. The referee did not need the VAR to rumble him. De Jong went over again soon after, buffeted in the box: this was no dive but nor, the referee decided, was it a penalty. Still, there was no way through. Antoine Griezmann, on as a sub, hit Sim\u00f3n\u2019s legs with the best chance \u2013 another one wasted.</p> <p>Another concerning image followed: Piqu\u00e9 pulled down Williams, desperately grabbing on to his shirt as the Athletic forward tried to escape up the right. Williams was far, far too fast for the centre-back, who even got dragged along the floor for a few metres as he hung on, his vulnerability cruelly, comically exposed.

      "bodyText": "Athletic Bilbao poured fuel on Barcelona\u2019s fire. A late, late goal exposed them once more, eliminated from the Copa del Rey in the week in which their captain publicly called out their sporting director, divisions coming to the surface, civil war declared, the collapse complete. Lionel Messi had accused Eric Abidal of \u201cdirtying\u201d the players. Here, offered the chance to make a point with their play, they did so themselves. \u201cTalk to me about the football, please,\u201d their coach, Quique Seti\u00e9n, said before this game but, when it came to the football, it was not much better. There was no hiding place on the field. At San Mam\u00e9s their players were thrown to the lions again. And what awaits them now may be even worse. A 94th-minute goal from I\u00f1aki Williams defeated Barcelona in the quarter-final of the Copa del Rey. Obviously they will not win the cup but it takes a leap of faith to believe they will win anything at all. The crisis continues, deeper now. It is institutional but it is sporting, too. Though Unai Sim\u00f3n saved Athletic a couple of times, Barcelona could not really claim they deserved better. They could have won but they could also have been beaten sooner. Away from home their results are calamitous, their vulnerability painfully clear, with one coach or the other. There is little to hold on to, little to believe in \u2013 maybe, horrible though it is to hear, not even Messi. For so long they have relied on him to rescue them; here it looked as if he might again. But instead there was impotence, frustration, the smell of failure. At the final whistle the Argentinian held his head in his hands, wearing an all too familiar face. He had the chance to win it \u2013 to win the argument \u2013 and wasted it. Williams on the other hand, did not. He became a hero. It took a long time for the goal to arrive but it could have come earlier. Ansu Fati had two shots in the first eight minutes. What was most striking, though, was how fast Barcelona lost control, how complicit they were in the game tilting away from them, escaping them like so many others this season. Athletic\u2019s best opportunities began at Barcelona\u2019s feet rather than their own, gift-wrapped for them. Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen passed to Athletic players twice in two minutes, Dani Garc\u00eda sending the first opportunity wide, Unai N\u00fa\u00f1ez unable to make the most of the second. Ter Stegen then got away with a third, fear rising. When Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Ter Stegen bumped into each other, it was illustrative of their ills. So, too, the moment when Frenkie de Jong, played clean through by Messi, with Sim\u00f3n off his line, took the baffling decision to dive rather than continue past the goalkeeper. The referee did not need the VAR to rumble him. De Jong went over again soon after, buffeted in the box: this was no dive but nor, the referee decided, was it a penalty. Still, there was no way through. Antoine Griezmann, on as a sub, hit Sim\u00f3n\u2019s legs with the best chance \u2013 another one wasted. Another concerning image followed: Piqu\u00e9 pulled down Williams, desperately grabbing on to his shirt as the Athletic forward tried to escape up the right. Williams was far, far too fast for the centre-back, who even got dragged along the floor for a few metres as he hung on, his vulnerability cruelly, comically exposed. Piqu\u00e9 was booked for the 15th time this season and was soon removed, limping. Williams, by contrast, kept running. There were two minutes left when Messi was played in by Arthur. Collecting the ball by the six-yard box, he shot straight at Sim\u00f3n. In the 89th Williams had a chance of his own, with Barcelona\u2019s defence again exposed, but he scuffed his volley from a similar position. There was to be one more, though, and this time he turned his header into the net. It was another dagger in Barcelona\u2019s back. San Mam\u00e9s exploded. Barcelona already had. Seti\u00e9n \u2018satisfied\u2019 despite late heartbreak Quique Seti\u00e9n and Gerard Piqu\u00e9 both tried to accentuate the positives after the game. \u201cWe are leaving this competition, it is painful, but the image of the team has been very good,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said. \u201cEverything went well today except the result \u2026 I am quite satisfied,\u201d he added. \u201cWe dominated the whole of the second half, but the penalty is not to get ahead with one of those chances.

I was driven there by my own strong settler/coloniser impulse, after googling a list of \u201ccheapest beachside addresses in Australia\u201d. My notion was that, given the unlikeliness of my owning an everyday home, I could skip straight to \u201cbeach house\u201d. I was looking to cut off a slice of so called Australia, put a fence around it, and indulge in endless summer. I booked an extraordinarily cheap Airbnb and decided to take a recce.</p> <p>I sped up the highway past the smoking Hazelwood power station and Loy Yang open-cut brown coalmine before turning onto a lonely, unpoliced road through vast swathes of clear-cut pine plantations and agricultural green. I hit Paradise singing country music, taking note of the free but nearly empty RV park, the foreclosed takeaway joint and general store selling nothing but booze and tackle. The action in town was clearly at the two real estate agents, side by side like gunslingers on a dusty main drag.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was a hot midweek day, the first of the smoky ones, and there, in the middle of infinity, was an offshore oil rig</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The whole area smacked of grand enterprise unfulfilled. Fibro shacks, flat pack houses and shanti lean-tos hustled together in the scrubby blocks on streets named Bondi and Clovelly for wealthier beaches.<em> \u201c</em>It\u2019s like the 1970s there,\u201d<em> </em>I\u2019d henceforth tell anyone willing to ignore my 1983 birthdate and nostalgically understand the 70s to mean rebellion, entitlement and AC/DC in any order or combination.</p> <p>My dating of Paradise Beach turned out to be, in part, accurate. In the 19th century the Gippsland Lakes were opened up for the purpose of transport and fishery. As a result freshwater environments turned brackish, and the periodically inundated land between the lakes and Bass Strait dried out, leaving stretches that could be occupied, European style, after centuries of Indigenous custodianship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/06/artists-step-up-protests-against-fossil-fuel-companies-sponsorship-of-perth-festivals\">Perth festival: artists step up protests against sponsorship by fossil fuel companies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the mid-20th century some men from council, development and advertising got together to launch the Golden Beach Club Estate plan, and other assorted dreamland havens; marketing cheap subdivisions on \u201cmile after mile of glittering golden sand\u201d to new Australians looking to purchase a postcard-worthy plot. 1954 advertising copy heralds a holiday haven of fishing, duck shooting, and jaunts on the Tambo Princess cruiseliner.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago, I found myself in Gunaikurnai country, in a place more recently given the lusty name Paradise Beach. I was driven there by my own strong settler/coloniser impulse, after googling a list of \u201ccheapest beachside addresses in Australia\u201d. My notion was that, given the unlikeliness of my owning an everyday home, I could skip straight to \u201cbeach house\u201d. I was looking to cut off a slice of so called Australia, put a fence around it, and indulge in endless summer. I booked an extraordinarily cheap Airbnb and decided to take a recce. I sped up the highway past the smoking Hazelwood power station and Loy Yang open-cut brown coalmine before turning onto a lonely, unpoliced road through vast swathes of clear-cut pine plantations and agricultural green. I hit Paradise singing country music, taking note of the free but nearly empty RV park, the foreclosed takeaway joint and general store selling nothing but booze and tackle. The action in town was clearly at the two real estate agents, side by side like gunslingers on a dusty main drag. The whole area smacked of grand enterprise unfulfilled. Fibro shacks, flat pack houses and shanti lean-tos hustled together in the scrubby blocks on streets named Bondi and Clovelly for wealthier beaches. \u201cIt\u2019s like the 1970s there,\u201d I\u2019d henceforth tell anyone willing to ignore my 1983 birthdate and nostalgically understand the 70s to mean rebellion, entitlement and AC/DC in any order or combination. My dating of Paradise Beach turned out to be, in part, accurate. In the 19th century the Gippsland Lakes were opened up for the purpose of transport and fishery. As a result freshwater environments turned brackish, and the periodically inundated land between the lakes and Bass Strait dried out, leaving stretches that could be occupied, European style, after centuries of Indigenous custodianship. In the mid-20th century some men from council, development and advertising got together to launch the Golden Beach Club Estate plan, and other assorted dreamland havens; marketing cheap subdivisions on \u201cmile after mile of glittering golden sand\u201d to new Australians looking to purchase a postcard-worthy plot. 1954 advertising copy heralds a holiday haven of fishing, duck shooting, and jaunts on the Tambo Princess cruiseliner. An offset-printed bathing beauty with perfect blonde pin curls and bedroom eyes preens on the shore of a future that would never be. \u201cA New Gold Coast is born!\u201d runs the slogan. Reader, it is not. The dream stalled. And by the 1970s concerns about building homes on a sandy wedge between the ocean and a wet place were conceded. Though many subdivisions were sold, only three areas were approved for decidedly un-Gold-Coastian development. Paradise Beach is, despite mid-century ambitions, a tiny, mostly unoccupied clutch of residential zoning near the middle of the fourth longest uninterrupted beach in the world. Often deserted and unswimmable, the ocean itself is commonly a rough, relentless, reminder that you are standing at the edge of the world.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones has claimed he is subjected to verbal abuse by members of the public on a daily basis and says it comes with the territory of being the England coach. Jones returns to Murrayfield on Saturday for the first time since a group of Scotland fans hurled abuse at him outside a Manchester train station the day after England\u2019s Calcutta Cup defeat in 2018. He was repeatedly sworn at during the incident, while throughout the match 24 hours earlier he was subjected to taunts from Scotland supporters. He was also vociferously booed during last Sunday\u2019s defeat by France, having repeatedly promised to unleash \u201cabsolute brutality\u201d on England\u2019s opponents. Two years ago Jones had travelled alone from Edinburgh to Manchester to attend a Premier League football match at Old Trafford when he was confronted, prompting him to say he would never use British public transport again. on Thursday Jones confirmed he is flying to and from Edinburgh with the rest of the squad this time. Dismissing the 2018 incident, which resulted in the three men being fined, as \u201ctiny\u201d, Jones said he comes in for similar treatment every day. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t of any significance at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThat happens every day. What do you reckon happens when I walk down the street? Some people say nice things, some people are into you. It happens every day. If you didn\u2019t want it, you don\u2019t do this job.\u201d Of his travel plans he added: \u201cI am not going to any football games. I am going directly home. I will be coming back with the team.\u201d Jones is likely to receive a hostile reception at Murrayfield, having described Scotland as a \u201cniggly team\u201d who look to goad their opponents. Jones is more concerned with getting England\u2019s Six Nations campaign back on track after the 24-17 defeat by France. The coach believes England can still \u201c100%\u201d win the Six Nations and has pledged to take on Scotland up front after making sweeping changes to his team. Ben Youngs, Joe Marler and Courtney Lawes have been dropped with Willi Heinz, Mako Vunipola, George Kruis, Lewis Ludlam and Jonathan Joseph coming in. He has also named six forwards on the bench as a show of intent and it is understood he would have made six changes to his starting XV with Luke Cowan-Dickie pencilled in to start until the hooker withdrew on Friday morning after his partner went into labour. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an obvious plan that we want to play against them,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re not hiding from the fact that we want to take them on up front. We just think it\u2019s going to be a high-volume, high-intensity game in the forwards. I just think our strengths are up front and that\u2019s what we want to play to.\u201d Jones has blamed his side\u2019s slow start in Paris \u2013 England were 17-0 down at half-time and conceded another seven unanswered points until Jonny May restored respectability with two fine individual tries \u2013 on his decision to ease his players into camp owing to their club workloads following the World Cup. As a result Jones believes England will finish the tournament strongly with consecutive home matches against Ireland and Wales and an away trip to Italy following Saturday\u2019s match. \u201cI think I under-prepared the team, so it took us some time to get into the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a reason for that given the workload of the players. We under-prepared and I take full responsibility. But there\u2019s a reason for that and my view is that we\u2019ll see the reason at the end of the competition \u2013 that we\u2019ll be full of running.\u201d To that end the losing bonus point in Paris may prove pivotal. \u201cEvery point is important in a competition when there\u2019s bonus points,\u201d Jones added. Owen Farrell echoed Jones\u2019s sentiments and expects a significant step-up in performance. \u201cWe\u2019ll believe that [we can win the tournament] until it\u2019s not possible,\u201d the England captain said. \u201cTraining has stepped up this week. We have had a good look at ourselves, we have seen what we can do and we have stepped up. You do tend to have a bit more of a look at yourself after a loss. It allows you to be a bit more open. We have said where we want to improve and I would expect us to not just talk about it but do it.\u201d The Six Nations organisers have confirmed they are in dialogue with the unions and \u201cmonitoring the situation\u201d regarding Storm Ciara.

      "bodyText": "In these embryonic weeks of the season it is the traits a side show in their moments of adversity, rather than the results, which offer the greatest hint of what may lie ahead. Take Warrington in the final moments here, for example. With their first win of 2020 long since secured, attention had turned to inflicting a \u201cnilling\u201d on the Super League champions for the first time in four years. Had Jonny Lomax scored in the final seconds, it would not have soured the night for many Wire supporters. Wins against their great rivals are few and far between in the league; this was Warrington\u2019s 15th in 68 meetings in the Super League era. But the manner in which they scrambled to deny Lomax \u2013 and celebrated afterwards \u2013 certainly said something. As any critic of Warrington will point out, it certainly does not suggest their first title in 65 years is somewhat of an inevitability. But it hints at everything Steve Price would want to see from his side at this point of the year: determination, unbridled desire and togetherness. They are handy characteristics to have so early in the campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s only early days but we\u2019re in a good place and we\u2019re looking fast across the board,\u201d Price said. Having battled commendably a man light for almost an hour at Wigan last week, they recorded their first victory of the season in a mightily impressive manner. Granted the Wolves were facing a Saints side without a host of first-team regulars but, having emerged from a scrappy opening half-hour to lead by three scores at half-time, they killed the prospect of a comeback with Josh Charnley\u2019s try shortly after the restart. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not getting carried away but we kept them to zero and we\u2019ve got to build from that,\u201dPrice said. Kristian Woolf\u2019s reign as St Helens coach is only two games old but the circumstances surrounding this, their first league defeat since July, ensure he is facing the kind of crisis that his predecessor did not endure throughout their title-winning campaign last season. Saints were already without five of the side who won last year\u2019s Grand Final here when matters were made worse as Alex Walmsley pulled out minutes before kick-off. Mark Percival was injured midway through the game, leaving Woolf desperately short of strike power with the World Club Challenge against Sydney Roosters a fortnight away. Woolf, however, was in no mood to hide behind his side\u2019s problems. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough out there to win games of footy and enough out there to play better than what we did,\u201dhe said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help but those injuries throw up a challenge.

Realistically the visitors had to score first after half-time to stand any chance but without so many frontline players \u2013 the Saints will be checking on a calf injury to Walmsley and a pectoral blow for Percival \u2013it was no surprise that Warrington struck instead. Another fine piece of handling created the space for Josh Charnley to touch down and by the time Ratchford had kicked another penalty attention had already turned to whether the Wolves could nil the Saints, rather than just win the game. There were one or two nervy moments late on but that question was emphatically answered in the final seconds when they scrambled en masse to deny Lomax.",

      "bodyText": "Melco Resorts, the casino group controlled by the Hong Kong magnate Lawrence Ho, says it has abandoned its plans to buy shares in James Packer\u2019s Crown Resorts because of the coronavirus outbreak. The move, which leaves Melco with its existing 10% stake in Crown, comes as the former New South Wales supreme court judge Patricia Bergin prepares for public hearings into Crown that are set to investigate the original Melco deal. In May last year Melco agreed to buy almost 20% of Crown from the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, Packer, in a transaction spread across two tranches. The first 10% was transferred in July but in August Ho and Packer pressed pause on the transfer of the remaining shares until after the end of the Bergin inquiry, which was prompted by a series of media reports making allegations including money laundering at Crown casinos and organised crime involvement in running junkets. Crown denies all the allegations. Melco\u2019s decision means it will no longer seek a seat on the Crown board, a move that will avoid scrutiny of its nominee under Australian casino regulator probity rules. According to research by the ratings agency S&amp;P, Melco faces more danger from the coronavirus outbreak than Crown because it operates casinos in the Chinese territory of Macau, a former Portuguese colony close to Hong Kong. S&amp;P said Melco \u201chas limited flexibility to absorb a prolonged and severe decline in its cash flow\u201d because it needs money to build an expansion to its Studio City casino in Macau, where casinos have been closed due to the virus. In a statement released late on Thursday, Melco said that \u201cdue to the impact of the coronavirus epidemic, including the severe drop in tourism in Asia to Integrated Resort (IR) facilities in the region, and the recent decision by the Macau SAR government to close all casinos in Macau, Melco has taken the decision to reassess all non-core investments to be made in 2020\u201d. \u201cAs a result of this decision, Melco will not pursue its planned investment in Australia for the second tranche of shares in Crown Resorts Limited. \u201cWhile Melco believes Crown has world-class assets that are complementary to its global business, it is Melco\u2019s belief that, at this time, its capital needs to be deployed on its core assets.\u201d The company said it would focus its resources on projects including extending Studio City and building its City of Dreams Mediterranean casino in Cyprus. \u201cManagement attention will remain focused on these critical areas of Melco\u2019s business until such time as operations and business throughout Asia have returned to normal,\u201d Melco said.",

But over the past two months, the 34-year-old had become a household name in China, known to hundreds of millions of people as the face and conscience of its spiralling coronavirus crisis. Late on Thursday, after state-controlled media outlets reported that he had died days earlier, the news was met with an extraordinary nationwide outpouring of grief and anger on social media. The response was an indication of how powerfully his story had resonated around the country as hundreds of millions of people faced the threat of a new disease, of still unknown lethality. Li tried to warn fellow doctors in the early days of the outbreak, posting a message alerting them to a mystery new disease at his hospital in late December. Seven people were in quarantine, the symptoms were similar to Sars, and doctors should consider wearing protective equipment to prevent infection, he said. Security forces came to his house four days after he sent that public health warning and accused him of \u201cmaking false comments\u201d and acting illegally to disturb social order. He signed a statement agreeing not to discuss the disease further. Yet within a week he would be infected himself, and within two weeks, China and the world would be talking of little else beyond the new disease, now identified as a coronavirus. Li himself was infected when he operated on a patient with glaucoma, who he did not know was carrying the virus. On 10 January he started to feel sick, and his symptoms worsened over the rest of the month. Hospitalised with fever and breathing problems, as he fought the illness, he also decided to fight the government, going public with details of how he had been silenced in the name of stability. He shared documents online and carried out interviews via text message, helping reporters piece together an alarming picture of official incompetence and negligence in the very period when containment might have been most possible. Almost overnight, he became a public figure \u2013 and a particularly rare one willing to take on the government in a system designed to muffle or crush dissent. Local authorities did eventually apologise to him and seven others investigated for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d, as public anger about the cover-up spread, and the central government admitted that the crisis had been mishandled in its early days. But it came too late for hundreds who have died, tens of thousands who have been infected, and Li himself.

      "bodyText": "A whistleblowing Chinese doctor who tried to raise the alarm about the coronavirus outbreak has died, a Communist party-controlled newspaper has confirmed. Li Wenliang, 34, was declared dead at 2.58am local time on Friday morning after \u201cemergency treatment\u201d at a hospital in Wuhan, the Global Times reported, following hours of confusion over his fate. Earlier reports of Li\u2019s death had triggered an outpouring of grief and anger on Chinese social media, with many hailing his decision to speak out over the virus despite the risks of doing so in his authoritarian country. The Global Times was among the heavily controlled state-run newspapers that stepped back from their initial reports of the ophthalmologist\u2018s death on Thursday. \u201cWe profoundly regret and mourn this death,\u201d the Wuhan City central hospital said in a brief statement on its official social media account. Chinese police had targeted Li for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d in late December 2019 after he posted a warning on social media about a cluster of cases of a flu-like disease that had been treated at his hospital. Seven patients were in quarantine and the disease symptoms reminded him of Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), he said. He urged colleagues to wear protective clothing at work. Four days later he was summoned to the local public security bureau, accused of \u201cmaking false comments\u201d and disturbing the social order. He was told that if he continued to talk about the disease, he would be \u201cbrought to justice\u201d. Li was one of eight people authorities targeted for \u201csharing false information\u201d, in a heavy-handed approach that China\u2019s supreme court later criticised. He agreed not to discuss his concerns in public again. But in early January he treated a woman with glaucoma without realising she was also a coronavirus patient; he appears to have been infected during the operation. On 10 January, when China was still insisting there had been no new cases for a week, he started coughing then developed a fever. Two days later he was in hospital; his parents also fell ill. Li broke his silence to give interviews from his hospital bed. \u201cIf the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency,\u201d he told the New York Times. The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China reached 563 on Thursday, as health experts prepared to meet in Geneva next week in an attempt to develop a vaccine. Chinese authorities said the death toll had risen by 73 in the previous 24 hours \u2013 the third record daily rise in a row \u2013 with 70 of the deaths recorded in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. There are more than 28,000 cases in China, according to health officials. The youngest patient is a baby born on Saturday in Wuhan and confirmed positive just 36 hours after birth. The baby was immediately separated from the mother after the birth. The World Health Organization (WHO), however, said on Thursday that while it was too early to say that China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak was peaking, Wednesday was the first day that the overall number of new cases in China had dropped. WHO official Mike Ryan said there had been a constant increase in cases in Hubei province but that had not been seen in other provinces. In Wuhan, the largest city in Hubei, hospitals were struggling to find enough beds for patients. A 1,500-bed hospital opened on Thursday, just days after a 1,000-bed hospital with prefabricated wards and isolation rooms began taking patients, but senior officials said the city of 11 million was close to capacity with only 8,254 beds for 8,182 coronavirus patients. Outside mainland China, at least 230 cases have been confirmed, including two deaths, one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines. On Thursday the UK confirmed a third case, while Japan confirmed another 10 infections among 3,700 passengers and crew stuck onboard the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship moored off the port of Yokohama, near Tokyo. The 10 new cases involved four people from Japan, two each from the US and Canada, and one each from New Zealand and Taiwan, the health ministry said, adding that five were in their 70s, four in their 60s and one in their 50s. Japanese health officials now have the results of 102 tests conducted on 273 passengers and crew who complained of feeling unwell or had been in close contact with a man in his 80s who disembarked late last month and tested positive on his return home to Hong Kong. TV footage showed the vessel arriving at Yokohama port to take on food and other supplies and hand over the infected patients, who are being treated at hospitals in the Yokohama area. Port officials could be seen dressed in white full-body protective suits, face masks and helmets. The WHO is asking for $675m to stop the outbreak. Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, acknowledged that the sum was large, but said it was \u201cmuch less than the bill we will face if we do not invest in preparedness now\u201d. Li\u2019s fate has echoes of Carlo Urbani, an Italian doctor who in 2003 played a crucial role in identifying Sars and raising the international alarm, but was eventually killed by it. Working for the WHO in Hanoi, Vietnam, he was called to a hospital when a patient arrived from Hong Kong with unusual pneumonia symptoms. He recognised the disease was highly contagious, brought in strict controls and called in international health authorities. His action led to the WHO raising a worldwide alert about the disease and halted its spread in Vietnam.",

They have declined to give any more detail about what it covered.</p> <p>The document from the Counter Terrorism Policing\u2019s National Operations Centre (CTPNOC) was marked as sensitive and produced in February 2019, soon after XR was formed in October 2018.

      "bodyText": "Counter-terrorism chiefs ordered a formal assessment of whether Extinction Rebellion was a national security threat one year ago and then sent a secret report about the group to police forces, the Guardian has learned. The revelation shows that counter-terrorism police\u2019s interest in the non-violent climate emergency group began earlier and was more extensive than previously thought. Police insist that the confidential assessment, which was titled Rising Up, concluded that XR was not a terrorist or extremist threat, and was sent to regional counter-terrorism units and \u201cpolicing partners\u201d. They have declined to give any more detail about what it covered. The document from the Counter Terrorism Policing\u2019s National Operations Centre (CTPNOC) was marked as sensitive and produced in February 2019, soon after XR was formed in October 2018. It was needed, police say, because the group was attracting a \u201clarge following\u201d and counter-terrorism specialists needed to assess their \u201cgoals and methods\u201d. The Guardian first revealed that a counter-terrorism document from November 2019 labelled XR as extremist last month, which police apologised for and withdrew only after its existence was made public. Then revelations about CTP documents from June 2019, titled \u201cSigns and Symbols\u201d, listing XR and other peaceful groups such as Greenpeace and Peta, alongside banned terrorists and extremists, caused anger and claims from activists that freedom of protest and thought were being threatened. The non-violent groups were alarmed to discover that the documents had been circulated as part of Prevent briefings for teachers and medical staff, to help them spot people at risk of falling into terrorism. Both leading Labour politicians and one Conservative heavyweight have voiced their concerns. The Guardian further understands that Counter Terrorism Policing headquarters (CTPHQ) produced documents about non-violent protest groups. An Extinction Rebellion spokesperson said: \u201cWe all agree public safety is paramount. However, if CTP is used as a blunt instrument, it is a threat to human rights. \u201cWe are concerned about how far, how long and how intrusive this investigation might have been and the ongoing implications.

They need to show leadership and responsibility on this so the public can maintain confidence in the crucially important counter-terror work the police do.\u201d After police were contacted about the document, the UK\u2019s senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism, deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, decided to explain counter-terrorism police\u2019s interest in XR. Speaking to the Guardian, Haydon said that producing Rising Up was the right thing to do: \u201cWhen a protest group is gaining influence and beginning to attract a large following, it is necessary for policing to assess that group\u2019s goals and methods to see whether they pose a security threat or are at risk of attracting extremists who might be a threat to the public.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 7 February. Top stories The federal government spent an additional $150m on community sport infrastructure outside its controversial sport grant scheme, with the Department of Health confirming that the money was committed in the lead-up to the 2019 election campaign, and administrated under the female facilities and water safety stream program. Forty-one projects secured funding, including a grant of $25m for a new pool in the marginal Western Australian seat of the attorney general, Christian Porter, and other marginal electorates including Corangamite, Swan and Gilmore also scored. An inquiry into the original $100m community sport infrastructure program, which was overseen by Bridget McKenzie, has been announced by the Senate. Donald Trump has been acquitted of abusing his power and obstructing Congress, bringing the impeachment process to a close. Mitt Romney crossed the aisle and became the first senator in history to vote to remove a president from his own party in an impeachment trial, but the vote was carried otherwise along party lines 52-48 and 53-47 on the respective charges. Trump immediately went on the offensive on Friday morning, calling the process \u201cevil\u201d \u2013 saying it had been drummed up by \u201cdirty cops\u201d, \u201cleakers\u201d and \u201cliars\u201d. The international press has been scathing in its reaction, with France\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration calling the impeachment process a \u201chollow pretence of justice\u201d. Meanwhile in the Democratic primaries, Bernie Sanders has claimed a \u201cstrong victory\u201d in the Iowa caucuses, even though he is trailing Pete Buttigieg in the first voting state. A Chinese doctor who was among the first to raise concerns about the spread of the coronavirus is critically ill, after becoming infected treating early cases of the then undiagnosed respiratory infection. Le Wenliang, 34, was accused by authorities of \u201cmaking false comments\u201d and \u201cspreading rumours\u201d after posting a warning on social media in late December about a cluster of cases of a flu-like disease at his hospital. The official death toll has risen to 563, with more than 28,000 reported cases. The World Health Organization has called for $675m to stop the outbreak, cautioning that the bill will be much larger \u201cif we do not invest in preparedness now\u201d. Australia Public health officials have fought back tears at an emotional parliamentary hearing in NSW, urging the state government to drop proposed laws that aim to curtail planning authorities\u2019 ability to block projects based on their climate emissions. A 44-year-old Australian national and two Chinese have been stabbed in the Maldives, in an attack claimed by Islamic State sympathisers. Three people have been arrested. The incoming chancellor of the Australian National University, Julie Bishop, has counselled the federal government to lead the world on climate despite \u201cmissteps\u201d, offering the \u201cevidence-based\u201d work of her university\u2019s 300-plus climate scientists and disaster management experts to inform any bushfires response. Labor has asked the Australian Electoral Commission to investigate why the Liberal party declared and then removed a $165,000 donation from the company of a Scott Morrison ally and key bidder for a $1bn government contract. The world A tiny piece of fashioned glass discovered on Lindisfarne is being hailed as a rare archeological treasure, linking the Northumbrian island with the Vikings around the time of the AD793 raids that heralded three centuries of destruction and occupation. Protected Indigenous lands could be subject to commercial mining under a controversial new bill from Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro. The far-right leader has long alleged that Indigenous land ownership has held back economic development. The FBI has warned that Chinese theft of corporate intellectual property constitutes the biggest law enforcement threat to the US, with one agency director alleging trade secrets worth \u201c$300bn to $600bn\u201d a year are being stolen. Christina Koch has returned to Earth after 328 days aboard the International Space Station, hoping her protracted mission can help promote gender equity within a traditionally male-dominated field. Recommended reads With the election of a new leader, Adam Bandt, for the first time in the Australian Greens\u2019 history, its leader will sit in the House of Representatives, not the Senate.

Listen They\u2019re the characters that make us fall in love with TV shows \u2013 so why do writers keep killing them off? Continuing Guardian Australia\u2019s focus on unforgettable moments in Australian TV, on this episode of Full Story, Laura Murphy-Oates discusses with our culture editor, Steph Harmon, why fictional deaths move us so much.

      "body": "<p>I Think We Are Alone marks the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2020/jan/15/lets-get-physical-frantic-assembly-at-25-in-pictures\">25th anniversary</a> of physical theatre company Frantic Assembly. In their grand old age they tout the lesson of togetherness, as a haphazard group of lonely Londoners search for connection in Sally Abbott\u2019s bittersweet play, which roots for kindness and conversation.</p> <p>A cab driver, a hospice worker and a student hit the ground running with heart-baring monologues; they can\u2019t find the right words to talk to each other so they spill to us instead. Certain relationships shine: two sisters overcoming trauma together, a mother and son figuring out how to give each other space, a one-night stand that slaps a laughing room into silence.</p> <p>Directed by Kathy Burke and Scott Graham, the six characters delicately scoot around each other, flowing on <a href=\"https://www.morganlarge.com/\">Morgan Large</a>\u2019s metallic set. They push heavy Perspex boxes, creating ghostly silhouettes and fuzzy shadows. Between chunks of dialogue the boxes crowd, divide and anchor them, almost like commas in a script. A translucent background lights up and the boxes glow with neon bars and electric fizzles.</p> <p>In one scene, cabbie Graham (Andrew Turner) holds on as a box is tilted diagonally, so that his feet sweep off the ground and he floats in mid-air. It\u2019s one of the few moments where you remember that Frantic Assembly are among the most influential British companies for movement. In much of the play, the use of the body is somewhat muted, with the boxes almost doing more physical work than the people.</p> <p>The play stumbles in its overly ambitious attempt to tackle all of society\u2019s problems at once, and the generic complaints about technology sound a bit stuck in 2010, but it has a great respect for the ordinary and is kind-hearted to its core. It deals with death gently and as the characters\u2019 lives gradually begin to intersect, they help get rid of each other\u2019s ghosts and demons. A tender sweep of a show, I Think We Are Alone swells with the simple, difficult, important desire for connection.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://theatreroyal.com/whats-on/i-think-we-are-alone/\">Theatre Royal Plymouth</a>, until 8 February. <a href=\"https://www.franticassembly.co.uk/productions/i-think-we-are-alone\">Touring until 16 May</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "I Think We Are Alone marks the 25th anniversary of physical theatre company Frantic Assembly. In their grand old age they tout the lesson of togetherness, as a haphazard group of lonely Londoners search for connection in Sally Abbott\u2019s bittersweet play, which roots for kindness and conversation. A cab driver, a hospice worker and a student hit the ground running with heart-baring monologues; they can\u2019t find the right words to talk to each other so they spill to us instead. Certain relationships shine: two sisters overcoming trauma together, a mother and son figuring out how to give each other space, a one-night stand that slaps a laughing room into silence. Directed by Kathy Burke and Scott Graham, the six characters delicately scoot around each other, flowing on Morgan Large\u2019s metallic set. They push heavy Perspex boxes, creating ghostly silhouettes and fuzzy shadows. Between chunks of dialogue the boxes crowd, divide and anchor them, almost like commas in a script. A translucent background lights up and the boxes glow with neon bars and electric fizzles. In one scene, cabbie Graham (Andrew Turner) holds on as a box is tilted diagonally, so that his feet sweep off the ground and he floats in mid-air. It\u2019s one of the few moments where you remember that Frantic Assembly are among the most influential British companies for movement. In much of the play, the use of the body is somewhat muted, with the boxes almost doing more physical work than the people. The play stumbles in its overly ambitious attempt to tackle all of society\u2019s problems at once, and the generic complaints about technology sound a bit stuck in 2010, but it has a great respect for the ordinary and is kind-hearted to its core. It deals with death gently and as the characters\u2019 lives gradually begin to intersect, they help get rid of each other\u2019s ghosts and demons. A tender sweep of a show, I Think We Are Alone swells with the simple, difficult, important desire for connection. At Theatre Royal Plymouth, until 8 February. Touring until 16 May.",

The Department for International Trade has opted to simplify the current regime rather than abolish large parts of it, as Theresa May\u2019s government planned under a temporary scheme to follow a no-deal Brexit. The trade secretary, Liz Truss, said she would consult business groups on whether the government should simplify its tariff policy, which she said would ensure greater choice and lower prices for consumers. Truss said the purpose of the review was to simplify and tailor tariffs to suit UK businesses and households, \u201csuch as removing tariffs of less than 2.5% and rounding tariffs down to the nearest 2.5%, 5% or 10% band\u201d. Goods such as fire extinguishers, pencils, bicycle pumps and some household fridges currently have tariffs below 2.5%, which might, under the proposal, be removed. Ministers are also seeking views on whether to remove tariffs on components used in factory production to try to reduce costs for UK manufacturers. Last year the government said 87% of imports into the UK would not attract a tariff once the UK was outside the EU\u2019s single market and customs union, leaving large parts of the agricultural sector facing being undercut by cheaper foreign imports. Truss called on UK businesses to help shape Britain\u2019s import tariff policy, which will apply from next year as the country prepares for life outside the EU. She said she wanted to hear from businesses during a four-week consultation from 5 March before replacing EU tariffs that remain in force for the rest of this year. Import tariffs on goods under the latest scheme will apply to countries where the UK government has so far failed to put alternative trade arrangements in place. But Truss immediately ran into criticism from the Institute of Directors for reviewing trade policy while the government and business groups were involved in trade negotiations with the EU and the US. Allie Renison, the IoD\u2019s head of trade policy, said: \u201cThe consultation comes at a fraught time as we seem headed for simultaneous negotiations with both the US and EU.

The UK is party to approximately 40 free trade agreements that the EU has with about 70 countries, which together account for more than 14% of UK trade. If these are not replicated as deals with the UK by the time Brexit occurs, their benefits will cease to apply to UK businesses. So far, 20 rollover agreements have been signed with 48 countries, accounting for about 8.5% of UK trade. In a separate written statement to the Commons, Truss said the UK would \u201cdrive a hard bargain\u201d in its trade negotiations and was \u201cprepared to walk away if that is in the national interest\u201d.

A breakdown of GCSE results issued by the Department for Education (DfE) showed the gap between disadvantaged pupils and others increased for the second year in a row. The introduction of tougher exams appear to have halted the improvement seen in previous years. \u201cThe attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their peers remains stable and is down by around 9% since 2011, but we recognise there is more to do,\u201d said Nick Gibb, the school standards minister for England. Just 456 of the 143,000 pupils classed as disadvantaged by the DfE achieved top grade 9s in English and maths last summer, compared with 6,132 out of 398,000 other pupils. The DfE classes about one in four state school pupils as disadvantaged, defined as having been eligible for free school meals within the five years before sitting GCSEs or if they have been in care or adopted from care. While more than two-thirds of non-disadvantaged children achieved grade 4 or higher in maths and English, just 36% of those eligible for free school meals did so. Of boys eligible for free school meals, those from mixed white and black Caribbean backgrounds had the weakest results, along with children from Gypsy or Roma families.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Among those stranded are Canadian permanent residents Danni Luo and her eight-year-old daughter Qinlin Li, who travelled to Wuhan on 19 January to celebrate Chinese lunar new year with family.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not on that airplane.

Any sense that those warnings were misplaced curdled about one hour after the acquittal vote, with an announcement by Senate Republicans that they would open an investigation of Hunter Biden, the son of Trump\u2019s perceived 2020 rival Joe Biden.</p> <p>Two Senate committees will investigate \u201cpotential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates during the Obama administration\u201d, their committee chairman wrote in <a href=\"https://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2020-02-05%20CEG%20RHJ%20to%20Secret%20Service%20%28Biden%20Travel%29.pdf\">a letter</a>.</p> <p>The investigations could supply Trump with headlines akin to the Hillary Clinton investigation headlines that helped drag him over the wire in 2016.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump appears to have now exchanged a bout of self-pity for a can-do attitude about controlling the justice department</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump surrogates including his sons and campaign manager, meanwhile, eagerly spread the charge this week that the Democrats\u2019 own nomination process was \u201crigged\u201d following confusion in the Iowa caucuses. The attack on election integrity probably previews what seemed a sure campaign by Trump to brand any 2020 election result he does not like as \u201cfake\u201d \u2013 his precise play when it comes to news.</p> <p>But a focus on how Trump might try to cheat in the 2020 election could reveal a lack of appreciation for the breadth of Trump\u2019s vision and the levers of power in his hands, and conceal the potential downside of dangerous fallout from a Trump unbound.</p> <p>Already in the weeks leading up to his acquittal, Trump was revisiting and expanding some of the most controversial actions of his early presidency, many of which were blocked or partially blocked by courts.</p> <p>Last month, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/us/politics/trump-wall-funding.html\">diverted</a> an additional $7.2bn of military funding to construction of his border wall, in a rush to demonstrate progress on his signature campaign promise in an election year. Last week, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/31/travel-ban-trump-countries-announcement\">expanded</a> his travel ban to six additional countries, in a move Amnesty International called \u201coffensive and actually harmful to our national security\u201d.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said in an interview that Trump \u201cabsolutely, 100%,\u201d must continue to lean on Ukraine for a Biden investigation. On Wednesday, Democrats <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-05/trump-withholding-823-million-for-clean-energy-democrats-say\">announced</a> the Trump administration was withholding $823m for a clean energy program it unsuccessfully tried to cut.</p> <p>What\u2019s next for Trump unbound? Many eyes are on the justice department, whose head, the attorney general, William Barr, hastened to claim he had no role in the Ukraine scheme after it was revealed that Trump told the Ukrainian president in a July phone call to coordinate with Barr.</p> <p>The question is how much resistance remains inside the justice department to Trump\u2019s open desire to investigate his perceived political enemies, and how long that resistance will last.

      "bodyText": "Even recently, Donald Trump has shown some capacity to be constrained. In September, he released security aid to Ukraine when Congress began asking questions. In October, after awarding his own Florida golf resort a contract to host a G7 summit, Trump reversed course under Republican pressure. The repeated demands he made in November and December for a \u201cfull\u201d Senate trial were rebuffed. But on Wednesday, Trump was acquitted by the Senate on impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, with many Republicans echoing an argument made by Trump\u2019s legal team: that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense. In the wake of that acquittal, Democrat impeachment managers warned, the country may learn the true meaning of Trump unleashed. \u201cA man without character or ethical compass will never find his way. He has done it before and he will do it again,\u201d the House intelligence committee chair, Adam Schiff, told the Senate. \u201cWhat are the odds if he is left in office that he will continue to try to cheat? I will tell you: 100%.\u201d Warnings during the impeachment trial about how and where Trump might \u201ccheat\u201d focused on the upcoming 2020 presidential election. Any sense that those warnings were misplaced curdled about one hour after the acquittal vote, with an announcement by Senate Republicans that they would open an investigation of Hunter Biden, the son of Trump\u2019s perceived 2020 rival Joe Biden. Two Senate committees will investigate \u201cpotential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates during the Obama administration\u201d, their committee chairman wrote in a letter. The investigations could supply Trump with headlines akin to the Hillary Clinton investigation headlines that helped drag him over the wire in 2016. Trump surrogates including his sons and campaign manager, meanwhile, eagerly spread the charge this week that the Democrats\u2019 own nomination process was \u201crigged\u201d following confusion in the Iowa caucuses. The attack on election integrity probably previews what seemed a sure campaign by Trump to brand any 2020 election result he does not like as \u201cfake\u201d \u2013 his precise play when it comes to news. But a focus on how Trump might try to cheat in the 2020 election could reveal a lack of appreciation for the breadth of Trump\u2019s vision and the levers of power in his hands, and conceal the potential downside of dangerous fallout from a Trump unbound. Already in the weeks leading up to his acquittal, Trump was revisiting and expanding some of the most controversial actions of his early presidency, many of which were blocked or partially blocked by courts. Last month, Trump diverted an additional $7.2bn of military funding to construction of his border wall, in a rush to demonstrate progress on his signature campaign promise in an election year. Last week, Trump expanded his travel ban to six additional countries, in a move Amnesty International called \u201coffensive and actually harmful to our national security\u201d. On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said in an interview that Trump \u201cabsolutely, 100%,\u201d must continue to lean on Ukraine for a Biden investigation. On Wednesday, Democrats announced the Trump administration was withholding $823m for a clean energy program it unsuccessfully tried to cut. What\u2019s next for Trump unbound? Many eyes are on the justice department, whose head, the attorney general, William Barr, hastened to claim he had no role in the Ukraine scheme after it was revealed that Trump told the Ukrainian president in a July phone call to coordinate with Barr. The question is how much resistance remains inside the justice department to Trump\u2019s open desire to investigate his perceived political enemies, and how long that resistance will last. A year after his election, Trump complained that he was \u201cnot supposed to be involved with the justice department,\u201d calling it \u201cthe saddest thing\u201d. Trump appears to have now exchanged that bout of self-pity for a can-do attitude about controlling the justice department. Last May, Trump said that talking with Barr about opening an investigation of the Bidens would be \u201cappropriate\u201d. An announcement by Barr this week of new restrictions on any politically sensitive investigations including into presidential campaigns was either reassuring, because it could narrow the possibility of such investigations, or alarming, because it raised the possibility of such investigations and because it was a reaction to an investigation widely seen as entirely appropriate, of the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia As the continuing Ukraine episode illustrated, Trump\u2019s will to power has driven out public servants who do not share his expansive view of executive influence. The continued loss of those rank-and-file employees could accelerate his takeover \u2013 especially if he wins re-election. On Thursday, one of those lifetime employees whose career fell casualty to Trump\u2019s personal ambitions, Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, wrote in the Washington Post about what the events surrounding Trump\u2019s impeachment meant for the national future. \u201cI had always thought that our institutions would forever protect us against individual transgressors,\u201d Yovanovitch wrote. \u201cBut it turns out that our institutions need us as much as we need them; they need the American people to protect them or they will be hollowed out over time, unable to serve and protect our country.\u201d",

Moreover, once the makeover was complete, PL Two\u2019s new clout could reawaken the much-diminished enthusiasm of many television and newspaper executives for England\u2019s lower leagues. Despite European crowd surveys showing that, in some recent seasons, only the Premier League and Bundesliga have attracted more fans to games than England\u2019s second tier, the Championship has been under-reported by a national media in thrall to the top flight. Yet a frequently overlooked division is studded with skill and excitement. Middlesbrough are a modest 18th but Jonathan Woodgate\u2019s sweet-passing, risk-taking side regularly excite neutrals. Who knows what will happen when the maverick new signing Ravel Morrison gets going in the creative department? Leeds, Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, Derby and \u2013 if they escape League One \u2013 Sunderland possess big enough fan bases and sufficiently illustrious histories to provide immense collective pulling power. Brentford offer an enticing, analytics-driven version of dry Moneyball theory made mud-on-boots reality while a Championship managerial cast featuring Marcelo Bielsa, Slaven Bilic and Lee Bowyer ensures entertaining subplots aplenty. What thriller series could top Bielsa\u2019s starring role in Leeds\u2019 \u201cSpygate\u201d scandal? Who says this action-packed soap opera cannot capture Asian and American hearts and minds? The Championship seems to be almost hiding in plain sight. It is certainly not making the most of itself. Doing so will involve detachment from the EFL before reducing the 24-team, 46-game format to a sleek 18-club, 34-game programme mirroring a similarly revamped top tier. Such a rearrangement could only enhance the quality of domestic football while facilitating a proper winter break that would not jeopardise the FA Cup. A holidaying J\u00fcrgen Klopp need not watch a Liverpool replay on a laptop. By reducing the number of PL One games fatigue would be minimised, quality enhanced and Champions League performance heightened. Added bonuses may include the kiboshing of ideas about England\u2019s biggest teams defecting to join a breakaway \u201cSuper Club\u201d European franchise. Trimming clubs and matches has never been properly contemplated by Premier League chairmen anxious to keep the division\u2019s incredible broadcast riches to themselves. Throw PL Two into the equation, though, and the resultant, infinitely enhanced, joint TV deal would soften the blow of relegation while ensuring fairer wealth distribution, some of which should trickle into the EFL. It cannot be right that the Championship has a \u00a3595m, five-year EFL deal with Sky but BT and Sky enjoy a collective \u00a34.55bn, three-year agreement with the Premier League. No wonder second-tier chairmen feel their division\u2019s broadcast value is chronically undervalued and the gap disproportionate. Parts of Al Hayba are filmed on the physical road to Damascus; English football could do with taking a journey along the metaphorical version.",

      "bodyText": "She would miss the friendship of her crewmates, she said, and of course the spectacular views. But after 328 days on the International Space Station \u2013 the longest continuous spaceflight ever undertaken by a female astronaut \u2013 Christina Koch could not deny last week that she was looking forward to experiencing some very simple pleasures back on Earth, including \u201cthe feeling of wind on my face\u201d. On Thursday the US astronaut was at last granted that wish, when the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, carrying Koch, Russian cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov and Italy\u2019s Luca Parmitano, landed in Kazakhstan, almost a year after Koch last set foot on earth. Her enormous grin as she was helped from the pod showed just how sweet the central Asian breeze could feel after 11 months in an airtight capsule. \u201cI am so overwhelmed and happy right now,\u201d the 41-year-old told reporters, shortly after being slid out of the scorched craft and helped to a chair. Having blasted off on 12 March last year, Koch\u2019s stint on the ISS surpassed the previous continuous record for a female astronaut, held by fellow American Peggy Whitson, and brought her within 12 days of the US record set in 2015/16 by the male Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly. (Russian Valeri Polyakov holds the all-time record of 14 months.) Her voyage saw her make 5,248 orbits of the Earth, witnessing 16 sunrises and sunsets every day, and travel 223m km. In many respects, of course, Koch\u2019s gender is the least significant thing about her. An electrical engineer from North Carolina, she is an expert in space science instrument development and in engineering in remote scientific locations including Antarctica and Alaska. Her research during the mission included growing protein crystals for potential use as treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinsons. But after decades marginalising the women who contributed to its space programmes, Nasa has taken strides to be more inclusive; the 2013 class of which Koch was part had a 50:50 gender split. Koch has said that both she and fellow astronaut Jessica Meir, with whom she overlapped on the ISS, were conscious of their status as role models to young women in particular. \u201cWe both drew a lot of inspiration from seeing people who were reflections of ourselves as we were growing up, and developing our dreams to become astronauts,\u201d she said in an interview from space last month. \u201cDiversity is important and it is something worth fighting for.\u201d It is about more than just optics, however. To date, while more than 560 men have been to space since 1961, while the figure for women is fewer than 70. Nasa plans to return to the moon by 2024, and if it and other space agencies wish to consider more frequent and longer stays outside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in future, they will need to know how prolonged space travel affects a diverse range of humans. Women and men are known to adapt to space differently in some ways, though the reasons are not fully understood, Dr Varsha Jain, a space gynaecologist based at Edinburgh university but currently working with Nasa, told the BBC last year. Women, for instance, \u201care more likely to feel sick when they go into space, men are more likely to get re-entry sickness when they come back to Earth\u201d. Equality will also require resources, however: Koch\u2019s stint on the space station also saw her participate, with Meir, in the first all-female spacewalk; that record had been delayed from the previous March, however, when Koch and colleague Anne McClain were due to spacewalk together but the ISS was equipped with only one space suit small enough to fit them. Though there was much about her stay that was unforgettable, Koch said last week, her spacewalk with Meir was a special moment she would never forget. \u201cWe caught each other\u2019s eye and we knew that we were really honoured with this opportunity to inspire so many, and just hearing our voices talk to Mission Control, knowing two female voices had never been on the loops, solving those problems together outside \u2013 it was a really special feeling.\u201d",

Official figures showed the emissions from homes and public buildings rose sharply as a result of a Siberian weather system, in part because many still rely on gas heating and subpar insulation. The cold snap in early 2018 caused emissions from homes to rise by 4% from the year before, according to the government\u2019s data, or the equivalent of a small country\u2019s annual emissions. National Energy Action (NEA), a fuel poverty charity, urged the government to make good on its election promises to help improve home energy efficiency before the UK hosts the next round of international UN climate talks in Glasgow this year. Peter Smith, a director at the NEA, said UK residential emissions \u201care rising at a time when the world is looking to us for global leadership\u201d on the climate crisis. Overall, the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions fell by 2% from the year before, to 366m tonnes, mainly because of heavy cuts to the amount of coal used to generate electricity. The country\u2019s cleaner energy system has helped emissions to fall by 43% since 1990. But the government\u2019s official climate advisers, at the Committee on Climate Change, have warned that the housing stock remained \u201cunfit\u201d for the challenge of meeting the UK\u2019s long-term climate targets. But the country\u2019s record on tackling home energy waste has slowed in recent years after government ministers axed schemes to help insulate homes. \u201cImprovements in home insulation and more efficient heating systems are recognised as the cheapest way to cut carbon emissions to reach net zero and end fuel poverty but since 2012 investment in domestic efficiency has declined steeply,\u201d Smith said. At the current rate of progress, the NEA estimates the UK will take 56 years to reach its targets for solid wall insulation and 39 years to meet its goals for loft insulation. The Conservative party manifesto pledged to accelerate the UK\u2019s attempts to combat energy waste by investing \u00a39.2bn on improving efficiency in domestic and public buildings. It also promised a \u00a33.8bn fund to help cut carbon emissions from social housing and \u00a32.5bn for fuel poor homes.

      "bodyText": "Derek Mackay is under intense pressure to quit as a member of the Scottish parliament after being forced to resign as finance secretary for sending hundreds of messages to a 16-year-old boy. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, revealed on Thursday morning that Mackay had stood down from her government hours before he was due to deliver next year\u2019s budget. Four hours later, she told MSPs he had also been suspended from the Scottish National party. In an emergency statement, Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament: \u201cIt was clear to me Derek Mackay\u2019s conduct fell far short of what was expected of a minister.\u201d Opposition leaders said Mackay, 42, should quit immediately as an MSP without waiting for the results of an SNP inquiry. They also questioned why it took Sturgeon 18 hours to announce his suspension. On Thursday, the Scottish Sun published a story about the messages. The paper\u2019s editor, Alan Muir, told the first minister\u2019s office late on Wednesday afternoon it had copies of hundreds of messages that Mackay had sent the schoolboy via Facebook and Instagram.

Ask around the thinktanks and the list of requirements is encyclopaedic. This is akin to running up a down escalator as, due to the lost austerity decade, the century-old north-south gap continues to widen. The economies in the north and Midlands rely more on public services, so cuts hurt them particularly badly.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s mighty pledge to narrow the gap between the richest and poorest regions in the UK is the policy with everything \u2013 except the monumental sums to make it happen. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research reports today that the amount suggested so far gets nowhere near: it is probably generous in thinking the process could be anywhere near done in a decade. Every government talks of doing it, but Johnson\u2019s capture of so many northern seats gives him a mighty new incentive to \u201clevel up\u201d, as the Tories now call it. What would it take? Ask around the thinktanks and the list of requirements is encyclopaedic. This is akin to running up a down escalator as, due to the lost austerity decade, the century-old north-south gap continues to widen. The economies in the north and Midlands rely more on public services, so cuts hurt them particularly badly. Add to that the \u00a312bn cuts to benefits, especially to tax credits, and low-wage areas suffered most. Local government is drained of funds, and the places worst hit are the very same now promised investment: Liverpool has lost the most, West Dorset the least. Unless there is a screeching U-turn, the so-called \u201cfair funding review\u201d, which has been delayed once again, is set to take \u201cdeprivation\u201d out of the measurement, substituting it with \u201crurality\u201d and \u201csparsity of population\u201d. That means taking cash out of poor towns and city districts and giving it to Tory shires. The same is already happening to schools. Here\u2019s the challenge. Andy Haldane, head of the government\u2019s Industrial Strategy Council, warned in a report this week that regional inequality of income is at 1901 levels. Other European countries face similar regional problems, but ours are worse. Yet as a small country, in geographical terms, with most \u201cleft behind\u201d towns within 30 miles of a hub city, we are better placed to correct this. In terms of equalising regions, Germany is the stand-out success. With gigantic effort over 30 years, it has levelled up the east of the country since the fall of the wall. Having started far behind, the former East Germany is now richer than England\u2019s north. \u201cThey spent 10 times more than the [British] government is proposing, on research and development, gold-plated universities and business support,\u201d says Tom Forth, head of data at ODI Leeds, a specialist in regional policy. Germany did it by using cities as hubs: he points to those cities needing fast train, tram and bus services to local towns. Symbolic, in a bad way, was Grant Shapps grandly announcing \u00a3500m to reopen the Beeching lines closed in the 1960s \u2013 that\u2019s enough for 25 miles of track. Too many cities, meanwhile, Leeds and Bradford being the biggest examples, have no metro or tram network. Rectifying this will be costly. But now we know that HS2 will cost around \u00a3100bn, no sum can ever be dismissed as too expensive. Rhetoric and promises are already running dangerously far ahead of any \u201clevelling up\u201d that people will ever actually see. Local funds to revive high streets, and fleets of fast, frequent buses could be quick wins, funded by taxing the online companies that destroy shops. Sajid Javid talks of \u201chuman capital\u201d, and how it is much needed in these areas. If he means it, then the budget should reallocate investment in people to the capital spending balance sheets, rather than current spending. That would allow generous borrowing for a surge in further education courses for all ages, which are as good for growth as pouring concrete. It would take 30% more just to get back to 2010 further education spending \u2013 and that wasn\u2019t exactly nirvana. Faced with the Bank of England\u2019s gloomy forecast of 1.1% growth for the next three years, Javid\u2019s wildly optimistic promise of 2.8% will need very un-Tory boldness. Will he turn Keynesian and borrow massively to invest, against approaching economic tornadoes? Of course, one easy way to narrow the north-south divide beckons. The south\u2019s wealth relies on the glittering gold of financial services. Brexit plans risk dealing it a hefty blow, sacrificing bankers (unpopular, but a huge chunk of our economy), for fishermen (popular, but negligible economically). The City sent up distress flares after Johnson\u2019s Brexit speech on Monday, reminding him finance is \u201ccritically important\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A German state premier elected with help from the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland has announced he will step down, succumbing to widespread outrage across the country and condemnation from Angela Merkel. A postwar consensus among established parties of shunning the far right was broken on Wednesday when Thomas Kemmerich won the election in the eastern state of Thuringia on the back of votes from the chancellor\u2019s Christian Democratic Union and the aggressively nationalistic AfD. The little-known Free Democrat (FDP) politician told German media on Thursday morning that he was right to have accepted the mandate, arguing that fresh elections would merely play into the hands of the far right and the far left. By lunchtime, however, after a meeting with his party leader, Christian Lindner, Kemmerich had changed his mind. \u201cResignation is unavoidable,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats need democratic majorities.\u201d Merkel had waded into the affair earlier in the day, saying it was \u201cunforgivable\u201d that politicians from her centre-right party voted with the AfD to remove Thuringia\u2019s leftwing premier, and that the outcome \u201chas to be reverted\u201d. The outgoing state premier, Bodo Ramelow, from the leftwing Die Linke party, had emerged as the candidate with the strongest support in last October\u2019s elections and had been widely expected to be sworn in to form a minority government in the third round of voting. Instead it was Kemmerich, whose party had barely sneaked into parliament on 5% of the vote, who won the secret ballot by a single vote. In a tweet sent on Wednesday afternoon, Ramelow drew attention to the fact that it was in Thuringia that Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi party had first entered the German parliament and thus paved its path to power, 90 years ago almost to the week. The AfD\u2019s branch in Thuringia is dominated by the party\u2019s aggressively nationalist wing. Last September a court ruled that the AfD\u2019s state leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, could legally be termed a fascist, saying such a designation \u201crests on verifiable fact\u201d. Speaking during a state visit to South Africa, Merkel described the circumstances of Kemmerich\u2019s election as \u201ca singular process that broke with a fundamental conviction of mine and my party\u2019s, namely that you don\u2019t win majorities with the help of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland.\u201d What will happen next in Thuringia, a relatively small state with a population of 2.1 million, remains far from clear, however. In a move that raises questions over CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s control over the party\u2019s regional groups, its Thuringia branch on Thursday appeared to reject the possibility of fresh elections, saying it wanted to continue to work with Kemmerich. Dissolving the state parliament will need a two-thirds majority \u2013 which would require votes from the CDU or the AfD. Kemmerich could call a vote of no-confidence instead, which would open the door to leftwing ex-premier Ramelow to be voted in after all. The Die Linke politician, who is seen as a moderate within the successor party of the East German Socialist Unity party, has made clear he remains available for the post. Either way the political earthquake in Germany\u2019s east has already done damage to the reputation of the two centre-right parties, Merkel\u2019s CDU and the FDP, a pro-business party with liberal roots that used to be a natural junior coalition partner for the Christian Democrats. Free Democrat leader Lindner, who walked out of coalition talks with the CDU and the Greens in 2017 saying it was \u201cbetter not to govern than govern badly\u201d, faces criticism from his members, several of whom have announced plans to cancel their membership on social media. Having initially voiced his surprise at the outcome of the vote, some reports have since suggested that Lindner was explicitly warned that the AfD could use his candidate as a vehicle to gain political influence. The AfD had fielded its own straw-man candidate in the anonymous third round of voting, without lending him any of its votes. Lindner has announced an internal confidence vote over his leadership for Friday. Merkel too appeared to criticise the FDP. She said Kemmerich gaining a majority only with the help of the far right had been predictable. \u201cTherefore it has to be said that this process is unforgivable and the result has to be reverted,\u201d she said. The events in Thuringia were met with protests in several cities around the country, including Berlin, where about 1,000 people gathered outside the FDP headquarters. In Erfurt, protesters formed a human chain outside the parliament, chanting: \u201cWho betrayed us? Free Democrats!\u201d Leading members of Germany\u2019s \u201cgrand coalition\u201d \u2013 forged between Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the SPD in 2018 \u2013 are due to meet at the weekend to discuss the situation.",

Officers linked a ferry crossing of the Irish Sea on 31 January with a bomb found on a heavy goods vehicle in county Armagh earlier this week. The Police Service of Norther Ireland (PSNI) believes the Continuity IRA (CIRA), a splinter group that rejects the peace process, was responsible for the device. George Clarke, assistant chief constable, told reporters that a phone call was made to a media outlet on 31 January warning that there was a bomb on the trailer of a lorry at Belfast port that was due to sail to Britain.

After the phone warning, police searched truck trailers but found nothing and the ferry sailed as planned without incident, he said. On Monday there was a second phone call to the media outlet, which prompted police to mount a two-day operation involving the search of 400 vehicles, leading to the discovery of a bomb attached to a truck in the Silverwood Industrial Estate in Lurgan.

Over the past month, however, it has been like an Oliver Stone movie out there. It\u2019s the Platoon of ribbon-cutting, the \u2019Nam of nursery visiting. Since Harry and Meghan decided to step back from their royal duties, the general stepping forward of other royals has resulted in a huge uptick in forms of dutifully giving a shit that take longer by train or car. At times it\u2019s difficult to decide whether the Duchess of Cambridge is off to haul herself pointedly round another women\u2019s project, or whether they\u2019re simply re-running the defence of Khe Sanh.</p> <p>Indeed, the two activities arguably have much in common. The royal family has been somewhat under siege in recent months, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-say-they-are-stepping-back-from-royal-family\" title=\"\">the departure of the Sussexes</a> merely the chaser to months of fallout over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2019/aug/29/is-there-a-way-out-of-the-epstein-mess-prince-andrew-hasnt-put-his-fat-finger-on-it\" title=\"\">Prince Andrew\u2019s long friendship with an international underage-sex trafficker</a>.</p> <p>Let\u2019s begin with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/03/baftas-2020-prince-william-diversity\" title=\"\">Prince William\u2019s decision to lecture Sunday\u2019s Bafta audience</a> about the unacceptable lack of diversity in the awards categories, a topic that had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/12/steve-mcqueen-baftas-lack-of-diversity\" title=\"\">much discussed</a> since the shortlists were announced. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with the royals coat-tailing on what other people have been saying. But you do have to salute a family with countless highly paid image advisers who \u2013 a mere TWO DAYS later \u2013 nonetheless allowed Prince Charles to announce that his new ambassador for the British Asian Trust was \u2026 <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/05/entertainment/katy-perry-british-asian-trust-scli-intl/index.html\" title=\"\">Katy Perry</a>. Look, she may not be British.

      "bodyText": "Over the past few years, the royal helicopter took off comparatively infrequently from the field by Kensington Palace. Over the past month, however, it has been like an Oliver Stone movie out there. It\u2019s the Platoon of ribbon-cutting, the \u2019Nam of nursery visiting. Since Harry and Meghan decided to step back from their royal duties, the general stepping forward of other royals has resulted in a huge uptick in forms of dutifully giving a shit that take longer by train or car. At times it\u2019s difficult to decide whether the Duchess of Cambridge is off to haul herself pointedly round another women\u2019s project, or whether they\u2019re simply re-running the defence of Khe Sanh. Indeed, the two activities arguably have much in common. The royal family has been somewhat under siege in recent months, with the departure of the Sussexes merely the chaser to months of fallout over Prince Andrew\u2019s long friendship with an international underage-sex trafficker. Let\u2019s begin with Prince William\u2019s decision to lecture Sunday\u2019s Bafta audience about the unacceptable lack of diversity in the awards categories, a topic that had been much discussed since the shortlists were announced. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with the royals coat-tailing on what other people have been saying. But you do have to salute a family with countless highly paid image advisers who \u2013 a mere TWO DAYS later \u2013 nonetheless allowed Prince Charles to announce that his new ambassador for the British Asian Trust was \u2026 Katy Perry. Look, she may not be British. But she has certainly dressed up as a lot of Asians in her time. We can probably rule out Prince William\u2019s next keynote speech being a hymn to his father entitled OK BOOMER. But with the best will in the world, arguably the most tangible impact he could have on diversity is having a word with his papa. Alas, people who know about these things say that behind the scenes, Prince Charles and his sons prefer to spend much of their time arguing about money \u2013 quite understandable, given how much of it they all have. For her part, Perry was hardly going to say no to the request to assist the charity in its fight against child labour in India, and prepared a short speech for her investiture in which she appeared to accede graciously to the royal bum-pinching role vacated by Dame Geraldine Halliwell some time in the early 00s. \u201cIn my own personal experience, he has an incredibly kind soul,\u201d Katy twinkled of a prince whose altruism famously extends to allowing his servants to squeeze the toothpaste on to the brush for him. \u201cSo kind, that yes, sometimes he talks to his plants,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd he asked me if I could sing to his plants. I will, in the future \u2013 you have my word, sir.\u201d A reminder that all the best British Asians hail from California. Against this faintly blundersome backdrop, then, it is in many ways no surprise to learn that a civil servant at the housing, communities and local government department has written to councils informing them that they are to fly the union jack above town halls in celebration of Prince Andrew\u2019s forthcoming 60th birthday.

The email address provided to Amazon for the purchase of 30 litres of hydrogen peroxide was linked to Hashem Abedi, the Old Bailey was told. Abedi, 22, is accused of helping to plan the May 2017 attack and helping to build the suicide bomb that his brother, Salman, detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. He denies the murder of 22 people aged between eight and 51, as well as attempted murder and conspiring with his brother to cause explosions. The jury was shown chilling CCTV footage of Salman\u2019s movements as he rented a flat in the city centre, dragged bomb-making equipment into the flat in a large blue suitcase, bought shrapnel for the bomb, and carried out a reconnaissance mission to the Manchester Arena before finally detonating the bomb at just after 10.30pm on 22 May 2017. Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, said the email was created to buy hydrogen peroxide, a key ingredient for the bomb, on 20 March 2017. At the same time, the siblings were using a network of unsuspecting family and friends in the Libyan community to buy other ingredients, including large amounts of sulphuric acid, the court heard. Within an hour of Abedi allegedly failing to purchase 10 litres of sulphuric acid using a friend\u2019s details, his mobile phone and car data were pinpointed in the vicinity of Hulme market, in the south of the city, Penny said. Minutes later the email account was created via publicly available wifi. \u201cMuch later, on 3 April 2017, this email address was provided to Amazon for the purchase of 30 litres of hydrogen peroxide,\u201d the prosecutor said. After the bombing, when the brothers\u2019 family home was raided by police, they found the email address handwritten on torn-up pieces of paper in a bin outside, the court heard. Penny said the email was used to make two purchases of hydrogen peroxide, one two days after the email was created and another 13 days later. Both orders were delivered to an empty terraced house belonging to a Libyan acquaintance of the siblings in Rusholme. The court heard that the brothers asked a network of acquaintances, mainly friends and cousins, to purchase two chemicals needed for the production of the homemade explosives. Some friends declined, but others, who believed their cover story that they needed the chemicals for a battery at their parents\u2019 home in Libya, agreed. However, a month before the attack, the brothers, by now having built up a stockpile of chemicals at two addresses in south Manchester, would be forced to hurriedly move the bomb-making ingredients, the court heard On 6 April 2017 the siblings\u2019 parents, Ramadan and Samia, arrived in the UK for a brief visit and the pair were told they would be returning to Libya on one-way tickets in a matter of days on plane tickets bought by their older brother, Ismail. Given their impending departure and fearing that their plans were about to be foiled, the brothers could no longer use various addresses to store the materials for their explosives, the court heard. \u201cThey needed to remove the materials quickly to a safe location, where they could be stored unobtrusively without drawing too much attention to themselves and before they were obliged to return to Libya with their parents,\u201d said Penny. Just 48 hours before their departure, they made a late-night purchase of a white Nissan Micra. The car was subsequently parked at a car park near the siblings\u2019 home, and the pair transferred chemicals and shrapnel to the car. Just hours later, the pair departed for Libya with their parents, the court heard. The brothers took the precaution of leaving one of the addresses \u2013 Somerton Court \u2013 by separate means of transport and with \u201cno small degree of subterfuge\u201d, Penny said. \u201cThe last thing they would have wanted would be for the two of them to be stopped together in the early hours of the morning in the Micra, an uninsured vehicle, which just happened to be full of bomb-making equipment. One way or another, they needed to reduce the risk of the entire operation being compromised.\u201d On his return from Libya, all Salman needed to do was collect what he needed from the Micra \u2026 source some parts necessary to make the bomb viable, and find somewhere suitable both to construct it and to detonate it,\u201d said Penny. Abedi denies the charges. The trial continues.",

It is helpful to Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and favourite in the contest, although perhaps only up to a point. Here are the main findings.</p> <p><strong>1) Among the public at large, Starmer has a clear lead over his three rivals on who is seen as having what it takes to be a good prime minister. </strong>Some 32% of people view him this way, the poll suggests. Rebecca Long-Bailey, his main rival, comes last, with only 14% of people seeing her as having what it takes to be a good PM, and 42% saying she doesn\u2019t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b38c5c27689ef0c98791e1841c72b0512a9d317\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b38c5c27689ef0c98791e1841c72b0512a9d317/0_0_1257_693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling - amongst public as a whole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"551\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling - among public as a whole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ipsos Mori</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Assuming that Labour members would like to elect a leader who can win an election (which is broadly, but not wholly, true), a clear lead on this measure is a strong advantage.</p> <p><strong>2) Starmer also has a clear lead amongst Labour supporters on \u2018having what it takes to be a good prime minster\u2019</strong>. Again, Long-Bailey is last on this measure and, as in the chart above, Starmer\u2019s lead over Long-Bailey here amounts to 18 points (although, proportionally, that counts for less on these figures). Starmer may be moderately encouraged by this. But Labour supporters are not the same as the Labour members who (along with registered supporters and affiliate members) will be deciding the next leader. And, although members would like a leader seen as having what it takes to be a good PM, separate polling of Labour members published recently showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/16/labour-leadership-contest-nandy-praised-for-neil-interview-as-poll-suggests-long-bailey-in-lead-live-news?page=with:block-5e206d508f088d80a182c0a7#block-5e206d508f088d80a182c0a7\">they rank having strong political convictions as being a more important trait in a leader than appealing to average voters.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6652ad28a88f414c0caf60df78471796eca9950f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6652ad28a88f414c0caf60df78471796eca9950f/0_0_1253_692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling - amongst Labour supporters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"552\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling - among Labour supporters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ipsos Mori</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3) People are more likely to say they would vote Labour at the next election with Starmer leading the party than with any of his rivals - but on this measure his lead over Emily Thornberry, Lisa Nandy and Long-Bailey is more modest.</strong> These figures suggest that Labour will still start well behind the Tories whoever wins the leadership. (The same <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/ipsos-mori-political-monitor-attitudes-labour-leadership-candidates\">Ipsos Mori poll today</a> puts the Conservatives on 47% and Labour on 30% on voting intention - a 17-point lead.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d3e61969e854dc74ea8a50aaddfcb9f70f3b53e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d3e61969e854dc74ea8a50aaddfcb9f70f3b53e/0_0_1235_690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling - amongst public as a whole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"559\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling - among public as a whole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ipsos Mori</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4) And Starmer would be better at getting non-Labour supporters to consider voting Labour at the next election, the poll suggests - although most non-Labour supporters say they would still be unlikely to back the party even with Starmer in charge.</strong> Only 20% of non-Labour supporters say Starmer would make them likely to back the party. For Long-Bailey, the figure is 12%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f638a7ad422f58ca0fb267c3689bfacb8455133\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f638a7ad422f58ca0fb267c3689bfacb8455133/0_0_1258_694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling - among non-Labour supporters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"552\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling - among non-Labour supporters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ipsos Mori</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is one other important point to make about the polling.

Now the first review (of sorts) is in, and it is not complimentary. In a highly unusual move, the <strong>House of Commons</strong> has issued a statement condemning Bercow for naming members of staff. Commons officials, like civil servants, would normally expect not to be identified or criticised by name in a book like this because they are deemed not to have a right of reply. </p> <p>In a statement described as \u201cregarding publication of the former Speaker\u2019s autobiography\u201d, a House of Commons spokesman said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>House of Commons staff work incredibly hard to enable the effective functioning of our democracy and have a right to expect that their privacy be respected. It is unacceptable to publicly name current or former staff without their prior knowledge or authority, especially for the purpose of financial gain or commercial success. A crucial element of the work of House of Commons staff is to provide confidential, impartial advice to MPs. Breaking this confidentiality undermines this important principle and also places staff in a position from which they are unable to respond.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The statement goes on to say that Commons staff who have suffered bullying should report it. (Bercow has been accused of bullying his staff by several senior figures, although he strongly denies it.) The Commons spokesman said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Parliament\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/privileges/UKParliamentBehaviourCode.pdf\"><em>Behaviour Code</em></a><em> makes clear the standards of behaviour expected of everyone in parliament, whether staff, members of the House of Lords, MPs or visitors. There is zero tolerance for abuse or harassment. We strongly encourage anyone who has experienced bullying or harassment in parliament to submit a complaint via the independent complaints and grievance scheme. In addition, all current and former staff can access the employee assistance programme for emotional support.</em></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a84d97add16eedd42b80a54da6d2b4640efd3aaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a84d97add16eedd42b80a54da6d2b4640efd3aaf/0_5_3946_2367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T13:00:57.024Z\">at 1.00pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3c05628f086a28115a6b23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T12:26:35.546Z\">12.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At first minister\u2019s questions MSPs are now raising other issues, but here is a clip of Jackson Carlaw asking about Derek Mackay a few minutes ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCScotlandNews/status/1225394520097001472\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jackson_Carlaw?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Jackson_Carlaw</a> of Scottish Conservatives asks what assurances the FM has received that this is the &quot;only example\u201d of Derek Mackay\u2019s \u201cunacceptable behaviour\u201d.<br><br>Nicola Sturgeon says she is not aware of any further allegations, and only became aware of this story last night <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FMQs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FMQs</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xQuY7qv7FD\">pic.twitter.com/xQuY7qv7FD</a></p>&mdash; BBC Scotland News (@BBCScotlandNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCScotlandNews/status/1225394520097001472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 6, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3c044b8f08e1332473e383\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T12:23:09.625Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>These are from the Birmingham Post and Mail\u2019s <strong>Jonathan Walker</strong> on Liam Byrne winning the Labour nomination for mayor of West Midlands.

In normal circumstances there would be nothing unusual about a former chancellor going to the Lords - it is more or less automatic, if an ex-chancellor wants a peerage - but these nominations did not look likely last year when Johnson was purging rebel pro-Europeans from his party. These moves will be seen as a sign that Johnson is serious about healing leave/remain divisions.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51389602\">the BBC report,</a> Downing Street is also nominating the two former Labour MPs Ian Austen and John Woodcock for peerages. Austen and Woodcock both quit Labour in the last parliament strongly criticising Jeremy Corbyn (although Woodcock was also subject to disciplinary proceedings at the time). At the election both men urged voters to back the Tories on the grounds that they thought Corbyn unfit to be prime minister.</p> <p>And No 10 is also expected to nominate Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, for a peerage too, the BBC reports. In the past there has been speculation about Davidson becoming an MP and standing for the Tory leadership one day, but going to the Lords would suggest she has given up on that ambition.</p> <p>These nominations have not been officially confirmed, and the BBC report stresses that final appointments will be subject to candidates clearing the vetting process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdb89f2a81b1666a8980cf0e2ec96d5b6190a59a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdb89f2a81b1666a8980cf0e2ec96d5b6190a59a/0_160_2620_1572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hammond.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Hammond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mazen Mahdi/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3bdc0a8f08e1332473e1d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T09:28:28.272Z\">9.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast is out.

      "bodyText": "Scotland\u2019s finance secretary, Derek Mackay, has resigned and been suspended as a member of the Scottish National party hours before he was due to deliver next year\u2019s budget after it emerged he had been sending messages to a 16-year-old boy. Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s bid for the Labour leadership has received a boost from polling that suggests he would be more likely than any of his rivals to attract new voters to Labour at the next general election. (See 4.06pm.) A key ally of Jeremy Corbyn has said failing to elect Rebecca Long-Bailey to be the Labour party\u2019s next leader risks turning the clock back to 2015 and the leadership of Ed Miliband. Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy has criticised Richard Burgon over his controversial proposal to ballot members before backing military action, which he put forward as part of his campaign to be the party\u2019s deputy leader. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, has launched a consultation on the UK\u2019s post-Brexit tariff policy, claiming the new system could lead to lower prices for consumers. (See 10.37am.) A flood of senior German politicians visiting the UK this week have been left confused and unnerved by the hardline rhetoric set out by Boris Johnson on trade talks, prompting warnings that the risk of a breakdown, or a no-deal Brexit, is as high as it has ever been. European countries that fish in British waters are pushing for a tougher stance to protect their fishing crews before trade talks with the UK. As Jennifer Rankin reports, western coastal states made the call at a meeting of European Union ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday evening, the first high-level diplomatic talks on chief negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s draft negotiating mandate since its publication on Monday. EU sources said western coastal states with a strong fishing interest wanted Barnier\u2019s text to be clearer that the EU would seek to maintain the same access to British waters, and the same quota shares for 100 types of fish that swim in shared seas. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, has said that Labour is minded to support the emergency government legislation ending automatic early release for terrorist offenders when MPs vote on it next week. (See 11.17am.) The Scottish government has published its budget for 2020-21, saying that no Scottish taxpayer will pay more income tax on their current income under the plans and that \u201cfor the third consecutive year, more than half of Scottish income taxpayers will pay less tax than if they lived anywhere else in the UK.\u201d The full details are here. A \u00a3170m government fund to improve bus services will not be nearly enough to plug a \u00a3700m funding gap in bus provision, Labour and local authorities have said. The House of Commons has severely criticised John Bercow after he named staff members without their prior knowledge in his autobiography. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. From Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge The Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski, who was widely-condemned for speaking alongside far-right politicians at a conference, has been reprimanded by the party but has avoided a suspension, the Press Association reports. Kawczynski defied critics to speak at an event in Rome as part of a line-up that included Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orban and Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini. The MP was condemned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Muslim Council of Britain. A Conservative party spokeswoman said today that Kawczynski\u2019s appearance at the event was unacceptable and that the MP had been reprimanded. She said: Daniel Kawczynski has been formally warned that his attendance at this event was not acceptable, particularly in light of the views of some of those in attendance, which we utterly condemn, and that he is expected to hold himself to higher standards. Daniel has accepted this and apologised. Ipsos Mori has released some interesting polling today (pdf) about the Labour leadership candidates. It is helpful to Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and favourite in the contest, although perhaps only up to a point. Here are the main findings. 1) Among the public at large, Starmer has a clear lead over his three rivals on who is seen as having what it takes to be a good prime minister. Some 32% of people view him this way, the poll suggests. Rebecca Long-Bailey, his main rival, comes last, with only 14% of people seeing her as having what it takes to be a good PM, and 42% saying she doesn\u2019t. Assuming that Labour members would like to elect a leader who can win an election (which is broadly, but not wholly, true), a clear lead on this measure is a strong advantage. 2) Starmer also has a clear lead amongst Labour supporters on \u2018having what it takes to be a good prime minster\u2019. Again, Long-Bailey is last on this measure and, as in the chart above, Starmer\u2019s lead over Long-Bailey here amounts to 18 points (although, proportionally, that counts for less on these figures). Starmer may be moderately encouraged by this. But Labour supporters are not the same as the Labour members who (along with registered supporters and affiliate members) will be deciding the next leader. And, although members would like a leader seen as having what it takes to be a good PM, separate polling of Labour members published recently showed that they rank having strong political convictions as being a more important trait in a leader than appealing to average voters. 3) People are more likely to say they would vote Labour at the next election with Starmer leading the party than with any of his rivals - but on this measure his lead over Emily Thornberry, Lisa Nandy and Long-Bailey is more modest. These figures suggest that Labour will still start well behind the Tories whoever wins the leadership. (The same Ipsos Mori poll today puts the Conservatives on 47% and Labour on 30% on voting intention - a 17-point lead.) 4) And Starmer would be better at getting non-Labour supporters to consider voting Labour at the next election, the poll suggests - although most non-Labour supporters say they would still be unlikely to back the party even with Starmer in charge. Only 20% of non-Labour supporters say Starmer would make them likely to back the party. For Long-Bailey, the figure is 12%. There is one other important point to make about the polling. Almost half of those asked about the four Labour leadership candidates either said that they did not know whether or not they had what it takes to be a good PM, or said that they did not have a view either way (which might just be another way of saying they did not know). Here are the detailed figures amongst all respondents, but the figures from Labour supporters are very similar, as you can see on this chart (pdf). This does not stop Starmer being able to say he is the candidate who seems most likely to be able to win over new voters are the next election. According to these figures, he is. But it does mean that any assessment of that kind is shrouded in uncertainty. A spokesman for John Bercow has defended the former Speaker\u2019s decision to name House of Commons officials in his memoir. (See 12.55pm.) The spokesman said: Given there is a small but highly vocal group of people consistently seeking to blacken his name, it would be odd if Mr Bercow did not comment on their unfounded allegations and the reasons behind them. He was advised by Speaker\u2019s counsel not to do so in detail while he was in office. He is therefore doing so now. If the book had not addressed these issues, he would rightly have been accused of serious omission. Critics are entitled to air their views. What they are not entitled to do is to make unfounded allegations and expect Mr Bercow to say nothing in return. Here is Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson\u2019s main rival for the Tory leadership last year, on the reports that Ken Clarke is getting a peerage. (See 9.55am.) This is from the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is unhappy about the reports saying Boris Johnson is offering peerages to Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond. (See 9.55am.) In a statement, the Institute of Directors welcomes the fact that the government is consulting on its post-Brexit tariff schedule (see 10.37am and 11.55am), but says \u201cbusinesses also need a much clearer understanding of how the new tariff regime would intersect with our upcoming trade negotiations and the continuity agreements [the Department for International Trade] is trying to roll over\u201d. Labour has now released the figures for the ballot in which Liam Byrne was selected as the party\u2019s candidate for West Midlands mayor. (See 11.24am and 12.23pm.) This is from PoliticsHome\u2019s Matt Honeycombe-Foster. Richard Burgon, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership, has received a mixed response to his suggestion that Labour should not support the use of military action without members first voting in favour (unless the UN has given its approval, or the country faces a national emergency). Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has backed the idea. Damian McBride, Gordon Brown\u2019s former communications chief, who now advises Emily Thornberry, has offered qualified critique on Twitter. But, as my colleague Kate Proctor reports, Lisa Nandy, a candidate for the Labour leadership, has said she could not disagree with the plan more. The Labour MP Neil Coyle has described the idea as \u201chorse shit\u201d. And this is from Anna Turley, who was a Labour MP until she lost her seat at the election. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Yesterday John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker, held the launch party for his memoir, Unspeakable. Now the first review (of sorts) is in, and it is not complimentary. In a highly unusual move, the House of Commons has issued a statement condemning Bercow for naming members of staff. Commons officials, like civil servants, would normally expect not to be identified or criticised by name in a book like this because they are deemed not to have a right of reply. In a statement described as \u201cregarding publication of the former Speaker\u2019s autobiography\u201d, a House of Commons spokesman said: House of Commons staff work incredibly hard to enable the effective functioning of our democracy and have a right to expect that their privacy be respected. It is unacceptable to publicly name current or former staff without their prior knowledge or authority, especially for the purpose of financial gain or commercial success. A crucial element of the work of House of Commons staff is to provide confidential, impartial advice to MPs. Breaking this confidentiality undermines this important principle and also places staff in a position from which they are unable to respond. The statement goes on to say that Commons staff who have suffered bullying should report it. (Bercow has been accused of bullying his staff by several senior figures, although he strongly denies it.) The Commons spokesman said: Parliament\u2019s Behaviour Code makes clear the standards of behaviour expected of everyone in parliament, whether staff, members of the House of Lords, MPs or visitors. There is zero tolerance for abuse or harassment. We strongly encourage anyone who has experienced bullying or harassment in parliament to submit a complaint via the independent complaints and grievance scheme. In addition, all current and former staff can access the employee assistance programme for emotional support. At first minister\u2019s questions MSPs are now raising other issues, but here is a clip of Jackson Carlaw asking about Derek Mackay a few minutes ago. These are from the Birmingham Post and Mail\u2019s Jonathan Walker on Liam Byrne winning the Labour nomination for mayor of West Midlands. (See 11.24am.) @LabourPete is Pete Lowe. Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, is asking questions now. He says Derek Mackay described his actions as \u201cfoolish\u201d. (See 9.09am.) But they were \u201cbeyond foolish\u201d, he says; they were \u201can abuse of power\u201d and \u201cnothing short of predatory\u201d. He welcomes the SNP\u2019s decision to suspend Mackay, but he says he should also stand down as an MSP. Carlaw reads out the NSPCC definition of grooming, and suggests it implies in this case. Sturgeon says she does not want to minimise what happened at all. But she repeats her point about the need for due process. During first minister\u2019s questions Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative leader, says Derek Mackay has 26,000 followers on Twitter. He asks Nicola Sturgeon if Derek Mackay has contacted other boys. And he asks what support has been offered to the boy\u2019s family. Sturgeon says until last night she was not aware of Mackay\u2019s contacts with the boy. She does not condone what he did at all, she says. She says she is not aware of the details of the family. But if they wanted to speak to her, she would be happy to speak to them, she says. She says all parties have faced allegations about party members. They all should apply high standards, she says. Carlaw asks if the reputation of the parliament can be maintained if Mackay remains an MSP. Sturgeon says she oversees the ministerial code. It was clear to her that he could not stay a minister, she says. She says, no matter how upset and shocked people are, there is a need for due process. She says there are matters Mackay will have to reflect on. In the Scottish parliament Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, has just made a statement about Derek Mackay. She said he has been suspended from the SNP and from the SNP\u2019s parliamentary group. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, has issued two written statements today: one covering the global tariff consultation (see 10.37am); and the other covering the government\u2019s plans for free trade agreements with countries outside the EU. David Henig, the former civil servant who now heads the UK Trade Policy Project, has posted some provisional analysis on Twitter. CPTPP is the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership is an Asian trade agreement that succeeded the TPP one (trans-Pacific partnership) that was nixed by President Trump. From my colleague Rowena Mason, who has been at this morning\u2019s Downing Street lobby briefing This morning\u2019s Sun splashed on a story saying councils have been told to fly the union jack for Prince Andrew\u2019s 60th birthday on 19 February. Given the scandal about his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the proposal has triggered fierce protests. Labour has chosen MP Liam Byrne to be its candidate in May\u2019s mayoral elections in West Midlands, beating former Respect party leader Salma Yaqoob in a bitter contest. The Conservatives will no doubt now spend the next few months reminding voters that it was Byrne who left the note after Labour lost power in 2010, telling his successor as chief secretary to the Treasury \u201cI\u2019m afraid there is no money\u201d. Byrne has apologised multiple times for the letter, saying he will regret it forever. Byrne, MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill since 2004, will go up against Andy Street, former managing director of John lewis, who took a surprise win for the Conservatives in the inaugural elections in 2017. Labour should invite council leaders to attend its shadow cabinet as it tries to rebuild the party following the general election, leadership contender Lisa Nandy has said. My colleague Kate Proctor has the full story here. In the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house, has just announced next week\u2019s business. He did not name a day for the debate on the emergency terror legislation proposed by the government, but he said the government wanted to introduce it \u201cat the earliest opportunity\u201d and he said that he might make an emergency business statement next week to announce the timetable for the legislation. As Kate Proctor reported yesterday, Whitehall officials have said the bill will go through the Commons next week, before clearing the Lords in the week beginning 24 February, after the February half-term recess. The government wants the bill on the statute book by 27 February - just one day before a convicted terrorist who disseminated Islamic State propaganda via Twitter is due for automatic release. Responding to Rees-Mogg, Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, signalled that Labour would vote for the emergency legislation. She told MPs: We on this side say that terrorist prisoners should not be automatically released, but should be subject to parole board assessment before release during their sentences. So the opposition will look carefully at what the government has to say, and work with the government on a cross-party basis in the national interest, and to protect our citizens. Vaz also said she hoped the opposition would be given sufficient time to look at the legislation. More than 3 million EU citizens have applied to live and work in the UK after Brexit, according to the Home Office. As the Press Association reports, the department has announced the latest up-to-date internal figures of how many people have applied for the EU settlement scheme. More than 2.7 million applicants have been granted permission to remain in the UK so far, according to the announcement. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, claims that British consumers and businesses could benefit from lower prices under plans for new UK tariffs that will apply from 1 January 2021, when the UK\u2019s post-Brexit transition period is over. She made the claim as she announced the Department for International Trade\u2019s consultation on what it describes as the \u201cUK global tariff\u201d - the tariff schedule that will apply to all countries exporting to the UK that do not have a free trade agreement. In a statement Truss says: The UK has left the EU and it is time for us to look forward to our future as an independent, global champion of free trade. It is vitally important that we now move away from complex tariff schedule imposed on us by the European Union. High tariffs impinge on businesses and raise costs for consumers. This is our opportunity to set our own tariff strategy that is right for UK consumers and businesses across our country. I am calling on people, businesses and civil society groups to seize this opportunity to take part in our consultation and tell us what would work best for them. Currently the UK has to apply EU tariffs, but from next year it will be free to apply its own \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d (MFN) tariff schedule. MFN is a standard term in trade, but it can be misleading. Although it sounds as if countries getting MFN tariffs are getting special treatment, in fact it means they are getting the same treatment as everyone else - apart from countries who are getting special treatment because of a free trade deal. In its news release DIT says: This bespoke regime, known as the UK Global Tariff, will ensure UK businesses compete on fair terms with the rest of the world whilst benefitting households through greater choice and lower prices. Ultimately, this will also help to make it easier to trade, drive up investment, and deliver more quality jobs across the UK. It also explains some of the plans that feature in the consultation. As part of the consultation, the government is seeking views on: simplifying and tailoring the tariff to suit UK businesses and households, such as removing tariffs of less than 2.5% and rounding tariffs down to the nearest 2.5%, 5% or 10% band; removing tariffs on key inputs to production which could reduce costs for UK manufacturers; and removing tariffs where the UK has zero or limited domestic production which could help to lower prices for consumers. This is from Children 1st, a Scottish children\u2019s charity, on Derek Mackay. Jackson Carlaw, the acting Scottish Conservative leader, has suggested that Derek Mackay should stand down as an MSP not just as finance secretary. Carlaw told Sky News: I think the whole parliament will be in shock. I think we are all bewildered that Derek could have undertaken such a colossal act of judgment. The first minister is going to be making a statement before first minister\u2019s questions this morning. I don\u2019t think if she believes that simply accepting his resignation from government is an end to the matter - I think there will be huge questions to be asked. Parents will be concerned. And I think many colleagues in parliament will wonder how on earth Mr Mackay could continue to enjoy the confidence of his constituents, or parliament. It is a huge blow to politics. Boris Johnson\u2019s father, Stanley, acted as an unlikely diplomatic backchannel to No 10, expressing Chinese concern that the prime minister had not offered China a personal message of support about the coronavirus outbreak, my colleague Patrick Wintour reports. Yesterday Radio 4 broadcast a documentary by Nick Robinson exploring what Boris Johnson really believes. It included an interview with Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, who was surprisingly positive about the prime minister given that Johnson deprived him of the Tory whip after a Brexit rebellion, effectively ending Hammond\u2019s career because it meant Hammond could not stand at the election as a Conservative candidate. Despite all this Hammond told the programme: We clashed on one issue and one issue only really, which was Brexit. On almost all other policy areas we\u2019ve always agreed. And I\u2019ve always seen Boris as a big tent, centrist Conservative politician. Hammond\u2019s comments make a lot more sense in the light of the report from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg that Downing Street is nominating Hammond for a peerage. Ken Clarke, another former Tory chancellor who had the whip removed after rebelling over Brexit, is also on the list, Kuenssberg reports. In normal circumstances there would be nothing unusual about a former chancellor going to the Lords - it is more or less automatic, if an ex-chancellor wants a peerage - but these nominations did not look likely last year when Johnson was purging rebel pro-Europeans from his party. These moves will be seen as a sign that Johnson is serious about healing leave/remain divisions. According to the BBC report, Downing Street is also nominating the two former Labour MPs Ian Austen and John Woodcock for peerages. Austen and Woodcock both quit Labour in the last parliament strongly criticising Jeremy Corbyn (although Woodcock was also subject to disciplinary proceedings at the time). At the election both men urged voters to back the Tories on the grounds that they thought Corbyn unfit to be prime minister. And No 10 is also expected to nominate Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, for a peerage too, the BBC reports. In the past there has been speculation about Davidson becoming an MP and standing for the Tory leadership one day, but going to the Lords would suggest she has given up on that ambition. These nominations have not been officially confirmed, and the BBC report stresses that final appointments will be subject to candidates clearing the vetting process. The Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast is out. Rowena Mason and the panel discuss the launch of the COP 26 global climate change conference, the pledge for Labour party reform from leadership candidates and this week\u2019s press boycott at No 10. Plus: Paul Owen on the chaos for the Democrats in Iowa. And these are from Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 finance spokesman in the Scottish parliament. This is from the Labour MP Jess Phillips on Derek Mackay. Boris Johnson is planning a major cabinet reshuffle this week, but in Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, is being forced into an extremely unwelcome mini-reshuffle following the resignation of her finance secretary, Derek Mackay, who had been seen as a potential future SNP leader. Last night the Scottish Sun revealed that Mackay had been sending multiple online messages to a schoolboy. Within the last hour Mackay announced his resignation. The timing is particularly awkward because he was due to deliver the Scottish government\u2019s budget later today. A junior minister will give the budget speech instead. Here is my colleague Severin Carrell\u2019s story. And here is Mackay\u2019s statement. I take full responsibility for my actions. I have behaved foolishly and I am truly sorry. I apologise unreservedly to the individual involved and his family. I spoke last night with the first minister and tendered my resignation with immediate effect. Serving in government has been a huge privilege and I am sorry to have let colleagues and supporters down. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.15am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 10am: Lisa Nandy, the Labour leadership candidate, gives a speech on local government. 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, takes questions in the Commons on next week\u2019s business. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 12pm: Kate Forbes, the Scottish public finance minister, delivers the Scottish government\u2019s budget in the Scottish parliament, replacing Derek Mackay, who resigned this morning as finance minister over texts to a 16-year-old boy. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has problems at Tottenham. You may have heard of them but here is a precis. In the absence of Harry Kane he has no centre-forward. The squad have imbalances. Son Heung-min is not a No 9 but he has had to play there. Lucas Moura is not really a central striker but has had to play there.</p> \n<p>Ryan Sessegnon is not a left-back but he has had to play there. Tanguy Ndombele cannot last 90 minutes and, to put it bluntly, it is time he sorted it out. Players are in the red zone in terms of fitness and are succumbing to injury \u2013 they cannot cope with the schedule.</p> \n<p>Mourinho used an old football proverb on Wednesday to describe the situation, one that is popular in Spain and was probably brought to British shores by John Toshack, who managed extensively in Spain and delighted in using it at any opportunity when he was in charge of Wales. It is the one about the undersized blanket.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like when you have to pull a blanket up and your feet are left out,\u201d Mourinho said after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/tottenham-southampton-fa-cup-replay-match-report\" title=\"\">3-2 FA Cup replay win</a> at home to Southampton. \u201cAnd then you cover your feet but half your body is out.

Like many public speakers and writers Mourinho is obsessed by the Rule of Three, the principle that states ideas presented in threes are inherently more rhythmic and memorable.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne game we have players A, B and C out and then the next game we are without D, E and F,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very difficult season.\u201d</p> \n<p>Problems, problems, problems. Already without Kane, Ben Davies and Moussa Sissoko, Mourinho mentioned how he could not select Giovani Lo Celso, \u00c9rik Lamela and Steven Bergwijn against Southampton.

      "bodyText": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has problems at Tottenham. You may have heard of them but here is a precis. In the absence of Harry Kane he has no centre-forward. The squad have imbalances. Son Heung-min is not a No 9 but he has had to play there. Lucas Moura is not really a central striker but has had to play there. Ryan Sessegnon is not a left-back but he has had to play there. Tanguy Ndombele cannot last 90 minutes and, to put it bluntly, it is time he sorted it out. Players are in the red zone in terms of fitness and are succumbing to injury \u2013 they cannot cope with the schedule. Mourinho used an old football proverb on Wednesday to describe the situation, one that is popular in Spain and was probably brought to British shores by John Toshack, who managed extensively in Spain and delighted in using it at any opportunity when he was in charge of Wales. It is the one about the undersized blanket. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you have to pull a blanket up and your feet are left out,\u201d Mourinho said after the 3-2 FA Cup replay win at home to Southampton. \u201cAnd then you cover your feet but half your body is out. That\u2019s us. But [we have] amazing spirit and that is something I like.\u201d Mourinho also put it another way because why use one figure of speech when you can reinforce the message with at least another? \u201cI had to manage this chess game without pieces,\u201d he said. \u201cNo bishops, no kings, no queens.\u201d He is gloriously theatrical and holds his audience with those long pauses, the exaggerated facial expressions, the hypnotic intonation to his voice. Like many public speakers and writers Mourinho is obsessed by the Rule of Three, the principle that states ideas presented in threes are inherently more rhythmic and memorable. \u201cOne game we have players A, B and C out and then the next game we are without D, E and F,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very difficult season.\u201d Problems, problems, problems. Already without Kane, Ben Davies and Moussa Sissoko, Mourinho mentioned how he could not select Giovani Lo Celso, \u00c9rik Lamela and Steven Bergwijn against Southampton. The first two had muscle fatigue; Bergwijn was ineligible. Dele Alli was fit only to be a substitute. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even play with three up [in a 4-3-3 as in the 2-0 home win over Manchester City on Sunday] \u2013 I had only two,\u201d Mourinho exclaimed, even if this overlooked the fact Sessegnon can surely play on the left of a front three. So Mourinho started with a 3-5-2 system, with Son and Lucas up top and Ndombele as one of the central attacking midfielders asked to connect the play. Except this was not ideal because Ndombele is short of peak condition. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to start a player who doesn\u2019t have 90 minutes in him when there is a chance you could go to extra time,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cYou know with that player you already have one substitution. But without Dele Alli, Lamela and Lo Celso I need somebody to connect a little bit. So I have to start with Tanguy even though I know he couldn\u2019t play. So after one hour they [the fans] don\u2019t follow. Maybe they think this coach is an idiot for taking him off.

Most managers try to put on a positive face in public while being critical behind the scenes but Mourinho wants the gallery for his tough love and ruthless gestures, which have included substituting Eric Dier after 29 minutes against Olympiakos. Mourinho hooked Jan Vertonghen after 54 minutes of the Southampton replay and the centre-half was visibly shattered, traipsing around the perimeter of the pitch before channelling Rodin\u2019s The Thinker on the bench.

Alan Menken and Howard Ashman \u2013 Under the Sea (The Little Mermaid, 1989)</h2> <p>The Little Mermaid was the film that began the Disney renaissance, which would go on to dominate the Academy\u2019s best-song category in the 1990s. Under the Sea is an early demonstration of how: beneath its perky, kid-friendly calypso lurks a set of lyrics that do more than your average children\u2019s song, dabbling in social comment.</p> <h2>38. Alan Menken and Tim Rice \u2013 A Whole New World (Aladdin, 1992)</h2> <p>The only Disney song to reach No 1 in the US \u2013 a fairly incredible state of affairs in itself \u2013 knocked Whitney Houston\u2019s I Will Always Love You off the top of the charts and similarly prevented The Bodyguard\u2019s frenzied epic I Have Nothing from scooping the Oscar for best song.</p> <h2>37. Common and John Legend \u2013 Glory (Selma, 2014)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d211e23c69123e5d4adebf6d1ed2c3d2506bcc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d211e23c69123e5d4adebf6d1ed2c3d2506bcc1/0_0_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selma, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Oyelowo and Carmen Ejogo in<em> </em>Selma, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/PATHE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Common and John Legend\u2019s theme from the civil-rights epic Selma is one of the less celebrated recent Oscar-winners. It became only a minor hit, which seems surprising: it serves up tension and euphoria in equal measure, and Legend\u2019s closing burst of extemporised vocals is spine-tingling.</p> <h2>36. Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington \u2013 The Ballad of High Noon (High Noon, 1952)</h2> <p>Frankie Laine\u2019s version of The Ballad of High Noon \u2013 sung in the movie by Tex Ritter \u2013 was on the first ever British chart. It was a rare hint of brooding darkness amid a set of songs big on cosy sentimentality. But Ritter\u2019s version is darker and more brooding still, set to a stark arrangement of drums and guitar, full of foreboding: quite unlike any previous Oscar winner.</p> <h2>35. Stephen Sondheim \u2013 Sooner or Later (Dick Tracy, 1990)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee860ff07eccb8fa6ba2df2af103e0eaba1cc879\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee860ff07eccb8fa6ba2df2af103e0eaba1cc879/0_73_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madonna in Dick Tracy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Madonna in Dick Tracy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Touchstone/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Dick Tracy soundtrack album I\u2019m Breathless is a largely overlooked moment in Madonna\u2019s back catalogue, but Sooner or Later is genuinely great. It is a Stephen Sondheim-penned 30s jazz pastiche, far outside of the singer\u2019s musical and vocal comfort zone, but she pulls it off with considerable style.</p> <h2>34. Three 6 Mafia \u2013 It\u2019s Hard Out Here for a Pimp (Hustle &amp; Flow, 2005)</h2> <p>Certainly the most strikingly titled Oscar-winning song of all time, Three 6 Mafia\u2019s unflinching gangsta rap track also appears to pay gentle homage to a previous best original song triumph: there is a distinct hint of the blaxploitation soundtrack style minted by Isaac Hayes\u2019 Theme From Shaft about the music.</p> <h2>33. Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock \u2013 Take My Breath Away (Top Gun, 1986)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"958bae1e756098a0cc78086268431e827d88db1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/958bae1e756098a0cc78086268431e827d88db1d/0_45_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Cruise in Top Gun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Cruise in Top Gun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/PARAMOUNT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Flashdance\u2019s 1983 victory, ballads \u2013 especially power ballads \u2013 reigned supreme at the Oscars for the rest of the decade: devotees of Up Where We Belong or, indeed, I\u2019ve Had the Time of My Life might disagree, but the pick is Berlin\u2019s Moroder-produced, synth-heavy Top Gun smash: a song as evocative of its era as the smell of Studio Line hair mousse.</p> <h2>32. Michael Gore and Dean Pitchford \u2013 Fame (Fame, 1980)</h2> <p>Bizarrely, Fame only became a UK hit two years after winning an Oscar: it was the spin-off TV series, not the movie, that turned it into a No 1. It has never since quite escaped the tag of being the sound of a million early 80s school discos, masking what a smartly constructed disco-rock hybrid it was.</p> <h2>31 Harry Warren and Al Dubin \u2013 Lullaby of Broadway (Gold Diggers of 1935, 1935)</h2> <p>The second winner of the best original song Oscar was used in three separate films in 1935. Seventy-five years later, you can still see why: the melody is hard to resist and its depiction of New York nightlife makes staggering home at dawn sound like the most fun it is possible to have.</p> <h2>30. Adele and Paul Epworth \u2013 Skyfall (Skyfall, 2012)</h2> <p>Incredibly, Skyfall was the first Bond theme to win an Oscar \u2013 most of the legendary 60s and 70s themes didn\u2019t warrant a nomination. It does a fantastic job of updating the traditional high-drama approach of the series, with a particular nod to Shirley Bassey\u2019s explosive approach: Adele\u2019s vocal is similarly brassy and effective.</p> <h2>29. Fred Carlin, Jimmy Griffin and Robb Royer \u2013 For All We Know (Lovers and Other Strangers, 1970)</h2> <p>A huge hit at the time, the romantic comedy Lovers and Other Strangers isn\u2019t much remembered 50 years on. For All We Know, a ballad written by two members of Bread, is, largely because of the Carpenters\u2019 definitive version. Karen Carpenter\u2019s astonishing voice, as ever, teases out a sense of doubt and unease under the romantic exterior and easy-listening gloss.</p> <h2>28. AR Rahman and Gulzar \u2013 Jai Ho (Slumdog Millionaire, 2008)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9af275bec80cb1a240377cc16b972504a88e6803\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9af275bec80cb1a240377cc16b972504a88e6803/0_155_2480_1489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dev Patel in Slumdog Millionaire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dev Patel in Slumdog Millionaire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c.FoxSearch/Everett / Rex Features/c FoxSearch/Everett /Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Oscars have mostly shied away from songs not sung in English, which makes AR Rahman\u2019s intense, Auto-Tune-heavy Bollywood track something of an anomaly. After its success it variously ended up covered by the Pussycat Dolls, as an internet meme and the Indian National Congress\u2019 2009 general election theme.</p> <h2>27. Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez \u2013 Remember Me (Coco, 2017)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"94cd30f1e0855535c07bfbd86e146da54b8d88ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94cd30f1e0855535c07bfbd86e146da54b8d88ec/603_81_1090_1090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coco, 2107.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coco, 2107.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Pixar/Disney</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Remember Me recurs in different versions throughout Pixar\u2019s Day of the Dead-inspired Coco, from mariachi to Miguel-fronted pop. Every version carries emotional weight, such is the song\u2019s subtle, delicate treatment of the subject of loss. Not the easiest topic to essay in an animated children\u2019s film, but it does it beautifully.</p> <h2>26. Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn \u2013 All the Way (The Joker Is Wild, 1957)</h2> <p>One of umpteen Frank Sinatra hits penned by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Khan, All the Way became so popular that it overshadowed the film in which it was featured; indeed, it overshadowed it to such an extent that The Joker Is Wild \u2013 a downbeat drama about an alcoholic nightclub entertainer, Joe E Lewis \u2013 ended up being briefly renamed after the song.</p> <h2>25. Lady Gaga, Mark Ronson, Anthony Rossomando and Andrew Wyatt \u2013 Shallow (A Star Is Born, 2018)</h2> <p>In a sense, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper\u2019s Shallow is a return to the kind of songs that won Oscars in the 80s: it is in effect an old-fashioned power ballad that shifts from fragility to belting-it-out intensity. But the old tricks still work, as evidenced by its rapturous critical reception.</p> <h2>24. Peter Allen, Burt Bacharach, Christopher Cross &amp; Carole Bayer Sager \u2013 Arthur\u2019s Theme (Best That You Can Do) (Arthur, 1981)</h2> <p>A perennial staple on late-night smooth radio, the years have been kind to Arthur\u2019s Theme. As naff as pop could get on release \u2013 the rise of MTV killed the singer Christopher Cross\u2019s burgeoning career overnight \u2013 the latter-day soft-rock amnesty has allowed people to look beyond the gloss and admit what a fantastic, oddly moving bit of songwriting lies at its centre.</p> <h2>23. Barbra Streisand and Paul Williams \u2013 Evergreen (A Star Is Born, 1976)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efb49769e896c69223d62a777d4412b9593eea15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efb49769e896c69223d62a777d4412b9593eea15/0_220_3144_1886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson in A Star Is Born, 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson in A Star Is Born, 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barbra Streisand\u2019s second Oscar triumph of the decade: another show-stopping ballad that quickly became an MOR standard, this time from the third remake of A Star Is Born, Evergreen boasted a melody written by Streisand that pulled off the trick of sounding instantly familiar, as if it had always existed.</p> <h2>22. Harry Warren and Mack Gordon \u2013 You\u2019ll Never Know (Hello, Frisco, Hello, 1943)</h2> <p>By now, it was obvious that the second world war \u2013 and the United State\u2019s involvement therein \u2013 was having a profound effect on the country\u2019s songwriting: despite coming from a musical set in 1915, You\u2019ll Never Know was a gorgeous balled steeped in a very pertinent kind of longing and trepidation: \u201cYou went away and my heart went with you, I speak your name in every prayer.\u201d</p> <h2>21. Paul Jabara \u2013 Last Dance (Thank God It\u2019s Friday, 1978)</h2> <p>The first disco Oscar-winner \u2013 nothing from Saturday Night Fever was even nominated \u2013 is a prime example of the Donna Summer-Giorgio Moroder partnership at its peak: a ballad that turns into an ecstatic floor-filler and exemplifies the tension between euphoric music and melancholy lyrics almost invariably at the heart of the best disco.</p> <h2>20. Johnny Mandel and Paul Francis Webster \u2013 The Shadow of Your Smile (The Sandpiper, 1965)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef20e0f56459bc19e06281c2a456bb89ea2cf6d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef20e0f56459bc19e06281c2a456bb89ea2cf6d9/0_62_2280_1315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in The Sandpiper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"577\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in The Sandpiper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the mid-60s, the songs that won Oscars could seem a little stodgy compared with the popular music erupting elsewhere. But Johnny Mandel and Paul Francis Webster\u2019s love theme from The Sandpiper is such a beautiful song it transcends the middle of the road. If you want to hear a hipper version than that of Andy Williams or Tony Bennett, check out the Delfonics\u2019 stunning 1968 soft-soul take.</p> <h2>19. Rodgers and Hammerstein \u2013 It Might As Well Be Spring (State Fair, 1945)</h2> <p>Originally from Rogers and Hammerstein\u2019s musical State Fair, there is a compelling argument that It Might As Well Be Spring really came into its own when uncoupled from the soundtrack and reworked as a jazz standard: Sarah Vaughan\u2019s slow, small-hours version on her 1955 album Sarah Vaughan In Hi-Fi wipes the floor with the original, revealing the song in its full glory.</p> <h2>18. Burt Bacharach and Hal David \u2013 Raindrops Keep Fallin\u2019 on My Head (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969)</h2> <p>According to the singer BJ Thomas, Bacharach and David\u2019s song initially received a muted response: released as a single in October 1969, it didn\u2019t become a hit until Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was released two months later, its gentle optimism understandably popular as the 60s drew to a messy end.</p> <h2>17. Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin \u2013 Thanks for the Memory (The Big Broadcast of 1938, 1938)</h2> <p>A fond recollection of failed marriage \u2013 \u201cparted by a slight thing, I wonder if we did the right thing\u201d \u2013 Bob Hope\u2019s signature tune strikes a beautiful note of wistful melancholy. Note that the apparently risqu\u00e9 line about enjoying \u201chash with Dinty Moore\u201d alas refers only to potatoes: a Dinty Moore is a corned-beef sandwich popular in Detroit.</p> <h2>16. James Horner and Will Jennings \u2013 My Heart Will Go On (Titanic, 1997)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a34f99314724f40333ba46acde5dd4089f962d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a34f99314724f40333ba46acde5dd4089f962d7/7_30_3897_2338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet in Titanic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet in Titanic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20thC Fox/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>C\u00e9line Dion hated it and was beset by menstrual cramps while recording it, and Ministry fan James Cameron didn\u2019t want a pop song at the end of Titanic, yet My Heart Will Go On became the powerhouse movie theme to end them all. Not so much a song, as the climax of a song that lasts for five minutes.</p> <h2>15. Ray Evans and Jay Livingston \u2013 Que Sera Sera (The Man Who Knew Too Much, 1956)</h2> <p>Alfred Hitchock\u2019s films are seldom celebrated for their abundance of catchy songs, but Que Sera Sera might be the catchiest Oscar-winner of all: it turned its title into a commonly used expression in English and ended up transformed into everything from a football chant to a soul song, the latter by Sly Stone.</p> <h2>14. Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez \u2013 Let It Go (Frozen, 2013)</h2> <p>After Can You Feel the Love Tonight, a lot of Disney\u2019s Oscar-winning songs felt anti-climactic. Let It Go, however, ticked every box: it avoided schmaltz, packed a huge, karaoke-friendly chorus, was variously claimed as an LGBTQ+ anthem and an affirmation of autism. Ubiquity followed.</p> <h2>13. Bruce Springsteen \u2013 Streets of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, 1993)</h2> <p>The Aids drama Philadelphia spawned two Oscar-nominated songs. It\u2019s a moot point whether Neil Young\u2019s desolate title track should have lost out to Streets of Philadelphia, but Bruce Springsteen\u2019s song, perhaps an easier listen, is magnificent nonetheless: a subtle, brooding examination of illness and loss.</p> <h2>12. Irving Berlin \u2013 White Christmas (Holiday Inn, 1942)</h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine now how groundbreaking White Christmas was. It more-or-less invented the modern secular Christmas song, its success revealing a vast market for nostalgic depictions of the festive season. Remarkably, it originally came with a hint of cynicism attached: its opening verse depicted its protagonist sunning himself beneath the palm trees of LA.</p> <h2>11. Marvin Hamlisch, Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman \u2013 The Way We Were (The Way We Were, 1973)</h2> <p>MOR ballads dominated the Oscars in the 1970s: some are largely forgotten, others became standards. The Way We Were, a heartstring-tugging depiction of a failed relationship that became Barbra Streisand\u2019s theme song, belongs in the latter category. Intriguingly, some critics suggested its regretful tone chimed with America\u2019s post-Vietnam mood.</p> <h2>10. Bob Dylan \u2013 Things Have Changed (Wonder Boys, 2000)</h2> <p>No Oscar-winning song has been subjected to as much analysis as Things Have Changed. Dylanologists have picked apart its lyrical allusions and claimed it as everything from a commentary on the actual movie to a prophecy of Armageddon. Whatever, its weary, bewildered tone is supremely affecting and one of Dylan\u2019s greatest contemporary moments.</p> <h2>9. Eminem \u2013 Lose Yourself (8 Mile, 2002)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd13b5815ffa06482c3c4044fc47af72a0fdbae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd13b5815ffa06482c3c4044fc47af72a0fdbae5/0_191_3300_1979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nashawn Ox Breedlove and Eminem in 8 Mile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nashawn Breedlove and Eminem in 8 Mile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/UNIVERSAL/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first hip-hop Oscar-winner might also be Eminem\u2019s best single, focusing his aggression and lyrical talent away from the shock value of bad-taste gags to a beautifully detailed depiction of an amateur rapper at the end of his tether heading into a freestyle battle: \u201cSuccess is my only motherfucking option.\u201d</p> <h2>8. Elton John and Tim Rice \u2013 Can You Feel the Love Tonight? (The Lion King, 1994)</h2> <p>One of three nominations from The Lion King. Elton John thought Circle Of Life should have won; you can see his point, but until Let It Go came along, Can You Feel the Love Tonight? was the unchallenged Disney blockbuster ballad for a reason: it strikes exactly the right balance between tenderness and air-punch-inducing grandiosity.</p> <h2>7. Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster \u2013 Secret Love (Calamity Jane, 1953)</h2> <p>Recorded by Doris Day in one take and subsequently covered by everyone from Count Basie to George Michael \u2013 the latter alighting on its potential as an LGBTQ coming-out anthem \u2013 the love theme from Calamity Jane is impossibly sumptuous, its dreamy quality perfectly capturing the mood of lyrics, in which a love presumed unrequited turns out to be requited after all.</p> <h2>6. Michel Legrand, Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman \u2013 The Windmills of Your Mind (The Thomas Crown Affair, 1968)</h2> <p>The Oscars ignored pop throughout the 60s, dominated instead by songs that could have been written before the second world war. If The Windmills of Your Mind wasn\u2019t pop per se \u2013 its roots are in French chanson \u2013 it still carries a vague hint of voguish psychedelic weirdness in its lyrics. The vocal by Noel Harrison \u2013 a moderately better singer than his father Rex, which isn\u2019t saying much \u2013 adds a certain rawness to the sumptuous arrangement.</p> <h2>5. Leigh Harline and Ned Washington \u2013 When You Wish Upon a Star (Pinocchio, 1940)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8938e37874232c0b135676997958e7d7489a85fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8938e37874232c0b135676997958e7d7489a85fd/0_0_3594_2692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pinocchio, 1940.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pinocchio, 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walt Disney Pictures/Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A year after Over the Rainbow came Disney\u2019s equivalent. When You Wish Upon a Star makes for a very weird children\u2019s song indeed \u2013 a kind of secular prayer that insists \u201cfate is kind \u2013 she brings to those who love the sweet fulfilment of your secret longing\u201d \u2013 and it quickly transcended its cartoon origins and reached an adult audience: the model for most of Disney\u2019s big hits since.</p> <h2>4. Isaac Hayes \u2013 Theme from Shaft (Shaft, 1971)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06bd2b0eeb1338477e432969fc2229142d00c747\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06bd2b0eeb1338477e432969fc2229142d00c747/0_62_3016_1809/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Roundtree in Shaft.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Roundtree in Shaft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mgm/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the context of previous Oscar winners, Theme from Shaft feels like a bomb going off: nothing this tough, this funky, this <em>black</em> had ever been nominated, let alone won. A flatly brilliant, vastly influential example of Isaac Hayes\u2019 manifold talents, it\u2019s both cinematic \u2013 the lush string arrangement \u2013 and unapologetically edgy. A bad mother, as Hayes himself put it.</p> <h2>3. Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields \u2013 The Way You Look Tonight (Swing Time, 1936)</h2> <p>One of the zeniths of the Great American Songbook, The Way You Look Tonight is exquisite; Jerome Kern\u2019s melody reduced his co-writer Dorothy Fields to tears on first hearing, and she responded with a lyric that\u2019s both emotionally complex \u2013 there\u2019s a poignant underlying sadness amid the romance \u2013 and strikingly simple.</p> <h2>2. Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg \u2013 Over the Rainbow (The Wizard of Oz, 1939)</h2> <p>Amazingly, Over the Rainbow was initially cut from The Wizard of Oz in the belief it slowed down the film, which would have been a bizarre fate for a song that subsequently took on a life of its own as an all-purpose anthem of possibility. Incredibly, given its ubiquity, it has never lost its ability to move, evidence that its writers hit on something far deeper and more universal than simply a melody and lyric.</p> <h2>1. Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer \u2013 Moon River (Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, 1961)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"422a10d406d071f53f191869ad9c5d67c508135d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/422a10d406d071f53f191869ad9c5d67c508135d/0_1_1380_827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly, Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly, Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trying to make a qualitative judgment about the best Oscar-winning original song is a thankless task. The winners span nine decades, take in umpteen genres and frequently defy comparison of any kind, their sound and their purpose varies so wildly. But Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer\u2019s Moon River is something else: it\u2019s so perfectly crafted, so melodically rich, its lyrics so simple and evocative, its themes \u2013 wanderlust, the passing of time, friendship \u2013 so universal and beautifully rendered, it feels about as close to no-further-questions perfection as songwriting gets. It has also proved infinitely malleable \u2013 whether performed as jazz, alt-rock, or in the simple guitar and vocal arrangement heard in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, it never fails.</p>",

      "bodyText": "40. Randy Newman \u2013 If I Didn\u2019t Have You (Monsters, Inc, 2001) Better Randy Newman songs were nominated for Oscars without winning \u2013 the decision to overlook Toy Story 2\u2019s astonishing When She Loved Me is particularly baffling \u2013 but If I Didn\u2019t Have You is still incredibly charming: a paean to friendship sung by Billy Crystal and John Goodman. 39. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman \u2013 Under the Sea (The Little Mermaid, 1989) The Little Mermaid was the film that began the Disney renaissance, which would go on to dominate the Academy\u2019s best-song category in the 1990s. Under the Sea is an early demonstration of how: beneath its perky, kid-friendly calypso lurks a set of lyrics that do more than your average children\u2019s song, dabbling in social comment. 38. Alan Menken and Tim Rice \u2013 A Whole New World (Aladdin, 1992) The only Disney song to reach No 1 in the US \u2013 a fairly incredible state of affairs in itself \u2013 knocked Whitney Houston\u2019s I Will Always Love You off the top of the charts and similarly prevented The Bodyguard\u2019s frenzied epic I Have Nothing from scooping the Oscar for best song. 37. Common and John Legend \u2013 Glory (Selma, 2014) Common and John Legend\u2019s theme from the civil-rights epic Selma is one of the less celebrated recent Oscar-winners. It became only a minor hit, which seems surprising: it serves up tension and euphoria in equal measure, and Legend\u2019s closing burst of extemporised vocals is spine-tingling. 36. Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington \u2013 The Ballad of High Noon (High Noon, 1952) Frankie Laine\u2019s version of The Ballad of High Noon \u2013 sung in the movie by Tex Ritter \u2013 was on the first ever British chart. It was a rare hint of brooding darkness amid a set of songs big on cosy sentimentality. But Ritter\u2019s version is darker and more brooding still, set to a stark arrangement of drums and guitar, full of foreboding: quite unlike any previous Oscar winner. 35. Stephen Sondheim \u2013 Sooner or Later (Dick Tracy, 1990) The Dick Tracy soundtrack album I\u2019m Breathless is a largely overlooked moment in Madonna\u2019s back catalogue, but Sooner or Later is genuinely great. It is a Stephen Sondheim-penned 30s jazz pastiche, far outside of the singer\u2019s musical and vocal comfort zone, but she pulls it off with considerable style. 34. Three 6 Mafia \u2013 It\u2019s Hard Out Here for a Pimp (Hustle &amp; Flow, 2005) Certainly the most strikingly titled Oscar-winning song of all time, Three 6 Mafia\u2019s unflinching gangsta rap track also appears to pay gentle homage to a previous best original song triumph: there is a distinct hint of the blaxploitation soundtrack style minted by Isaac Hayes\u2019 Theme From Shaft about the music. 33. Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock \u2013 Take My Breath Away (Top Gun, 1986) After Flashdance\u2019s 1983 victory, ballads \u2013 especially power ballads \u2013 reigned supreme at the Oscars for the rest of the decade: devotees of Up Where We Belong or, indeed, I\u2019ve Had the Time of My Life might disagree, but the pick is Berlin\u2019s Moroder-produced, synth-heavy Top Gun smash: a song as evocative of its era as the smell of Studio Line hair mousse. 32. Michael Gore and Dean Pitchford \u2013 Fame (Fame, 1980) Bizarrely, Fame only became a UK hit two years after winning an Oscar: it was the spin-off TV series, not the movie, that turned it into a No 1. It has never since quite escaped the tag of being the sound of a million early 80s school discos, masking what a smartly constructed disco-rock hybrid it was. 31 Harry Warren and Al Dubin \u2013 Lullaby of Broadway (Gold Diggers of 1935, 1935) The second winner of the best original song Oscar was used in three separate films in 1935. Seventy-five years later, you can still see why: the melody is hard to resist and its depiction of New York nightlife makes staggering home at dawn sound like the most fun it is possible to have. 30. Adele and Paul Epworth \u2013 Skyfall (Skyfall, 2012) Incredibly, Skyfall was the first Bond theme to win an Oscar \u2013 most of the legendary 60s and 70s themes didn\u2019t warrant a nomination. It does a fantastic job of updating the traditional high-drama approach of the series, with a particular nod to Shirley Bassey\u2019s explosive approach: Adele\u2019s vocal is similarly brassy and effective. 29. Fred Carlin, Jimmy Griffin and Robb Royer \u2013 For All We Know (Lovers and Other Strangers, 1970) A huge hit at the time, the romantic comedy Lovers and Other Strangers isn\u2019t much remembered 50 years on. For All We Know, a ballad written by two members of Bread, is, largely because of the Carpenters\u2019 definitive version. Karen Carpenter\u2019s astonishing voice, as ever, teases out a sense of doubt and unease under the romantic exterior and easy-listening gloss. 28. AR Rahman and Gulzar \u2013 Jai Ho (Slumdog Millionaire, 2008) The Oscars have mostly shied away from songs not sung in English, which makes AR Rahman\u2019s intense, Auto-Tune-heavy Bollywood track something of an anomaly. After its success it variously ended up covered by the Pussycat Dolls, as an internet meme and the Indian National Congress\u2019 2009 general election theme. 27. Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez \u2013 Remember Me (Coco, 2017) Remember Me recurs in different versions throughout Pixar\u2019s Day of the Dead-inspired Coco, from mariachi to Miguel-fronted pop. Every version carries emotional weight, such is the song\u2019s subtle, delicate treatment of the subject of loss. Not the easiest topic to essay in an animated children\u2019s film, but it does it beautifully. 26. Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn \u2013 All the Way (The Joker Is Wild, 1957) One of umpteen Frank Sinatra hits penned by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Khan, All the Way became so popular that it overshadowed the film in which it was featured; indeed, it overshadowed it to such an extent that The Joker Is Wild \u2013 a downbeat drama about an alcoholic nightclub entertainer, Joe E Lewis \u2013 ended up being briefly renamed after the song. 25. Lady Gaga, Mark Ronson, Anthony Rossomando and Andrew Wyatt \u2013 Shallow (A Star Is Born, 2018) In a sense, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper\u2019s Shallow is a return to the kind of songs that won Oscars in the 80s: it is in effect an old-fashioned power ballad that shifts from fragility to belting-it-out intensity. But the old tricks still work, as evidenced by its rapturous critical reception. 24. Peter Allen, Burt Bacharach, Christopher Cross &amp; Carole Bayer Sager \u2013 Arthur\u2019s Theme (Best That You Can Do) (Arthur, 1981) A perennial staple on late-night smooth radio, the years have been kind to Arthur\u2019s Theme. As naff as pop could get on release \u2013 the rise of MTV killed the singer Christopher Cross\u2019s burgeoning career overnight \u2013 the latter-day soft-rock amnesty has allowed people to look beyond the gloss and admit what a fantastic, oddly moving bit of songwriting lies at its centre. 23. Barbra Streisand and Paul Williams \u2013 Evergreen (A Star Is Born, 1976) Barbra Streisand\u2019s second Oscar triumph of the decade: another show-stopping ballad that quickly became an MOR standard, this time from the third remake of A Star Is Born, Evergreen boasted a melody written by Streisand that pulled off the trick of sounding instantly familiar, as if it had always existed. 22. Harry Warren and Mack Gordon \u2013 You\u2019ll Never Know (Hello, Frisco, Hello, 1943) By now, it was obvious that the second world war \u2013 and the United State\u2019s involvement therein \u2013 was having a profound effect on the country\u2019s songwriting: despite coming from a musical set in 1915, You\u2019ll Never Know was a gorgeous balled steeped in a very pertinent kind of longing and trepidation: \u201cYou went away and my heart went with you, I speak your name in every prayer.\u201d 21. Paul Jabara \u2013 Last Dance (Thank God It\u2019s Friday, 1978) The first disco Oscar-winner \u2013 nothing from Saturday Night Fever was even nominated \u2013 is a prime example of the Donna Summer-Giorgio Moroder partnership at its peak: a ballad that turns into an ecstatic floor-filler and exemplifies the tension between euphoric music and melancholy lyrics almost invariably at the heart of the best disco. 20. Johnny Mandel and Paul Francis Webster \u2013 The Shadow of Your Smile (The Sandpiper, 1965) By the mid-60s, the songs that won Oscars could seem a little stodgy compared with the popular music erupting elsewhere. But Johnny Mandel and Paul Francis Webster\u2019s love theme from The Sandpiper is such a beautiful song it transcends the middle of the road. If you want to hear a hipper version than that of Andy Williams or Tony Bennett, check out the Delfonics\u2019 stunning 1968 soft-soul take. 19. Rodgers and Hammerstein \u2013 It Might As Well Be Spring (State Fair, 1945) Originally from Rogers and Hammerstein\u2019s musical State Fair, there is a compelling argument that It Might As Well Be Spring really came into its own when uncoupled from the soundtrack and reworked as a jazz standard: Sarah Vaughan\u2019s slow, small-hours version on her 1955 album Sarah Vaughan In Hi-Fi wipes the floor with the original, revealing the song in its full glory. 18. Burt Bacharach and Hal David \u2013 Raindrops Keep Fallin\u2019 on My Head (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969) According to the singer BJ Thomas, Bacharach and David\u2019s song initially received a muted response: released as a single in October 1969, it didn\u2019t become a hit until Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was released two months later, its gentle optimism understandably popular as the 60s drew to a messy end. 17. Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin \u2013 Thanks for the Memory (The Big Broadcast of 1938, 1938) A fond recollection of failed marriage \u2013 \u201cparted by a slight thing, I wonder if we did the right thing\u201d \u2013 Bob Hope\u2019s signature tune strikes a beautiful note of wistful melancholy. Note that the apparently risqu\u00e9 line about enjoying \u201chash with Dinty Moore\u201d alas refers only to potatoes: a Dinty Moore is a corned-beef sandwich popular in Detroit. 16. James Horner and Will Jennings \u2013 My Heart Will Go On (Titanic, 1997) C\u00e9line Dion hated it and was beset by menstrual cramps while recording it, and Ministry fan James Cameron didn\u2019t want a pop song at the end of Titanic, yet My Heart Will Go On became the powerhouse movie theme to end them all. Not so much a song, as the climax of a song that lasts for five minutes. 15. Ray Evans and Jay Livingston \u2013 Que Sera Sera (The Man Who Knew Too Much, 1956) Alfred Hitchock\u2019s films are seldom celebrated for their abundance of catchy songs, but Que Sera Sera might be the catchiest Oscar-winner of all: it turned its title into a commonly used expression in English and ended up transformed into everything from a football chant to a soul song, the latter by Sly Stone. 14. Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez \u2013 Let It Go (Frozen, 2013) After Can You Feel the Love Tonight, a lot of Disney\u2019s Oscar-winning songs felt anti-climactic. Let It Go, however, ticked every box: it avoided schmaltz, packed a huge, karaoke-friendly chorus, was variously claimed as an LGBTQ+ anthem and an affirmation of autism. Ubiquity followed. 13. Bruce Springsteen \u2013 Streets of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, 1993) The Aids drama Philadelphia spawned two Oscar-nominated songs. It\u2019s a moot point whether Neil Young\u2019s desolate title track should have lost out to Streets of Philadelphia, but Bruce Springsteen\u2019s song, perhaps an easier listen, is magnificent nonetheless: a subtle, brooding examination of illness and loss. 12. Irving Berlin \u2013 White Christmas (Holiday Inn, 1942) It\u2019s hard to imagine now how groundbreaking White Christmas was. It more-or-less invented the modern secular Christmas song, its success revealing a vast market for nostalgic depictions of the festive season. Remarkably, it originally came with a hint of cynicism attached: its opening verse depicted its protagonist sunning himself beneath the palm trees of LA. 11. Marvin Hamlisch, Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman \u2013 The Way We Were (The Way We Were, 1973) MOR ballads dominated the Oscars in the 1970s: some are largely forgotten, others became standards. The Way We Were, a heartstring-tugging depiction of a failed relationship that became Barbra Streisand\u2019s theme song, belongs in the latter category. Intriguingly, some critics suggested its regretful tone chimed with America\u2019s post-Vietnam mood. 10. Bob Dylan \u2013 Things Have Changed (Wonder Boys, 2000) No Oscar-winning song has been subjected to as much analysis as Things Have Changed. Dylanologists have picked apart its lyrical allusions and claimed it as everything from a commentary on the actual movie to a prophecy of Armageddon. Whatever, its weary, bewildered tone is supremely affecting and one of Dylan\u2019s greatest contemporary moments. 9. Eminem \u2013 Lose Yourself (8 Mile, 2002) The first hip-hop Oscar-winner might also be Eminem\u2019s best single, focusing his aggression and lyrical talent away from the shock value of bad-taste gags to a beautifully detailed depiction of an amateur rapper at the end of his tether heading into a freestyle battle: \u201cSuccess is my only motherfucking option.\u201d 8. Elton John and Tim Rice \u2013 Can You Feel the Love Tonight? (The Lion King, 1994) One of three nominations from The Lion King. Elton John thought Circle Of Life should have won; you can see his point, but until Let It Go came along, Can You Feel the Love Tonight? was the unchallenged Disney blockbuster ballad for a reason: it strikes exactly the right balance between tenderness and air-punch-inducing grandiosity. 7. Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster \u2013 Secret Love (Calamity Jane, 1953) Recorded by Doris Day in one take and subsequently covered by everyone from Count Basie to George Michael \u2013 the latter alighting on its potential as an LGBTQ coming-out anthem \u2013 the love theme from Calamity Jane is impossibly sumptuous, its dreamy quality perfectly capturing the mood of lyrics, in which a love presumed unrequited turns out to be requited after all. 6. Michel Legrand, Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman \u2013 The Windmills of Your Mind (The Thomas Crown Affair, 1968) The Oscars ignored pop throughout the 60s, dominated instead by songs that could have been written before the second world war. If The Windmills of Your Mind wasn\u2019t pop per se \u2013 its roots are in French chanson \u2013 it still carries a vague hint of voguish psychedelic weirdness in its lyrics. The vocal by Noel Harrison \u2013 a moderately better singer than his father Rex, which isn\u2019t saying much \u2013 adds a certain rawness to the sumptuous arrangement. 5. Leigh Harline and Ned Washington \u2013 When You Wish Upon a Star (Pinocchio, 1940) A year after Over the Rainbow came Disney\u2019s equivalent. When You Wish Upon a Star makes for a very weird children\u2019s song indeed \u2013 a kind of secular prayer that insists \u201cfate is kind \u2013 she brings to those who love the sweet fulfilment of your secret longing\u201d \u2013 and it quickly transcended its cartoon origins and reached an adult audience: the model for most of Disney\u2019s big hits since. 4. Isaac Hayes \u2013 Theme from Shaft (Shaft, 1971) In the context of previous Oscar winners, Theme from Shaft feels like a bomb going off: nothing this tough, this funky, this black had ever been nominated, let alone won. A flatly brilliant, vastly influential example of Isaac Hayes\u2019 manifold talents, it\u2019s both cinematic \u2013 the lush string arrangement \u2013 and unapologetically edgy. A bad mother, as Hayes himself put it. 3. Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields \u2013 The Way You Look Tonight (Swing Time, 1936) One of the zeniths of the Great American Songbook, The Way You Look Tonight is exquisite; Jerome Kern\u2019s melody reduced his co-writer Dorothy Fields to tears on first hearing, and she responded with a lyric that\u2019s both emotionally complex \u2013 there\u2019s a poignant underlying sadness amid the romance \u2013 and strikingly simple. 2. Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg \u2013 Over the Rainbow (The Wizard of Oz, 1939) Amazingly, Over the Rainbow was initially cut from The Wizard of Oz in the belief it slowed down the film, which would have been a bizarre fate for a song that subsequently took on a life of its own as an all-purpose anthem of possibility. Incredibly, given its ubiquity, it has never lost its ability to move, evidence that its writers hit on something far deeper and more universal than simply a melody and lyric. 1. Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer \u2013 Moon River (Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, 1961) Trying to make a qualitative judgment about the best Oscar-winning original song is a thankless task. The winners span nine decades, take in umpteen genres and frequently defy comparison of any kind, their sound and their purpose varies so wildly. But Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer\u2019s Moon River is something else: it\u2019s so perfectly crafted, so melodically rich, its lyrics so simple and evocative, its themes \u2013 wanderlust, the passing of time, friendship \u2013 so universal and beautifully rendered, it feels about as close to no-further-questions perfection as songwriting gets. It has also proved infinitely malleable \u2013 whether performed as jazz, alt-rock, or in the simple guitar and vocal arrangement heard in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, it never fails.",

The $150m female facilities and water safety stream program, announced by the Coalition less than two months before the election, was funded in the 2019 budget for the purpose of female changerooms and swimming pool upgrades. While there was an expectation among sports clubs that the program would be open for applications in the wake of the sports rorts scandal, the Department of Health has revealed that the $150m fund was all spent during the election campaign. \u201cThe projects funded through the $150 million Female Facilities and Water Safety Stream Program were announced by the Australia Government in 2019,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said. \u201cThe FFWSS Program was not open to applications for grants. The projects were selected as election commitments. \u201cProjects eligible for funding included those that supported the development of female change room facilities at sporting grounds and community swimming facilities.\u201d The Department of Health formally advised successful recipients on 23 October 2019 and additional information was requested \u201cas part of standard due diligence that would support contract execution\u201d. Most of the funded projects will be under way within the next 12 months, the department said. According to details of grant recipients provided by the Department of Health, 41 projects have successfully secured funding through the program totalling $131m. As with the controversial community sport infrastructure program, projects funded through the scheme were predominantly in Coalition-held seats or those that it was targeting in the election, including the key seats of Braddon in Tasmania, Boothby in South Australia, Gilmore in NSW, Brisbane in Queensland, Corangamite in Victoria, and Pearce and Swan in WA. The largest single grant was $25m for the new Ellenbrook pool in the attorney general Christian Porter\u2019s marginal seat of Pearce, which was announced three weeks before the election. In Corangamite, which the Liberal MP Sarah Henderson was attempting to hold on for the Coalition despite it becoming notionally Labor in a redistribution, $20m was pledged from the fund for the Torquay pool and $10m to the Bellarine aquatic centre. Steve Irons, who is a close ally of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and was battling to keep his WA seat of Swan in Coalition hands, used the fund to promise $20m to build a new South Perth aquatic centre. A $500,000 grant for the Broulee surf club in Gilmore was announced by candidate Warren Mundine, who was unable to hold the marginal seat of Gilmore for the Coalition following the departure of Anne Sudmalis. In a media release just four days before the election, Mundine pledged the $500,000 \u201cto increase the clubhouse footprint and improve amenities for women\u201d. Details of the new fund come after the Senate moved on Wednesday to set up an inquiry into the controversial $100m community sport infrastructure program, which a scathing auditor general\u2019s report found had been used by the former Nationals minister Bridget McKenzie to target projects in marginal seats, while ignoring the recommendations of Sport Australia. Morrison has attempted to draw a line under the saga after McKenzie resigned from cabinet and as the deputy Nationals leader on Sunday, but Labor has continued to target the Coalition over the project. The new deputy Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has conceded the partisan allocation of projects by party representation in marginal seats is not \u201cthe best way to do it\u201d, despite Morrison repeatedly defending the program. The government has suggested it may yet fund clubs that missed out on funding, noting that of the total of $400m in project founding sought, the government had awarded $100m. \u201cAs I said last week, we think this infrastructure is important to local communities,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be working with the treasurer as we prepare for this year\u2019s budget to see how we can provide further support for this important infrastructure that brings communities together,\u201d Morrison said on Wednesday.",

      "bodyText": "Community group members and public health professionals have fought back tears while calling on the New South Wales government to drop \u201canti-climate\u201d legislation that would limit planning authorities\u2019 ability to block fossil fuel developments. Several witnesses became emotional while giving evidence to a parliamentary hearing into the proposed laws, which are designed to stop planning authorities from rejecting or imposing conditions on projects based on their impacts overseas, including overseas emissions. It is in part focused on scope 3 emissions, which are emissions that occur after coal or gas is sold into the market and burned. Because Australia exports much of these resources, many of these emissions occur overseas. The NSW Minerals Council lobbied the state government in 2019 to change laws that require the Independent Planning Commission to consider these emissions when assessing a project. It followed the NSW land and environment court\u2019s rejection of the Rocky Hill coalmine in February, which cited the impact the mine would have on climate change, including through the burning of coal in other countries, at a time when \u201ca rapid and deep decrease\u201d in global emissions was urgently needed. Two other decisions by the IPC also cited the impact of climate change in their reasons for imposing conditions on a mine or rejecting it entirely. But the amendments now before the NSW parliament were drafted before the unprecedented fires that have affected much of the country. On Thursday, multiple speakers choked back tears as they spoke of the impact the bill would have at a time when Australians were living the reality of the climate crisis. \u201cWhat I find so insulting, so wilfully ignorant that it leaves me white hot with anger, is that this government and some within its departments are so easily bullied by the fossil fuel lobby to even think of introducing an anti-climate bill while Australia is burning,\u201d Julie Lyford told the hearing. Lyford is the president of Groundswell Gloucester, which argued in the Rocky Hill case that the mine would have a detrimental impact on climate change and the social fabric of the town. \u201cThe proponents of this bill are climate criminals. They will be held to account one day if this bill goes through,\u201d she said. Dianne Montague, a member of Groundswell Gloucester, told the hearing rural communities disproportionately bore the impacts of mining and were now also \u201cthe ones bearing the burden of the impacts of climate change\u201d. She said the community had been living with smoke from nearby fires for months. \u201cDepression is everywhere. Everybody you talk to is depressed because of what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. Doctors told the hearing that the bill was a step backward in planning for health risks from fires and other extreme events associated with climate change. Ingrid Johnston, a senior policy officer at the Public Health Association of Australia, told the hearing that the effects of global heating crossed borders. To demonstrate this, she spoke of putting a gas mask on her 11-year-old son because of severe smoke that settled over Canberra in January from fires burning in NSW. \u201cThe last couple of months have demonstrated all too clearly that bushfire smoke doesn\u2019t respect borders. Just ask people in the west coast of New Zealand,\u201d she said. Other speakers identified major concerns with the wording of the bill, telling the committee it could have unintended consequences. This included the NSW Minerals Council, which has been pushing for these changes. The council\u2019s policy director, Andrew Abbey, said the proposed amendments could potentially lead to a greater risk that developments would be refused outright. \u201cIn the sense that if a project couldn\u2019t get over the line because you can\u2019t impose a condition on it related to scope 3 or downstream emissions the view could be formed that you subsequently don\u2019t approve the project,\u201d he told the hearing. Both the council and the CFMMEU said they supported the \u201cintent\u201d of the bill but were not sure if it achieved its stated purpose. And the Environmental Defenders Office, which acted for Groundswell Gloucester in the Rocky Hill Case, said the bill could limit planning authorities\u2019 ability to consider all emissions associated with projects, including emissions that occur in Australia. \u201cIn terms of legal drafting, this is a mess,\u201d the principal lawyer Elaine Johnson said after the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to determine how it would be applied.\u201d",

Being a better person For a while now, Kerri has secretly suspected she may have personality issues. When her team gave her a performance review and had to provide positive feedback, the only nice thing they could muster was that she had \u201cnice sunglasses\u201d. At the company retreat colleagues raised her abusive and unpredictable yelling when someone uses her mug, her openly expressed hatred of colleagues that wear ostentatious glasses, her opposition to halal meat in the canteen (\u201ctastes weird\u201d) and her long dispute about putting in a wheelchair ramp for Kevin (but, she argued, it would ruin the symmetry of the pebble garden).

What keeps you motivated: the loneliness of being repellant. Chance of success: correlates to motivation. Going vegan Since everybody Darrell knows has told him that he MUST watch The Game Changers on Netflix, and since he watched it and was super impressed with all the swoll vegan athletes, Darrell has decided to become vegan. It\u2019s a no-brainer, thought Darrell.

Problem is, the only thing Darrell can cook is toast and steak. Tofu makes him gag. Now all he eats is toast and burgers from vegan fast food chains. In his 35 carb-heavy days of being a vegan, he has put on weight and feels lethargic. But this is meant to be healthy, right? What keeps you motivated: cancer. The apocalypse. Improved performance time should he become an elite athlete. Chance of success: moderate. Going vegan properly is a major change of lifestyle and unless you are prepared and committed, it can be easy to give up. Recycling more Since Peter heard that all the garbos just put all the rubbish into one big container that ends up being shipped ... somewhere, he decided that recycling is a con. But when an anonymous letter arrived from neighbours (\u201cPLEASE RECYCLE YOUR WASTE!!!!\u201d) shaming him, Peter has decided to recycle again. As well as doing his bit for the planet (presuming of course that it all doesn\u2019t end up in the one big bin, which is then tossed in the sea), he gets to avoid doing something which causes him pain \u2013 having stressful interactions with his neighbours. What keeps you motivated: public shame. The apocalypse. Chance of success: high. Going on a diet At first Belinda thought her pants had shrunk.

However, if the outcome of Thursday morning\u2019s pow-wow between the good and the great of the 20 member clubs is anything to go by, the reality is far more prosaic and mundane.</p> \n<p>It is not often the Premier League members vote for any wheeze that is not entirely in their own interests, but they are prone to the occasional rick. Their wheeze to close the past two summer transfer windows prior to the start of the season proved a grave misstep, as it gave their European rivals an extra three weeks to shamelessly court, unsettle and plunder their players, leaving squads full of holes they couldn\u2019t fill. It is an error they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/premier-league-transfer-window-summer-2020-shut-1-september\">now voted to rectify</a>, deciding to once again fall in line with the rest of Europe (as the country they represent falls out) and move this year\u2019s closing date back to 1 September.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/premier-league-transfer-window-summer-2020-shut-1-september\">Premier League clubs push transfer window closure back to September</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cOne of the reasons is because the immigration system is going to change and it may be that it\u2019s the last window where freedom of movement is possible,\u201d cheered Premier League chief suit Richard Masters. \u201cClubs may want to take advantage of the longer window to make sure that they\u2019ve taken full advantage.\u201d Any changes to the immigration system will, of course, be prompted by the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union which, while \u201cdone\u201d in the Tory sense of the word, remains so hopelessly up in the air that nobody yet knows how it will affect football transfers. While many of the more vocal and patriotic Union Jack-wavers among the fanbases of assorted clubs may be delighted that Boris Johnson and his cronies have succeeded in \u201ctaking back control\u201d, it remains to be seen how thrilled they\u2019ll be when they discover their team has been stymied in its attempt to sign some midfield schemer from Portugal or Germany because their CV doesn\u2019t tick the requisite boxes required for them to secure a work permit.</p> \n<p>And while that Chelsea fan who gatecrashed a live Irish news report to raucously eff and jeff his support for both his football team and the UK\u2019s withdrawal in Parliament Square last Friday might argue these restrictions would only apply to players who aren\u2019t much good, they would be wrong. Had he required one, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is just one of several hundred European players in English football\u2019s top two tiers who wouldn\u2019t have had enough international caps to qualify for a work permit before moving to England. One shudders to think how Chelsea would have fared in recent years without him.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cWe have identified inaccuracies in the translation of Sky Sports News\u2019 interview with Alfredo Morelos. We apologise to both football clubs as well as Alfredo Morelos for the issues caused by these errors. After numerous steps undertaken by Sky to verify the interview thoroughly we can be clear that at no point did Morelos allege that any racial abuse was directed at him by [Queen\u2019s] Celtic supporters in the interview. We apologise to the [Queen\u2019s] Celtic supporters for this serious error. We are reviewing our procedures for translated interviews to ensure this does not occur in future. Below is the full transcript of the video published on Sky Sports with a professionally verified translation\u201d \u2013 Sky suits <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/celtic-seven-points-rangers-scottish-premiership-match-reports\">offer up an apology</a> for the saga around their interview with the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers forward.

      "bodyText": "WINDOW DRESSING Not being a member of the Premier League, The Fiver has never been lucky enough to attend one of their shareholders\u2019 meetings but we\u2019ve often imagined what the experience might entail: assorted well-fed, besuited gentlemen lighting each other\u2019s expensive Cuban cigars with \u00a350 notes and toasting each other\u2019s extreme good fortune with the finest champagne. However, if the outcome of Thursday morning\u2019s pow-wow between the good and the great of the 20 member clubs is anything to go by, the reality is far more prosaic and mundane. It is not often the Premier League members vote for any wheeze that is not entirely in their own interests, but they are prone to the occasional rick. Their wheeze to close the past two summer transfer windows prior to the start of the season proved a grave misstep, as it gave their European rivals an extra three weeks to shamelessly court, unsettle and plunder their players, leaving squads full of holes they couldn\u2019t fill. It is an error they have now voted to rectify, deciding to once again fall in line with the rest of Europe (as the country they represent falls out) and move this year\u2019s closing date back to 1 September. \u201cOne of the reasons is because the immigration system is going to change and it may be that it\u2019s the last window where freedom of movement is possible,\u201d cheered Premier League chief suit Richard Masters. \u201cClubs may want to take advantage of the longer window to make sure that they\u2019ve taken full advantage.\u201d Any changes to the immigration system will, of course, be prompted by the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union which, while \u201cdone\u201d in the Tory sense of the word, remains so hopelessly up in the air that nobody yet knows how it will affect football transfers. While many of the more vocal and patriotic Union Jack-wavers among the fanbases of assorted clubs may be delighted that Boris Johnson and his cronies have succeeded in \u201ctaking back control\u201d, it remains to be seen how thrilled they\u2019ll be when they discover their team has been stymied in its attempt to sign some midfield schemer from Portugal or Germany because their CV doesn\u2019t tick the requisite boxes required for them to secure a work permit. And while that Chelsea fan who gatecrashed a live Irish news report to raucously eff and jeff his support for both his football team and the UK\u2019s withdrawal in Parliament Square last Friday might argue these restrictions would only apply to players who aren\u2019t much good, they would be wrong. Had he required one, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is just one of several hundred European players in English football\u2019s top two tiers who wouldn\u2019t have had enough international caps to qualify for a work permit before moving to England. One shudders to think how Chelsea would have fared in recent years without him. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe have identified inaccuracies in the translation of Sky Sports News\u2019 interview with Alfredo Morelos. We apologise to both football clubs as well as Alfredo Morelos for the issues caused by these errors. After numerous steps undertaken by Sky to verify the interview thoroughly we can be clear that at no point did Morelos allege that any racial abuse was directed at him by [Queen\u2019s] Celtic supporters in the interview. We apologise to the [Queen\u2019s] Celtic supporters for this serious error. We are reviewing our procedures for translated interviews to ensure this does not occur in future. Below is the full transcript of the video published on Sky Sports with a professionally verified translation\u201d \u2013 Sky suits offer up an apology for the saga around their interview with the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers forward. One question: are their translations not normally up to a \u2018professional\u2019 standard? Anyhow, the Queen\u2019s Celtic have responded by lodging a complaint with Ofcom and publishing said letter in full. FIVER LETTERS \u201cContinuing the thread of pre-match music (Fiver letters passim), I remember going to see the original Wimbledon playing my team, Stockport County, and listening to the DJ discussing how he had thought long and hard about the music to play to show empathy to Chelsea who had suffered a defeat that week in Big Cup. And then he played the \u2018chorus\u2019 of The Laughing Policeman\u201d \u2013 Brian Ross. \u201cOnce went to a pre-season friendly between Leamington and Leicester. The Leamington sound man was clearly only armed with a Paulo Nutini album, which he played in its entirety on repeat before the game, at half-time, and during every break in play, simply pressing pause every time play resumed\u201d \u2013 Sam Russell. \u201cI used to watch Bradford Park Avenue during my time in that city, and not only did they come out to Electric Avenue by Eddy Grant, they sometimes published playlists, which were commendably eclectic. How that sat with those in flat caps and bobble hats I sat amongst, I never did find out\u201d \u2013 Jon Millard. \u201cRe: Peter Storch\u2019s Dumbarton link (yesterday\u2019s letters).

The area covers 7,000 hectares (17,297 acres), 5,500 hectares of which are vineyards While Burgundy claims to be France\u2019s oldest wine-producing region, citing evidence of pre-Roman Celtic vines, the vineyards of Bordeaux enjoy a warmer climate and the quality of the wines produced, made of a blend of two or more grapes, is considered more reliable. Burgundy\u2019s unpredictable climate means the quality of the wine, made just from the pinot noir grape for its most valued reds, varies. Before meeting on Thursday, Gilles Flutet, the head of the institute\u2019s territories and boundaries department, said any decisions would not be \u201cset in stone\u201d until a public consultation had taken place and insisted all appeals would be considered. He said the zones threatened with exclusion from the burgundy appellation were those, like chablis, that used it \u201cvery little\u201d. The burgundy union had disagreed, saying the institute was undermining the whole AOC structure. More than 6,000 people signed a petition opposing the proposed map. \u201cWe must avoid conflating two historically distinct wine-growing regions, each with their own characteristics,\u201d it wrote in a statement. \u201cWe must prevent this discrediting of the AOC system. If a beaujolais becomes a bourgogne, then why shouldn\u2019t a cr\u00e9mant de bourgogne become a champagne?\u201d",

That winner, though, was Altior in 2016, and there is a hint at least of similar potential about Shishkin, the winner of the Sidney Banks Memorial Hurdle at Huntingdon on Thursday and the undoubted leader of Henderson\u2019s squad for this year\u2019s Supreme on 10 March.</p> \n<p>Shishkin was briefly 9-2 for the Festival opener after his 11-length defeat of Shan Blue, which was completed with Nico de Boinville, his jockey, motionless throughout. Once Henderson had confirmed that the Supreme is his target, though, he was generally cut to around 3-1, and it is difficult to see any of his market rivals supplanting him at the head of the market between now and the Festival.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/05/kempton-racecourse-climbdown-prompts-tentative-celebrations\">Kempton racecourse climbdown prompts tentative celebrations</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do and that\u2019s what those races are all about,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThey were very respectable opposition but he\u2019s got a lot of gears, hasn\u2019t he?</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always thought he was very good and he won\u2019t run again before [the Supreme on] Tuesday.

It is an idea that has been kicked around for decades but we have yet to arrive at the decisive moment, when a powerful person wakes up and says: \u201cToday, I am going to find the pockets deep enough to pay for this thing...\u201d</p> \n<p>The benefits to racing would obviously include having a building in a busy town somewhere that would act as an entry point to the sport for the mildly curious. It would be a source of news stories and debate when decisions were made as to who should be honoured therein.</p> \n<p>Most importantly, it would be a place for racing to show how much it treasures its past and values the achievements of those who went before. The sport in Britain has, frankly, been poor at this. If you don\u2019t value your own history, you can\u2019t expect anyone else to do so. If you don\u2019t value your past, you cheapen your present.</p> \n<p>Mini halls of fame have emerged in places like Cheltenham and Aintree and there is, of course, a fine racing museum at<a href=\"https://www.palacehousenewmarket.co.uk/\"> Palace House in Newmarket</a> that would welcome your support. But I tend to think that a truly impactful Hall Of Fame would be closer to a major population centre.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8956d539823fe547caf2a3e84805bded7a55d89c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8956d539823fe547caf2a3e84805bded7a55d89c/0_166_4842_2906/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trainer Henry Cecil and Lester Piggott during their association in the 1970s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trainer Henry Cecil and Lester Piggott during their association in the 1970s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Smith/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While our rulers dig down the back of the sofa for the readies, can we not at least build an online Hall Of Fame, with biographies of our greats and footage of their greatest moments? Old lags like me know a lot of the stories and can find many of the old races but it shouldn\u2019t take 35 years of hanging around the tracks to become familiar with racing lore. It should all be neatly packaged in a single, readily identifiable website that could act as a rabbit hole down which interested youngsters could tumble.</p> \n<p>I was in Tate Britain the other day, reading about a curator who found <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/martin-the-destruction-of-pompei-and-herculaneum-n00793\">John Martin\u2019s Destruction Of Pompeii </a>wrapped up inside <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/paul-delaroche-the-execution-of-lady-jane-grey\">Delaroche\u2019s Execution of Lady Jane Grey</a>, 45 years after both paintings were thought to have been lost in a flood. Horse racing\u2019s entire history might have been lost in a flood, for all the central authorities seem to care about it. Fanatics are left to discover what they can and occasional treasures are temporarily displayed on social media before being washed away by the following tide. <strong>CC</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82fb61eb-6350-4017-b3b2-d6ae2170a69a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Huntingdon:</b>&nbsp;1.00 Swilly Sunset 1.31 Thomas Shelby 2.01 Yorgonnahearmeroar 2.31 Shishkin 3.05 Tea Clipper (nap) 3.40 The Composeur (nb) 4.12 Allavina<br><br><b>Chelmsford:</b> 1.10 Jen's Lad 1.40 Calidus Mirabilis 2.10 The King's Steed 2.40 Storm Over 3.15 Brigand 3.50 Thegreatestshowman 4.20 Rodin.<br><br><b>Doncaster:</b> 1.23 Imperial Nemesis 1.53 Zoffee 2.23 Well Smitten 2.55 Jenkins 3.30 Glory And Fortune 4.04 See Forever 4.40 Out On The Tear.<br><br><b>Newcastle:</b> 4.30 Corked 5.00 Ascot Week 5.30 Union 6.00 Youneverletmedown 6.30 Heath Charnock 7.00 Athollblair Boy 7.30 Hunters Step 8.00 I Am Dandy.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Given the wealth of young jumping talent that passes through his stable from one season to the next, it is perhaps a little surprising that Nicky Henderson has managed only a single success in the Supreme Novice Hurdle, the first race at the Cheltenham Festival, in the last 27 years. That winner, though, was Altior in 2016, and there is a hint at least of similar potential about Shishkin, the winner of the Sidney Banks Memorial Hurdle at Huntingdon on Thursday and the undoubted leader of Henderson\u2019s squad for this year\u2019s Supreme on 10 March. Shishkin was briefly 9-2 for the Festival opener after his 11-length defeat of Shan Blue, which was completed with Nico de Boinville, his jockey, motionless throughout. Once Henderson had confirmed that the Supreme is his target, though, he was generally cut to around 3-1, and it is difficult to see any of his market rivals supplanting him at the head of the market between now and the Festival. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do and that\u2019s what those races are all about,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThey were very respectable opposition but he\u2019s got a lot of gears, hasn\u2019t he? \u201cWe\u2019ve always thought he was very good and he won\u2019t run again before [the Supreme on] Tuesday. Nico mentioned the Neptune [Novice Hurdle] after Newbury, and we came two miles and three here. It was hardly going to prove stamina but it proves he can do anything you like, because he was only in first gear. \u201cYou\u2019d have to say he\u2019s going to be the pick of the Supreme horses [at the stable], but there could be others and there\u2019s a host of them in the Ballymore. Chantry House comes out on Saturday, it will be interesting to see how he comes along. \u201c[Shishkin] is a chaser in the making to be honest, I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s another Altior but he\u2019s an Altior type of horse. He\u2019s got a lot of speed and a lot of scope. He\u2019s a good-looking, big, chasing-type of animal that we rather like.\u201d GW Racing the poorer for failing to fund Hall of Fame The absence of money, a familiar problem for followers of horse racing, is, I am told, the reason why the sport in Britain does not yet have a Hall Of Fame, nor any plans for one. It is an idea that has been kicked around for decades but we have yet to arrive at the decisive moment, when a powerful person wakes up and says: \u201cToday, I am going to find the pockets deep enough to pay for this thing...\u201d The benefits to racing would obviously include having a building in a busy town somewhere that would act as an entry point to the sport for the mildly curious. It would be a source of news stories and debate when decisions were made as to who should be honoured therein. Most importantly, it would be a place for racing to show how much it treasures its past and values the achievements of those who went before. The sport in Britain has, frankly, been poor at this. If you don\u2019t value your own history, you can\u2019t expect anyone else to do so. If you don\u2019t value your past, you cheapen your present. Mini halls of fame have emerged in places like Cheltenham and Aintree and there is, of course, a fine racing museum at Palace House in Newmarket that would welcome your support. But I tend to think that a truly impactful Hall Of Fame would be closer to a major population centre. While our rulers dig down the back of the sofa for the readies, can we not at least build an online Hall Of Fame, with biographies of our greats and footage of their greatest moments? Old lags like me know a lot of the stories and can find many of the old races but it shouldn\u2019t take 35 years of hanging around the tracks to become familiar with racing lore. It should all be neatly packaged in a single, readily identifiable website that could act as a rabbit hole down which interested youngsters could tumble. I was in Tate Britain the other day, reading about a curator who found John Martin\u2019s Destruction Of Pompeii wrapped up inside Delaroche\u2019s Execution of Lady Jane Grey, 45 years after both paintings were thought to have been lost in a flood. Horse racing\u2019s entire history might have been lost in a flood, for all the central authorities seem to care about it. Fanatics are left to discover what they can and occasional treasures are temporarily displayed on social media before being washed away by the following tide. CC",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.billbrandt.com/\">Bill Brandt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/henry-moore\">Henry Moore</a> met for the first time in 1942, when the German-born photographer was commissioned by <a href=\"http://www.lilliputmagazine.co.uk/\">Lilliput magazine</a> to shoot the quintessentially British sculptor in his studio. The resulting portrait appeared in a spread devoted to the two artists\u2019 shelter pictures \u2013 both had made extended series of sleeping Londoners huddled in platforms and tunnels on the underground during the blitz. Their meeting, and the shared subject matter that prompted it, is the conceptual starting point for this fascinating exhibition, which traces their parallel paths and overlapping interests.</p> <p>It begins in London during the war years, when both were commissioned by the Ministry of Information to create work that showed the stoicism of the British public. Brandt\u2019s photographs of the silhouettes of landmarks rising out of the rubble-strewn darkness have a sepulchral beauty that seems slightly romanticised given the grim circumstances. By contrast, his crowded portraits of civilians sleeping in the subways \u2013 their prone bodies often shot in closeup and printed in high contrast \u2013 are a vivid play of harsh, unforgiving light and dark, looming shadows. One of the most strikingly intimate photographs is of an exhausted family sprawled across a narrow, dirty train tunnel at Liverpool Street station, a child\u2019s outstretched legs resting on her mother\u2019s lap. It is a study of stoicism, for sure, but also of confinement and dogged survival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7a26fcd0c997a0925713207ab8dd62ec3e2e9f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7a26fcd0c997a0925713207ab8dd62ec3e2e9f0/0_0_1920_2397/801.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool Street Extension (Bill Brandt, 1940).\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liverpool Street Extension (Bill Brandt, 1940).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Bill Brandt Archive Ltd.

Made using black ink, charcoal and crayon, Moore\u2019s densely layered drawings evoke the visceral experience of the miner\u2019s hard labour. Shadowy, squat and bent figures toil in what he described as the \u201calmost unbearable heat and thick choking dust\u201d of this subterranean world.

      "body": "<p>The West Midlands is, let\u2019s be honest, not a great place for walking. Birmingham\u2019s fine city centre is throttled by massive ring roads, which the council spent much of the 20th century putting in and, thus far, much of the 21st century trying to take out. Beyond that, you\u2019ll find a landscape of multi-lane highways, with central reservations wide enough for entire streets. In what other city would you encounter so many \u201cislands\u201d that turn out, on closer inspection, to be roundabouts?</p> <p>It\u2019s not a great place for public transport, either. Its rail network looks all right on a map, but local services are forced to compete with intercity routes for tracks and platform space, while the West Midlands Metro consists of a single tram line, from Birmingham to Wolverhampton, which has managed one piddling extension in 21 years. That leaves locals dependent on buses or, more often, the private cars that commuters opt for because their bus keeps getting stuck in traffic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Compared with continental or American mayoralties that come with real statutory or fiscal powers, the mayor of the West Midlands is weak</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But now, a possible saviour for weary Brummie commuters has appeared on the horizon. Andy Street, the former boss of John Lewis, has been the Tory mayor of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/05/former-john-lewis-boss-wins-west-midlands-mayoralty-andy-street\" title=\"\">West Midlands since 2017</a>, although you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know it from his chosen campaign colour (green, rather than blue). On Tuesday, he unveiled a <a href=\"https://www.citymetric.com/transport/mayor-west-midlands-has-released-map-his-15bn-transport-plan-and-it-s-so-so-beautiful-4925\" title=\"\">tube-style map</a> of what the conurbation\u2019s transport network could look like by 2040, provided it re-elects him next May.</p> <p>The map shows an entire tram network, its lines, named mostly for local heroes such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/23/mary-lee-berners-lee-obituary\" title=\"\">Mary Lee Woods</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/benjamin-zephaniah\" title=\"\">Benjamin Zephaniah</a>, stretching to every corner of the region. Besides that, you\u2019ll find an overground, expanded through reopened freight lines and with 21 extra stations; a system of automated pods connecting the University of Warwick to the rail network; a people mover linking the airport to the National Exhibition Centre and HS2; and Coventry buried beneath mysterious blue spaghetti known only as \u201cthe Godiva line\u201d.</p> <p>More bafflingly, it also shows HS2 itself. If that seems an odd thing to include on a metro map \u2013 the tube map doesn\u2019t note that trains to Birmingham visit Watford Junction \u2013 then that\u2019s because this map isn\u2019t really intended to show the future Midlands transport network at all.

      "bodyText": "The West Midlands is, let\u2019s be honest, not a great place for walking. Birmingham\u2019s fine city centre is throttled by massive ring roads, which the council spent much of the 20th century putting in and, thus far, much of the 21st century trying to take out. Beyond that, you\u2019ll find a landscape of multi-lane highways, with central reservations wide enough for entire streets. In what other city would you encounter so many \u201cislands\u201d that turn out, on closer inspection, to be roundabouts? It\u2019s not a great place for public transport, either. Its rail network looks all right on a map, but local services are forced to compete with intercity routes for tracks and platform space, while the West Midlands Metro consists of a single tram line, from Birmingham to Wolverhampton, which has managed one piddling extension in 21 years. That leaves locals dependent on buses or, more often, the private cars that commuters opt for because their bus keeps getting stuck in traffic. But now, a possible saviour for weary Brummie commuters has appeared on the horizon. Andy Street, the former boss of John Lewis, has been the Tory mayor of the West Midlands since 2017, although you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know it from his chosen campaign colour (green, rather than blue). On Tuesday, he unveiled a tube-style map of what the conurbation\u2019s transport network could look like by 2040, provided it re-elects him next May. The map shows an entire tram network, its lines, named mostly for local heroes such as Mary Lee Woods and Benjamin Zephaniah, stretching to every corner of the region. Besides that, you\u2019ll find an overground, expanded through reopened freight lines and with 21 extra stations; a system of automated pods connecting the University of Warwick to the rail network; a people mover linking the airport to the National Exhibition Centre and HS2; and Coventry buried beneath mysterious blue spaghetti known only as \u201cthe Godiva line\u201d. More bafflingly, it also shows HS2 itself. If that seems an odd thing to include on a metro map \u2013 the tube map doesn\u2019t note that trains to Birmingham visit Watford Junction \u2013 then that\u2019s because this map isn\u2019t really intended to show the future Midlands transport network at all. It\u2019s intended, rather, to re-elect Andy Street. Look closely, and there\u2019s another subtle hint that this is more campaign tool than serious plan: the price tag. That \u00a315bn is a lot of money, of course, but it\u2019s surely not a coincidence that it\u2019s also the figure generally attached, with ever-decreasing accuracy, to London\u2019s Crossrail.

      "body": "<p>Too much democratic accountability can get exhausting. After a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/05/baroness-morgan-turncotes-brings-disingenuity-bbc-debate\">hectic 45 minutes the previous day</a> in which she had urged the BBC to become more transparent and relevant, Baroness Morgan of Cotes needed an ermine-filled duvet day.</p> <p>At culture questions two weeks ago, the secretary of state <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/16/lady-morgan-looks-down-upon-her-departmental-questions\">had at least deigned to drop in</a> to the peers\u2019 gallery to observe \u2013 and give a royal wave to \u2013 her departmental flunkeys as they took turns at the dispatch box. But the novelty had now palled rather. These weren\u2019t her people and Lady Nicky had outgrown the Commons.</p> <p>So it was junior minister Nigel Adams who found himself having to handle a tricky urgent question on the BBC licence fee that Her Ladyship was unable to answer in person.</p> <p>What Nicky had said about the BBC had never been intended as a declaration of war. Absolutely not. He couldn\u2019t understand how people might have got that impression. The government considered the Beeb to be a beacon of British values and the only reason it now prevented ministers from appearing on some of its programmes was because most of them were simply not good enough. Boris Johnson just didn\u2019t want to lower the quality of the BBC\u2019s output with worthless contributions from his cabinet of fools.</p> <p>There was no sinister agenda in play, Adams insisted. All Lady Turncotes had done was to implement an eight-week consultation period, during which a wide range of views would be heard, and at the end of which the government would do exactly as it had planned all along.</p> <p>There would be no criminal prosecutions for non-payment of the licence fee, followed a short while later by the abolition of the licence fee itself. Then hopefully no more Beeb. Other than that the BBC would be free to do whatever it wanted. Simples.</p> <p>The shadow culture secretary, Tracy Brabin, was not exactly reassured by this. She reminded Adams that non-payment of the licence fee wasn\u2019t exactly a pressing problem for the criminal justice system \u2013 only five people were currently in prison for the offence \u2013 and that most people considered the licence fee as the fairest form of funding for a public service broadcaster.</p> <p>And on the question of accountability and transparency, the government should start by looking at its own record on banning journalists from prime ministerial events and lobby briefings.</p> <p>All Adams could do was to continue to play dumb. Something that comes relatively easily to him, if not quite so easily as to some of his colleagues. The timing of the consultation had nothing whatsoever to do with the government\u2019s desire to avoid public scrutiny. Even though there had been precisely nothing about the licence fee in the Tory manifesto just two months ago. It was just one of those things. An amazing coincidence.</p> <p>Just like it had been total serendipity that, only 24 hours after giving an interview about how Johnson \u2013 a man for whom he had never previously disguised his contempt \u2013 was basically a \u201creally, really good bloke\u201d whom he had always admired, Philip Hammond was in line to join Lady Nicky in the Lords. Failing upwards is very on trend at the moment. There must be hundreds of Tory MPs, both past and present, who will be waiting for the official announcement with intense anticipation.</p> <p>One of whom could well be Theresa Villiers, who had earlier answered environment questions. Villiers is yet another cabinet minister whose entire political career has been built on under-achievement. The most memorable thing she has ever done in her 15 years in parliament was to be one of two MPs to have joined the 380-metre \u201cMarch to Freedom\u201d during Andrea Leadsom\u2019s short-lived campaign to become Tory leader in 2016. But all mediocre things must come to an end eventually, and Villiers is tipped for the chop in the imminent reshuffle.</p> <p>The Commons was more or less deserted for Villiers\u2019 last stand \u2013 a bad day for the ticket touts who had eagerly been promoting her farewell appearance \u2013 but the environment secretary dutifully fulfilled her brief in her usual semi-detached manner. Her face is always devoid of expression and, in years to come, philosophers will debate whether she is more alive than dead.</p> <p>Still, Villiers did achieve a minor triumph in saying almost nothing of interest. She steered clear of the row over COP 26 \u2013 possibly because she had no idea the conference was even due to be taking place \u2013 and prevaricated over whether an Australian-style trade deal would mean no tariffs on koalas and kangaroos that had been barbecued in the bushfires.</p> <p>The closest she came to a coherent statement was that the whole point of Brexit was for Britain to waste a lot of time and money deciding to implement the same food and environmental standards that we had in the EU. It was a fittingly apt note of futility on which to bow out. Arise Lady Theresa. Your time has surely come.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Too much democratic accountability can get exhausting. After a hectic 45 minutes the previous day in which she had urged the BBC to become more transparent and relevant, Baroness Morgan of Cotes needed an ermine-filled duvet day. At culture questions two weeks ago, the secretary of state had at least deigned to drop in to the peers\u2019 gallery to observe \u2013 and give a royal wave to \u2013 her departmental flunkeys as they took turns at the dispatch box. But the novelty had now palled rather. These weren\u2019t her people and Lady Nicky had outgrown the Commons. So it was junior minister Nigel Adams who found himself having to handle a tricky urgent question on the BBC licence fee that Her Ladyship was unable to answer in person. What Nicky had said about the BBC had never been intended as a declaration of war. Absolutely not. He couldn\u2019t understand how people might have got that impression. The government considered the Beeb to be a beacon of British values and the only reason it now prevented ministers from appearing on some of its programmes was because most of them were simply not good enough. Boris Johnson just didn\u2019t want to lower the quality of the BBC\u2019s output with worthless contributions from his cabinet of fools. There was no sinister agenda in play, Adams insisted. All Lady Turncotes had done was to implement an eight-week consultation period, during which a wide range of views would be heard, and at the end of which the government would do exactly as it had planned all along. There would be no criminal prosecutions for non-payment of the licence fee, followed a short while later by the abolition of the licence fee itself. Then hopefully no more Beeb. Other than that the BBC would be free to do whatever it wanted. Simples. The shadow culture secretary, Tracy Brabin, was not exactly reassured by this. She reminded Adams that non-payment of the licence fee wasn\u2019t exactly a pressing problem for the criminal justice system \u2013 only five people were currently in prison for the offence \u2013 and that most people considered the licence fee as the fairest form of funding for a public service broadcaster. And on the question of accountability and transparency, the government should start by looking at its own record on banning journalists from prime ministerial events and lobby briefings. All Adams could do was to continue to play dumb. Something that comes relatively easily to him, if not quite so easily as to some of his colleagues. The timing of the consultation had nothing whatsoever to do with the government\u2019s desire to avoid public scrutiny. Even though there had been precisely nothing about the licence fee in the Tory manifesto just two months ago. It was just one of those things. An amazing coincidence. Just like it had been total serendipity that, only 24 hours after giving an interview about how Johnson \u2013 a man for whom he had never previously disguised his contempt \u2013 was basically a \u201creally, really good bloke\u201d whom he had always admired, Philip Hammond was in line to join Lady Nicky in the Lords. Failing upwards is very on trend at the moment. There must be hundreds of Tory MPs, both past and present, who will be waiting for the official announcement with intense anticipation. One of whom could well be Theresa Villiers, who had earlier answered environment questions. Villiers is yet another cabinet minister whose entire political career has been built on under-achievement. The most memorable thing she has ever done in her 15 years in parliament was to be one of two MPs to have joined the 380-metre \u201cMarch to Freedom\u201d during Andrea Leadsom\u2019s short-lived campaign to become Tory leader in 2016. But all mediocre things must come to an end eventually, and Villiers is tipped for the chop in the imminent reshuffle. The Commons was more or less deserted for Villiers\u2019 last stand \u2013 a bad day for the ticket touts who had eagerly been promoting her farewell appearance \u2013 but the environment secretary dutifully fulfilled her brief in her usual semi-detached manner. Her face is always devoid of expression and, in years to come, philosophers will debate whether she is more alive than dead. Still, Villiers did achieve a minor triumph in saying almost nothing of interest. She steered clear of the row over COP 26 \u2013 possibly because she had no idea the conference was even due to be taking place \u2013 and prevaricated over whether an Australian-style trade deal would mean no tariffs on koalas and kangaroos that had been barbecued in the bushfires. The closest she came to a coherent statement was that the whole point of Brexit was for Britain to waste a lot of time and money deciding to implement the same food and environmental standards that we had in the EU. It was a fittingly apt note of futility on which to bow out. Arise Lady Theresa. Your time has surely come.",

      "bodyText": "The Grenfell Tower inquiry has been delayed again so that the government can decide whether evidence given by professionals and company executives could also be used to mount criminal prosecutions against them. Hearings were first postponed last week and now will not restart until at least 24 February after the inquiry asked the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, to promise those involved in the disastrous refurbishment that what they say under cross-examination will not be used to try to send them to jail. The undertaking was requested by lawyers for corporate witnesses in the public inquiry who were involved in the refurbishment of the west London council block where a blaze claimed 72 lives. They include the cladding contractor, Harley Facades, current and former employees of the main contractor, Rydon, the client, Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, and the architects, Studio E. They have all threatened to refuse to answer questions otherwise. Detectives are investigating possible crimes including gross negligence manslaughter but have said they will not send any files to prosecutors until the end of the inquiry. The inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said he understood that survivors and bereaved might be \u201cindignant\u201d that witnesses should be allowed to dictate the terms on which they answered questions, but he said the right not to self-incriminate was enshrined in English law. The request for the undertaking had been opposed by the bereaved and survivors represented by Michael Mansfield QC, who said it had \u201ccaused immense anxiety, distress and anger\u201d. Mansfield argued that the inquiry already had enough documentary evidence to piece together what happened, but Moore-Bick said the inquiry wanted a deeper understanding of what went wrong at Grenfell and that could only be achieved through cross-examination. \u201cIt will not be possible for the inquiry properly to fulfil its terms of reference if witnesses do not have an assurance that the answers they give to questions will not be used in furtherance of criminal proceedings against them,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cIt is very regrettable, in our view, that the position likely to be adopted by the witnesses was not made clear months ago when the consequences could have been debated without the disruption to the timetable.\u201d He said he would urge the attorney general to make a rapid decision because the inquiry was \u201cconcerned with matters that directly affect the safety of the public at large\u201d. He said: \u201cThe work of the inquiry should not be delayed longer than necessary.\u201d Hearings were already scheduled to last until summer 2021 and further delays would threaten to push back the inquiry\u2019s final conclusions on the June 2017 disaster until 2022. Costs to the public purse, which have already reached \u00a340m, would also increase. Moore-Bick said: \u201cContrary to reports in the press, it does not grant anyone immunity from prosecution. It does not apply to any statements or documents already in the possession of the inquiry and it does not prevent the prosecuting authorities from making use of answers given by one witness in furtherance of proceedings against another.\u201d The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was almost alone among corporate participants in saying it wanted its present and former employees to give evidence openly without claiming privilege. However, John Hoban, a building control officer at the council responsible for overseeing Grenfell Tower\u2019s compliance with building regulations, said he would not answer some questions without the undertaking. The inquiry has already found that the building failed to meet building regulations, and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has apologised for its failures.",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s ambassador to the UK has condemned the British authorities for sowing panic over the coronavirus with its advice for all British citizens to leave the country. On Tuesday the British government became the first in the world to advise all citizens to leave China if they could, although unlike the US, Australia and several other countries, it has not banned entry for travellers who have recently visited mainland China. Ambassador Liu Xiaoming said the UK position was an overreaction that ignored World Heath Organization advice against sweeping travel restrictions, which he claimed UK officials had privately acknowledged was correct. \u201cI am not accusing, I would just like to see their words match their actions,\u201d Liu said at a press conference in London about China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. \u201cWe asked them to take the advice of the WHO, to make a reasonable reaction. \u201cWe don\u2019t think there should be such a panic. We were given notice before they [the UK] made a formal announcement, we advised them we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. We believe the epidemic is controllable, preventable and curable.\u201d The UK has three confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, two connected to the University of York and one diagnosed in Brighton on Thursday. The new patient did not contract the disease in the UK, the chief medical officer said. In China the disease still shows no sign of being brought under control, despite massive government mobilisation to try to contain it. There are now over 28,000 people infected, the vast majority in Hubei province, which is the centre of the outbreak, and over 560 people have died. Liu said the Chinese government had asked London to review its decision, but otherwise praised ties between the two countries. He said the Chinese and British governments had \u201cmaintained very close contact\u201d since the outbreak began, and praised collaboration between scientists from the two countries who are working in areas including tracing the origin of the coronavirus and the race to develop a vaccine. He declined to comment on why he thought London had brought in the hardline policy, saying that was for the Foreign Office to answer. As well as concerns over the spread of the virus, staff numbers on the ground in China were thought to be a factor. The British embassy has evacuated all non-essential staff and already warned that the support it could offer citizens would be reduced. Most UK citizens who were stranded in the quarantined centre of the outbreak have been evacuated on special flights, but tens of thousands more live in cities across China, often with Chinese relatives or dependents. Liu also raised concerns about \u201chatred and discrimination\u201d towards Chinese citizens and people of Chinese heritage in the UK, as fears about the virus grew. He said the embassy had had reports of discrimination from schools and universities, and had issued warning advice. He admitted that the country had not been fully prepared for an epidemic on the scale it was now battling. \u201cI can\u2019t say China is prepared for this outbreak, we don\u2019t have enough beds, hospitals,\u201d he said, adding that was why two new hospitals had been thrown up in Hubei in as many weeks. \u201cWe try our best to take as many patients as possible,\u201d he added.",

She fled the UK aged 15 to live under Isis with two friends, and subsequently bore three children, all of whom have since died. Other Britons or former Britons held in prisons in the region are believed to include Shahan Choudhury, who left London in 2014. He said he had acted as a gravedigger during Isis\u2019s last phase, burying victims of the conflict. Another is Hamza Parvez, a former police cadet from London, who joined Isis in 2014 and appeared in online propaganda videos urging other Britons to travel and join up, in the early phases of the self-styled caliphate. Syria\u2019s Kurdish forces were instrumental in helping remove Isis from Syria. Its military provided the ground forces that eliminated the group\u2019s hold on the territory in March last year but have been unable to turn that into a strong diplomatic or security position. They suffered a significant setback when the US president, Donald Trump, allowed Turkey to invade the border region in northern Syria in October. Ankara then set up a security zone in which Syrian Kurdish forces were excluded. Conditions in the prisons, where there are a handful of guards and little space for prisoners, are cramped and insanitary. There are fears they could become breeding grounds for future extremism. The Syria Kurds hope that if they start putting foreign fighters on trial, some western governments will provide extra money to secure their detention, although this has not been forthcoming in the past. The Foreign Office said that anyone who has fought for, or supported Isis, should face justice \u201cin the most appropriate jurisdiction, which will often be in the region where their offences have been committed\u201d. A spokesperson said they could not comment specifically on the Syrian Kurds announcement but added: \u201cAny internationally supported justice mechanism must respect human rights and the rule of law as well as ensure fair trials and due process.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Senate trial of Donald Trump has arrived at its preordained conclusion. The president has begun a victory lap to celebrate impunity and settle scores with a long list of enemies headed by Mitt Romney, while the Democrats return to their ill-starred primaries. But there are good reasons to believe that Ukraine, the reluctant focus of the impeachment battle, will continue to haunt US politics for some time to come. Trump\u2019s factotum, Rudy Giuliani, called on Wednesday for a redoubling of efforts to mine the country for damaging information about Joe Biden and his son, Hunter \u2013 the original sin that first launched impeachment saga. Giuliani was joined by two Republican senators, Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson, who sought to demonstrate their fealty by calling for Hunter Biden, who landed a job on a Ukrainian energy firm during the Obama administration, to be investigated for using government-funded travel for business reasons. On the other side of the barricades, Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chair of the House judiciary committee, said he expects to continue the investigation of Trump\u2019s actions towards Ukraine, irrespective of the Senate\u2019s acquittal, and would likely issue a subpoena for John Bolton, who became the dog that didn\u2019t bark at Trump\u2019s trial. Through selected leaks of his forthcoming memoir, the former national security adviser made clear he could provide damaging eye-witness testimony on Trump\u2019s efforts to extort political favours from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, by blocking military assistance and a White House invitation.

However, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s relative absence from the media spotlight, with fewer policy launches and media events (a joke among journalists was that McDonald won an early debate between Varadkar and Martin despite not even being there) has allowed a significant section of the electorate to see it as a radical change-maker, whether it is or not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/31/sinn-fein-ireland-left-election-ira\">Can Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s young voters finally pull Ireland to the left? | Roisin Agnew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Will the surge dissipate on election day? Spooked by losing seats in the 2019 local elections, Sinn F\u00e9in isn\u2019t running enough candidates to capitalise on its current nationwide popularity. The most likely outcome is some version of a Fianna F\u00e1il coalition, perhaps with Fine Gael \u2013 a potentially muted conclusion to a dramatic campaign. A single party, or a combination of parties and independents, requires 80 seats to form a majority or a coalition. A combination of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael seats would probably exceed that, whereas even if every Sinn F\u00e9in candidate were elected \u2013 which is highly unlikely \u2013 they would still only number 42.</p> <p>Sinn F\u00e9in may privately welcome a strong period in opposition, especially if there\u2019s an unpopular centrist government in power.

So unexpected was the Sinn F\u00e9in surge that RTE had to roll back on its initial format of a head-to-head debate between Varadkar and the Fianna F\u00e1il leader, Miche\u00e1l Martin. However, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s relative absence from the media spotlight, with fewer policy launches and media events (a joke among journalists was that McDonald won an early debate between Varadkar and Martin despite not even being there) has allowed a significant section of the electorate to see it as a radical change-maker, whether it is or not. Will the surge dissipate on election day? Spooked by losing seats in the 2019 local elections, Sinn F\u00e9in isn\u2019t running enough candidates to capitalise on its current nationwide popularity. The most likely outcome is some version of a Fianna F\u00e1il coalition, perhaps with Fine Gael \u2013 a potentially muted conclusion to a dramatic campaign. A single party, or a combination of parties and independents, requires 80 seats to form a majority or a coalition. A combination of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael seats would probably exceed that, whereas even if every Sinn F\u00e9in candidate were elected \u2013 which is highly unlikely \u2013 they would still only number 42. Sinn F\u00e9in may privately welcome a strong period in opposition, especially if there\u2019s an unpopular centrist government in power. Disgruntled public sentiment will not simply evaporate, the generational cleavage is very real and demands for change are louder than any party expected. Whatever happens on Saturday, the boundaries of Irish politics are being redrawn. \u2022 Una Mullally is a columnist for the Irish Times",

In Douglas, we can recognise a kind of acting that seems as antique, as \u201cperiod\u201d, precious and charming as the way <a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/07/16/the-feingold-column-the-gish-sisters-and-bowling-greens-disgrace/\" title=\"\">the Gish sisters </a>fluttered their hands and widened their eyes in the silent era. No one now is capable of the fun that Douglas had, or all the conviction he brought to good work and garbage alike. But he was Kirk Douglas \u2013 and others were not.</p> <p>However, to begin with, he wasn\u2019t Kirk at all. He was born Issur Danielovitch in Amsterdam, upstate New York, the son of Russian Jews, Herschel, a ragman who changed his name to Harry Demsky, and Bryna (nee Sanglel). The couple had only lately arrived from what is now Belarus \u2013 at the time a serious handicap to getting ahead. Yet Issur\u2019s upbringing was founded upon the preposterous gamble that ambition (and competitiveness) would bring success. That was the American way. </p> <p>He worked his way through St Lawrence University under the name Isidore Demsky, then found employment as a professional wrestler while he took classes at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. The wrestling was not just by necessity. Young and old, he was intensely physical, an intimidating presence (though not a big man), who always seemed capable of menace, danger and power.</p> <p>He was uncertain only about his name, for it was under the pseudonym George Spelvin Jr that he made his Broadway debut in a production of Spring Again, in 1941. After a few more plays, he had a couple of second world war years in the US navy as a lieutenant, before being discharged on medical grounds. Thus, he was already 30 before he made his movie debut (as Kirk Douglas), playing a bespectacled and repressed weakling in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946). The story goes that this break owed a good deal to his early friendship with a drama school classmate, Betty Perske, who would become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/13/lauren-bacall-obituary\" title=\"\">Lauren Bacall</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a7e4546be95649167d36366a84fc642e18d4013c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7e4546be95649167d36366a84fc642e18d4013c/0_278_3163_1898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kirk Douglas as Midge Kelly in Champion, 1949.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirk Douglas as Midge Kelly in Champion, 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was not at all bad, and it did not take long for the business to appreciate his huge energy and innate gift for what could be termed facial swashbuckling. His face was handsome until he grinned. Then he became a kind of Mr Punch. And when he spoke, the voice was poised to growl and roar. It had its own passionate vibrato \u2013 much taken up by comics and impersonators \u2013 but utterly natural in Douglas. Indeed, it was a force of will that seemed to come from a large man. His voice could be heroic, threatening, sardonic, merciless, epic or self-loathing \u2013 but it seldom meddled in the ordinary.</p> <p>Douglas was seen to great advantage as the villain in Jacques Tourneur\u2019s Out of the Past (1947), a man whose every smile seemed a more reliable portent of rage and violence. For a few years, he was tricky to cast, not quite hero or villain. But in 1949, he seized on the role of the ruthless boxer in Champion. This was an unreservedly nasty guy, redeemed only by his energy, his winning and his flawless determination. The movie\u2019s script (by Carl Foreman) was meant as a warning about boxing, corruption and even ambition itself, but Douglas made the man a pioneer to later raging bulls, and he deserved his best actor Oscar nomination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"cc044197b9089cc20a250e4bbcedf674eabe2009\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc044197b9089cc20a250e4bbcedf674eabe2009/0_98_2829_1697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kirk Douglas as Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life, 1956.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirk Douglas as Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life, 1956.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More important, Champion defined his star quality as a grinning villain, a rough-edged hero or a driven careerist. Over the next few years, he had the roles that established him. As the trumpet player in Young Man With a Horn (1950), supposedly inspired by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ue9igC7flI\" title=\"\">Bix Beiderbecke</a> (and dubbed by Harry James), he handled the horn in the way gangsters held guns. His wife in that film was played by Bacall in a thankless and unpleasant role.</p> <p>Over the next two years, he was the \u201cgentleman caller\u201d in the Gertrude Lawrence version of The Glass Menagerie; a western hero facing a desert ordeal in Along the Great Divide; the vicious, manipulative reporter in Billy Wilder\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/08/ace-in-the-hole-dvd-philip-french-review\" title=\"\">Ace in the Hole</a>; a neurotic cop having a breakdown in Detective Story; a Howard Hawks hero in The Big Sky; and then Shields in Vincente Minnelli\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/22/bad-and-the-beautiful-review\" title=\"\">The Bad and the Beautiful</a>.</p> <p>He got another Oscar nomination for his depiction of Shields, that flamboyant, conniving rascal of charm, a figure allegedly based on the Gone With the Wind producer David O Selznick, but really a tribute to the necessary piracy (in Hollywood\u2019s opinion) of its own \u201ccreative\u201d process. There could as easily have been nominations for Detective Story or Ace in the Hole, projects in which Douglas explored the darker sides of supposedly stalwart professions. That he died in both films \u2013 and died horribly \u2013 was a measure of his own commitment, as well as his fascination with pain. Few leading actors have enjoyed so many deaths and mutilations on screen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"af1dd39f40513fece4a975fdbb1e82a263e4f990\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af1dd39f40513fece4a975fdbb1e82a263e4f990/79_176_2279_1367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kirk Douglas in The Heroes of Telemark, 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirk Douglas in The Heroes of Telemark, 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Rank</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 1953, he was unquestionably a star, though not every film was well chosen. He was a trapeze artist with Pier Angeli in a scene from The Story of Three Loves (1953) which, along with Strangers When We Meet (1960), was his best love story. He was a rowdy sailor in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and was in Italy to make Ulysses (both 1954); he appeared in Man Without a Star for King Vidor (wrapped up in barbed wire in one scene); in The Indian Fighter; and was a racing car driver in The Racers (all 1955).</p> <p>But then, in 1956, with a face that was astonishingly suited to the self-portraits, he became Vincent van Gogh in Minnelli\u2019s Lust for Life. The passion of that film has not dated, in part because Minnelli trusted the paintings, the European locations and the importance of the painter\u2019s relationship with his younger brother, Theo. Douglas was superb and tragic in the role. For once there was no question about the validity of his self-destructive urges. He won a third best actor nomination, losing out to Yul Brynner in The King and I (other nominees that year were James Dean and Rock Hudson in Giant and Laurence Olivier as Richard III.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be2c0bf81b605aa0fa60c8624e1a1777e6e541e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be2c0bf81b605aa0fa60c8624e1a1777e6e541e0/0_0_2020_2375/851.jpg\" alt=\"Kirk Douglas in The Vikings, 1958.\" width=\"851\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirk Douglas in The Vikings, 1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: United Artists/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1955 Douglas formed his own production company, Bryna, and took an increasing interest in, and profit from, the business. He tried a rather dismal romantic comedy, Top Secret Affair (1957), but he was always funnier in scary moments. So he relied on action pictures and westerns: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCQb93-RrZo\" title=\"\">Gunfight at the OK Corral</a> (1957), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvB1jLld1W0\" title=\"\">The Vikings </a>(1958), Last Train from Gun Hill (1959), a strange version of The Devil\u2019s Disciple (1959) and The Last Sunset (1961).</p> <p>During this period he fell in with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-stanley-kubrick-1079329.html\" title=\"\">Stanley Kubrick</a> and played the first world war soldier-lawyer in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/01/paths-of-glory-review-kubrick-first-world-war\" title=\"\">Paths of Glory</a> (1957), a brave Bryna production. That led to Kubrick being hired to replace Anthony Mann on the apple of Douglas\u2019s eye, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/05/spartacus-kirk-douglas-kubrick\" title=\"\">Spartacus</a> (1960). He loved the Howard Fast novel for its epic potential, but also because he identified with slaves who won their freedom. \u201cI come from a race of slaves. That would have been my family, me<em>,</em>\u201d he said in his autobiography.</p> <p>In addition, Douglas helped crack the anti-communist blacklist by hiring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/16/dalton-trumbo-hollywood-blacklist-mitzi-trumbo-bryan-cranston\" title=\"\">Dalton Trumbo</a> to do the screenplay. The film shows his earnestness \u2013 it is, really, Douglas\u2019s picture more than Kubrick\u2019s \u2013 as well as his weakness for overdoing things. But Spartacus stands as a revealing portrait of a kind of naive Hollywood liberalism, pro-slave in all its sentiments, yet unerringly Roman at heart.

      "bodyText": "Without irony or modesty, Kirk Douglas, who has died aged 103, saw himself as the archetypal American, a sturdy bridge between the abyss of the past and the bounty of the new world. Indeed, he regarded his life story as worthy of some Los Angeleno Sistine chapel where he was posed \u2013 savage, muscular, radiant and determined \u2013 his arms linking penniless, uneducated immigrants from Russia and, say, his son Michael, a smooth prince of the city, a fabulously successful producer and actor. And I, Kirk would have cried to the fates and the heavens, I am the ragman\u2019s son. That was the title of his 1988 autobiography, in which he told the story of how an epitome of underprivilege had become world famous \u2013 recipient of the presidential medal of freedom, chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur, fulfilling the roles of Van Gogh, Spartacus, Doc Holliday, a one-eyed Viking chieftain, and Jonathan Shields in The Bad and the Beautiful, that model of Hollywood confidence, arrogance and alchemy who knows that being bad has its own fatal allure. His autobiography stopped short of the night in 1996 when Douglas, gaunt and wrestling with the after-effects of a stroke, at last received his first Oscar \u2013 an honorary one at that \u2013 and told the world that he was proud. No actor now would dare to perform with the zest and belief that drove him. In Douglas, we can recognise a kind of acting that seems as antique, as \u201cperiod\u201d, precious and charming as the way the Gish sisters fluttered their hands and widened their eyes in the silent era. No one now is capable of the fun that Douglas had, or all the conviction he brought to good work and garbage alike. But he was Kirk Douglas \u2013 and others were not. However, to begin with, he wasn\u2019t Kirk at all. He was born Issur Danielovitch in Amsterdam, upstate New York, the son of Russian Jews, Herschel, a ragman who changed his name to Harry Demsky, and Bryna (nee Sanglel). The couple had only lately arrived from what is now Belarus \u2013 at the time a serious handicap to getting ahead. Yet Issur\u2019s upbringing was founded upon the preposterous gamble that ambition (and competitiveness) would bring success. That was the American way. He worked his way through St Lawrence University under the name Isidore Demsky, then found employment as a professional wrestler while he took classes at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. The wrestling was not just by necessity. Young and old, he was intensely physical, an intimidating presence (though not a big man), who always seemed capable of menace, danger and power. He was uncertain only about his name, for it was under the pseudonym George Spelvin Jr that he made his Broadway debut in a production of Spring Again, in 1941. After a few more plays, he had a couple of second world war years in the US navy as a lieutenant, before being discharged on medical grounds. Thus, he was already 30 before he made his movie debut (as Kirk Douglas), playing a bespectacled and repressed weakling in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946). The story goes that this break owed a good deal to his early friendship with a drama school classmate, Betty Perske, who would become Lauren Bacall. He was not at all bad, and it did not take long for the business to appreciate his huge energy and innate gift for what could be termed facial swashbuckling. His face was handsome until he grinned. Then he became a kind of Mr Punch. And when he spoke, the voice was poised to growl and roar. It had its own passionate vibrato \u2013 much taken up by comics and impersonators \u2013 but utterly natural in Douglas. Indeed, it was a force of will that seemed to come from a large man. His voice could be heroic, threatening, sardonic, merciless, epic or self-loathing \u2013 but it seldom meddled in the ordinary. Douglas was seen to great advantage as the villain in Jacques Tourneur\u2019s Out of the Past (1947), a man whose every smile seemed a more reliable portent of rage and violence. For a few years, he was tricky to cast, not quite hero or villain. But in 1949, he seized on the role of the ruthless boxer in Champion. This was an unreservedly nasty guy, redeemed only by his energy, his winning and his flawless determination. The movie\u2019s script (by Carl Foreman) was meant as a warning about boxing, corruption and even ambition itself, but Douglas made the man a pioneer to later raging bulls, and he deserved his best actor Oscar nomination. More important, Champion defined his star quality as a grinning villain, a rough-edged hero or a driven careerist. Over the next few years, he had the roles that established him. As the trumpet player in Young Man With a Horn (1950), supposedly inspired by Bix Beiderbecke (and dubbed by Harry James), he handled the horn in the way gangsters held guns. His wife in that film was played by Bacall in a thankless and unpleasant role. Over the next two years, he was the \u201cgentleman caller\u201d in the Gertrude Lawrence version of The Glass Menagerie; a western hero facing a desert ordeal in Along the Great Divide; the vicious, manipulative reporter in Billy Wilder\u2019s Ace in the Hole; a neurotic cop having a breakdown in Detective Story; a Howard Hawks hero in The Big Sky; and then Shields in Vincente Minnelli\u2019s The Bad and the Beautiful. He got another Oscar nomination for his depiction of Shields, that flamboyant, conniving rascal of charm, a figure allegedly based on the Gone With the Wind producer David O Selznick, but really a tribute to the necessary piracy (in Hollywood\u2019s opinion) of its own \u201ccreative\u201d process. There could as easily have been nominations for Detective Story or Ace in the Hole, projects in which Douglas explored the darker sides of supposedly stalwart professions. That he died in both films \u2013 and died horribly \u2013 was a measure of his own commitment, as well as his fascination with pain. Few leading actors have enjoyed so many deaths and mutilations on screen. By 1953, he was unquestionably a star, though not every film was well chosen. He was a trapeze artist with Pier Angeli in a scene from The Story of Three Loves (1953) which, along with Strangers When We Meet (1960), was his best love story. He was a rowdy sailor in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and was in Italy to make Ulysses (both 1954); he appeared in Man Without a Star for King Vidor (wrapped up in barbed wire in one scene); in The Indian Fighter; and was a racing car driver in The Racers (all 1955). But then, in 1956, with a face that was astonishingly suited to the self-portraits, he became Vincent van Gogh in Minnelli\u2019s Lust for Life. The passion of that film has not dated, in part because Minnelli trusted the paintings, the European locations and the importance of the painter\u2019s relationship with his younger brother, Theo. Douglas was superb and tragic in the role. For once there was no question about the validity of his self-destructive urges. He won a third best actor nomination, losing out to Yul Brynner in The King and I (other nominees that year were James Dean and Rock Hudson in Giant and Laurence Olivier as Richard III.) In 1955 Douglas formed his own production company, Bryna, and took an increasing interest in, and profit from, the business. He tried a rather dismal romantic comedy, Top Secret Affair (1957), but he was always funnier in scary moments. So he relied on action pictures and westerns: Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957), The Vikings (1958), Last Train from Gun Hill (1959), a strange version of The Devil\u2019s Disciple (1959) and The Last Sunset (1961). During this period he fell in with Stanley Kubrick and played the first world war soldier-lawyer in Paths of Glory (1957), a brave Bryna production. That led to Kubrick being hired to replace Anthony Mann on the apple of Douglas\u2019s eye, Spartacus (1960). He loved the Howard Fast novel for its epic potential, but also because he identified with slaves who won their freedom. \u201cI come from a race of slaves. That would have been my family, me,\u201d he said in his autobiography. In addition, Douglas helped crack the anti-communist blacklist by hiring Dalton Trumbo to do the screenplay. The film shows his earnestness \u2013 it is, really, Douglas\u2019s picture more than Kubrick\u2019s \u2013 as well as his weakness for overdoing things. But Spartacus stands as a revealing portrait of a kind of naive Hollywood liberalism, pro-slave in all its sentiments, yet unerringly Roman at heart. For Douglas was by then an aristocrat who had no interest in giving up all he had won (except by charitable contribution). The picture was a commercial hit, but it won only one significant Oscar \u2013 best supporting actor for Peter Ustinov as the cynical slave-trader. It would seem that Douglas never worked as hard again, and he was surely pained that Spartacus was not even nominated for best picture. As an actor, he did more good work, though he was not quite as energised in Lonely Are the Brave (1962), one of his personal favourites; playing Shields again in Two Weeks in Another Town (1962); overshadowed by Burt Lancaster in Seven Days in May (1964); in Harm\u2019s Way (1965); The Heroes of Telemark (1965); outstanding in Elia Kazan\u2019s The Arrangement (1969); and There Was a Crooked Man (1970). Douglas had another burning cause in those years. He had helped get a play made out of Ken Kesey\u2019s novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest, and he had himself played its lead role \u2013 Randle P McMurphy, mad genius, slave leader, rebel and doomed hero \u2013 when it opened on Broadway in 1963. For years he tried to get it turned into a film, but without success. He eventually gave the project to his son Michael, and the film won five Oscars in 1976 \u2013 best picture, best actor, for Jack Nicholson\u2019s McMurphy, and best actress, director and screenplay.

Headcount is expected to grow by 20% \u201cor more\u201d this year. \u201cTwitter numbers look pretty darn good and a bounceback from a lacklustre third quarter,\u201d said Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com. \u201cIt\u2019s also encouraging that Twitter is executing on its strategy in a quarter when [Snapchat] struggled and Facebook also found life tougher.\u201d",

Bercow\u2019s book entitled Unspeakable was officially launched on Wednesday night. Excerpts were serialised in the Guardian. The criticisms come as Bercow waits to discover whether he will be given a peerage. Labour has nominated him, but senior Conservative sources have made clear they would like to block it. In one section of his book, Bercow writes about allegations made by a named staff member who, he says, accused him of bullying between 2010 and 2011 and was allegedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cAt no time during our work together did she complain to me.

A spokesman for Bercow defended his decision to name members of staff without their permission in his autobiography. The spokesman said: \u201cGiven there is a small but highly vocal group of people consistently seeking to blacken his name, it would be odd if Mr Bercow did not comment on their unfounded allegations and the reasons behind them. \u201cHe was advised by Speaker\u2019s counsel not to do so in detail while he was in office.

But to historians, \u201cHoly Island\u201d also has immense significance as the site, in AD793, of <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/lindisfarne-priory/History/viking-raid/\">the first major Viking raid </a><a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/lindisfarne-priory/History/viking-raid/\">in Britain or Ireland</a>, launching almost three centuries of destruction and occupation that dramatically shaped English history.</p> <p>The exact location of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/04/archaeologists-crowdfunded-search-lindisfarne-monastery-excavation\">early wooden monastery</a> is not known \u2013 ruins visible on the island today are from a <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/lindisfarne-priory/things-to-do/\">later priory</a> \u2013 but recent excavations on the island by archaeologists and volunteers from <a href=\"https://digventures.com/projects/lindisfarne/\">DigVentures</a> have located a cemetery and at least one building.</p> <p>The gaming piece, discovered last summer, came from a trench that has been dated to the eighth to ninth centuries, according to the project\u2019s lead archaeologist, David Petts, putting it squarely in the most notorious period of the island\u2019s history, around the time of the raid. Even if the game was being played by wealthy monks or pilgrims before the Vikings attacked, he says, it shows the influence that Norse culture already had across the north Atlantic.</p> <p>\u201cWe often tend to think of early medieval Christianity, especially on islands, as terribly austere: that they were all living a brutal, hard life,\u201d says Petts, a senior lecturer in the archaeology of northern England at Durham University.</p> <p>In fact, he says, Lindisfarne at the time would have been a bustling place peopled with monks, pilgrims, tradespeople, and even visiting kings. \u201cThe sheer quality of this piece suggests this isn\u2019t any old gaming set. Someone on the island is living an elite lifestyle.\u201d</p> <p>It is particularly valuable as an artefact, he says, because \u201cwe are starting to get an insight into the actual lives of the people who were in the monastery, rather than just their cemeteries and their afterlives\u201d.</p> <p>The gaming piece is unusual not only as an artefact but because of the manner of its discovery. DigVentures excavations are <a href=\"https://digventures.com/projects/lindisfarne/\">crowdfunded and staffed substantially by volunteers</a>, and the find was made by the mother of one of the team members, who was visiting the site for a day to celebrate her birthday.</p> <p>\u201cSeveral of the most significant finds from Lindisfarne have been made by members of the public,\u201d says DigVentures\u2019 managing director, Lisa Westcott Wilkins. \u201cThe big argument is that you can\u2019t do real archaeology with members of the public: you can, as long as it is properly supervised.\u201d</p> <p>When the piece was discovered, she says, \u201cmy heart was pounding, the little hairs on my arms were standing up. As a scientist, you have to train yourself out of having an emotional response to things like this.

      "bodyText": "It is not large \u2013 the shape and size of a chocolate sweet \u2013 and might easily have been discarded as a pebble by a less careful hand. But a tiny piece of worked glass unearthed during an excavation on Lindisfarne has been revealed to be a rare archaeological treasure linking the Northumbrian island with the Vikings, from the very beginning of one of the most turbulent periods in English history. Archaeologists believe the object, made from swirling blue and white glass with a small \u201ccrown\u201d of white glass droplets, is a gaming piece from the Viking board game hnefatafl (\u201cking\u2019s table\u201d), or a local version of the game. Whether dropped on the island by a Norse raider or owned by a high-status local imitating their customs, the gaming piece offers a rare tangible link between Lindisfarne\u2019s Anglo-Saxon monastery and the culture that eventually overwhelmed it. Lindisfarne is arguably best known for its spectacular illuminated gospels, which were created in the early eighth century in the island\u2019s first monastery. But to historians, \u201cHoly Island\u201d also has immense significance as the site, in AD793, of the first major Viking raid in Britain or Ireland, launching almost three centuries of destruction and occupation that dramatically shaped English history. The exact location of the early wooden monastery is not known \u2013 ruins visible on the island today are from a later priory \u2013 but recent excavations on the island by archaeologists and volunteers from DigVentures have located a cemetery and at least one building. The gaming piece, discovered last summer, came from a trench that has been dated to the eighth to ninth centuries, according to the project\u2019s lead archaeologist, David Petts, putting it squarely in the most notorious period of the island\u2019s history, around the time of the raid. Even if the game was being played by wealthy monks or pilgrims before the Vikings attacked, he says, it shows the influence that Norse culture already had across the north Atlantic. \u201cWe often tend to think of early medieval Christianity, especially on islands, as terribly austere: that they were all living a brutal, hard life,\u201d says Petts, a senior lecturer in the archaeology of northern England at Durham University. In fact, he says, Lindisfarne at the time would have been a bustling place peopled with monks, pilgrims, tradespeople, and even visiting kings. \u201cThe sheer quality of this piece suggests this isn\u2019t any old gaming set. Someone on the island is living an elite lifestyle.\u201d It is particularly valuable as an artefact, he says, because \u201cwe are starting to get an insight into the actual lives of the people who were in the monastery, rather than just their cemeteries and their afterlives\u201d. The gaming piece is unusual not only as an artefact but because of the manner of its discovery. DigVentures excavations are crowdfunded and staffed substantially by volunteers, and the find was made by the mother of one of the team members, who was visiting the site for a day to celebrate her birthday. \u201cSeveral of the most significant finds from Lindisfarne have been made by members of the public,\u201d says DigVentures\u2019 managing director, Lisa Westcott Wilkins. \u201cThe big argument is that you can\u2019t do real archaeology with members of the public: you can, as long as it is properly supervised.\u201d When the piece was discovered, she says, \u201cmy heart was pounding, the little hairs on my arms were standing up. As a scientist, you have to train yourself out of having an emotional response to things like this. It\u2019s a piece of evidence, bottom line. \u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s just so beautiful and so evocative of that time period, I couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d \u2022 You can explore a 3D interactive model of the hnefatafl piece here.",

      "bodyText": "The number 999 is burned into Edwin Moses\u2019s psyche. He holds the greatest winning streak in athletics for, as a two-times Olympic champion over 400m hurdles, Moses was unbeaten for nine years, nine months and nine days. From August 1977 to June 1987, he won 122 consecutive races but the worldly American, who is also a physicist and the chairman emeritus of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, has spent enough time in other countries, such as Britain, to know 999 is also the number to call in an emergency. For much of his life the struggle against doping has felt like an emergency to Moses. It explains why he has been at the forefront of anti-doping for 32 years and why, even now, he is such a vocal proponent of clean sport. Moses has helped lead the clampdown on Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping programme. He continues to monitor the situation in regard to a likely blanket ban on all Russian athletes competing in this summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics, even as \u201cauthorised neutrals\u201d, and he is heartened that last week World Athletics hardened its stance. Real changes and genuine contrition need to be shown by the Russian Athletics Federation to avoid the ban on all its individual athletes. This is a fight Moses has waged for decades. \u201cThat\u2019s why I worked out three times a day,\u201d he says when asked if he felt the shadow of doping among his rivals even when he seemed invincible as an athlete. \u201cI ate properly. I had a great stretching programme. I had a great physical therapist. I did all kinds of innovative training exercises. I swam. Did weights. But I also did it because I knew it would make me the best.\u201d This was not the template used by cheating athletes. \u201cWe all knew it was happening,\u201d Moses says. \u201cWe knew doping was wide scale because there was no drug testing \u2013 beyond being able to detect drugs for three or four days. It was unabated. \u201cI\u2019m a physicist. I\u2019ve got a biology and chemistry background. I wanted to be a doctor. So I was shocked when I went to the 1976 Olympics and saw some of the eastern bloc women. They were much more manly than me. \u201cThen, in the 1980s, more athletes used performance-enhancing drugs because out-of-competition testing did not exist. There was no test for testosterone or growth hormones then. EPO was brand new. So there was unabated use of these drugs all over the world. \u201cA few athletes spoke up but many made comments out of expediency. It was a dark period in my sport and it\u2019s continued for a long time. It\u2019s finally changing now but I was one of the few who spoke out at the start. People who protest, and do the right thing, usually don\u2019t have anything to gain. I was winning anyway so there was nothing for me to gain. I could have done nothing and track and field would have been worse than it is today. I made a difference. That\u2019s why we have out-of-competition drug testing \u2013 because of what I and a few others did in 1988.\u201d Athletics has never recovered from its loss of legitimacy in the aftermath of the dirtiest race in history, the 100m final at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, when Ben Johnson, the initial winner, failed a drug test. Serious questions, at the very least, have been raised over the other seven finalists. Moses, who won bronze in the 400m hurdles at those Games, when he was 33 and competing in his final Olympics, felt an even sharper desire to clean up his sport. \u201cAfter Ben Johnson, I put together a group of 10 US athletes. We demanded [out-of-competition] testing in the US. We got the money and legislation and drew up the drug programme from scratch because no one had ever done it. We got it ratified and the following year the US Olympic Committee adopted our programme. I became the chief of US testing from 1989 to 1994. \u201cThere was no such thing as Wada [the World Anti-Doping Agency] and, in the US, I was chairman of the committee for the big six Olympic sports. I negotiated agreements to test athletes and that was the first testing outside competition.\u201d The 64-year-old Moses seems energised by World Athletics. \u201cThey\u2019re doing an outstanding battle in the fight against doping and hopefully the corrupt people are gone. The news [last Thursday] was great. World Athletics put out a statement saying unless the Russians apologise for the last transgression [when their federation conspired to hide the truth with the 2018 world indoor high jump champion, Danil Lysenko, who missed three doping tests], they\u2019re rescinding the possibility of their athletes competing in Tokyo. Period. They\u2019ll stop all of them.\u201d At the world championships in Doha last October, 29 Authorised Neutral Athletes from Russia won six medals \u2013 despite their country being banned for four years. \u201cThe ones they allowed to compete [in Doha] were tested as much as anyone else. If they can\u2019t show the same evidence there\u2019s no reason to let them compete. I feel that way about any athlete from the many areas of the world where there\u2019s very little testing. But this latest news is significant. Someone\u2019s got to stand up for the right thing.\u201d Does he expect Russia to back down and apologise? \u201cNo. I doubt it.\u201d Moses is justifiably proud of his role in toughening up Wada \u2013 as the anti-doping agency seemed subservient to the International Olympic Committee. Moses and Beckie Scott, the chair of Wada\u2019s Athlete Committee, became embroiled in a row with the organisation. Scott said she was \u201cbullied\u201d in 2018 over her opposition to reinstating Russia\u2019s anti-doping agency. Moses supported Scott and he was told to \u201cshut up\u201d by some Wada officials. \u201cI\u2019m proud that \u2013 alongside Beckie and others on the athletes\u2019 commission \u2013 we forced Wada to look at its governance,\u201d Moses says. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ve been able to fix some of Wada\u2019s problems. Changes were made to bring an ethical balance to the way Wada is run internally. The Russians got caught red-handed and the evidence was clear from two investigations. \u201cBut politically it was perceived differently because of the money Russia puts into sports. If it had been a completely independent group that had nothing to do with international federations or the IOC, it would not have dragged on. At Wada they had federation guys and IOC guys who were not looking out for the best [anti-doping] interests. That was the innate problem. We forced them to deal with those issues.\u201d Will Wada be stronger now? \u201cWe will see. The new president at Wada, Witold Banka, is a [former Poland] athlete. I think the strain in anti-doping politics has been taken out because the leadership has changed. That was the elephant in the room. It started at the top [with the former president Craig Reedie being associated with the IOC].\u201d Is the war against doping being won? \u201cOur deterrent model is very important. New software packages mean we\u2019re able to buy the right tests that can withstand the legal, analytical and statistical scrutiny required to prove a test is conclusive. Drugs are being detected for longer periods of time. They\u2019re now looking at proteins in the body that change immediately upon use of growth hormone, testosterone, EPO. We can detect more because we\u2019re looking at protein chains, 200 or 300 segments long, in the DNA. That\u2019s brought in a whole new way of testing.\u201d Moses is also a passionate ambassador for Laureus \u2013 the group that celebrates the power of sport to transform the lives of millions of people.

The post I called on him to renounce was the <a href=\"http://www.bafta.org/about/key-personnel/president\">presidency of Bafta</a>.

In casting my votes, I aimed to observe this rubric. From what I know of my fellow academicians, they would have done likewise. Yet our president appeared to think we had done something wrong.</p> <p>Introducing Bafta\u2019s highest award, its fellowship \u2013 which this year went to <a href=\"https://www.lucasfilm.com/leadership/kathleen-kennedy/\">Kathleen Kennedy</a>, one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful producers \u2013 the Prince upbraided us thus: \u201cIn 2020, and not for the first time in the last few years, we find ourselves talking again about the need to do more about diversity in the sector and in the awards process. That simply cannot be right in this day and age.\u201d What can he have meant?</p> <p>Presumably he was referring to the dissatisfaction that has been expressed about the paucity of women and individuals from ethnic minorities among the awards nominees. Presumably he thinks that things should have been different.

Surely, he didn\u2019t imagine that we academicians say to ourselves, \u201cDirector X\u2019s achievement has been greater than that of any of her peers, but I won\u2019t vote for her because she\u2019s a woman.\u201d Or that we adopt a similar attitude to ethnic minority actors.

      "bodyText": "The other day, I wrote to Prince William, urging him to resign. Not from his second-in-line thingy: he seems to do that job OK, if nowhere near as well as his wife does hers. The post I called on him to renounce was the presidency of Bafta. As a voting academician, I felt obliged to take this step after puzzling over the opaque remarks he read from notes at Sunday\u2019s awards ceremony. The purpose of the academy\u2019s annual awards is \u201cto recognise, honour and reward individuals for outstanding achievement in feature films released in the UK within the awards year\u201d. In casting my votes, I aimed to observe this rubric. From what I know of my fellow academicians, they would have done likewise. Yet our president appeared to think we had done something wrong. Introducing Bafta\u2019s highest award, its fellowship \u2013 which this year went to Kathleen Kennedy, one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful producers \u2013 the Prince upbraided us thus: \u201cIn 2020, and not for the first time in the last few years, we find ourselves talking again about the need to do more about diversity in the sector and in the awards process. That simply cannot be right in this day and age.\u201d What can he have meant? Presumably he was referring to the dissatisfaction that has been expressed about the paucity of women and individuals from ethnic minorities among the awards nominees. Presumably he thinks that things should have been different. So what does he think went wrong? The most obvious explanation is that he considers us voters to have been making biased judgments. Surely, he didn\u2019t imagine that we academicians say to ourselves, \u201cDirector X\u2019s achievement has been greater than that of any of her peers, but I won\u2019t vote for her because she\u2019s a woman.\u201d Or that we adopt a similar attitude to ethnic minority actors. If he did take such a view, he would want to resign anyway, rather than preside over an institution with this kind of membership. Does he imagine that bias is distorting our decision-making, but that it\u2019s unconscious? Even this doesn\u2019t feel plausible. Of the things that might cloud an assessment of directorial achievement, unacknowledged misogyny must be a long way down the list. The ethnicity of an actor cannot be overlooked, but in 2014 Steve McQueen\u2019s 12 Years a Slave won best film, Chiwetel Ejiofor won best actor and Barkhad Abdi won best supporting actor, while Lupita Nyong\u2019o received a nomination. So this electorate cannot really be in thrall to covert racism. The harsh reality is that this year\u2019s judgments continue to seem defensible, even when re-examined in the light of the royal critique. Some excellent films were directed by women last year. I admired Little Women, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, The Souvenir, Harriet, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Hustlers, Booksmart, Honey Boy and Atlantics. As I wrote last week, I consider The Farewell the year\u2019s most illuminating picture. But, when compared with the competition, I don\u2019t think any of these constitutes the year\u2019s \u201cbest film\u201d. Many of these titles were well-directed, but they tended not to require the outstanding directing skill required to snag the director award. As it happens, For Sama won best documentary and three of the five films nominated for film not in the English language were directed or co-directed by women. All the same, it would be extraordinary if the nominations overall featured as many female as male directors. The reason for this is simple enough. A tangle of causes, which extend beyond patriarchal discrimination, mean there are many more male than female directors. Only five per cent of the 1,300 top-grossing films made between 2007 and 2019 were directed by women. Similarly, more white than ethnic minority actors win awards because there are more white roles. Colour-blind casting might help redress the balance in a romp such as The Personal History of David Copperfield, but in a predominantly naturalistic medium this process can only go so far. As long as the industry is dominated by white males, they are likely to dominate awards lists. This has long been understood. Even Bafta\u2019s president has surely clocked this unwelcome fact, which led me to decide that he couldn\u2019t really be suspecting us of faulty discernment after all. His beef could only have lain elsewhere. Presumably he thought we ought to be saying to ourselves: \u201cDirector X may not have been the top achiever of the year, but she was pretty good.

Commitment to the idea of ranking runs wide and deep, as shown by the otherwise absurd attention paid to awards, or the passionate engagement with things like top 10s or the Guardian\u2019s Oscar hustings. Anyway, rigging the Baftas in favour of the supposedly disadvantaged would prove counterproductive. Female and ethnic minority film-makers are at last making headway in the industry, if not as speedily as many might wish. Artificially misrepresenting their progress would do them no favours. All that would happen is that the standing of those minority award-winners who might otherwise have made it on merit alone would become tainted.

We can\u2019t afford this as a party.\u201d</p> <p>She told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019re here in Bassetlaw, where at the event this morning people were clearly very, very angry about having a candidate imposed on them because they feel it\u2019s not just disrespectful to the Labour party but it\u2019s disrespectful to people in the public who deserve the best candidate.

The approach to local councillors would strengthen Labour\u2019s work in regaining the scores of \u201cred wall\u201d seats lost at the December poll, she suggested. Overall, the party lost 59<br>constituencies in its worst defeat since 1935.</p> <p>Addressing local councillors and residents in Worksop, Bassetlaw, which is represented by the Conservative MP Brendan Clarke-Smith, she suggested \u00a312bn of funding for local enterprise partnerships (Leps) should go straight to local authorities.</p> <p>Nandy also told members in Worksop that she \u201ccan\u2019t disagree more\u201d with the proposals of Richard Burgon, a deputy leadership candidate, to ballot the party before backing military action unless it was an emergency or approved by the UN. Nandy said senior former Labour figures, who warned against the war in Iraq, would be \u201cashamed\u201d of his plan and what it signalled for the future of the party.</p> <p>\u201cI have to say that I think Robin Cook would be ashamed of where we may end up as a party,\u201d she said. \u201cAt times in our history there have been moments when we have had to stand up and go to protect people all over the world. In Sierra Leone, and Rwanda, those people cannot wait for us to go and ballot Labour party members. I think everyone in this party understands that.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a responsibility to protect and we have obligations to people outside our borders and that\u2019s the kind of Labour party I will lead.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Murray, another deputy leadership candidate, also criticised Burgon\u2019s suggestion. \u201cThis is a reckless proposal that will do nothing to regain the trust of the public,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of the reason we lost the last two elections is because people didn\u2019t trust our leadership when it came to national security \u2013 this is the worst possible way to address that problem.\u201d</p> <p>With the leadership contest entering its second month, Keir Starmer is the frontrunner, but Rebecca Long-Bailey and Nandy are also through to the ballot paper. Emily Thornberry is the fourth candidate, yet to be confirmed for the ballot.</p> <p>Pollster Ipsos Mori released some data about the Labour leadership candidates on Thursday, suggesting that Starmer has a clear lead over his three rivals with regards to who is seen as having what it takes to be a good prime minister. Thirty-two percent of people view him this way, the poll suggests. Long-Bailey, his main rival, came last, with only 14% of people seeing her as having what it takes to be a good PM, and 42% saying she does not.</p> <p>However, almost half of those asked about the four Labour leadership candidates either said that they did not know whether they had what it takes to be a good prime minister, or said that they did not have a view either way, suggesting views on the candidates could change if name recognition increased.</p>",

Nandy said senior former Labour figures, who warned against the war in Iraq, would be \u201cashamed\u201d of his plan and what it signalled for the future of the party. \u201cI have to say that I think Robin Cook would be ashamed of where we may end up as a party,\u201d she said. \u201cAt times in our history there have been moments when we have had to stand up and go to protect people all over the world. In Sierra Leone, and Rwanda, those people cannot wait for us to go and ballot Labour party members. I think everyone in this party understands that. \u201cWe have a responsibility to protect and we have obligations to people outside our borders and that\u2019s the kind of Labour party I will lead.\u201d Ian Murray, another deputy leadership candidate, also criticised Burgon\u2019s suggestion. \u201cThis is a reckless proposal that will do nothing to regain the trust of the public,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of the reason we lost the last two elections is because people didn\u2019t trust our leadership when it came to national security \u2013 this is the worst possible way to address that problem.\u201d With the leadership contest entering its second month, Keir Starmer is the frontrunner, but Rebecca Long-Bailey and Nandy are also through to the ballot paper. Emily Thornberry is the fourth candidate, yet to be confirmed for the ballot. Pollster Ipsos Mori released some data about the Labour leadership candidates on Thursday, suggesting that Starmer has a clear lead over his three rivals with regards to who is seen as having what it takes to be a good prime minister. Thirty-two percent of people view him this way, the poll suggests. Long-Bailey, his main rival, came last, with only 14% of people seeing her as having what it takes to be a good PM, and 42% saying she does not. However, almost half of those asked about the four Labour leadership candidates either said that they did not know whether they had what it takes to be a good prime minister, or said that they did not have a view either way, suggesting views on the candidates could change if name recognition increased.",

There are plans to remove levies on products that are used by key manufacturing industries and those where the UK has no domestic production Twitter shares jumped in pre-market trading after ite quarterly revenues breached $1bn for the first time Twitter shares are up 6% in pre-market trading after releasing fourth quarter and annual earnings figures for 2019. Some highlights: Revenue was up 14% at $3.46bn, year-on-year Fourth quarter revenue also pushed past the $1bn mark for the first time Annual net income increased to $1.47bn, up from $1.21bn a year earlier The company also said it\u2019s continuing to expand and will grow headcount by 20% or more in 2020. They ended the year with 4,800 employees so that would be roughly 960 new staff. The FTSE 100 is still holding above 7,500 (at least by 13 points or so). It\u2019s being helped in part by the weaker pound which is down 0.3% against both the euro and US dollar. The FCA\u2019s letter to investment platforms CEOs can be read in full here. The Financial Conduct Authority has written to CEOs of investment platforms, warning that they must be \u201cimpartial\u201d when putting together Best Buy lists for customers. The \u201cDear CEO\u201d letter touches on a number of issues including conflicts of interest: If not appropriately identified and managed, conflicts of interest can lead to customers receiving poor value for money and / or products and services that are unsuitable for their needs. We expect you to identify all potential conflicts of interest and to have processes in place to effectively manage them. Firms operating Best Buy lists must construct them impartially and manage conflicts e.g. preference for funds offering discounts over formal and objective criteria, lack of independence of research teams and associated governance. Processes for clear selection, monitoring and deselection of funds on lists should be documented, understood and followed. You may remember how much criticism Hargreaves Lansdown attracted for having listed Neil Woodford\u2019s flagship Equity Income Fund on its Wealth 50 list of favourite investments, despite concerns about the size of his investments in smaller and unlisted companies, which are harder to sell. Hargreaves said in the months later said it was aware of the fund\u2019s underperformance but kept it on the list in the hope it would bounce back. The Woodford Equity Income Fund is now being liquidated, but the whole debacle has focused minds on regulation of the fund industry and investment platforms that promote them to retail investors. A quick catch-up on Christine Lagarde, who was speaking in the European parliament. Nothing ground-breaking. The European Central Bank boss said that growth remains modest but there are tentative signs of stabilisation, even if the coronavirus outbreak in China clouds the horizon, she said. ViaReuters: The ECB has maintained ultra-easy policies for years to boost growth and Lagarde said this support was still needed to shield the currency bloc from global headwinds. While uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment remain elevated, those related to trade tensions between the United States and China are receding. The Scottish government\u2019s budget will take place after midday, and will be led by Kate Forbes, the Scottish public finance minister. She replaces Derek Mackay, who resigned this morning as finance minister over texts to a 16-year-old boy. At mid-morning the European stock rally has lost some of its momentum. The FTSE 100 and the mid-cap FTSE 250 are both up by about 0.2%, while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40 have gained about 0.6% apiece. That has weighted down the Euro Stoxx 600, which has fallen back from the record highs. Some good news for 70,000 customers of Nationwide, the UK\u2019s largest building society, which has failed to warn customers of impending charges for the second time in six months. Nationwide will pay back \u00a3900,000 to 70,000 customers after it failed to warn them about unarranged overdrafts, breaching banking rules. It did send text alerts, but these did not contain a warning that customers would be charged. The majority of customers will be refunded by 27th March, with the rest completed by 29th May, according to a letter sent out by the Competition and Markets Authority. Trade wonk news: the government has launched its consultation on Britain\u2019s post-Brexit tariff schedules, with plans to remove levies on products that are used by key manufacturing industries and those where the UK has no domestic production. The four-week consultation (to close on 5 March) will likely be the target of intense lobbying, as manufacturing industries in particular try to secure cheaper materials and components. The new tariff schedule will kick in on 1 January 2021, confirming a move away from the EU\u2019s common external tariff, the Department for International Trade said. Among the plans outlined in a brief consultation document are removing \u201cnuisance\u201d tariffs of less than 2.5%, having standardised bands, as well as the industry-specific cuts. And watch out on the farming front: there are plans for \u201csteps towards agricultural tariffs that are applied as single percentages\u201d. And that oil price data for you: Brent crude futures have gained 0.6% to reach $55.60 per barrel \u2013 although they have retreated somewhat from the levels above $56.50 hit in the early morning. The price of futures for West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, have held on to more of their gains: one option will set you back $51.39, a gain of 1.3% for Thursday. Oil prices have continued to rally from lows hit earlier in the week, as investors weigh whether the hit to demand has been fully priced in, and producers near agreement on output cuts. A meeting of Opec as well as Russia could result in a deal today to cut back on production, sustaining prices, Reuters reports: An Opec+ technical committee may reach consensus on Thursday on the need to further cut oil output by at least 500,000 barrels per day in response to the coronavirus\u2019 impact on energy demand and global economic growth, two sources told Reuters. The so-called JTC panel has extended its meeting for a third day into Thursday after Russia voiced its opposition to a deeper supply cut and was instead suggesting an extension of current cuts. Carmaker Toyota has bucked the recent trend and raised its profits forecasts \u2013 but the Japanese carmaker acknowledged that coronavirus had not yet been factored in on its earnings. Toyota raised its annual operating profit forecast by 4.2% on favourable currency rates and better-than-expected vehicle sales, despite warning that there would be an impact on sales for the world\u2019s second largest carmaker. Carmakers are among the hardest-hit companies because Wuhan, the city where the outbreak is believed to have originated, is a key automotive hub. Supply chains stretching around the world have been affected, and sales are expected to fall off a cliff until the epidemic stops. Toyota operating officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi told a news conference (via Reuters): We are looking very closely at inventories of components which are made in China and used in other countries, including Japan, and at the possibility of alternative production. *Refresh your page to see a correction to a previous post.

The FTSE 250 has gained 0.7%. France\u2019s Cac 40 gained 0.8% at the open, while Germany\u2019s Dax gained 0.7%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China has said it would halve additional tariffs levied against 1,717 US goods last year, in a move that has boosted markets in Asia that have been under pressure since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. The products benefiting are part of $75bn of goods on which China imposed tariffs worth between 5% and 10% in September as part of a tit-for-tat trade war with the Trump administration. Analysts said that the tariff cut is partly a move by Beijing to boost confidence amid an outbreak that has disrupted businesses in China\u2019s core manufacturing regions and hit investor sentiment. 560 deaths had been reported so far on Thursday morning in China. And the reaction was strong on Asian markets, with the CSI 300 index, which measures the biggest stocks on Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, rising by 1.86%. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite index rose by 1.72%, stocks in Hong Kong rose by 2.4%, and the Japanese Topix index gained 2%. The tariff cuts, that will come into effect on 14 February, Valentine\u2019s Day, come after the signing of a Phase 1 trade deal that brought a truce to a bruising trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Craig Nicol said: It shouldn\u2019t be surprising news as this comes after both nations had agreed in Phase 1 negotiations that they would reduce tariffs on each other\u2019s goods as part of the deal Deutsche Bank\u2019s forecasters predict Chinese GDP growth will be 5.8% this year, 0.3 percentage points lower than previously forecast.

      "bodyText": "You probably already suspected this, but people in the UK are not feeling altogether happy with life. For the first time since the Office for National Statistics started measuring wellbeing, indexes of both life satisfaction and the feeling that things done in life are worthwhile have declined significantly. After a trend of rising life satisfaction between 2011 and 2016 and plateauing scores until late 2018, the measure of contentment fell for the first time in the quarter to autumn 2019, according to data released on Thursday. At the same time an index of \u201cfeelings that the things done in life are worthwhile\u201d also fell, making it the first time both had dipped significantly year on year since 2011, when the statistics body began measuring wellbeing and happiness. \u201cIt is the first significant change since early 2015 in what was a stable picture of life satisfaction in the UK,\u201d the statisticians said. A third measure of \u201chappiness\u201d also dipped while average anxiety ratings remained at an elevated level in the quarter to September 2019, with about 10.6 million people feeling high anxiety. The figures come from the government\u2019s annual population survey, a continuous household survey capturing data from 320,000 people, the largest of its type. Any consequences of our mood and happiness resulting from the December general election and Britain\u2019s departure from the EU last week will not be known until later in the year, when figures are released for those periods. The ONS suggests the dip in the national mood could be linked to households\u2019 economic worries, even though they may not be well-founded. The data showed that household expectations about future unemployment worsened in the last year, even though actual unemployment continued to fall. The statisticians said the deterioration in personal wellbeing would reflect those worries it suggested could have been caused by widespread media coverage of business failures, with Debenhams going into administration and Boots and Marks &amp; Spencer among those announcing store closures. Equally, households\u2019 expectations for the future of the economy as a whole continued to decline as they have done since 2014, becoming increasingly negative. That is despite households\u2019 views of their own financial situation improving and becoming more positive. \u201cExpectations about the economy were reflected in real household spending per person which grew at its slowest rate since the end of 2016,\u201d the ONS said. People were spending less on cars than in 2016, and spending on recreation, culture and holidays also slowed over the last two years. All of the measures of happiness and wellbeing remain higher than in the immediate aftermath of the financial crash. Other recent research has shown more subtle influences on happiness, such as the trend towards more flexible working. A survey last month of families found that half of all parents able to work remotely or from home said that doing so had probably increased the hours they work for no extra pay. The charity Working Families found that parents working outside of their contracted hours were more likely to feel stressed. Of those parents staying in \u201cwork mode, 54% said work led to arguments with their children, and 57% said it contributed to arguments with partners.",

Verona\u2019s home game against Brescia in November 2019 was halted for several minutes after Mario Balotelli was racially abused by fans. The club were given a partial stadium ban but that was suspended by the Italian football federation\u2019s appeals court. In January a 38-year-old fan was given a five-year stadium ban after being found guilty of directing racial abuse at Balotelli. He was accused of initiating the racist chants, which led to a visibly angry Balotelli kicking the ball into the crowd, and was identified by Verona police after they reviewed CCTV footage and eyewitness accounts. Verona also banned the leader of their ultras, Lucas Castellini, until 30 June 2030 over racist comments he made about the Brescia striker in the days after the incident at the Bentegodi. For the game against Juventus, set to be a 28,000 sell-out, stewards will wear small \u201cbody cams\u201d measuring 8.15cm by 5.45cm. The scheme was successfully tested in the recent home game against Lecce. Balotelli is not the only player to have been subjected to racism in Italy this season. Internazionale\u2019s Romelu Lukaku was subjected to monkey chants by Cagliari fans in September \u2013 and was then told by Inter ultras that such chanting should not be interpreted as racist. That same month an Italian TV pundit was sacked for saying that the only way to stop Romelu Lukaku was to give \u201chim 10 bananas to eat\u201d and in December the paper Corriere dello Sport was widely condemned for a front page previewing the game between Lukaku\u2019s Inter and Chris Smalling\u2019s Roma with the headline \u201cBlack Friday\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The British government is helping a controversial Israeli spyware company to market its surveillance technologies at a secretive trade fair visited by repressive regimes, the Guardian can reveal. The government will host the NSO Group, which sells technology that has allegedly been used by autocratic regimes to spy on the private messages of journalists and human rights activists, at the closed Security and Policing trade fair in Hampshire next month. The NSO Group is due to be an exhibitor at the three-day fair, where police and security officials from abroad can browse commercial stalls selling surveillance and crowd-control equipment. Around 60 foreign delegations are typically hosted by the British government to the fair. In the last four years they have included countries whose human rights records have been criticised such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, Oman, Qatar and Hong Kong. The identities of this year\u2019s delegations are not known as they are usually announced on the opening day of the fair. NSO has faced allegations that its technology is used to target human rights activists and reporters around the world. At least three UK residents are among those who are alleged to have been targeted using spyware sold by NSO. Among them is a prominent London-based satirist who is suing Saudi Arabia in the UK courts alleging that the Riyadh regime targeted him using malware developed by the firm. The company is being sued in the US by WhatsApp, the popular messaging app, which has alleged that 1,400 of its users were hacked over a two-week period last year. NSO has denied the allegation. The company\u2019s signature spyware has also allegedly been used to target journalists, including a recently revealed case involving a reporter for the New York Times who is alleged to have been targeted by Saudi Arabia using NSO technology. NSO has denied the allegation. Last week Reuters reported that the FBI was examining whether NSO technology was used against Americans. The firm said it was not aware of any inquiry. The annual trade fair is organised by the Home Office and the Department for International Trade. The NSO Group has attended previously. The general public have been barred from the fairs. Whitehall memos show that the government has a strict criteria for selecting who attends and exhibits. Last year Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour MP who was sitting on the parliamentary committee examining arms exports, was denied entry. The Home Office bills the fair as \u201cTHE official government global security event, offering a world-class opportunity\u201d to network with government officials and buy technology from commercial firms. More than 300 firms, mainly from the UK, are due to exhibit their products at this year\u2019s fair, which will open on 3 March at the Farnborough airport exhibition centre. Brochures from previous years show how firms were seeking to sell equipment for many kinds of surveillance, from software that \u201cintercepts\u201d national phone and internet systems to traditional \u201cbugs\u201d that can be attached to cars or hidden in walls. Some exhibitors are promising \u201cimmersive experiences\u201d to help sell their products. Ministers are due to give keynote addresses at the fair, which is also attended by senior government officials. In its promotional material for the fair, the NSO Group calls itself a \u201cglobal leader in the world of cyber-intelligence, data acquisition and analysis\u201d. It says it sells its technology to selected intelligence agencies, militaries and law enforcement organisations around the world to fight crime and terrorism. It says it is \u201ccommitted to the proper use of its technology to help governments strengthen public safety and protect against major security threats\u201d.

NSO has said its technology is only intended to be used to fight crime and terrorism. Martyn Day, a lawyer representing Almasarir, said: \u201cUnless the government is prepared to take a stand and make it clear that it is inappropriate for such software to be sold to oppressive regimes then we are nothing short of colluding with those very regimes in their oppression of dissidents. A Home Office spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cThe government will do all it can to help keep British people and British interests safe in the UK and overseas\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The lead single from Frazey Ford\u2019s 2015 album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/frazey-ford-indian-ocan-review-kitty-empire-folk-memphis-gem\">Indian Ocean</a>, a coruscating breakup lament called Done, came accompanied by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXRrySTujn8\">one of the great videos</a> of the last decade. It featured Ford leading a gaggle of glammed-up, righteously pissed-off looking mums through Vancouver, with some of their kids in tow. They march down suburban pavements, dance with abandon and cruise the streets in a battered mobile home. At one point, Ford visits a record store and holds an Otis Redding album up to the camera, which figures.</p> <p>When Ford\u2019s former bandmate in the Canadian group the Be Good Tanyas, Jolie Holland, struck out on a solo career, she concentrated on paring the band\u2019s rootsy Americana down until it was stark and eerie (her version of their best-known song, The Littlest Birds, dramatically shifted its mood from amiable to chilling). But Ford has developed a sound rooted in warm southern soul. On Indian Ocean, she even employed the old house musicians from Memphis\u2019 Hi Records \u2013 men who 40 years previously had played on Al Green\u2019s classic 70s albums and Ann Peebles\u2019 I Can\u2019t Stand the Rain.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tge9e-DJhAM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Tge9e-DJhAM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video for The Kids Are Having None of It</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In one sense, it was a bold move. The world is hopelessly overstuffed with artists plying variations on retro soul, from aged original practitioners rescued from obscurity by younger enthusiasts to post-Winehouse pop singers and the kind of bands who talk about \u201creal music\u201d and wish to signpost their disdain for the shallow fripperies of modernity. It\u2019s tough to cut through this crowded market, but Ford\u2019s albums do. Despite the presence of musicians who were there the first time around, Indian Ocean never sounded like a Sealed Knot re-creation or shallow pastiche. Ford wrote fantastic songs \u2013 everything from acute little character studies to stuff that sounded like gospel \u2013 and wove country and jazz into a sound that perfectly fitted her understated voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c24b0aab7d685f118e486273f9d77b3a2e5fb3c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c24b0aab7d685f118e486273f9d77b3a2e5fb3c6/0_0_3600_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of U Kin B The Sun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>She continues and refines this approach on U Kin B the Sun. The horn arrangements and the Hi Rhythm Section are gone \u2013 guitarist Teenie Hodges died before Indian Ocean was released. Its sound is barer: bass pushed to the front, gentle shadings of guitar and keyboards, lots of empty space. And the mood is darker. The lyrics touch on relationship strife in no-punches-pulled style on the bluntly titled Motherfucker; on the survivors of the 2018 Parkland school shooting in The Kids Are Having None of It (\u201cThey can\u2019t be bought, they can\u2019t be taught your hate\u201d); and on Ford\u2019s complicated relationship with her parents, whom she has bluntly described as \u201ca complete disaster\u201d. The opening track, Azad, doesn\u2019t make life as the daughter of young hippies constantly on the run from the draft sound like much fun: it takes the sight of a dragonfly to make her realise \u201cthere is beauty in this world, so hold it any way you know how\u201d.</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s often hard to work out what the lyrics are about. Ford has a habit of smearing words to incomprehensibility, leaving it to the sound of her voice to convey the emotion of a song. Luckily, that\u2019s something her voice is eminently capable of doing. Abundantly aware of the fact that less is more, her vocals are high, airy and textured with a gently fluttering vibrato but, as befits a woman who writes songs called things such as Motherfucker, you\u2019d never describe them as delicate. They\u2019re capable of landing a raw emotional punch or of conveying something more complex. On U and Me, which seems to be another breakup song, her tone switches from warm to wracked and back again, as sadness and loss are tempered by genuine fondness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4N5WuLpUuLCY98TrthGv3C\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4N5WuLpUuLCY98TrthGv3C\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>For all the darkness of the subject matter, there is a warmth to the album. It makes sense that it comes with a cover dappled by sunlight. This is partly to do with the production which, for all its sparseness, has a lovely organic, intimate feeling \u2013 it frequently feels as though you\u2019re eavesdropping on a band playing live \u2013 and partly to do with the strength of the melodies: choruses gently surge, vocal harmonies are sparingly applied but beautiful. The exception is the closing title track, which lasts the best part of six minutes. It comes to a halt midway through, then reassembles itself as a thick, dream-like swirl of sound, rich with echoing, multitracked vocals that sound positively ecstatic. As usual, it is hard to make out exactly what they\u2019re singing, beyond the fact that Ford keeps repeating the word \u201cjoy\u201d, as if reaffirming her dragonfly-induced childhood revelation about the beauty of the world.</p> <p>Its mood is heady and infectious, the perfect end to an album that doesn\u2019t grab your attention with pyrotechnic displays, opting instead for a slow-burning, unassuming kind of power: a low-key delight, but a delight all the same.</p> <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8mag3GO2Es\">Franky Wah: Time After Time (feat Jessie Ware) (Elliot Adamson mix)</a></strong></p> <p>Elliot Adamson\u2019s remix turns a poppy track inside out, transforming it into distorted, fierce acid house.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The lead single from Frazey Ford\u2019s 2015 album Indian Ocean, a coruscating breakup lament called Done, came accompanied by one of the great videos of the last decade. It featured Ford leading a gaggle of glammed-up, righteously pissed-off looking mums through Vancouver, with some of their kids in tow. They march down suburban pavements, dance with abandon and cruise the streets in a battered mobile home. At one point, Ford visits a record store and holds an Otis Redding album up to the camera, which figures. When Ford\u2019s former bandmate in the Canadian group the Be Good Tanyas, Jolie Holland, struck out on a solo career, she concentrated on paring the band\u2019s rootsy Americana down until it was stark and eerie (her version of their best-known song, The Littlest Birds, dramatically shifted its mood from amiable to chilling). But Ford has developed a sound rooted in warm southern soul. On Indian Ocean, she even employed the old house musicians from Memphis\u2019 Hi Records \u2013 men who 40 years previously had played on Al Green\u2019s classic 70s albums and Ann Peebles\u2019 I Can\u2019t Stand the Rain. In one sense, it was a bold move. The world is hopelessly overstuffed with artists plying variations on retro soul, from aged original practitioners rescued from obscurity by younger enthusiasts to post-Winehouse pop singers and the kind of bands who talk about \u201creal music\u201d and wish to signpost their disdain for the shallow fripperies of modernity. It\u2019s tough to cut through this crowded market, but Ford\u2019s albums do. Despite the presence of musicians who were there the first time around, Indian Ocean never sounded like a Sealed Knot re-creation or shallow pastiche. Ford wrote fantastic songs \u2013 everything from acute little character studies to stuff that sounded like gospel \u2013 and wove country and jazz into a sound that perfectly fitted her understated voice. She continues and refines this approach on U Kin B the Sun. The horn arrangements and the Hi Rhythm Section are gone \u2013 guitarist Teenie Hodges died before Indian Ocean was released. Its sound is barer: bass pushed to the front, gentle shadings of guitar and keyboards, lots of empty space. And the mood is darker. The lyrics touch on relationship strife in no-punches-pulled style on the bluntly titled Motherfucker; on the survivors of the 2018 Parkland school shooting in The Kids Are Having None of It (\u201cThey can\u2019t be bought, they can\u2019t be taught your hate\u201d); and on Ford\u2019s complicated relationship with her parents, whom she has bluntly described as \u201ca complete disaster\u201d. The opening track, Azad, doesn\u2019t make life as the daughter of young hippies constantly on the run from the draft sound like much fun: it takes the sight of a dragonfly to make her realise \u201cthere is beauty in this world, so hold it any way you know how\u201d. In fact, it\u2019s often hard to work out what the lyrics are about. Ford has a habit of smearing words to incomprehensibility, leaving it to the sound of her voice to convey the emotion of a song. Luckily, that\u2019s something her voice is eminently capable of doing. Abundantly aware of the fact that less is more, her vocals are high, airy and textured with a gently fluttering vibrato but, as befits a woman who writes songs called things such as Motherfucker, you\u2019d never describe them as delicate. They\u2019re capable of landing a raw emotional punch or of conveying something more complex. On U and Me, which seems to be another breakup song, her tone switches from warm to wracked and back again, as sadness and loss are tempered by genuine fondness. For all the darkness of the subject matter, there is a warmth to the album. It makes sense that it comes with a cover dappled by sunlight. This is partly to do with the production which, for all its sparseness, has a lovely organic, intimate feeling \u2013 it frequently feels as though you\u2019re eavesdropping on a band playing live \u2013 and partly to do with the strength of the melodies: choruses gently surge, vocal harmonies are sparingly applied but beautiful. The exception is the closing title track, which lasts the best part of six minutes. It comes to a halt midway through, then reassembles itself as a thick, dream-like swirl of sound, rich with echoing, multitracked vocals that sound positively ecstatic. As usual, it is hard to make out exactly what they\u2019re singing, beyond the fact that Ford keeps repeating the word \u201cjoy\u201d, as if reaffirming her dragonfly-induced childhood revelation about the beauty of the world. Its mood is heady and infectious, the perfect end to an album that doesn\u2019t grab your attention with pyrotechnic displays, opting instead for a slow-burning, unassuming kind of power: a low-key delight, but a delight all the same. This week Alexis listened to Franky Wah: Time After Time (feat Jessie Ware) (Elliot Adamson mix) Elliot Adamson\u2019s remix turns a poppy track inside out, transforming it into distorted, fierce acid house.",

      "bodyText": "In Jayde Perkin\u2019s exquisitely moving Mum\u2019s Jumper, a little girl leaves her mother behind in hospital when visiting hours are over. The next day, the hospital phones her father to say: \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d \u201cGone where?\u201d the girl asks. She is sad, and angry, and lonely, but her father explains that one day she will grow into her grief, just as she will grow into the jumper her mother has left behind. For Dr Clare Etherington, a GP in Harrow, the picture book could be the perfect prescription for a grieving child. \u201cI am often asked [for advice] by, say, grandparents if they know a child is going to undergo a family bereavement,\u201d she says. \u201cMum\u2019s Jumper might be one to try \u2026 I\u2019m nearly 60 and it meant something to me, let alone for a seven-year-old.\u201d Bibliotherapy \u2013 the prescription of books as a remedy to ills \u2013 has been officially operating in the UK since 2013, when the Reading Agency charity launched the Reading Well Books on Prescription programme, supported by professional health bodies including NHS England and the Royal College of GPs. A list of titles chosen by experts and available in libraries was put together for GPs and mental health professionals to prescribe to patients, tackling topics from depression to dementia to chronic pain. Since then, 1.2 million readers have borrowed more than 2.3m of the scheme\u2019s books from libraries. Now the Reading Agency is extending the programme to children for the first time. Mum\u2019s Jumper is one of 33 books chosen by health professionals, literary experts and children to support mental health and wellbeing. Aimed at children between seven and 11, the Reading Well for Children list of nonfiction and fiction titles explores topics from anxiety to bullying and staying safe online, as well as looking at conditions including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and physical disabilities. It is free to access from public libraries, and is intended, says the Reading Agency, to \u201cencourage conversation between children and their parents, or carers, about feelings, and to offer support outside of a clinical setting or whilst waiting for treatment\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think books replace formal counselling and help, but they can empower and help family conversations,\u201d says Etherington. \u201cA GP gets 10 minutes with a patient if you\u2019re lucky, and you can\u2019t do everything. It\u2019s useful to have resources so that, if you run out of time, you can say: \u2018Go and check this out.\u2019\u201d She is often asked by a parent how to explain a depressed mum or dad to a child, and says that Up and Down Mum, one of the titles selected for the new list, would be useful for joint reading. \u201cChildren with unwell parents often feel very sad and guilty and worry the problem is because they themselves have done something wrong. I think books can be starting points for things that are difficult to discuss. I often pick books with pictures as well as words because I think they accommodate different ways of understanding.\u201d Etherington has already prescribed adults the Reading Well list. \u201cIn the past I have lent people Living With a Black Dog. The scenario tends to be people who get low moods but cannot see any really obvious visible reason in their life,\u201d she says. \u201cI also refer people who are thinking about cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT] or mindfulness to ask for the Reading Well books at the library.\u201d For Michael Rosen, whose Sad Book, illustrated by Quentin Blake, is included on the list, the initiative is \u201charnessing the power of reading to help tackle the crisis facing children\u2019s mental health\u201d.

He could see the end coming, with <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/222046.stm\" title=\"\">automation</a>; since 1998, the UK has had no manned lighthouses.</p> <p>His wildest, most remote posting was the <a href=\"https://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses-and-lightvessels/smalls-lighthouse\" title=\"\">Smalls Lighthouse</a>, a granite tower perched on a rock 20 miles off the coast of Pembrokeshire, where he worked for two years \u2013 one month on, one month off, like in the film.</p> <p>A key difference, though, was that there were three of them. That came about after an incident on the Smalls, a little before Hargreaves\u2019s time in 1801, that changed lighthouse policy.

      "bodyText": "\u201cGod, I\u2019m glad I never went to that one,\u201d says Neil Hargreaves, as the closing credits of The Lighthouse roll. Neil is a former lighthouse keeper. I have brought him to see the film \u2013 centred around a 19th-century brick phallus on a godforsaken, storm-lashed rock off the coast of Maine \u2013 to get the insider\u2019s view. Actually, first I tried to take the film to him, to the cottage owned by Trinity House where he lives in Harwich, with a view from upstairs over the North Sea (tame today). But the DVD didn\u2019t work, so he gave up his day and came back to London with me, to go to the cinema. To be honest, I was a little apprehensive: what would Hargreaves \u2013 73, old-school gent, proper polite \u2013 make of Robert Eggers\u2019s nightmarish monochrome psychodrama? Of Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson going fabulously and terrifyingly insane in oilskins and knitwear? Of the flying semen, the unspeakable depths to which they plunge, all the way down to Davy Jones\u2019s Locker? But he remains sanguine and stoic. \u201cFrom a cinematic point of view, it was quite interesting,\u201d he offers. \u201cThere is nothing entirely realistic about it.\u201d So, er, it doesn\u2019t reflect his own experiences? \u201cOh no, no, no,\u201d he says, quickly. Hargreaves, originally from Lancashire, spent 16 years on lighthouses and lightships before taking voluntary redundancy in 1988 and becoming a security guard. He could see the end coming, with automation; since 1998, the UK has had no manned lighthouses. His wildest, most remote posting was the Smalls Lighthouse, a granite tower perched on a rock 20 miles off the coast of Pembrokeshire, where he worked for two years \u2013 one month on, one month off, like in the film. A key difference, though, was that there were three of them. That came about after an incident on the Smalls, a little before Hargreaves\u2019s time in 1801, that changed lighthouse policy. It was before radio, he explains: the two keepers had no contact with the mainland and one of them died. \u201cThe other chap didn\u2019t want the authorities to think he had bumped him off, so he kept him on the lighthouse, first inside the kitchen. Then, because they were overdue due to bad weather, he must have started to smell. So he took him out and lashed the body to the gallery round the outer part of the lantern. By the time the ship eventually got to him to relieve him, he had gone mad.\u201d Hmm, a few echoes of the film there. After that, there were always three men on a lighthouse. \u201cThey were a good bunch of blokes,\u201d says Hargreaves. \u201cI made some good friends and I\u2019m still friends with them. You got the odd one now and again, as you do anywhere, I suppose. The job did attract the odd loner, people who prefer their own company.\u201d Most keepers had hobbies; he knew a couple who knitted, like Pattinson\u2019s character.

Western coastal states made the call at a meeting of European Union ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday evening, the first high-level diplomatic talks on chief negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s draft negotiating mandate since its publication on Monday. EU sources said western coastal states with a strong fishing interest wanted Barnier\u2019s text to be clearer that the EU would seek to maintain the same access to British waters, and the same quota shares for 100 types of fish that swim in shared seas. Boris Johnson has vowed to \u201ctake back control\u201d of British waters, saying the UK would be an \u201cindependent coastal state\u201d conducting annual negotiations with the EU as Norway does. On Wednesday it emerged that the UK has been quietly increasing its maritime defences in a bid to avoid a rerun of the 1970s \u201ccod wars\u201d. But the EU wants to maintain the status quo that grants its member states 35% of the quantity of fish from British waters, with the richest harvest for France, the Netherlands and Denmark. France and Denmark, along with Belgium and Portugal, said the text on fisheries needed to be stronger, before ministers approve Barnier\u2019s mandate at the end of the month. A revised text is expected by the end of the week. David McAllister, a German Christian Democrat MEP, who is leading the European parliament on EU-UK talks, said the issue of access to waters was inseparable from the overall deal, as well as access to European fisheries markets.

Germany and the Netherlands said the EU needed to look at alternatives to sharing information, other than the SIS database, which has 64m entries of information on criminal suspects, identity documents and missing people and is used by British police every day.

Another \u00a320m will be earmarked for a trial of an Uber-style on-demand bus services for rural areas.</p> <p>The fund, announced on Thursday, will provide \u00a370m for more bus lanes and other priority measures to encourage higher-frequency services. The remaining \u00a330m will be given to local authorities to boost bus services or restore those that have been lost.</p> <p>The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said he hoped to see London levels of bus services extended to the whole of England.</p> <p>Speaking to Sky News, he said: \u201cI want to see buses being as convenient everywhere in the country as they are in London. In London you can always jump on and off a bus. That is not the case elsewhere. Part of the money today is to reverse that by putting hundreds of new routes on for buses.\u201d</p> <p>When it was put to him that the government was spending \u00a3400m a year less on buses than it did 10 years ago, Shapps said: \u201cThis a downpayment on our bus policy.\u201d</p> <p>Explaining the scheme to pilot on-demand buses to LBC, he said: \u201cThese are buses which would come along when you order them up on your app, effectively. And it would reroute them to you. I think it is quite an interesting idea, particularly with the way the world is changing.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, dismissed the ideas as gimmicks that fell well short of making up for previous cuts.

      "bodyText": "A \u00a3170m government fund to improve bus services will not be nearly enough to plug a \u00a3700m funding gap in bus provision, Labour and local authorities have said. Part of the funding will go towards a \u00a350m scheme to establish the UK\u2019s first all-electric bus town by 2025. Another \u00a320m will be earmarked for a trial of an Uber-style on-demand bus services for rural areas. The fund, announced on Thursday, will provide \u00a370m for more bus lanes and other priority measures to encourage higher-frequency services. The remaining \u00a330m will be given to local authorities to boost bus services or restore those that have been lost. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said he hoped to see London levels of bus services extended to the whole of England. Speaking to Sky News, he said: \u201cI want to see buses being as convenient everywhere in the country as they are in London. In London you can always jump on and off a bus. That is not the case elsewhere. Part of the money today is to reverse that by putting hundreds of new routes on for buses.\u201d When it was put to him that the government was spending \u00a3400m a year less on buses than it did 10 years ago, Shapps said: \u201cThis a downpayment on our bus policy.\u201d Explaining the scheme to pilot on-demand buses to LBC, he said: \u201cThese are buses which would come along when you order them up on your app, effectively. And it would reroute them to you. I think it is quite an interesting idea, particularly with the way the world is changing.\u201d The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, dismissed the ideas as gimmicks that fell well short of making up for previous cuts. He said: \u201cThe Tories have cut \u00a3635m a year from bus budgets in England, causing over 3,000 routes to be axed and bus use to plummet. A \u00a320m fund for on-demand buses doesn\u2019t begin to repair the damage these cuts have done. There is no substitute for properly funded local bus networks.\u201d When the idea of on-demand buses was first mooted by the government, McDonald said it amounted to a \u201clet them take taxis\u201d approach to transport. Darren Rodwell, the Local Government Association\u2019s transport spokesman, said the money was a step in the right direction, but he added: \u201cWe would urge the government to go further in the forthcoming budget and plug the \u00a3700m annual funding gap councils face in providing the concessionary fares scheme, which would help to protect local routes and reverse the decline in bus services. \u201cThis gap is forcing many councils to increasingly have to divert funding from discretionary routes and services to prop up the statutory scheme.\u201d The Unite union\u2019s national officer for passenger transport, Bobby Morton, said: \u201cThe money being pledged for the creation and the reinstatement of bus routes is an absolute drop in the ocean compared to what has been cut from bus services.

Trump claims \u2018full exoneration\u2019, but Romney makes history Donald Trump has claimed \u201cfull vindication and exoneration\u201d after his acquittal by the Senate on both articles of impeachment: a vote that was predictable but nonetheless weighty in its implications, further fanning the flames of what David Smith describes as the most profound national split since at least the Vietnam war.

As the last of the Iowa results trickled in, Bernie Sanders appeared to have closed the gap with Pete Buttigieg to a near tie. Sanders also maintains a healthy poll lead in New Hampshire, but Buttigieg is looking to leverage his success in Iowa as the contest moves on to the Granite State. Joe Biden.

But now, as Brighton prepare to host Watford in a textbook relegation six-pointer, doubts about the wisdom of sticking with Potter are being aired on the south coast.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/premier-league-winter-break-prime-content\">Who needs football when Premier League winter break provides prime content? | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brighton have done more than just stick with Potter; whereas De Boer was jilted after five games, Potter was handed a new six-year contract after 13 league matches. When he was given that deal in November, Brighton were five points clear of the bottom three and looking up. Now they are two points clear and seeking their first win of 2020. In times of uncertainty, people can get nostalgic and, just as Palace turned to steady ol\u2019 Roy Hodgson after giving De Boer the boot, some Brighton fans are pining for the days of Chris Hughton, whose Brighton team had more points (27) at this stage last season than Potter\u2019s do now (26). But do not be misled by that last fact.</p> <p>Hughton\u2019s team were not only boring, they were decomposing. They won none of their last nine matches and, even though they eked out enough draws to survive, they did not look like a team who could ever win again even if they actually tried to. It was more likely their temporary solidity would crumble. By contrast, it is not hard to imagine Potter\u2019s creative side playing their way back into the top half of the table. There is no cause to abandon the revolution. But a couple of short-term compromises could be made to stop a team in transition from falling before they really find their stride.</p> <p>Above all, Brighton need to improve their finishing. In many matches they have dominated with swish authority but let points slip because their failure to convert chances has had the twin effects of inspiring opponents and making Brighton jittery. Fightbacks should have been resisted better but, instead, an evolving team have become ragged too quickly when things have started to go against them. Some players have not coped well with pressure. So, while the statistics show that Brighton have conceded fewer goals and faced fewer shots per game than under Hughton last season, there have been sudden outbreaks of sloppiness that have created an illusion that Potter\u2019s whole enterprise was flawed from the start. It is a mentality thing. \u201cYou can\u2019t just win by playing well, you have to be able to suffer,\u201d said Potter after last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/brighton-hove-albion-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">home draw with Aston Villa</a>, another game in which Brighton seemed in total control before goofing. There was no trace of greater resolve the following week when they pitched up at Bournemouth and flopped to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/21/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">a 3-1 defeat</a>.</p> <p>Last weekend\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/01/west-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">draw at West Ham</a>, on the other hand, may have been a turning point. Firstly, because it represented a trend reversal: this time it was Brighton who fought back, recovering from 3-1 down to salvage a point. That owed something to West Ham\u2019s haplessness but it was also because Brighton summoned the sort of gumption they will have to continue showing for the rest of the campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55e5ca874d47cfae9f25b8f87b35573632862e3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55e5ca874d47cfae9f25b8f87b35573632862e3d/0_319_3775_2439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glenn Murray\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glenn Murray, here scoring Brighton\u2019s equaliser at West Ham, should be used more often.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Greenwood/IPS/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Secondly, Potter made significant personnel changes, most obviously giving Glenn Murray a first league start since September. Murray scored a precious equaliser. The veteran is not as ingenious as Neal Maupay nor as dynamic as Aaron Connolly but he is a sharper finisher than both and, since Brighton did not sign any strikers in January and last season\u2019s supposed long-term replacements for Murray (Florin Andone and J\u00fcrgen Locadia) have been farmed out on the grounds of inadequacy, the 36-year-old should play a significant role in firing Brighton to safety, not necessarily as a constant starter but certainly used more regularly than he has been so far this season. It is not easy to gauge when Murray\u2019s relative coolness in front of goal will make him a better option than younger alternatives who will make bigger all-round contributions but, now Murray has got his first league goal of the season and a new contract, Potter seems likely to get the judgment right more often than not.</p> <p>In central defence, too, Potter has a big decision. One of his boldest moves this season has been to break up the partnership of Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy in order to deploy his \u00a320m recruit Adam Webster, who is a better passer than Duffy but has been prone to lapses in his first term in the top flight. Potter believes Webster will develop more consistency but the risk is Brighton will run out of Premier League matches before that happens. Duffy should play a significant part in the relegation fight, either instead of Webster or alongside him in a three-man backline. The manager has shown he is willing to alter formations when the situation demands it and, what is more, a back three would enable him to play Tariq Lamptey, the club\u2019s main January recruit, as a wing-back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In central midfield the permutations are slightly different. Dale Stephens has been out of form and there is a good case for starting Yves Bissouma or the gifted 21-year-old Steven Alzate, who will one day dictate operations from the middle but has been used mainly on the periphery.</p> <p>So Potter has options, though probably not as many as he would like and none of which are guaranteed short-term successes. But Brighton are at least as likely to stay up under Potter as they are under any other manager whom they could draft in now. And if they survive this season, they can expect to thrive under Potter in the near future. This is a time for everyone at the Amex to hold their nerve. They are four points below Hodgson\u2019s Palace but, all things considered, in a much better place.</p>",

When he was given that deal in November, Brighton were five points clear of the bottom three and looking up. Now they are two points clear and seeking their first win of 2020. In times of uncertainty, people can get nostalgic and, just as Palace turned to steady ol\u2019 Roy Hodgson after giving De Boer the boot, some Brighton fans are pining for the days of Chris Hughton, whose Brighton team had more points (27) at this stage last season than Potter\u2019s do now (26). But do not be misled by that last fact. Hughton\u2019s team were not only boring, they were decomposing. They won none of their last nine matches and, even though they eked out enough draws to survive, they did not look like a team who could ever win again even if they actually tried to. It was more likely their temporary solidity would crumble. By contrast, it is not hard to imagine Potter\u2019s creative side playing their way back into the top half of the table. There is no cause to abandon the revolution. But a couple of short-term compromises could be made to stop a team in transition from falling before they really find their stride. Above all, Brighton need to improve their finishing. In many matches they have dominated with swish authority but let points slip because their failure to convert chances has had the twin effects of inspiring opponents and making Brighton jittery. Fightbacks should have been resisted better but, instead, an evolving team have become ragged too quickly when things have started to go against them. Some players have not coped well with pressure. So, while the statistics show that Brighton have conceded fewer goals and faced fewer shots per game than under Hughton last season, there have been sudden outbreaks of sloppiness that have created an illusion that Potter\u2019s whole enterprise was flawed from the start. It is a mentality thing. \u201cYou can\u2019t just win by playing well, you have to be able to suffer,\u201d said Potter after last month\u2019s home draw with Aston Villa, another game in which Brighton seemed in total control before goofing. There was no trace of greater resolve the following week when they pitched up at Bournemouth and flopped to a 3-1 defeat. Last weekend\u2019s draw at West Ham, on the other hand, may have been a turning point. Firstly, because it represented a trend reversal: this time it was Brighton who fought back, recovering from 3-1 down to salvage a point. That owed something to West Ham\u2019s haplessness but it was also because Brighton summoned the sort of gumption they will have to continue showing for the rest of the campaign. Secondly, Potter made significant personnel changes, most obviously giving Glenn Murray a first league start since September. Murray scored a precious equaliser. The veteran is not as ingenious as Neal Maupay nor as dynamic as Aaron Connolly but he is a sharper finisher than both and, since Brighton did not sign any strikers in January and last season\u2019s supposed long-term replacements for Murray (Florin Andone and J\u00fcrgen Locadia) have been farmed out on the grounds of inadequacy, the 36-year-old should play a significant role in firing Brighton to safety, not necessarily as a constant starter but certainly used more regularly than he has been so far this season. It is not easy to gauge when Murray\u2019s relative coolness in front of goal will make him a better option than younger alternatives who will make bigger all-round contributions but, now Murray has got his first league goal of the season and a new contract, Potter seems likely to get the judgment right more often than not. In central defence, too, Potter has a big decision. One of his boldest moves this season has been to break up the partnership of Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy in order to deploy his \u00a320m recruit Adam Webster, who is a better passer than Duffy but has been prone to lapses in his first term in the top flight. Potter believes Webster will develop more consistency but the risk is Brighton will run out of Premier League matches before that happens. Duffy should play a significant part in the relegation fight, either instead of Webster or alongside him in a three-man backline. The manager has shown he is willing to alter formations when the situation demands it and, what is more, a back three would enable him to play Tariq Lamptey, the club\u2019s main January recruit, as a wing-back. In central midfield the permutations are slightly different. Dale Stephens has been out of form and there is a good case for starting Yves Bissouma or the gifted 21-year-old Steven Alzate, who will one day dictate operations from the middle but has been used mainly on the periphery. So Potter has options, though probably not as many as he would like and none of which are guaranteed short-term successes. But Brighton are at least as likely to stay up under Potter as they are under any other manager whom they could draft in now. And if they survive this season, they can expect to thrive under Potter in the near future. This is a time for everyone at the Amex to hold their nerve. They are four points below Hodgson\u2019s Palace but, all things considered, in a much better place.",

They pulled and stretched my nipples, treating them like pieces of silly putty, rather than the soft and tender flesh that they were. If you\u2019d told me that I\u2019d eventually breastfeed for over six years (and counting), spread out among three children, I would have likely responded that there was absolutely no way.

I believed it was the most frugal option. But truthfully, breastfeeding took its toll on me, and it was not as cost-effective as I had first believed.</p> <p>For one, there\u2019s the equipment many women require to breastfeed, including pumps, storage bags, nipple ointment, nursing bras, breast pads and even consultations with lactation consultants, should you require assistance in the journey. Writer Kaitlin Bell Barnett has said that six months of nursing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/02/my-mommy-tax-six-months-of-nursing-cost-more-than-a-year-of-formula\">cost her $2,000</a>, while a year\u2019s worth of formula would have cost around $1,200 to $2,000.</p> <p>There\u2019s also an unspoken cost that many breastfeeding proponents neglect to mention: the cost of a mother\u2019s time. Dr Courtney Jung, author of Lactivism, which takes a critical stance toward the notion that \u201cbreast is always best\u201d, estimates that six months of breastfeeding could require about 900 hours of a mother\u2019s time.</p> <p>I would guess that in the first six months of breastfeeding, when the only source of nutrition for my baby was breastmilk, I probably spent five hours breastfeeding throughout a 24-hour period. That\u2019s 910 hours over six months, not far off Jung\u2019s approximation.</p> <p>Based on my estimate, I nursed 35 hours a week, with no days off. That\u2019s equivalent to a full-time job. How are these time demands supposed to coexist with the demands of a full-time job?</p> <p>Don\u2019t forget that over <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2019/access-to-paid-and-unpaid-family-leave-in-2018.htm\">three-quarters</a> of civilian workers in the US have no paid parental leave, and for this reason <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/18151/the-real-war-on-families\">one in </a><a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/18151/the-real-war-on-families\">four mothers</a> return to work only two weeks after giving birth in the US. (I\u2019m Canadian, but I\u2019ve been in a similar situation to American mothers because as a self-employed worker I didn\u2019t have access to paid time off for my youngest child.)</p> <p>One solution to this conflict between the time required for breastfeeding and the necessity of returning to work, some say, is breast pumps. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires private health insurers to cover breast pumps, and <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2698967\">one study</a> asserts that more women are now attempting to breastfeed, and breastfeeding for longer periods of time, now that breast pumps are more readily accessible.</p> <p>While one could argue that a woman who pumps \u2013 and is at work while her baby is fed a bottle of pumped milk \u2013 isn\u2019t breastfeeding for those hours, she is pumping. In my calculations, I didn\u2019t even account for time spent pumping. If a pumping mother spends 20 hours a week on breastfeeding and pumping, an extremely conservative estimate, that\u2019s still equivalent to a part-time job, in addition to her full-time work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The cost to those women is unbelievable, given the entire burden of breastfeeding is placed on them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even today, however, only <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1049386715001176\">40% of women</a> have access to both a break time to pump, and a private space to do so. And what\u2019s more, the idea of breast pumping as a solution seems more like a triumph for capitalism than a win for women. Jung points out that it keeps women in the workplace, gives money to the breast pump manufacturers, allows companies to bypass having to pay women for maternity leave, and the government comes out looking like it\u2019s passing groundbreaking legislation for women.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a relationship between the absence of maternity leave and pumping,\u201d Jung said in a phone interview<em>. </em>\u201cThe legislation that passed takes into account that breastfeeding is impossible, and tries to square the circle with pumping.\u201d</p> <p>The only effective way to give a woman a fair chance at breastfeeding is with policy that makes it easier for her to do so while also supporting her need to earn an income.</p> <p>Jung says that paid maternity leave is the only solution to level the playing ground for working women who want to breastfeed. \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s no maternity leave in the United States makes it incredibly impressive that we have the rates of breastfeeding that we do have. Women are killing themselves to get the numbers that we\u2019ve got \u2026 The cost to those women is unbelievable, given the entire burden of breastfeeding is placed on them, with no help at all \u2013 except, here, have a breast pump,\u201d said Jung.</p> <p>I find it most jarring that women in the US are told, by the nation\u2019s professional association of pediatricians, that the rates of breastfeeding are a public health crisis.</p> <p>While it\u2019s evident that paid maternity leave is required to make breastfeeding possible for American women, it\u2019s equally as important that the American ideology around breastfeeding shifts. Women shouldn\u2019t be pressured to breastfeed when they are bearing a heavy financial burden because of it.</p>",

Along the way I have become acutely aware of the cost of breastfeeding, both in the extensive amount of time that I have dedicated to it, and the financial sacrifices that I have made in order to be available to breastfeed. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends mothers worldwide exclusively breastfeed for six months, and should continue breastfeeding once food is introduced, up to two years or more. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggests six months of exclusive breastfeeding and one year or more of breastfeeding with complementary foods. The AAP also states within its guidelines: \u201cInfant nutrition should be considered a public health issue and not only a lifestyle choice.\u201d Translation: if you\u2019re not breastfeeding you\u2019re endangering society. What these organizations fail to consider is how their recommendations conflict with the professional realities of a woman\u2019s life, particularly for women in the US. \u201cUnfortunately, exclusive breastfeeding guidelines were implemented before all of the societal systems for exclusive breastfeeding support are in place,\u201d says Jody Segrave-Daly, co-founder of the Fed is Best Foundation, and a veteran neonatal nurse and lactation consultant. \u201cThis places an unbearable burden on mothers in the US, no matter what their income is.\u201d When I gave birth to my first child I was 22, I was living in poverty and desperate to make breastfeeding work. I believed it was the most frugal option. But truthfully, breastfeeding took its toll on me, and it was not as cost-effective as I had first believed. For one, there\u2019s the equipment many women require to breastfeed, including pumps, storage bags, nipple ointment, nursing bras, breast pads and even consultations with lactation consultants, should you require assistance in the journey. Writer Kaitlin Bell Barnett has said that six months of nursing cost her $2,000, while a year\u2019s worth of formula would have cost around $1,200 to $2,000. There\u2019s also an unspoken cost that many breastfeeding proponents neglect to mention: the cost of a mother\u2019s time. Dr Courtney Jung, author of Lactivism, which takes a critical stance toward the notion that \u201cbreast is always best\u201d, estimates that six months of breastfeeding could require about 900 hours of a mother\u2019s time. I would guess that in the first six months of breastfeeding, when the only source of nutrition for my baby was breastmilk, I probably spent five hours breastfeeding throughout a 24-hour period. That\u2019s 910 hours over six months, not far off Jung\u2019s approximation. Based on my estimate, I nursed 35 hours a week, with no days off. That\u2019s equivalent to a full-time job. How are these time demands supposed to coexist with the demands of a full-time job? Don\u2019t forget that over three-quarters of civilian workers in the US have no paid parental leave, and for this reason one in four mothers return to work only two weeks after giving birth in the US. (I\u2019m Canadian, but I\u2019ve been in a similar situation to American mothers because as a self-employed worker I didn\u2019t have access to paid time off for my youngest child.) One solution to this conflict between the time required for breastfeeding and the necessity of returning to work, some say, is breast pumps. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires private health insurers to cover breast pumps, and one study asserts that more women are now attempting to breastfeed, and breastfeeding for longer periods of time, now that breast pumps are more readily accessible. While one could argue that a woman who pumps \u2013 and is at work while her baby is fed a bottle of pumped milk \u2013 isn\u2019t breastfeeding for those hours, she is pumping. In my calculations, I didn\u2019t even account for time spent pumping. If a pumping mother spends 20 hours a week on breastfeeding and pumping, an extremely conservative estimate, that\u2019s still equivalent to a part-time job, in addition to her full-time work. Even today, however, only 40% of women have access to both a break time to pump, and a private space to do so. And what\u2019s more, the idea of breast pumping as a solution seems more like a triumph for capitalism than a win for women. Jung points out that it keeps women in the workplace, gives money to the breast pump manufacturers, allows companies to bypass having to pay women for maternity leave, and the government comes out looking like it\u2019s passing groundbreaking legislation for women. \u201cThere\u2019s a relationship between the absence of maternity leave and pumping,\u201d Jung said in a phone interview. \u201cThe legislation that passed takes into account that breastfeeding is impossible, and tries to square the circle with pumping.\u201d The only effective way to give a woman a fair chance at breastfeeding is with policy that makes it easier for her to do so while also supporting her need to earn an income. Jung says that paid maternity leave is the only solution to level the playing ground for working women who want to breastfeed. \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s no maternity leave in the United States makes it incredibly impressive that we have the rates of breastfeeding that we do have. Women are killing themselves to get the numbers that we\u2019ve got \u2026 The cost to those women is unbelievable, given the entire burden of breastfeeding is placed on them, with no help at all \u2013 except, here, have a breast pump,\u201d said Jung. I find it most jarring that women in the US are told, by the nation\u2019s professional association of pediatricians, that the rates of breastfeeding are a public health crisis. While it\u2019s evident that paid maternity leave is required to make breastfeeding possible for American women, it\u2019s equally as important that the American ideology around breastfeeding shifts. Women shouldn\u2019t be pressured to breastfeed when they are bearing a heavy financial burden because of it.",

      "body": "<p>When an advisory panel reviewed in 2009 the list of sporting events that had to be broadcast on terrestrial television, the Welsh Assembly submitted a proposal that the Group A list, made up of matches or tournaments that could not be sold to pay TV for live coverage, should include Wales\u2019s home matches in the Six Nations.</p> <p>It argued that as the television audience for those games amounted to 65% of the population, the national interest demanded that they be kept free for all. The panel agreed and amended the Group A list accordingly in their report for the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, but before a decision was made, there was a change of government and nothing happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/05/six-nations-broadcasting-rights-cvc-deal\">Broadcasting rights impasse puts CVC\u2019s \u00a3300m Six Nations deal in peril</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Welsh Rugby Union had argued that the matches should remain on the Group B list. Events could be screened live on a subscription channel so long as a terrestrial broadcaster was given secondary rights, as happens with England\u2019s home cricket series. It was in no hurry for the Six Nations to do a deal with Sky but argued that if the tournament were restricted to the BBC or ITV, the value of the contract would depreciate. Sky was a valuable bargaining tool.</p> <p>It is as well for the Six Nations today that Wales\u2019s home matches are not protected since negotiations continue with CVC, the private equity company seeking a 15% stake in the tournament for \u00a3300m and in return control of its commercial arm. That would give CVC licence to negotiate the broadcasting deal that starts in 2022. The BBC and ITV currently pay \u00a390m a year for the rights and given the problems both broadcasters face, are unlikely to be able to afford more than an incremental increase.</p> <p>That would hardly suit CVC which, in its successful pitches for a 27% stake in both the Premiership and the Pro14, argued that rugby union had undersold itself, particularly when it came to broadcasting rights.</p> <p>The value it places on international rugby can be measured by the fact it invested \u00a3320m in the two leagues for an effective 54% and has offered \u00a320m less for 15% of the Six Nations, although the package would include the rights for the autumn internationals in all the unions.</p> <p>The investment would make sense only were there to be a pay-TV element in the next broadcasting contract, even if the southern hemisphere unions agreed to the July and November tour matches being given a competitive makeover on the lines of World Rugby\u2019s proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\" title=\"\">Nations League that was shot down</a> last year, albeit without relegation.</p> <p>The danger for CVC now is that a deal taking live matches off free-to-air would spark public outrage and probably a petition to the government for the tournament to be promoted to the A list \u2013 depressing its broadcast value.</p> <p>The Six Nations are so determined to keep a terrestrial element that they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/05/six-nations-broadcasting-rights-cvc-deal\" title=\"\">holding out against giving CVC commercial control</a>, wanting to have the final say. While it is in all their interests to secure a lucrative deal given they would be handing over 15% of their profits each year in return for the lump sum, they are also conscious of the impact on the game\u2019s profile should the Six Nations, along with the November internationals, be taken off free-to-view channels.</p> <p>When that 2009 panel met, it was presented with figures showing a stark difference between the audiences generated by Sky, then the major subscription service in sport, compared with the BBC and ITV. The first leg of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/29/manchester-united-arsenal-champions-league-semi-final\" title=\"\">Champions League semi-final that year between Manchester United and Arsenal</a> had a viewing figure of 1.77m on Sky compared with 7.48m on ITV for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/05/championsleague-arsenal\" title=\"\">the second leg</a>.

      "bodyText": "When an advisory panel reviewed in 2009 the list of sporting events that had to be broadcast on terrestrial television, the Welsh Assembly submitted a proposal that the Group A list, made up of matches or tournaments that could not be sold to pay TV for live coverage, should include Wales\u2019s home matches in the Six Nations. It argued that as the television audience for those games amounted to 65% of the population, the national interest demanded that they be kept free for all. The panel agreed and amended the Group A list accordingly in their report for the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, but before a decision was made, there was a change of government and nothing happened. The Welsh Rugby Union had argued that the matches should remain on the Group B list. Events could be screened live on a subscription channel so long as a terrestrial broadcaster was given secondary rights, as happens with England\u2019s home cricket series. It was in no hurry for the Six Nations to do a deal with Sky but argued that if the tournament were restricted to the BBC or ITV, the value of the contract would depreciate. Sky was a valuable bargaining tool. It is as well for the Six Nations today that Wales\u2019s home matches are not protected since negotiations continue with CVC, the private equity company seeking a 15% stake in the tournament for \u00a3300m and in return control of its commercial arm. That would give CVC licence to negotiate the broadcasting deal that starts in 2022. The BBC and ITV currently pay \u00a390m a year for the rights and given the problems both broadcasters face, are unlikely to be able to afford more than an incremental increase. That would hardly suit CVC which, in its successful pitches for a 27% stake in both the Premiership and the Pro14, argued that rugby union had undersold itself, particularly when it came to broadcasting rights. The value it places on international rugby can be measured by the fact it invested \u00a3320m in the two leagues for an effective 54% and has offered \u00a320m less for 15% of the Six Nations, although the package would include the rights for the autumn internationals in all the unions. The investment would make sense only were there to be a pay-TV element in the next broadcasting contract, even if the southern hemisphere unions agreed to the July and November tour matches being given a competitive makeover on the lines of World Rugby\u2019s proposed Nations League that was shot down last year, albeit without relegation. The danger for CVC now is that a deal taking live matches off free-to-air would spark public outrage and probably a petition to the government for the tournament to be promoted to the A list \u2013 depressing its broadcast value. The Six Nations are so determined to keep a terrestrial element that they are holding out against giving CVC commercial control, wanting to have the final say. While it is in all their interests to secure a lucrative deal given they would be handing over 15% of their profits each year in return for the lump sum, they are also conscious of the impact on the game\u2019s profile should the Six Nations, along with the November internationals, be taken off free-to-view channels. When that 2009 panel met, it was presented with figures showing a stark difference between the audiences generated by Sky, then the major subscription service in sport, compared with the BBC and ITV. The first leg of a Champions League semi-final that year between Manchester United and Arsenal had a viewing figure of 1.77m on Sky compared with 7.48m on ITV for the second leg. There was a similar 4-1 split for the 2005 and 2009 Ashes series on Channel 4 and Sky respectively. Sky defended itself by saying that fans watching in pubs and bars were not included in the figures, although the panel concluded the number was insignificant with most viewers preferring to watch big matches at home. But there was no comeback for the figures showing the number of young viewers: a mere 31,000 children aged between four and 15 watched the 2009 Ashes \u2013 on Sky \u2013 compared with two million when England played Sweden at football\u2019s 2006 World Cup finals \u2013 on the BBC and ITV. The Welsh Rugby Union submitted in 2009 that a Group A listing would \u201cdecimate the sport\u201d in Wales and threaten its investment in the game. Meanwhile the Six Nations provided written evidence that concluded: \u201cThe Championship may be competed for by the national representative teams of the six participating rugby unions but it is NOT a public asset, owned by \u2018the nation\u2019.\u201d \u201cThe technology and power of broadcasting means a sport cannot stand still,\u201d says Richard Cramer, the managing partner of Front Row Legal, which specialises in sports, media and business. \u201cChange is going to happen anyway and a question the Six Nations will be asking themselves is whether they have the expertise to manage it. \u201cCVC does and it will have its eyes on overseas markets.

Filming the pulling up of a lobster pot with a fisherman, we told him we had the shot and could return to the harbour. \u201cNo we can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got 15 more to get in yet.\u201d When we finally moored we were made to get out of his boat five times so we could be filmed from eight different angles, including from a drone. He asked me if my work was always such a faff. I didn\u2019t get the sense from any of our contributors they were keen to swap lives any time soon. \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster and writer",

The Christian group pushes legislation to enshrine rightwing Judeo-Christian values into law through public declarations, such as \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d placards, and \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws used to deny services to people of other faiths and beliefs.</p> <p>\u201cThese abortion bills are a key part of a larger agenda to codify a far-right evangelical Christian America,\u201d said Rachel Laser, the president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</p> <p>In 2019, Missouri was one of a handful of states which passed a <a href=\"https://rewire.news/legislative-tracker/law/missouri-fetal-heartbeat-abortion-ban-hb-126/\">ferociously anti-abortion law</a> called \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d, which bans abortion at six weeks (in Missouri\u2019s case, abortion is banned at eight weeks). But Missouri\u2019s law was not just a six-week abortion ban.</p> <p>It also held that if the eight-week ban was found unconstitutional, which it almost certainly would be, then another ban at 14 weeks would go into effect. If that is found unconstitutional, then 18 weeks, and if that too is found unconstitutional, then at 20 weeks. The law also held that if Roe v Wade were ever overturned, the state would automatically outlaw abortion.</p> <p>Missouri\u2019s health department has repeatedly attempted to shutter its last remaining abortion clinic in St Louis. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/missouri-abortion-clinic-house-hearing\">denied the clinic a license to operate</a>, which is now being challenged in court.</p>",

Mainstream groups such as the anti-abortion March for Life continue to focus on proposals to winnow down women\u2019s rights incrementally. Others, like Moon, feel emboldened by the Trump administration\u2019s conservative record on appointing judges and its public rhetoric to ban abortion and want to see how courts handle any challenge. Moon is a longtime anti-abortion extremist. In 2017, he decapitated a live chicken on Facebook to call for an end to abortion. In the video, he then removed one of the chicken\u2019s internal organs, and said Missourians needed to get \u201cto the heart of the matter\u201d, and ban abortion. Anti-abortion activists commonly compare abortion to slavery, and Moon has also sought to make that comparison literally. He introduced a bill to create an abortion exhibit at the Missouri state museum, one that would be required to be shown alongside exhibits on slavery. When a statue of the Greek goddess of agriculture Ceres was removed from the state capitol\u2019s rotunda for cleaning, Moon opposed its replacement, arguing it was \u201cpagan\u201d and offensive to Christians. Just this session alone, Moon has introduced bills to require internet service providers to block \u201cobscene\u201d websites or face penalties (later withdrawn); to allow parents to opt their children out of sex education in public schools; and a bill to prohibit doctors from treating children with gender dysphoria with hormones or surgery, under penalty of losing their license. In addition to his work against abortion, Moon is the co-chair of the Missouri chapter of the Congressional Prayer Caucus. The Christian group pushes legislation to enshrine rightwing Judeo-Christian values into law through public declarations, such as \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d placards, and \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws used to deny services to people of other faiths and beliefs. \u201cThese abortion bills are a key part of a larger agenda to codify a far-right evangelical Christian America,\u201d said Rachel Laser, the president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. In 2019, Missouri was one of a handful of states which passed a ferociously anti-abortion law called \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d, which bans abortion at six weeks (in Missouri\u2019s case, abortion is banned at eight weeks). But Missouri\u2019s law was not just a six-week abortion ban. It also held that if the eight-week ban was found unconstitutional, which it almost certainly would be, then another ban at 14 weeks would go into effect. If that is found unconstitutional, then 18 weeks, and if that too is found unconstitutional, then at 20 weeks. The law also held that if Roe v Wade were ever overturned, the state would automatically outlaw abortion. Missouri\u2019s health department has repeatedly attempted to shutter its last remaining abortion clinic in St Louis. It denied the clinic a license to operate, which is now being challenged in court.",

If it would change my life.\u201d</p> <p>It has been more than a decade since the tough-tackling centre-back tried to take her own life and was found by a housemate. Flaherty has not spoken about it publicly since. She has not even talked about it privately with that housemate, nor until recently with her family, who if they referred to the incident at all would mention \u201cthat thing you did once\u201d. Yet here she is, at West Ham\u2019s Rush Green training ground, feeling as if she is \u201csitting in the Big Brother diary room\u201d. Flaherty grins but, much like her hard persona masks a soft centre, the smile hides trepidation about an interview \u2013 released on Thursday on Time to Talk day and before the Football Association\u2019s Heads Up weekend \u2013 that almost didn\u2019t happen.</p> <p>\u201cLast week I wasn\u2019t going to do this,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I\u2019d made the decision not to do it I went on Twitter and someone had taken their life. The day before they had sent out a tweet saying: \u2018These letters are the hardest letters to write.\u2019 Then they passed away. And I thought: \u2018I have to do this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Flaherty\u2019s career is packed with trophies. Seven FA Cups, eight top\u2011division titles, a Champions League win as a part of Arsenal\u2019s quadruple winners; few have had such success. \u201cI think I could have gone through my whole career not having mentioned what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d the 28-year-old captain reflects. \u201cI\u2019m a different person now to the person I was back then \u2013 I\u2019m stronger now.

That\u2019s nothing against Arsenal but I just wish now that I would have stayed at home, gone to college and learned a trade and come out with something.</p> <p>\u201cI was in the academy Monday to Friday. Now my mum will have a go at me when I don\u2019t pick up the phone and ring her. Families have WhatsApp groups but when I was younger, I\u2019d go Monday through Friday and I wouldn\u2019t talk to them all week. I wasn\u2019t doing well in college, I wasn\u2019t interested. I was going through things \u2026 I knew I was gay. I had known I was gay for a long time but as you get older you start to think about relationships, you\u2019re talking about taking things a bit further than just liking someone or thinking someone\u2019s nice looking.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/04/shortage-coaches-threat-development-womens-game\">FA admits it lacks coaches to deal with women's football boom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s all of the unknown. OK, I\u2019m gay but what do I do? Do I go to gay bars? There\u2019s no education about it when you\u2019re younger. How do I find gay girls? Where do I find a partner? I did think when I was growing up that I would be this silly old woman with 100 dogs. And you worry about how your parents will react. You don\u2019t want to disappoint them.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was the football. \u201cI was with Arsenal\u2019s first team but I wasn\u2019t playing. I was on the bench. With the team they had it was no surprise but I don\u2019t think I handled that well and I don\u2019t really think I had the right guidance as a younger player.\u201d</p> <p>She was cripplingly lonely. That was the context, the cocktail of emotions, that fuelled the attempt to take her own life aged 17. \u201cI just wish I\u2019d been educated about it. Read something. Or had someone grab hold of me. It\u2019s hard because some people have no one.\u201d</p> <p>There was a heavy helping of luck involved in her survival. It was lucky the lock on her door was broken, enabling her housemate to find her and get her to hospital, where she was put on a drip. \u201cJayne Ludlow and Ciara Grant, Arsenal players at the time, worked in the academy and were sort of the on-call leaders.

      "body": "<p>One teenager wants to know when you\u2019re ready to have a baby. Another wonders if he\u2019ll ever be accepted as black and gay. A third complains about the older generation writing off the young as stupid screen addicts. All of them want to know about having sex for the first time.</p> <p>Georgie Coles, Rosie Doonan and Kylie Perry of Paper Birds have gamely offered to answer these questions and more. Trying to fill the vacuum left by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/mar/25/pressandpublishing.g2\">Just Seventeen</a> problem page, they wrote to groups of young people around the country with a promise to listen to their concerns. Ask Me Anything, an emotionally powerful show, is their response.</p> <p>But something is amiss. At first it feels as though they\u2019re just teasing us, delaying their answers to these niggling questions for dramatic effect. They filibuster entertainingly, bantering with the audience, revisiting their own teenage years through a make-believe sitcom and joining in with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/9b230e86-6322-4e82-9daa-e52338db4b4d\">Doonan\u2019s soul-baring songs</a> about becoming a mother.</p> <p>We do get direct answers to some of the questions, but although the performers appear to be edging towards an honest sharing of their own experience, they are also evasive. And so they should be: their conceit is flawed. Society is not divided between those with questions and those with answers. We are all flailing about, improvising, making it up as we go along. Yes, you can ask these women anything, but the longer their performance goes on, the more they realise there\u2019s only so much they can tell you.</p> <p>From a technical point of view, Jemma McDonnell\u2019s production is razor sharp. The AV design by the <a href=\"https://themediaworkshop.co.uk/\">Media Workshop</a> mixes WhatsApp chats with Alexa-style interjections and recorded interviews, all with startling precision.</p> <p>Cleverly, the show spins on its axis and redefines its own terms. The grownups can offer empathy, a kindly ear or a shoulder to cry on, but solutions are harder to come by. Their call instead for a conversation \u2013 a genuine exchange \u2013 feels humble, mature and quietly radical. </p> <ul> <li><p>At Live theatre, Newcastle, until 8 February. <a href=\"https://www.thepaperbirds.com/tour-dates/\">Then touring</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "One teenager wants to know when you\u2019re ready to have a baby. Another wonders if he\u2019ll ever be accepted as black and gay. A third complains about the older generation writing off the young as stupid screen addicts. All of them want to know about having sex for the first time. Georgie Coles, Rosie Doonan and Kylie Perry of Paper Birds have gamely offered to answer these questions and more. Trying to fill the vacuum left by the Just Seventeen problem page, they wrote to groups of young people around the country with a promise to listen to their concerns. Ask Me Anything, an emotionally powerful show, is their response. But something is amiss. At first it feels as though they\u2019re just teasing us, delaying their answers to these niggling questions for dramatic effect. They filibuster entertainingly, bantering with the audience, revisiting their own teenage years through a make-believe sitcom and joining in with Doonan\u2019s soul-baring songs about becoming a mother. We do get direct answers to some of the questions, but although the performers appear to be edging towards an honest sharing of their own experience, they are also evasive. And so they should be: their conceit is flawed. Society is not divided between those with questions and those with answers. We are all flailing about, improvising, making it up as we go along. Yes, you can ask these women anything, but the longer their performance goes on, the more they realise there\u2019s only so much they can tell you. From a technical point of view, Jemma McDonnell\u2019s production is razor sharp. The AV design by the Media Workshop mixes WhatsApp chats with Alexa-style interjections and recorded interviews, all with startling precision. Cleverly, the show spins on its axis and redefines its own terms. The grownups can offer empathy, a kindly ear or a shoulder to cry on, but solutions are harder to come by. Their call instead for a conversation \u2013 a genuine exchange \u2013 feels humble, mature and quietly radical. At Live theatre, Newcastle, until 8 February. Then touring.",

We believe that the sweeping changes and increased investment in this agreement will not only be integral to the league\u2019s continued growth, but will also move MLS closer to the systems in place in overseas leagues with which we aspire to compete.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What are the deadlines?</strong></h2> <p>The collective bargaining agreement between Major League Soccer and the league\u2019s Players Association (MLSPA) will expire on Friday after the two parties negotiated a brief extension. The sides have promised \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2020/01/30/mls-and-mlspa-announce-current-cba-will-be-extended-through-feb-7\">productive discussions</a>\u201d are ongoing, but if there has been any progress, the sides have been tight-lipped.

However, the first indication of actual strife between the two parties will be if a work stoppage continues through the first round of Concacaf Champions League matches, on 18 February.</p> <p>If a strike extended to the start of the MLS season and beyond, it would be the first time in the league\u2019s history that regular-season games were affected by a work stoppage.</p> <h2><strong>What are the stakes?</strong></h2> <p>The 2020 season marks the 25th year in the relatively brief history of MLS, and the league is adding two teams a season between now and 2022. The league hopes one team in particular, the David Beckham owned Inter Miami, will give it a boost in publicity in America\u2019s crowded sports market. If the strike means Miami can\u2019t even take the field when the season starts, it hardly sends out the message that MLS is a league meant to be taken seriously.</p> <p>Added to that, MLS is starting to think about its next broadcast deal, which is due to expire at the end of 2022. The current deal brought in an average of around $90m per year. That number is expected to climb, but to exactly what is unsure. MLS will likely downplay the prospect of that deal increasing in an era of increased cable-cutting, even though the league is touting an <a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/schedule/2020/announcement\">all-time high</a> 46 network televised games for 2020.

He reappeared after a holiday in Costa Rica with a salt-and-pepper beard that eerily recalled his dad. No longer just a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/may/26/stylewatch-justin-trudeaus-socks-at-g7\">dude with funny socks</a>, this time he meant business.</p> <p>Or to put it another way, these men are \u201cfully Lettermaning\u201d. David Letterman, you might remember, quit his talkshow after 33 years and did two things: a) moved to the middle of nowhere, and b) promptly grew a beard. His sightings got weird and erratic (an interview given to the Indianapolis Monthly? Sure!) and his hirsute appearance made him the Yeti of Hollywood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"701ba81633ae3ddbf1106a7b50ac308058812089\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/701ba81633ae3ddbf1106a7b50ac308058812089/0_0_1952_2850/685.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvester Stallone out and about in LA.\" width=\"685\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvester Stallone out and about in LA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ROGUT/starmaxinc.com/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He explained his new whiskers (to the Whitefish Review): \u201cEverybody hates it. My wife hates it. My son hates it. But it\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve kind of developed a real creepy look with it that I\u2019m sort of enjoying. And I can tell that people are put off by it.

      "bodyText": "When is a beard just a beard \u2013 and when is it a \u201ccrisis beard\u201d? US website Vox coined the phrase to define the moment when a man of a certain age has a moment of existential crisis, downs tools and ditches the razor. First, there was Beto O\u2019Rourke who, days before leaving the Democratic presidential primary, stopped shaving, went on to sculpt his growth into a Craig David-style shape before finally embracing full beardness Then there was Justin Trudeau who, through his strong position against the US\u2019s escalation with Iran, is going through a period of political maturation (not to mention a drop in popularity). He reappeared after a holiday in Costa Rica with a salt-and-pepper beard that eerily recalled his dad. No longer just a dude with funny socks, this time he meant business. Or to put it another way, these men are \u201cfully Lettermaning\u201d. David Letterman, you might remember, quit his talkshow after 33 years and did two things: a) moved to the middle of nowhere, and b) promptly grew a beard. His sightings got weird and erratic (an interview given to the Indianapolis Monthly? Sure!) and his hirsute appearance made him the Yeti of Hollywood. He explained his new whiskers (to the Whitefish Review): \u201cEverybody hates it. My wife hates it. My son hates it. But it\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve kind of developed a real creepy look with it that I\u2019m sort of enjoying. And I can tell that people are put off by it. And the more people implore me to shave, the stronger my resolve is to not shave.\u201d Which was brilliantly self-aware, rebellious and a teeny weeny bit cry for help. Indeed, he reflected later with GQ after his beard went viral in 2017: \u201cI think there\u2019s a bundle of emotional manifestations with the beard that I have not yet been able to fully examine.

The extreme weather events, the horrific fires, that take such a terrible toll on our communities and wildlife place us at the frontline of the impact \u2013 and so Australia has a direct interest in leading international debate on this topic.</p> <p>\u201cI certainly look forward to our government taking on that role.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how Morrison should balance Nationals and Liberal conservatives wanting more coal-fired power with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/04/coalition-mps-clash-over-climate-policy-in-first-partyroom-meeting-of-2020\">moderate Liberals\u2019 calls to do more to fight global heating</a>, Bishop responded that Morrison \u201cdoesn\u2019t need my advice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need action on several fronts: disaster response, including the resourcing of emergency fire services; climate change mitigation [and] adaptation; and reducing our own emissions is obviously vital \u2013 but we have to focus on all areas, not just the electricity sector,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Despite Morrison claiming the government has set out how it will reduce emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030, critics have noted it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/31/government-accused-australia-failure-cut-vehicle-emissions\">is yet to set vehicle emissions standards</a> or a plan to reduce emissions in the transport and agriculture sectors.</p> <p>Bishop backed the Morrison government on its handling of the coronavirus, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/03/some-australian-universities-delay-semester-start-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">criticism from Universities Australia</a> that Australian Border Force had overreacted by reportedly detaining Chinese students returning to Australia after the travel ban.</p> <p>Bishop said she assumed all measures were taken after \u201cconsultation with national and international health bodies\u201d.</p> <p>ANU, like many other universities, has offered flexible arrangements to help its students affected by virus-related travel bans including online delivery of courses, intensive courses and deferral without penalty.</p> <p>Bishop said she was \u201cnot aware of any evidence\u201d that Australia\u2019s relationship with China had slowed evacuations from Wuhan or had suffered as a result of travel bans.</p> <p>Bishop listed among other priorities for the ANU to equip students and graduates for the fourth industrial revolution and disruption of traditional work, and to gain greater international recognition for the university.</p> <p>Since retiring from politics at the 2019 election Bishop has also taken a role on the board of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/21/julie-bishops-job-with-palladium-caught-dfat-by-surprise\">foreign aid contractor Palladium</a> which she insists is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/05/no-theatrical-flourishes-as-pyne-and-bishop-play-down-their-new-backstage-gigs\">not a breach of ministerial standards</a>, which ban ministers lobbying on \u201cany matters on which they have had official dealings\u201d in the previous 18 months.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia \u201cneeds action on several fronts\u201d following a catastrophic bushfire season, including leading international efforts against climate change and cutting emissions beyond the electricity sector, Julie Bishop has said. Bishop, the incoming chancellor of the Australian National University, made the comments to Guardian Australia, offering to put the university\u2019s disaster management experts and more than 300 climate scientists at the federal government\u2019s disposal to provide \u201cevidence-based\u201d responses to the bushfires. The former foreign minister and deputy Liberal leader started the ANU role in January but has postponed an event marking her appointment as the university responds to the outbreak of coronavirus and extreme weather including bushfires in the Australian Capital Territory and damage from a hailstorm. Bishop said that \u201cclearly there have been some missteps\u201d in the federal government\u2019s handling of the bushfires, adding she is \u201ccertain the government will reflect on recent events and learn from any missteps\u201d. \u201cI as chancellor \u2026 have offered to assist the federal government in its bushfire recovery response,\u201d she said. Bishop said the university was preparing to provide expertise in disaster recovery, public health, biodiversity, engineering, and climate science. \u201cANU has climate change expertise, we have expertise in bushfire recovery, 300 climate scientists across seven colleges and 25 schools. \u201cWe have the climate change institute, headed up by Mark Howden who\u2019s on the intergovernmental climate change panel. \u201cAs a national university we have a responsibility to the Australian community to deliver evidence-based solutions \u2026 to the myriad consequences from these catastrophic events.\u201d The government has come under fire for its handling of climate change because the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has argued Australia contributes just 1.3% of global emissions, while lobbying to lower global ambition by including carryover credits in 2030 Paris targets. Liberal senator Jim Molan said on Monday his stance on climate change was not based on evidence, while the new deputy Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has explained he had professed doubt \u2013 but now accepts \u2013 climate science because he is not \u201cgifted academically\u201d and lacks a scientific background. Bishop praised Britain for being \u201cambitious and a leading voice in calling for greater standards to deal with climate change\u201d after Boris Johnson urged major economies to go carbon neutral by 2050. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the view that Australia, as a leading industrialised and developed nation, with one of the best standards of living in the world, needs to be a leader in the international response to climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a responsibility. The extreme weather events, the horrific fires, that take such a terrible toll on our communities and wildlife place us at the frontline of the impact \u2013 and so Australia has a direct interest in leading international debate on this topic. \u201cI certainly look forward to our government taking on that role.\u201d Asked how Morrison should balance Nationals and Liberal conservatives wanting more coal-fired power with moderate Liberals\u2019 calls to do more to fight global heating, Bishop responded that Morrison \u201cdoesn\u2019t need my advice\u201d. \u201cWe need action on several fronts: disaster response, including the resourcing of emergency fire services; climate change mitigation [and] adaptation; and reducing our own emissions is obviously vital \u2013 but we have to focus on all areas, not just the electricity sector,\u201d she said. Despite Morrison claiming the government has set out how it will reduce emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030, critics have noted it is yet to set vehicle emissions standards or a plan to reduce emissions in the transport and agriculture sectors. Bishop backed the Morrison government on its handling of the coronavirus, despite criticism from Universities Australia that Australian Border Force had overreacted by reportedly detaining Chinese students returning to Australia after the travel ban. Bishop said she assumed all measures were taken after \u201cconsultation with national and international health bodies\u201d. ANU, like many other universities, has offered flexible arrangements to help its students affected by virus-related travel bans including online delivery of courses, intensive courses and deferral without penalty. Bishop said she was \u201cnot aware of any evidence\u201d that Australia\u2019s relationship with China had slowed evacuations from Wuhan or had suffered as a result of travel bans. Bishop listed among other priorities for the ANU to equip students and graduates for the fourth industrial revolution and disruption of traditional work, and to gain greater international recognition for the university. Since retiring from politics at the 2019 election Bishop has also taken a role on the board of foreign aid contractor Palladium which she insists is not a breach of ministerial standards, which ban ministers lobbying on \u201cany matters on which they have had official dealings\u201d in the previous 18 months.",

      "body": "<p>Ross Brawn believes Lewis Hamilton would deserve to equal Michael Schumacher\u2019s record of seven world titles should the British driver take the championship this season. Formula One\u2019s sporting director considers both drivers to be exceptional but that their skills differ because the sport has changed since the German\u2019s era.</p> <p>Brawn, who has also been fundamental in shaping the form F1 will take, also insisted that an overdue restructuring of governance would take place next year.</p> <p>Hamilton has won the world championship six times, and with stable regulations and Mercedes in imperious form last year, he approaches the new season as the strong favourite.</p> <p>Brawn has worked closely with both drivers. He was the technical director at Benetton when Schumacher won his first two titles and then at Ferrari, where Schumacher secured five more between 2000 and 2004. He became principal of Mercedes in 2010, persuading Hamilton to join the team, and worked alongside him in 2013 before retiring a year later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/nov/03/lewis-hamilton-f1-world-championship-michael-schumacher\">Six-times world champion Lewis Hamilton is the best driver I have seen | Johnny Herbert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey are both massively talented in what they do in the car and those moments where they pull something out of nowhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the qualifying laps Lewis has done have left the team speechless. Michael was the same, there are sometimes just those drivers who can do that.\u201d</p> <p>Brawn joined F1 management as sporting director in 2017, since when Hamilton has taken the title every year, an achievement Brawn considers every bit as impressive as Schumacher\u2019s. \u201cLewis has deserved it, he has deserved every championship he has won,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has got himself at the right team at the right time and he is at peak performance. He doesn\u2019t make mistakes and is a fantastic driver, his performance is exceptional.\u201d</p> <p>Brawn enjoyed a close relationship with Schumacher and the German cited him as the main reason he came out of retirement to join Mercedes in 2010. Schumacher remains in recovery after suffering a brain injury while skiing in 2013.</p> <p>Brawn recognises that Hamilton has earned his place in the record books on merit. \u201cIt is not like Lewis is winning out of luck,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is winning because he is doing a fantastic job and you have to give him credit.\u201d</p> <p>This will be Hamilton\u2019s 14th season in F1 but he remains motivated and the new season, which starts in Melbourne on 15 March, looms large. However, Brawn feels it is difficult to make direct comparisons between Hamilton and Schumacher. \u201cThey were different cars, different eras, different competition,\u201d he said. \u201cLewis is incredibly professional, dedicated and committed but Michael had an intensity of detail toward the car that Lewis doesn\u2019t need.</p> <p>\u201cMichael came up in an era where there wasn\u2019t the technology there is now. Data analysis was pretty crude. Now a driver gets out of the car and the engineer has an analysis of the car\u2019s behaviour through every corner. When I first worked with Michael we had a sheet with the corner numbers on and he had to explain where he had understeer or oversteer and we would then analyse that.\u201d</p> <p>Brawn has been at the centre of framing the new regulations for 2021, including technical changes and the introduction of a budget cap. He was insistent the sport has to evolve and the changes are intended to promote closer racing.</p> <p>\u201cThese cars at the moment are terrible aerodynamically when they get close to each other,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a plethora of bits that fall off as soon as they look at each other. That\u2019s not a racing car, you don\u2019t want a tank but you want something which is robust enough to race properly and we have lost that.\u201d</p> <p>He has also been instrumental in overhauling the sport\u2019s governance, which has been unwieldy and restrictive. In the past all the teams had to agree to make changes, which has left F1\u2019s management struggling to achieve objectives. Last season a new sprint race format for qualifying was rejected. The system expected to be agreed for 2021 will require only a majority or super-majority \u2013a seven-eight split \u2013 to authorise a proposal. It will also enable F1 to deal swiftly in closing loopholes in regulations that teams may be exploiting.</p> <p>\u201cWe are moving away from this unanimity which has always blocked anything happening,\u201d Brawn said. \u201cIt has been counterproductive. We are moving away from the rigid, locked situation where things can\u2019t change even when they are wrong. Developing F1 is not just technical or sporting regulations, it\u2019s financial regulations and the governance.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ross Brawn believes Lewis Hamilton would deserve to equal Michael Schumacher\u2019s record of seven world titles should the British driver take the championship this season. Formula One\u2019s sporting director considers both drivers to be exceptional but that their skills differ because the sport has changed since the German\u2019s era. Brawn, who has also been fundamental in shaping the form F1 will take, also insisted that an overdue restructuring of governance would take place next year. Hamilton has won the world championship six times, and with stable regulations and Mercedes in imperious form last year, he approaches the new season as the strong favourite. Brawn has worked closely with both drivers. He was the technical director at Benetton when Schumacher won his first two titles and then at Ferrari, where Schumacher secured five more between 2000 and 2004. He became principal of Mercedes in 2010, persuading Hamilton to join the team, and worked alongside him in 2013 before retiring a year later. \u201cThey are both massively talented in what they do in the car and those moments where they pull something out of nowhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the qualifying laps Lewis has done have left the team speechless. Michael was the same, there are sometimes just those drivers who can do that.\u201d Brawn joined F1 management as sporting director in 2017, since when Hamilton has taken the title every year, an achievement Brawn considers every bit as impressive as Schumacher\u2019s. \u201cLewis has deserved it, he has deserved every championship he has won,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has got himself at the right team at the right time and he is at peak performance. He doesn\u2019t make mistakes and is a fantastic driver, his performance is exceptional.\u201d Brawn enjoyed a close relationship with Schumacher and the German cited him as the main reason he came out of retirement to join Mercedes in 2010. Schumacher remains in recovery after suffering a brain injury while skiing in 2013. Brawn recognises that Hamilton has earned his place in the record books on merit. \u201cIt is not like Lewis is winning out of luck,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is winning because he is doing a fantastic job and you have to give him credit.\u201d This will be Hamilton\u2019s 14th season in F1 but he remains motivated and the new season, which starts in Melbourne on 15 March, looms large. However, Brawn feels it is difficult to make direct comparisons between Hamilton and Schumacher. \u201cThey were different cars, different eras, different competition,\u201d he said. \u201cLewis is incredibly professional, dedicated and committed but Michael had an intensity of detail toward the car that Lewis doesn\u2019t need. \u201cMichael came up in an era where there wasn\u2019t the technology there is now. Data analysis was pretty crude. Now a driver gets out of the car and the engineer has an analysis of the car\u2019s behaviour through every corner. When I first worked with Michael we had a sheet with the corner numbers on and he had to explain where he had understeer or oversteer and we would then analyse that.\u201d Brawn has been at the centre of framing the new regulations for 2021, including technical changes and the introduction of a budget cap. He was insistent the sport has to evolve and the changes are intended to promote closer racing. \u201cThese cars at the moment are terrible aerodynamically when they get close to each other,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a plethora of bits that fall off as soon as they look at each other. That\u2019s not a racing car, you don\u2019t want a tank but you want something which is robust enough to race properly and we have lost that.\u201d He has also been instrumental in overhauling the sport\u2019s governance, which has been unwieldy and restrictive. In the past all the teams had to agree to make changes, which has left F1\u2019s management struggling to achieve objectives. Last season a new sprint race format for qualifying was rejected. The system expected to be agreed for 2021 will require only a majority or super-majority \u2013a seven-eight split \u2013 to authorise a proposal. It will also enable F1 to deal swiftly in closing loopholes in regulations that teams may be exploiting. \u201cWe are moving away from this unanimity which has always blocked anything happening,\u201d Brawn said. \u201cIt has been counterproductive. We are moving away from the rigid, locked situation where things can\u2019t change even when they are wrong. Developing F1 is not just technical or sporting regulations, it\u2019s financial regulations and the governance.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Precision matters, so let\u2019s be very precise. The Australian federal police has not conducted a deep dive into what went on in Angus Taylor\u2019s office \u2013 how it came to pass that a dodgy document was deployed in a political attack against the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore. The police haven\u2019t investigated. They have declined to investigate. According to the AFP\u2019s statement issued on Thursday, the New South Wales police handed them \u201cinformation\u201d about the inquiry they had undertaken last year into the controversy. The AFP perused this information and determined \u201cit is unlikely further investigation will result in obtaining sufficient evidence to substantiate a commonwealth offence\u201d. Now this is kind of curious, because nobody at any point asked the police to consider whether a commonwealth offence had been committed. The referral was very precise. It asked for an assessment of whether an offence had been committed under NSW law. Having assessed the NSW investigation \u2013 after the NSW police kindly passed the political hot potato on to the constabulary in Canberra \u2013 the AFP determined there was \u201cno evidence\u201d to indicate the minister for energy and emissions reduction was involved in falsifying information. This is a relief of course, but it always seemed highly unlikely Taylor himself would have authored a career-ending dodgy document as a bit of comic relief between cabinet submissions. So why is the arbitration narrowed to what the minister did or did not do? Also, it is entirely unclear how this \u201cno evidence\u201d determination was reached. By speaking to Angus Taylor? By looking at electronic records? The AFP has declined to say whether police interviewed the minister, or staff, or others, as part of this process. The AFP has justified its decision not to investigate (again being clear what has actually happened here) because of the \u201clow level of harm\u201d associated with the episode, and because Taylor apologised for using false figures when he accused the council of undertaking travel that wasn\u2019t actually undertaken. Let\u2019s pause here a moment and consider \u201clow level of harm\u201d. Now it\u2019s obvious to say harm is an eye-of-the-beholder concept, but it probably pays at this juncture to recap the central facts of this case. To explain the otherwise inexplicable, Taylor has always insisted that his office accessed an early version of the Sydney City Council annual report, and that version contained different travel figures than the report that appears on the website currently. Taylor\u2019s problem is there has never been any concrete evidence, at least in the public domain, to substantiate that claim. Now perhaps the police fared better than the rest of us, but the minister never provided any proof to the parliament or to journalists. The City of Sydney for its part produced detailed evidence of its metadata and screenshots from the system used to manage its website. That material showed the publicly available documents had not changed since they were first uploaded \u2013 with the correct and accurate figures \u2013 in November last year. The evidence supplied by the council suggests the document Taylor\u2019s office used wasn\u2019t ever on the council website. So if that\u2019s correct, where did this false document come from? Who authored it? Why did they do that? And most importantly, why are there no consequences for doing that? Sticking with the sliding scale of harm, it is true that nobody is ever going to lose any sleep over an issue as micro as the size of the Sydney City Council travel budget, and whether a commonwealth cabinet minister thinks it\u2019s a good use of his time to pick a student politics fight with a local government official. But I suspect a number of us do care if documents have been falsified and whether fake documents are being deployed in public debate. That would seem to me to be quite harmful activity in an age where citizens in democracies don\u2019t know who, or what, to trust in politics and public life, and are suspicious of institutions that once enjoyed significant levels of respect. Not being able to determine what\u2019s true, and people not being held accountable when falsehoods happen, is incredibly harmful. It\u2019s more than harmful, actually. Corrosive is a better word. In deciding not to investigate, the AFP also determined that getting to the bottom of the Taylor/Moore imbroglio would require a \u201csignificant\u201d level of resources. Really? Would it require more than the small phalanx of police who sifted through the underwear drawer of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst last year after she was raided after publishing information that was clearly in the public interest? More resources than that? Seems pretty unlikely, doesn\u2019t it. Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor",

      "body": "<p>Early 2020 is either a very good or a very bad time to publish a book about why socialism is the answer to the world\u2019s problems. Bad for reasons that, if you\u2019re British, don\u2019t need rehearsing; good because with every awful news cycle capitalism looks less and less able to provide most people with a decent, sustainable life. Also, as even arch-capitalist publications such as the Economist acknowledge, there has been a recent upsurge of fresh thinking on the left, particularly in Britain and the US. The problem for socialists is not a lack of exciting ideas, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-a-green-new-deal-we-need-it-now\" title=\"\">the green new deal</a>, but how to persuade voters that they are relevant and practical.</p> <p>Gilbert\u2019s daringly short book is an attempt to rectify that. In half a dozen quick chapters, with lightly sketched examples and a minimum of jargon, it covers three huge topics: how capitalism came into being, and what\u2019s wrong with it; how socialism developed during the 19th and 20th centuries as an alternative way of organising society; and how an updated, contemporary version could be drawn together, successfully presented during and between elections, and then put into practice.</p> <p>For Gilbert, socialism is a project for collaborating citizens as much as political parties and governments. It should be about freedom as much as equality. And it doesn\u2019t necessarily require a \u201ctotal transformation\u201d of society. \u201cSometimes it can simply mean creating, defending, or building up institutions that are not organised along capitalist lines,\u201d he writes, such as \u201ccooperatively owned social media platforms [or] the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\" title=\"\">National Health Service</a>\u201d.</p> <p>All these views mark Gilbert, who teaches at the University of East London and is influential online, as a member of the relatively new leftwing intellectual milieu that provided many of the ideas for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Corbynism</a>, and may do so for his successor, too \u2013 not least because of the lack of ideas in the rest of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\" title=\"\">Labour party</a>. Like his fellow thinkers, Gilbert is intensely interested in the modern world: in the need for the left to adapt to digital technology and social diversity. He reveres some of the achievements of postwar socialism, such as the NHS. But he is also critical of \u201ccentralised socialist regimes\u201d, whether paternalistic such as postwar Britain, or authoritarian such as the Soviet Union. Despite the red fist on the cover \u2013 too many books about the left have predictable jackets \u2013 the socialism Gilbert wants is democratic and consensual, not confrontational and macho.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For Gilbert, socialism is a project for collaborating citizens as much as politicians \u2013 it's about freedom as much as equality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Achieving it is not as immense a task, he argues, as commonly imagined. Unlike many leftwing theorists since the 70s, the decade when the right\u2019s modern ascendancy began, he does not see capitalism as an all-enveloping system. In everyday life, he points out, \u201cthere are all kinds of things going on ... that are not capitalism, from teaching in [state] schools ... to interaction between friends\u201d. And capitalism itself contains collaborative, even potentially socialist impulses: \u201cpeople actually have to cooperate on a vast scale\u201d to create and distribute many consumer products.</p> <p>The writing here is conversational, accessible. Yet the points being made feel heretical, so used have most people become to seeing capitalism, for all its failings, as essentially impregnable. Gilbert also usefully reminds us that, for much of the 20th century, governments across the world regularly turned things that had been commodities, such as education and health, into public goods that were effectively outside the market. Since the 80s, capitalism\u2019s many political allies have worked tirelessly and often successfully to take these goods back under the market\u2019s control, through privatisation. But there are now signs of that process going into reverse, with even the Conservatives being forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/26/northern-rail-to-be-renationalised-and-some-beeching-closures-reversed\" title=\"\">renationalise</a> failing rail companies.</p> <p>Gilbert argues that the left\u2019s task is to expand the collaborative, noncapitalist space bit by bit. A local council could award contracts to cooperatives rather than multinationals, as already happens in a few radical municipalities such as Preston. Or a national coalition of support for socialism could be gradually assembled, among the ever\u2011widening range of people capitalism fails \u2013 as began to happen during the best phases of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>Occasionally, Gilbert\u2019s expansive, often optimistic argument becomes too broad-brush. \u201cHumans have only ever survived and prospered in cooperation,\u201d he writes. It\u2019s a welcome challenge to the notion that the competitive individualism that pervades modern life is natural and eternal. But many historians would say that individualism and cooperation have a more complicated, more mutually dependent, relationship.</p> <p>Gilbert\u2019s definition of socialism as \u201ccooperation\u201d and capitalism as profit-seeking at all costs may also be too vague and too narrow, respectively, for some readers. And his call for socialism to be a bottom-up process, while inspiring, and fitting the times, does make you wonder whether that would favour the parts of fragmented, unequal countries like Britain which have the most energy and confidence.</p> <p>Yet this book is meant to get you thinking, not give conclusive answers. Its footnotes generously direct you to a whole world of recent and classic leftwing volumes. And Gilbert ends on a hopeful note for despondent lefties. When socialism makes progress, he writes, it\u2019s not just \u201cwho is in government that matters; it\u2019s the overall balance of forces in society\u201d. That balance rarely stays the same for long.</p>",

Bad for reasons that, if you\u2019re British, don\u2019t need rehearsing; good because with every awful news cycle capitalism looks less and less able to provide most people with a decent, sustainable life. Also, as even arch-capitalist publications such as the Economist acknowledge, there has been a recent upsurge of fresh thinking on the left, particularly in Britain and the US. The problem for socialists is not a lack of exciting ideas, such as the green new deal, but how to persuade voters that they are relevant and practical. Gilbert\u2019s daringly short book is an attempt to rectify that. In half a dozen quick chapters, with lightly sketched examples and a minimum of jargon, it covers three huge topics: how capitalism came into being, and what\u2019s wrong with it; how socialism developed during the 19th and 20th centuries as an alternative way of organising society; and how an updated, contemporary version could be drawn together, successfully presented during and between elections, and then put into practice. For Gilbert, socialism is a project for collaborating citizens as much as political parties and governments. It should be about freedom as much as equality. And it doesn\u2019t necessarily require a \u201ctotal transformation\u201d of society. \u201cSometimes it can simply mean creating, defending, or building up institutions that are not organised along capitalist lines,\u201d he writes, such as \u201ccooperatively owned social media platforms [or] the National Health Service\u201d. All these views mark Gilbert, who teaches at the University of East London and is influential online, as a member of the relatively new leftwing intellectual milieu that provided many of the ideas for Corbynism, and may do so for his successor, too \u2013 not least because of the lack of ideas in the rest of the Labour party. Like his fellow thinkers, Gilbert is intensely interested in the modern world: in the need for the left to adapt to digital technology and social diversity. He reveres some of the achievements of postwar socialism, such as the NHS. But he is also critical of \u201ccentralised socialist regimes\u201d, whether paternalistic such as postwar Britain, or authoritarian such as the Soviet Union. Despite the red fist on the cover \u2013 too many books about the left have predictable jackets \u2013 the socialism Gilbert wants is democratic and consensual, not confrontational and macho. Achieving it is not as immense a task, he argues, as commonly imagined. Unlike many leftwing theorists since the 70s, the decade when the right\u2019s modern ascendancy began, he does not see capitalism as an all-enveloping system. In everyday life, he points out, \u201cthere are all kinds of things going on ... that are not capitalism, from teaching in [state] schools ... to interaction between friends\u201d. And capitalism itself contains collaborative, even potentially socialist impulses: \u201cpeople actually have to cooperate on a vast scale\u201d to create and distribute many consumer products. The writing here is conversational, accessible. Yet the points being made feel heretical, so used have most people become to seeing capitalism, for all its failings, as essentially impregnable. Gilbert also usefully reminds us that, for much of the 20th century, governments across the world regularly turned things that had been commodities, such as education and health, into public goods that were effectively outside the market. Since the 80s, capitalism\u2019s many political allies have worked tirelessly and often successfully to take these goods back under the market\u2019s control, through privatisation. But there are now signs of that process going into reverse, with even the Conservatives being forced to renationalise failing rail companies. Gilbert argues that the left\u2019s task is to expand the collaborative, noncapitalist space bit by bit. A local council could award contracts to cooperatives rather than multinationals, as already happens in a few radical municipalities such as Preston. Or a national coalition of support for socialism could be gradually assembled, among the ever\u2011widening range of people capitalism fails \u2013 as began to happen during the best phases of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. Occasionally, Gilbert\u2019s expansive, often optimistic argument becomes too broad-brush. \u201cHumans have only ever survived and prospered in cooperation,\u201d he writes. It\u2019s a welcome challenge to the notion that the competitive individualism that pervades modern life is natural and eternal. But many historians would say that individualism and cooperation have a more complicated, more mutually dependent, relationship. Gilbert\u2019s definition of socialism as \u201ccooperation\u201d and capitalism as profit-seeking at all costs may also be too vague and too narrow, respectively, for some readers. And his call for socialism to be a bottom-up process, while inspiring, and fitting the times, does make you wonder whether that would favour the parts of fragmented, unequal countries like Britain which have the most energy and confidence. Yet this book is meant to get you thinking, not give conclusive answers. Its footnotes generously direct you to a whole world of recent and classic leftwing volumes. And Gilbert ends on a hopeful note for despondent lefties. When socialism makes progress, he writes, it\u2019s not just \u201cwho is in government that matters; it\u2019s the overall balance of forces in society\u201d. That balance rarely stays the same for long.",

      "body": "<p>On the morning of 1 September 1859, the English astronomer Richard Carrington noticed something strange on the surface of the sun: two patches of intensely white light erupting from a cluster of dark sunspots. Five minutes later, they vanished.</p> <p>Later that night, bright aurora lit the Earth\u2019s sky as far south as Havana and Honolulu. Around the world, telegraph communications failed, some of them bursting into flames.</p> <p>Carrington had observed a billion tonnes of plasma being lifted off the sun\u2019s surface and accelerated into space at more than 1,300 times the speed of sound. While most such events miss the Earth, this was a direct hit. The so called \u201cCarrington Event\u201d created the largest geomagnetic storm in recorded history.</p> <p>Solar activity of this magnitude is, thankfully, rare. Analysis of ice core samples suggest the storm of 1859 may have been the fiercest in 500 years.</p> <p>But what if it were to happen again?</p> <p>The impact on today\u2019s far more technology dependent society could be more serious. That\u2019s why governments around the world are paying increasing attention to \u201cspace weather\u201d.</p> <p>Not to be confused with weather on Earth, space weather is concerned with the environmental conditions in near-Earth space caused by magnetic fields, radiation and matter ejected from the sun.</p> <p>Last month, the US House science, space and technology committee approved a bill to prioritise investment in space weather forecasting. While the UK government has also developed a detailed strategy to prepare for severe space weather.</p> <p>But there is a lot we don\u2019t yet know. It\u2019s difficult to predict space weather events with accuracy \u2013 and with more than 160 years of technological advancement since the Carrington Event, there\u2019s no way to know what the impact on modern society would be.</p> <p>To help answer these questions, we need to take a closer look at the source of space weather: the sun.</p> <p>In 2018, Nasa launched the Parker Solar Probe, venturing closer than any previous mission to study the sun\u2019s atmosphere or corona.</p> <p>On 9 February the European Space Agency will launch its own mission, the Solar Orbiter, to further expand our knowledge of the sun and space weather. It will use the gravity of Venus to help get into orbit around the sun. The Solar Orbiter will not get as close as Nasa\u2019s probe but will be able to look directly at the sun.</p> <p>Of the many innovations onboard the Solar Orbiter, one of the most interesting is the heat shield. Its outermost layer will be lined with a material called \u201csolar black\u201d \u2013 a type of black calcium phosphate processed from burnt bone charcoal.</p> <p>Burnt char bone has an ancient legacy. Our prehistoric ancestors would use it, along with wooden charcoal, as a black pigment. The survival of some cave paintings after thousands of years is a testament to the material\u2019s endurance.</p> <p>Remote-sensing instruments onboard the Solar Orbiter will observe the sun through tiny sliding doors in the shield, while other instruments will measure the conditions around the spacecraft. Together, they will allow the craft to investigate the three most common types of solar activity that drive space weather:</p> <p><strong>Solar Flares</strong></p> <p>Solar flares are sudden flashes of increased brightness but most of their energy is invisible to the naked eye, consisting of intense bursts of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation.</p> <p>If directed at the earth, solar flares disrupt radio communications. The X-rays can also heat the outer atmosphere, causing low-orbiting satellites to lose altitude.</p> <p>Solar flares are a particular concern for human missions to the moon, Mars or beyond. For example, if Apollo 17 had launched just a few months earlier, it may have encountered the solar storm of August 1972, potentially exposing the three astronauts to dangerous levels of radiation.</p> <p>Scientists have a good idea of how solar flares get their energy and we know that they occur near sunspots. But the underlying mechanisms are not well understood and current methods of flare prediction are limited. There is currently no way of knowing when any given region of the sun will produce a flare.</p> <p><strong>Solar energetic particles</strong></p> <p>Much like a giant particle accelerator, the sun sometimes shoots off storms of high energy protons and electrons into space.</p> <p>These solar energetic particles can reach the Earth within an hour, penetrating the protective layers of our magnetic field and sometimes even reaching the surface.</p> <p>If they were to strike the Earth, electronics onboard planes would be damaged and air travellers would be exposed to increased doses of radiation.</p> <p><strong>Coronal mass ejections</strong></p> <p>Perhaps the most concerning element of solar activity, coronal mass ejections are eruptions on the surface of the sun that cause large parts of the corona to blast away.</p> <p>They are slower than solar flares or energetic particles, taking between one and four days to reach Earth. But when they do, they create a geomagnetic storm which, much like a spring, compresses one side of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere while extending the other. When the spring adjusts, this \u201ctension\u201d is directed back into the upper atmosphere.</p> <p>Coronal mass ejections can produce mass power outages and failure of telecommunication services, including GPS. The insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London estimates that in a worst-case scenario, it could leave 20 to 40 million people in the north-eastern US without power, perhaps for years.</p> <p>Each of these phenomena can occur in isolation or in combination. On that morning in 1859, Carrington observed all three: a perfect solar storm.</p> <p>What are the chances it could happen again? The estimates vary. Some reports have suggested the likelihood may be as high as 12% in the next decade. However, more recent studies have put forward a more conservative estimate of between 0.46% and 1.88%.</p> <p>In the grand scheme of global risks, weather in space may be considered less of a threat to our safety than the weather on Earth. Nonetheless, the importance of Esa\u2019s Solar Orbiter is not to be underestimated. It will answer important questions that will help us not only to prepare for severe space weather but also better understand the sun and its impact on our lives.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 February 2020 to remove an inaccurate reference to the speed at which solar energetic particles travel.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the morning of 1 September 1859, the English astronomer Richard Carrington noticed something strange on the surface of the sun: two patches of intensely white light erupting from a cluster of dark sunspots. Five minutes later, they vanished. Later that night, bright aurora lit the Earth\u2019s sky as far south as Havana and Honolulu. Around the world, telegraph communications failed, some of them bursting into flames. Carrington had observed a billion tonnes of plasma being lifted off the sun\u2019s surface and accelerated into space at more than 1,300 times the speed of sound. While most such events miss the Earth, this was a direct hit. The so called \u201cCarrington Event\u201d created the largest geomagnetic storm in recorded history. Solar activity of this magnitude is, thankfully, rare. Analysis of ice core samples suggest the storm of 1859 may have been the fiercest in 500 years. But what if it were to happen again? The impact on today\u2019s far more technology dependent society could be more serious. That\u2019s why governments around the world are paying increasing attention to \u201cspace weather\u201d. Not to be confused with weather on Earth, space weather is concerned with the environmental conditions in near-Earth space caused by magnetic fields, radiation and matter ejected from the sun. Last month, the US House science, space and technology committee approved a bill to prioritise investment in space weather forecasting. While the UK government has also developed a detailed strategy to prepare for severe space weather. But there is a lot we don\u2019t yet know. It\u2019s difficult to predict space weather events with accuracy \u2013 and with more than 160 years of technological advancement since the Carrington Event, there\u2019s no way to know what the impact on modern society would be. To help answer these questions, we need to take a closer look at the source of space weather: the sun. In 2018, Nasa launched the Parker Solar Probe, venturing closer than any previous mission to study the sun\u2019s atmosphere or corona. On 9 February the European Space Agency will launch its own mission, the Solar Orbiter, to further expand our knowledge of the sun and space weather. It will use the gravity of Venus to help get into orbit around the sun. The Solar Orbiter will not get as close as Nasa\u2019s probe but will be able to look directly at the sun. Of the many innovations onboard the Solar Orbiter, one of the most interesting is the heat shield. Its outermost layer will be lined with a material called \u201csolar black\u201d \u2013 a type of black calcium phosphate processed from burnt bone charcoal. Burnt char bone has an ancient legacy. Our prehistoric ancestors would use it, along with wooden charcoal, as a black pigment. The survival of some cave paintings after thousands of years is a testament to the material\u2019s endurance. Remote-sensing instruments onboard the Solar Orbiter will observe the sun through tiny sliding doors in the shield, while other instruments will measure the conditions around the spacecraft. Together, they will allow the craft to investigate the three most common types of solar activity that drive space weather: Solar Flares Solar flares are sudden flashes of increased brightness but most of their energy is invisible to the naked eye, consisting of intense bursts of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. If directed at the earth, solar flares disrupt radio communications. The X-rays can also heat the outer atmosphere, causing low-orbiting satellites to lose altitude. Solar flares are a particular concern for human missions to the moon, Mars or beyond. For example, if Apollo 17 had launched just a few months earlier, it may have encountered the solar storm of August 1972, potentially exposing the three astronauts to dangerous levels of radiation. Scientists have a good idea of how solar flares get their energy and we know that they occur near sunspots. But the underlying mechanisms are not well understood and current methods of flare prediction are limited. There is currently no way of knowing when any given region of the sun will produce a flare. Solar energetic particles Much like a giant particle accelerator, the sun sometimes shoots off storms of high energy protons and electrons into space. These solar energetic particles can reach the Earth within an hour, penetrating the protective layers of our magnetic field and sometimes even reaching the surface. If they were to strike the Earth, electronics onboard planes would be damaged and air travellers would be exposed to increased doses of radiation. Coronal mass ejections Perhaps the most concerning element of solar activity, coronal mass ejections are eruptions on the surface of the sun that cause large parts of the corona to blast away. They are slower than solar flares or energetic particles, taking between one and four days to reach Earth. But when they do, they create a geomagnetic storm which, much like a spring, compresses one side of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere while extending the other. When the spring adjusts, this \u201ctension\u201d is directed back into the upper atmosphere. Coronal mass ejections can produce mass power outages and failure of telecommunication services, including GPS. The insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London estimates that in a worst-case scenario, it could leave 20 to 40 million people in the north-eastern US without power, perhaps for years. Each of these phenomena can occur in isolation or in combination. On that morning in 1859, Carrington observed all three: a perfect solar storm. What are the chances it could happen again? The estimates vary. Some reports have suggested the likelihood may be as high as 12% in the next decade. However, more recent studies have put forward a more conservative estimate of between 0.46% and 1.88%. In the grand scheme of global risks, weather in space may be considered less of a threat to our safety than the weather on Earth. Nonetheless, the importance of Esa\u2019s Solar Orbiter is not to be underestimated. It will answer important questions that will help us not only to prepare for severe space weather but also better understand the sun and its impact on our lives. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 February 2020 to remove an inaccurate reference to the speed at which solar energetic particles travel.",

This is especially wise for a party that throughout its history has mostly been a federation of interests and ideologies rather than a cult restricted to the doctrinally pure or the wretched of the Earth.</p> <p>But unity in adversity is not the same as the pursuit of a unified project. Of course, unity is strength. A house divided against itself cannot stand. All that stuff is true. But unity is not everything. In some circumstances unity can merely paper over cracks where rebuilding is needed. Labour\u2019s long history is also full of decisions to banish members from even the broadest tent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/28/labour-split-affection-corbyn\">Though Labour is split, unity may now be easier than it looks | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The real question facing Labour about unity is this. How can it end the deep and disabling internal divisions of the past five years and converge behind an agreed set of electorally sustainable reformist and social democratic objectives? This question underlies the 2020 leadership election. It has no single magic answer. Instead the answer lies in a variety of interlocking responses to the dead end into which Jeremy Corbyn led the party.</p> <p>Here are two responses, though there are many others. The first is the need for a serious appreciation of the electoral geography that will face Corbyn\u2019s successor. This is important because of the variety and complexity of the fractured country Britain has now become. It should have been the factual bedrock of the leadership contest.</p> <p>This transformed electoral landscape goes far beyond even the daunting gulf between the Conservatives and Labour. All Labour members should commit to memory the fact that, since 12 December, Labour now needs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/dec/12/uk-general-election-2019-full-results-live-labour-conservatives-tories\" title=\"\">124 extra seats</a> to win, more than a hundred of them now held by the Conservatives \u2013 a proportionate increase of more than 60% that no party has ever achieved in one election in modern times. This task far exceeds even the difficult task of regaining the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/labours-red-wall-demolished-by-tory-onslaught\" title=\"\">red wall seats of the north and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/labours-red-wall-demolished-by-tory-onslaught\" title=\"\">Midlands</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the structure of Labour\u2019s vote has changed and is still changing. In the past, Labour\u2019s safest seats were in the coalfields and heavy industrial areas. Never again. Now they are in cities, suburbs and university towns \u2013 except in Scotland \u2013 and areas with significant ethnic minority populations. To win, Labour doesn\u2019t just need to rebuild its red wall. It also needs to win places such as Basingstoke, Hexham, and Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson\u2019s seat), which have never elected a Labour MP, even in 1997. According to the former Labour strategist Greg Cook, who is not one for hyperbole, \u201cthis new electoral landscape is arguably the most formidable Labour has ever faced\u201d.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s second problem \u2013 which relates directly to the shift in electoral geography \u2013 is its political narrative. Here\u2019s where things get more difficult as a direct result of the Corbyn legacy. But, right on cue, a possible guide through these troubled waters has emerged. In his richly nuanced <a href=\"https://www.warringfictions.net\" title=\"\">Warring Fictions</a>, the most stimulating book I have read on Labour in ages, party activist Chris Clarke highlights three legacy myths of the Corbyn era\u2019s left populism that Labour needs to overcome.</p> <p>The first, which he dubs the \u201cdark knight\u201d myth, claims that politics is a Manichean struggle between the morally good in-group (in this case the Labour left) and the wicked and selfish centre and right (the Tories and all those who can be tarred with the neoliberal or Tory-lite labels that have become Labour\u2019s curse). This, says Clarke, leads to a destructive exclusivist allure of identity, moral self-regard and complacency.</p> <p>The second, the \u201cpuppetmaster\u201d myth, says everything is ultimately a conspiracy against the public. In this view, the country is run by an elite of (sometimes foreign) magnates, media and deep-state agencies bent on crushing the public into submission to the status quo. As a result, incremental and reformist politics can be dismissed as hopeless.</p> <p>The third, which Clarke calls the \u201cgolden age\u201d myth, is a narrative of decline from an era of supposed virtue \u2013 the postwar Attlee era looms large \u2013 against which later eras are always found wanting. This leads to the favourite Labour trope of leadership betrayal, in which everything is a moral failure by corrupted leaders who should have acted in more virtuous ways, whatever the constraints. There is no room here to go into the details of Clarke\u2019s argument, but they are all familiar from the Corbyn era, as well as from the parlous state of the US Democratic party.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s leadership election matters a lot, but in reality it only matters if Labour makes a break with the recent past. To signal this \u2013 a precondition for winning in Basingstoke as well as Bassetlaw \u2013 the first thing the new leader should do is to unequivocally purge the stain of antisemitism from the party. The corrosive \u201cdark knight\u201d idea that there can be no enemies on the left will need to change from day one.</p> <p>Unity is fine and dandy, but in practice it has to be unity that engages in a principled way with the country as it is, not the mythologised country the Corbyn project would have liked it to be.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 and 7 February 2020. The name of Boris Johnson\u2019s seat is Uxbridge and South Ruislip, not Uxbridge as was originally stated. The constituency, which was created in 2010, has never been held by the Labour party, but the former constituency, Uxbridge, did return Labour MPs on several occasions, most recently in 1966. The article was further amended because an earlier version said that no party had ever achieved an increase of 124 seats at one election in modern times. In fact Labour gained more seats than this in the 1997 election. This has been corrected.</p>",

This is especially wise for a party that throughout its history has mostly been a federation of interests and ideologies rather than a cult restricted to the doctrinally pure or the wretched of the Earth. But unity in adversity is not the same as the pursuit of a unified project. Of course, unity is strength. A house divided against itself cannot stand. All that stuff is true. But unity is not everything. In some circumstances unity can merely paper over cracks where rebuilding is needed. Labour\u2019s long history is also full of decisions to banish members from even the broadest tent. The real question facing Labour about unity is this. How can it end the deep and disabling internal divisions of the past five years and converge behind an agreed set of electorally sustainable reformist and social democratic objectives? This question underlies the 2020 leadership election. It has no single magic answer. Instead the answer lies in a variety of interlocking responses to the dead end into which Jeremy Corbyn led the party. Here are two responses, though there are many others. The first is the need for a serious appreciation of the electoral geography that will face Corbyn\u2019s successor. This is important because of the variety and complexity of the fractured country Britain has now become. It should have been the factual bedrock of the leadership contest. This transformed electoral landscape goes far beyond even the daunting gulf between the Conservatives and Labour. All Labour members should commit to memory the fact that, since 12 December, Labour now needs 124 extra seats to win, more than a hundred of them now held by the Conservatives \u2013 a proportionate increase of more than 60% that no party has ever achieved in one election in modern times. This task far exceeds even the difficult task of regaining the so-called red wall seats of the north and Midlands. That\u2019s because the structure of Labour\u2019s vote has changed and is still changing. In the past, Labour\u2019s safest seats were in the coalfields and heavy industrial areas. Never again. Now they are in cities, suburbs and university towns \u2013 except in Scotland \u2013 and areas with significant ethnic minority populations. To win, Labour doesn\u2019t just need to rebuild its red wall. It also needs to win places such as Basingstoke, Hexham, and Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson\u2019s seat), which have never elected a Labour MP, even in 1997. According to the former Labour strategist Greg Cook, who is not one for hyperbole, \u201cthis new electoral landscape is arguably the most formidable Labour has ever faced\u201d. Labour\u2019s second problem \u2013 which relates directly to the shift in electoral geography \u2013 is its political narrative. Here\u2019s where things get more difficult as a direct result of the Corbyn legacy. But, right on cue, a possible guide through these troubled waters has emerged. In his richly nuanced Warring Fictions, the most stimulating book I have read on Labour in ages, party activist Chris Clarke highlights three legacy myths of the Corbyn era\u2019s left populism that Labour needs to overcome. The first, which he dubs the \u201cdark knight\u201d myth, claims that politics is a Manichean struggle between the morally good in-group (in this case the Labour left) and the wicked and selfish centre and right (the Tories and all those who can be tarred with the neoliberal or Tory-lite labels that have become Labour\u2019s curse). This, says Clarke, leads to a destructive exclusivist allure of identity, moral self-regard and complacency. The second, the \u201cpuppetmaster\u201d myth, says everything is ultimately a conspiracy against the public. In this view, the country is run by an elite of (sometimes foreign) magnates, media and deep-state agencies bent on crushing the public into submission to the status quo. As a result, incremental and reformist politics can be dismissed as hopeless. The third, which Clarke calls the \u201cgolden age\u201d myth, is a narrative of decline from an era of supposed virtue \u2013 the postwar Attlee era looms large \u2013 against which later eras are always found wanting. This leads to the favourite Labour trope of leadership betrayal, in which everything is a moral failure by corrupted leaders who should have acted in more virtuous ways, whatever the constraints. There is no room here to go into the details of Clarke\u2019s argument, but they are all familiar from the Corbyn era, as well as from the parlous state of the US Democratic party. Labour\u2019s leadership election matters a lot, but in reality it only matters if Labour makes a break with the recent past. To signal this \u2013 a precondition for winning in Basingstoke as well as Bassetlaw \u2013 the first thing the new leader should do is to unequivocally purge the stain of antisemitism from the party. The corrosive \u201cdark knight\u201d idea that there can be no enemies on the left will need to change from day one. Unity is fine and dandy, but in practice it has to be unity that engages in a principled way with the country as it is, not the mythologised country the Corbyn project would have liked it to be. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 6 and 7 February 2020. The name of Boris Johnson\u2019s seat is Uxbridge and South Ruislip, not Uxbridge as was originally stated. The constituency, which was created in 2010, has never been held by the Labour party, but the former constituency, Uxbridge, did return Labour MPs on several occasions, most recently in 1966. The article was further amended because an earlier version said that no party had ever achieved an increase of 124 seats at one election in modern times. In fact Labour gained more seats than this in the 1997 election. This has been corrected.",

Cllr Nick Forbes, the leader of the Local Government Association (LGA) Labour Group, said there was a \u201chuge sense of anger\u201d among councillors \u2013 collectively the party\u2019s second biggest funder, contributing \u00a32m a year to party coffers \u2013 that they had been sidelined by the national leadership. He accused the party hierarchy of ignoring warnings from grassroots councillors after last year\u2019s disappointing council elections that issues with Corbyn and policy meant the party was failing to cut through to Labour voters on the doorsteps. Forbes told the Guardian a \u201ccentralising, statist\u201d party leadership had repeatedly disregarded local councillors\u2019 experience and everyday connection with ordinary members of the public. \u201cThe party does not really take us seriously or involve us,\u201d he said.

I hope you enjoy today\u2019s briefing.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson would need two full terms as prime minister to fulfil his pledge to \u201clevel up\u201d the British economy in the wake of Brexit, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In a warning before next month\u2019s budget, Britain\u2019s oldest economic thinktank says the government\u2019s plan to raise investment in infrastructure projects by about \u00a320bn a year can have only a modest impact on the UK\u2019s dismal productivity levels. Johnson has pledged to invest in new transport projects and other large public works but NIESR says the positive impact on the economy will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/06/economists-warning-boris-johnson-election-pledge-output\">less than 0.5% of GDP over the long run, compared with an estimated 3-4% cost of Brexit</a>.</p> \n<p>In a blow to the chancellor, NIESR says Sajid Javid will fall short of achieving his growth target of 2.8% per year while his new budget rules will probably be trashed by public spending at the levels promised in the election campaign.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Johnson\u2019s plan will only have modest impact Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray here. I hope you enjoy today\u2019s briefing. Boris Johnson would need two full terms as prime minister to fulfil his pledge to \u201clevel up\u201d the British economy in the wake of Brexit, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In a warning before next month\u2019s budget, Britain\u2019s oldest economic thinktank says the government\u2019s plan to raise investment in infrastructure projects by about \u00a320bn a year can have only a modest impact on the UK\u2019s dismal productivity levels. Johnson has pledged to invest in new transport projects and other large public works but NIESR says the positive impact on the economy will be less than 0.5% of GDP over the long run, compared with an estimated 3-4% cost of Brexit. In a blow to the chancellor, NIESR says Sajid Javid will fall short of achieving his growth target of 2.8% per year while his new budget rules will probably be trashed by public spending at the levels promised in the election campaign. The Bank of England has already warned that Brexit will strike a blow to British productivity as higher trade barriers harm efficiency gains, while growth can only run at 1.1% on average until 2023 without driving up inflation. The number of new homes registered to be built in the UK in 2019 rose to 161,022 \u2013 the highest in 13 years \u2013 but it remains well below the government\u2019s target of 300,000 a year by 2025. * * * Death of screen colossus \u2013 Kirk Douglas, the last great star of Hollywood\u2019s golden age, has died at the age of 103. Michael Douglas announced the news in a statement last night. \u201cTo the world, he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBut to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad, to Catherine, a wonderful father-in-law, to his grandchildren and great grandchild their loving grandfather, and to his wife Anne, a wonderful husband.\u201d Born Issur Danielovitch Demsky to impoverished Russian-Jewish immigrants, Douglas went on as an actor to earn a reputation as a tough customer \u2013 both on screen and off \u2013 known for his rugged handsomeness. His production company, Bryna Productions, developed two of his arguably greatest pictures: Paths of Glory and Spartacus, both directed by Stanley Kubrick. Revisit some of his career in clips. * * * Trump survives on party lines \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s entirely expected acquittal was nonetheless a moment of gravity, whatever his claims of exoneration, David Smith writes. Mitt Romney, the onetime presidential candidate, proved the only Republican in the Senate (which they control) to vote for the president\u2019s dismissal, explaining: \u201cCorrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one\u2019s oath of office that I can imagine.\u201d Nancy Pelosi emphasised that while not removed, Trump would remain \u201cimpeached forever\u201d. Smith, our bureau chief in DC, notes that Trump\u2019s latest Gallup poll approval rating stands at 49% \u2013 the highest since he took office and better than Bill Clinton or Barack Obama at this stage in their re-election years: \u201cSomehow he is becoming stronger rather than weaker.\u201d * * * \u2018Scourge on us all\u2019 \u2013 A record number of 1,805 antisemitic incidents were logged in the UK in 2019, the fourth year in a row figures have hit an all-time high, according to monitoring group the Community Security Trust (CST).

      "bodyText": "Though Jared Kushner was a \u201clead point of contact\u201d for US allies worried about Donald Trump\u2019s threats to Nato, the president\u2019s son-in-law did not \u201cseem to know what Nato actually did\u201d, a new book claims. Kushner even appeared to be ignorant of article 5, the treaty clause which stipulates that an attack on one member is an attack on all. The claim is contained in Sinking in the Swamp: How Trump\u2019s Minions and Misfits Poisoned Washington, by Lachlan Markay and Asawin Suebsaeng, two reporters for the Daily Beast. The Guardian obtained a copy of the book, which has been excerpted elsewhere and will be published on 11 February. Markay and Suebsaeng write that Kushner\u2019s ignorance of the founding principles of Nato was exposed in May 2017, as Trump was about to travel to Nato headquarters in Brussels to address allies worried by his attacks on the organization and claims that other countries were not paying their way. In the days before the trip, the authors write, Kushner convened a background briefing at the White House with journalists from mainstream media outlets \u2013 not including the Beast. As the president\u2019s senior adviser \u201cwent deeper and deeper into discussing the intricacies of Nato and what his father-in-law\u2019s administration meant\u201d for it, they write, \u201csenior officials in the room started wondering what the hell \u2026 [he] was talking about\u201d. \u201cIt was a word salad reminiscent of the president\u2019s own rambling when it came to issues and minutiae with which he couldn\u2019t be bothered.\u201d Markay and Suebsaeng report that the then National Security Council spokesman, Michael Anton, followed Kushner out of the room and \u201crespectfully asked\u201d about his \u201cmuddled\u201d presentation to the journalists, bringing up article 5. \u201cOh, article 5,\u201d the authors say Kushner replied. \u201cWhat\u2019s that again?\u201d Markay and Suebsaeng\u2019s picture of White House dysfunction under Trump and senior advisers such as Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump is familiar from everyday reporting and a number of bestselling books. In the trip following the scene reported in Sinking in the Swamp, Trump duly used his official remarks in Brussels to harangue Nato leaders. \u201cI have been very, very direct with Secretary [Jens] Stoltenberg and members of the alliance,\u201d he said, \u201cin saying that Nato members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations, for 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they\u2019re supposed to be paying for their defense. \u201cThis is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States. And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years.\u201d In December, before a summit in London to mark Nato\u2019s 70th anniversary, the US announced it was cutting its own contribution to joint Nato projects to an equivalence of that of Germany. Trump has claimed credit for increased spending by Nato allies. Experts counter that the increase in member nations contributing at least 2% of GDP to defence spending was planned, as a response to Russian aggression. Trump cut his attendance at the London summit short, after other leaders were recorded apparently mocking him. According to NBC News, a month before that the former national security adviser John Bolton warned a private audience Trump could \u201cgo full isolationist\u201d if he wins re-election this year. In December, speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, one European diplomat said: \u201cThe greatest fear is what he would do in a second term. He would be more free from constraints. It is impossible to predict.\u201d In January, the New York Times reported that Trump has privately said he would like to withdraw the US from Nato altogether, a move Congress has sought to preclude.",

between <strong>Tim Watts</strong> and <strong>Tony Smith</strong> on the <strong>Christopher Pyne</strong> \u2018joke\u2019.</p> <p><strong>Watts:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. I refer to recent comments made by the former minister for defence, Christopher Pyne, in conversation with the former secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, <strong>Martin Parkinson</strong>, on the 20 January 2020 episode of the <em>Pyne Time</em> podcast. In the conversation, Mr Pyne commented on the malicious intrusion into the Australian Parliament House computer network, discovered in early 2019, stating that he and Mr Parkinson knew \u2018how much worse it all was\u2019 and that they \u2018could never talk about it\u2019. </p> <p>Putting aside the extraordinary indiscretion of a former minister for defence making comments of this kind, I refer to your statement to the House on 12 February 2019 about the extent of this attack. </p> <p>I know that you appreciate the seriousness of public confidence in this institution and I acknowledge and thank you for your written response to my correspondence with you on this matter. I ask whether for the benefit of the House you could share your response to Mr Pyne\u2019s comments.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Smith:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I first thank the member for Gellibrand for bringing the matter to my attention in writing. I have replied, as he said, outlining \u2013 in fact, I\u2019ve replied jointly with the president of the Senate. I think it is important that I do, given these comments have been made, make a statement to the House, which I\u2019ll do now.</p> <p>I\u2019m only aware of the comments thanks to the member for Gellibrand, but I\u2019ll just say this: following discovery of the cybersecurity incident in January of last year, as members would be aware, the president and I, as we have said, received detailed briefings from the Australian Signals Directorate and the Department of Parliamentary Services. Communication and management of the incidents was guided by the information available to us as presiding officers in the context of the parliamentary computing network. Of course, as we pointed out, our statements balanced the need for transparency with discretion on matters of national security. But any inference that our statements to the parliament on this issue were inaccurate or misleading as to the seriousness of the situation is false. I stand by the statements made by the president of the Senate and myself.</p> <p>I finally say the podcast also refers to a cyberintrusion at the Australian National University, which is in the transcript that you kindly forwarded to me. So perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be inferred that the comments necessarily relate to the parliamentary network. </p> <p>The important point is that the president and I have no further information or knowledge as to what Mr Pyne meant with his comments, and I thank the member for Gellibrand again.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T06:25:50.500Z\">at 6.25am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3ba8588f086a28115a6865\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T05:47:15.764Z\">5.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Senator <strong>Jacqui Lambie </strong>has been asked on ABC Afternoon Briefing about her proposed amendments to the union penalty bill.<br></p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/04/jacqui-lambie-wants-deal-on-union-busting-bill-as-soon-as-possible\">Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday</a>, Lambie is trying to strike a deal with the government \u201cas soon as possible\u201d on the bill, which lowers the threshold for deregistering unions or disqualifying their officials.</p> <p>Lambie replied: \u201c<em>We are still talking through those amendments ... <strong>The hold-up is when it comes to, there\u2019s a points system, on whether or not it\u2019s constitutional</strong>, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing at the moment.

I\u2019ve been a senator for nine years and have the deepest respect for this chamber of parliament, which is so important to our democracy.

      "bodyText": "With both chambers adjourning, I too am going to adjourn the blog. We have another week of sittings to get through though, before we can rest our weary heads. Plus estimates is coming up. So prepare yourself. It is committee day tomorrow, so make sure you check in with the Guardian to see what is happening across the day, as well as all the other news which happens outside this place. A very, very big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp for their never-ending help today, which is also extended to the rest of the Guardian brains trust. You might not get to know all their names, but it is a small but mighty team who keep this blog ticking over and from the moderators to the subs, to the editors, we could not do it without them. I hope you manage to have some switch-off time between now and Monday morning. I\u2019ll be back on the news beat in the meantime, but will be back with you in blog capacity just before 8am when parliament resumes. Have a wonderful weekend. And take care of you. And now the House is adjourned. From Mike Bowers\u2019 lens to your eyeballs: When you start with the man in the mirror and ask him to change his ways. The Senate is on to its adjournment debate. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go There\u2019s a heart (there\u2019s a heart), a hand to hold onto. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go There\u2019s a place, of Somebody who needs you Everywhere you look. Further to my earlier post on Jacqui Lambie: A spokesman for the attorney general, Christian Porter, said: \u201cThere are no constitutional issues with the points system and the government is continuing direct discussions with the crossbench including Senator Lambie.\u201d Here is the whole exchange between Tim Watts and Tony Smith on the Christopher Pyne \u2018joke\u2019. Watts: I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. I refer to recent comments made by the former minister for defence, Christopher Pyne, in conversation with the former secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson, on the 20 January 2020 episode of the Pyne Time podcast. In the conversation, Mr Pyne commented on the malicious intrusion into the Australian Parliament House computer network, discovered in early 2019, stating that he and Mr Parkinson knew \u2018how much worse it all was\u2019 and that they \u2018could never talk about it\u2019. Putting aside the extraordinary indiscretion of a former minister for defence making comments of this kind, I refer to your statement to the House on 12 February 2019 about the extent of this attack. I know that you appreciate the seriousness of public confidence in this institution and I acknowledge and thank you for your written response to my correspondence with you on this matter. I ask whether for the benefit of the House you could share your response to Mr Pyne\u2019s comments. Smith: I first thank the member for Gellibrand for bringing the matter to my attention in writing. I have replied, as he said, outlining \u2013 in fact, I\u2019ve replied jointly with the president of the Senate. I think it is important that I do, given these comments have been made, make a statement to the House, which I\u2019ll do now. I\u2019m only aware of the comments thanks to the member for Gellibrand, but I\u2019ll just say this: following discovery of the cybersecurity incident in January of last year, as members would be aware, the president and I, as we have said, received detailed briefings from the Australian Signals Directorate and the Department of Parliamentary Services. Communication and management of the incidents was guided by the information available to us as presiding officers in the context of the parliamentary computing network. Of course, as we pointed out, our statements balanced the need for transparency with discretion on matters of national security. But any inference that our statements to the parliament on this issue were inaccurate or misleading as to the seriousness of the situation is false. I stand by the statements made by the president of the Senate and myself. I finally say the podcast also refers to a cyberintrusion at the Australian National University, which is in the transcript that you kindly forwarded to me. So perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be inferred that the comments necessarily relate to the parliamentary network. The important point is that the president and I have no further information or knowledge as to what Mr Pyne meant with his comments, and I thank the member for Gellibrand again. Senator Jacqui Lambie has been asked on ABC Afternoon Briefing about her proposed amendments to the union penalty bill. As Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday, Lambie is trying to strike a deal with the government \u201cas soon as possible\u201d on the bill, which lowers the threshold for deregistering unions or disqualifying their officials. Lambie replied: \u201cWe are still talking through those amendments ... The hold-up is when it comes to, there\u2019s a points system, on whether or not it\u2019s constitutional, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing at the moment. I do believe that the other amendments are sitting there, there\u2019s just a couple of other issues and one of them is the points system. That could be a little bit constitutional. So do we work it around so we still get the same result and the same outcome and we\u2019re just trying to tie that in now\u201d. That\u2019s a very interesting answer. The points system was introduced by Centre Alliance amendments as a sort-of three strikes policy to prevent disqualification of union officials for minor offences. The government accepted the amendments in a bid to pass the bill. It\u2019s possible Lambie has blown the whistle on a problem not just with her proposed amendments but the scheme of the bill put to the Senate and defeated in November. I\u2019ve asked the attorney general, Christian Porter, to clarify. OK, it took some transcription time, but we got there. At the end of question time, Tim Watts raised an issue with Tony Smith, asking about comments the former minister Christopher Pyne made in his podcast with the former Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary Martin Parkinson. Pyne and Parkinson were talking about the breach of the parliamentary network last year on the podcast, which led to this exchange: Parkinson: I\u2019m amazed, actually, at how little concern is expressed by the public when these breaches occur. Pyne: Everyone almost factors it in, don\u2019t they? Parkinson: Yeah. Pyne: They think \u201coh well\u201d. Parkinson: Look at ANU, at what\u2019s happened. I\u2019m not blaming ANU but just saying we should be appalled by this. Look at what happened at Parliament House. We should be appalled. Pyne: You and I know how much worse it all was, which we could never talk about (laughs). Parkinson: No (laughs). Watts asked Smith whether this is something Pyne should be joking about, and whether he had gone past his boundaries by hinting there was more to what the public was told about the breach. Smith said he was unaware of what Pyne was talking about: Communication and management of the incident was guided by the information available to us as presiding officers in the context of the parliamentary computing network,\u201d Smith said. Of course, as we pointed out, our statements balanced the need for transparency with discretion on matters of national security. But any inference that our statements to the parliament to this issue were inaccurate or misleading as to the seriousness of the situation is false. I stand by the statements made by the president of the Senate and myself. I would just finally say the podcast also refers to a cyber intrusion at the Australian National University. ... So perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be inferred that the comments necessarily relate to the parliamentary network. The important point is the president and I have no further information or knowledge as to what Mr Pyne meant.\u201d Asked about the AFP decision not to investigate Angus Taylor, Anthony Albanese says: Well, Scott Morrison could ask Angus Taylor tomorrow what happened. How did this occur? That\u2019s what he should do. You shouldn\u2019t need outside organisations. A PM who actually cared about integrity would have dealt with this. The PM quite clearly doesn\u2019t care about integrity. And I make this point as well \u2013 and I\u2019ll conclude with this \u2013 Australia needs a national integrity commission. We need one with real power to make independent investigations. The fact is that faith in our politics is at an all-time low. It\u2019s at an all-time low because of the sports rorts saga that we can see. ... Angus Taylor of course has been involved in a Watergate scandal, he\u2019s been involved in the issue around Jam Land and his declarations to the parliament. He\u2019s been involved in this document where we still don\u2019t know where it came from. We know it was given from his office to the Daily Telegraph. Where did it come from? They can\u2019t just say we don\u2019t know because quite clearly someone does know. We know it didn\u2019t come from the City of Sydney because the police in their investigation went to the City of Sydney and went through their data. Now why the data of minister Taylor\u2019s office wasn\u2019t gone through is a question for others to answer. Anthony Albanese: ... If you look at Stuart Robert\u2019s answer today to my question in parliament, it is clear he knows they will have to pay money back. It was clearly implied. And I will make two points in addition to the point that Bill has been making, and I praise Bill for what he has done in pursuing this issue. The fact is, every single person who came to my electoral office seeking assistance either got their debt reduced to zero or got it reduced substantially. Without exception. The truth is the most vulnerable people in our society don\u2019t go to their local MP\u2019s office. People from non-English-speaking backgrounds, in some cultures if you get a demand letter from the government, you rush and you pay that money even if you don\u2019t have it \u2013 you borrow it from a relative. That is what has gone on here. Bill Shorten: [Scott Morrison] was the treasurer when they invented robodebt. No doubt his fingerprints will be all over it. The point about it is they want to pretend they are making a surplus. They will string out vulnerable people. This is a government who basically had no authority to send vulnerable people on safety net payments, they just assume that people would pay up. ... This is a mass act of unjust enrichment by the government. It is theft of people\u2019s money \u2013 the government has abused its power. ... How may times of this government after getting caught breaking the rules before it simply says they got it wrong. Bill Shorten: The federal government has been illegally and unjustly enriching itself with the government adding money back. They don\u2019t have the power to do it. The fact they are still running a legal action when their own public servants have already privately said it is not legal. This is a waste of money. The interest bill is ticking over because if you owe someone money that you have taken, you owe them the interest on that lost income. They are paying lawyers to fight it, they shouldn\u2019t have taken the taxpayers\u2019 money and they are spending more taxpayer money ... ... the commonwealth has been pretending that it is allowed to take money by issuing these notices. It is not! If I sent you an email demanding money, and you pay me, that is illegal. Anthony Albanese throws to Bill Shorten: Due to the persistent efforts of Labor, a document was put up on the Senate website, which goes to the heart of the robodebt scandal: 700,000 Australians received robodebt notices over the last four years. The government has taken $1.5bn off Australians back to the coffers for themselves. Labor has campaigned against the robodebt, it\u2019s been unfair. Mothers report their children have taken their lives, adult children, because of the pressure of these robodebt notices. But today a document has been released which the government did not want people to see, they resisted that. What it reveals is that the chief legal officer of the tax commission has told the tax commissioner that he\u2019s been told by the government, the department of social security, that there is no valid legal basis for the commonwealth to issue these debt notices. Or to put it in plain English, the government has been illegally, unjustly enriching itself, ripping off hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable Australians. Today in response to Anthony\u2019s question, minister Stuart Robert said, we have justified it. No minister, you have been illegally taking money from Australians for four years. Now the government needs to answer the following questions. When did they find out the scheme was illegal? Why didn\u2019t they find out the scheme was illegal? Furthermore, how many people will be repaid? How much money will be repaid? Why are they wasting taxpayer money fighting legal class actions, when their own ... documents reveal the government has been running a legal ponzi scheme, ripping off hundreds of thousands of its own people with no legal authority. Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten are holding their second press conference together since the election, on robodebt \u2013 asking when the government knew it was illegal. Albanese: Today in question time we started by asking about the correspondence that came from the Australian Taxation Office that we know, as a result of Senate questions on notice that were delivered today, that months ago the government was advised that the robodebt scheme was in fact illegal. Even after being presented with that, what the government did today was consistent with what it does on everything. They couldn\u2019t confess, they said it was just an adjustment. They couldn\u2019t say they got it wrong. The fact is, given the ATO advice, the government will have a very significant liability indeed. Because people were put under enormous pressure getting bills we now know were not only unfair and just wrong but also illegal at the time. Christian Porter: ... Now it has been previously noted that meritless political referrals to key law enforcement agencies waste resources that could be allocated to the investigation of serious matters such as homicides, terrorism offences, drug offences, offences against children, and the NSW police commissioner said they are a great diverter of my time. It has also been previously noted that the shadow attorney general has either made or oversighted from Labor eight meritless political referrals, with zero charges laid, referred, pursued. Zero. And so now, the information before House is that the strike rate is now zero from 10. Not zero from nine, because the shadow attorney general first referred it ... to NSW police under NSW law, they said nothing, then it went to the AFP, two more strikes. Zero from 10. I noted previously, to try and find some context to put to this, the most Test cricket ducks in Test cricket history was from a poor person, Ajit Agarkar, who had five in a row (shared by Australia\u2019s Bob Holland). I can now inform the House that the record in all first-class cricket innings without scoring a run was set in 1930 by an English cricketer, Seymour Clark, nine innings, zero runs, he has now been beat. Zero from 10. If the shadow AG was a cricket player, he would be the worst first-class batsman in cricket history. In fact, I have been into deep ministerial discussions with the minister of health, to see if we can provide the shadow AG with a referral pad, so he can just save time with his referrals, just by writing the name, and the offence, and sending it off to the police. Perhaps now you might ask yourself, do you regret, do you apologise? Brendan O\u2019Connor is making a personal explanation on being \u201cmisrepresented\u201d after his photo was used in multiple News Corp outlets in place of Michael McCormack. Which it was. Because after two years, apparently even newsrooms can\u2019t identify who the deputy prime minister is. It\u2019s hard being sourdough. The attorney general calls on Labor to apologise to Angus Taylor. Cue the prime minister: \u201cAnd on that note, I ask for all other questions to be tabled.\u201d Christian Porter says Labor now has a strike rate of \u201czero from 10\u201d in \u201cmeritless\u201d referrals to police We get one more dixer \u2013 on Angus Taylor not being investigated by the AFP. The motion to suspend standing orders fails, and the MPs return to their normal seats. \u201cArrogance and cowardice is what characterises this man,\u201d says Richard Marles, pointing to an indifferent prime minister, before he too is shut down. Tony Burke gets in \u201cwe saw the prime minister\u2019s true character on display \u2013 stubborn, all about marketing\u201d before he is shut down by Christian Porter. The bells ring again. Joel Fitzgibbon has welcomed David Littleproud\u2019s return to the agriculture portfolio: I congratulate both David Littleproud and Keith Pitt on their ministerial appointments. It was a mistake to remove David Littleproud from the agriculture portfolio and Labor welcomes his re-appointment. David Littleproud was denied the portfolio following the 2019 election because he diverged too far from the National party playbook and its failed populism and pork-barrelling guidance. His challenge this time will be to take the prime minister and his colleagues with him on a reform journey to turn around the flat-lining productivity and poor profitability in the food and fibre sector. The Morrison government has no national plan for the agriculture sector and no coherent national plan for the ongoing drought. Despite some welcome rain, the drought is very much still with us. David Littleproud\u2019s first act should be to stop cutting farming families off Farm Household Allowance. Labor will work with David Littleproud on any reform agenda in pursuit of sustainable profitability in the agriculture sector. The government can\u2019t keep claiming the National Farmers Federation\u2019s plan as its own. In the face of challenges from drought, bushfires, biosecurity threats, trade wars and the coronavirus, the sector deserves better. There are some rumblings from government backbenchers to just let Labor have one of these debates and get it over and done with, because Labor has been responding to the shut down of the motions by calling a quorum every chance it gets. Because of that, government MPs are having their speeches interrupted \u2013 they also can\u2019t do their work, because they keep getting called back into the chamber. These aren\u2019t things that impact Scott Morrison, because he doesn\u2019t make those speeches, and he doesn\u2019t have to form the quorum. But it is annoying the backbench, who have been doing this for a while now and are a bit sick of it. Still, rules are rules and Labor can call for a quorum if there aren\u2019t enough government MPs in the chamber. And Labor\u2019s tactics are honed through decades of factional wars within its own conferences and branches \u2013 it is better at this sort of political warfare, because it is a natural part of its own brand of politcs. And there is more chance that a Hemsworth will suddenly take notice of me than Morrison allows one of these debates to go forward. Christian Porter moves that Anthony Albanese no longer be heard. The division bells ring for four minutes. You know where this is going. The motion: That the House, one, notes: a) The prime minister is incapable of expressing regret and admitting when he is wrong. b) The prime minister blames others and attempts to cover up his failings with false or misleading claims including but in no way limited to: 1. The prime minister\u2019s claim the response to the national bushfire crisis was a matter for the states and territories. 2. The prime minister\u2019s claim volunteer firefighters didn\u2019t need economic compensation because they wanted to be there. 3. The prime minister\u2019s statement that he didn\u2019t hold a hose when Australians were looking to him for national leadership in an unprecedented bushfire crisis. 4. The prime minister\u2019s claim he had a conversation with a bushfire survivor who had lost everything, when he instead forced her to shake his hand only to turn his back when she asked for help, and c) The prime minister can\u2019t learn from his mistakes if he never admits them, and Two, therefore calls on the prime minister to put the national interest ahead of his political interest, Labor is now moving to suspend standing orders with its latest \u201cthe prime minister is terrible\u201d motion. Scott Morrison, who actually appears under pressure with these questions, but still hasn\u2019t actually expressed regret, continued that answer: Mr Speaker, I do not \u2013 I do not regret establishing the national bushfire recovery agency within days. And putting $2bn into the national bushfire recovery agency. Mr Speaker, I don\u2019t regret pulling together the peak groups of all the organisations from Indigenous organisations to charitable groups to tourism industry bodies to small business bodies, to those looking after wildlife and getting them together and putting the plan in place, that is now in full operation, that is out there supporting local communities. And I don\u2019t regret that I did not take the actions that those opposite now seek to be doing in seeking to politicise a bushfire crisis, as they sought to do all summer. As they sought to do all summer, Mr Speaker, as we sought to communicate how we were helping Australians. As we reached out to Australians, as we coordinated our response, as we got that response out ... boots on the ground. All the leader of the opposition could do was seek political opportunities for himself and his colleagues. Mr Speaker, our government is responding to the crisis of the bushfires. Our government responded to the crisis of the north Queensland floods. Our government is responding and delivering on the response to the devastating drought that is being faced by the Australian people. Our government is responding to the virus that threatens the world today, and we are ensuring that to date our measures have been effective at protecting Australian people not just here in this country but overseas. The leader of the opposition is consumed by his political ambition. He is consumed by his political vanity and he has displayed a lack of character in this House today which only confirms what I expect: the each-way attitude he has to everything will be confirmed more and more in the eyes of the Australian people. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Why does the prime minister refuse to express any regret for saying the national bushfire crisis was a matter for the states, forcing a handshake on a bushfire survivor only to turn his back when she asked for help, claiming volunteer firefighters didn\u2019t need compensation because they wanted ... and launching a political ad on a catastrophic fire day? Why can\u2019t the prime minister admit that he ever got anything wrong? Morrison: No member of this House is perfect, Mr Speaker. Not me, not the leader of the opposition. And where there are things that need to be improved, and over the summer where I could have responded to events in different ways, I have already made those comments public because I will always seek to do my best each and every day for the people of Australia. But I tell you what I don\u2019t regret ... I don\u2019t regret when I returned to Australia \u2013 with my family ultimately, who followed me \u2013 I don\u2019t regret the fact that we put in place the single biggest call-out of our reservists to go to the aid of Australians who are fighting this bushfire crisis. Josh Frydneberg continues to use old auditor general reports to attack Labor, in some sort of tactic to explain why the sports grants auditor general\u2019s report into its scheme isn\u2019t so bad. Or something. I am not sure how highlighting all the times the auditor general has said \u201cthis is dodgy\u201d makes what is still happening any less smelly. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret telling communities devastated by the bushfires that the economic impact \u201ccould well prove to be positive\u201d? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I\u2019d be happy for the member to relay to me outside of this place or to send to my office what he\u2019s actually referring to. But what I can say to the House is this: that, Mr Speaker, once we work through the recovery arrangements across all the bushfire-affected areas, once we get past the devastation that has impacted all of these bushfire-affected areas, there will be a recovery. There will be a rebuilding. There will be significant economic activity going into these areas to rebuild these communities, and that will support their economies when that occurs. This is a similar observation, Mr Speaker, that has been relayed to us by the treasury. That once you go through the process of rebuilding and recovery, that is what can support those economies getting back on to their feet. Those are the remarks I have made. Once again I suspect that the Labor party is seeking to be grubby on bushfires. I don\u2019t remember those comments Labor is referring to, and I can\u2019t find them, so can\u2019t help you with that one, sorry. And here is the relevant part of the transcript at the time: Journalist: Do you think volunteer firefighters \u2013 should we be looking at starting to pay them? Prime minister: Well, we have a volunteer firefighting force across the country which numbers in the, you know, the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. And that also includes those who come in from other jurisdictions. It is a standing volunteer force. And these are matters that are considered from time to time, but this is why I am so appreciative of the commitment made by employers to support that volunteer effort. The volunteer effort is a big part of our natural disaster response and it is a big part of how Australia has always dealt with these issues. We are constantly looking at ways to better facilitate the volunteer effort, but to professionalise that at that scale is not a matter that has previously been accepted and it\u2019s not a matter that is currently under consideration by the government. But as is the case with all fire events, or as is the case with all flood events and other natural disasters, this actual nationally coordinated effort is designed to constantly look at those issues, post these events. And the recommendations come forward from the chiefs, those directly responsible for fighting these fires and coordinating resources. And you\u2019re right, these fires have been going on for some months now and when I was speaking with the commissioner on the weekend out at Wilberforce, where we have the megafire in the north-west at the moment, we were talking through the crew rotations. And the fact is these crews, yes, they\u2019re tired, but they also want to be out there defending their communities. And so we do all we can to rotate their shifts to give them those breaks, but equally, they \u2013 and in many cases \u2013 you\u2019ve got to hold them back to make sure they get that rest. And I thank them all for what they\u2019re doing, particularly all those who support them. Mark Butler and Mark Dreyfus have responded to the news that the Australian federal police will not be investigating Angus Taylor: Serious questions remain unanswered over Angus Taylor and his doctored documents scandal. Two police investigations have now failed to clarify where Angus Taylor got his dodgy figures from. Angus Taylor assured parliament that this fabricated report was \u2018directly downloaded\u2019 from the City of Sydney council website. We know this is not true, as a law enforcement official confirmed: \u201cThe document had to have been doctored from Canberra.\u201d The public internet archives, the Trove database maintained by the National Library, confirmed that the correct version of the report was on the internet all through 2019. We know the Department of Energy\u2019s draft letter provided to the minister\u2019s office contained no reference to the City of Sydney\u2019s travel expenditure. If Angus Taylor continues to refuse to come clean, then the prime minister must order a proper, independent and transparent investigation into his minister and commit to making the findings public. But it is done. And a reminder that NSW Liberal minister Andrew Constance \u2013 who fought, alongside his neighbours, to save his house in that electorate, and was out there every single day (and was so involved that for a brief period was put on a list for unaccounted people) \u2013 had a different take to Scott Morrison of that visit: \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t even know he was coming and I haven\u2019t had a call from him,\u201d Constance told the Seven network. So to be honest with you, the locals probably gave him the welcome that he probably deserved. I\u2019d say this to the prime minister today: the nation wants you to open up the cheque books, help people rebuild their lives. I know this is tough and I know I\u2019m on his side of politics, but you know, Gladys [Berejiklian, the NSW premier] and [the RFS commissioner] Shane Fitzsimmons came here two days ago and they obviously visited the fire-affected part of my electorate in the north. Glad\u2019s he going to come back, but this is the feeling that people are going through.\u201d Terri Butler to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret saying he had a conversation with a bushfire survivor who lost her home in Cobargo, when video clearly shows there wasn\u2019t a conversation? He forced her to shake his hand and then turned his back on her as she asked for help. Morrison: I thank the member for her question about my visit to Cobargo with my wife Jenny on that occasion. I\u2019d just been through fire response centre and been elsewhere. Fire had raged through Cobargo days before. I was the first member of parliament to visit Cobargo after those fires. I went there because I knew the community needed to know that the government would be there and, Mr Speaker, that I was prepared to hear from them. And to be there, as I had spoken to many people, including Mark, who was the captain of the Rural Fire Service brigade there, and the many others I met at the Rural Fire Service brigade, and I went up to the showgrounds and there were some people who were very pleased that I was there, and I discussed the impact of the fires on them. And there were others who were very distraught. They were very upset. I was there and they were able to vent their frustration and their anger directly at me. When you\u2019re prime minister, you turn up and you listen and whatever comes at you ... you\u2019re prepared to do. That the lady you referred to raised with me funding levels for the NSW fire service, that\u2019s the issue that they raised with me. The leader of the oppposition will remember back when he was on the mid-coast, I think it was further north, people heckled him at a press conference and yelled out at him. Now, you will not find me criticising him for being in a fire zone and being subject to those sorts of things. I don\u2019t think that helps. For the opposition to be engaging in this sort of low-rank behaviour, it doesn\u2019t help anybody recovering from the fires. All I know is I was in Cobargo ... I was there for the people of Cobargo, and I\u2019ll be there for the people of Cobargo into the future as well, and they know it. And here is when he said he didn\u2019t hold a hose, on December 20: I mean, I took leave in June as well and we did follow exactly the same practice. So I mean, we don\u2019t always say where we\u2019re going. My privacy with my family when we\u2019re having leave, I\u2019m sure people understand, that\u2019s something that I know Australians would respect. But I think on this occasion, John, because there have been such horrendous events that have understandably caused a lot of anxiety, I deeply regret that and so does Jenny, and to all those who were affected by the fires especially, we deeply regret it. And I\u2019ll be getting back there as soon as I can. The girls and Jen will stay on and stay out the rest of the time we had booked here. But I know Australians understand this and they\u2019ll be pleased I\u2019m coming back, I\u2019m sure. They know that, you know, I don\u2019t hold a hose, mate, and I don\u2019t sit in a control room. That\u2019s the brave people who do that are doing that job. But I know that Australians would want me back at this time out of these fatalities, so I\u2019ll happily come back and do that. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret saying, and I quote, \u201cI don\u2019t hold a hose, mate\u201d when Australians were looking to him for national leadership? Morrison: I was simply making the point that the operational response that was going on at that time was being handled excellently by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. And I stand by those comments, Mr Speaker, that I support the amazing efforts of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, which only a few days ago were in here, and I commend them here again today. Each and every day we\u2019ve been working closely with that service, as we have with the firefighting service, CFA in Queensland and South Australia. I note today, as they did yesterday, those opposite sought to politicise the bushfires over summer and they continue to do it now. Here is the story on that at the time: Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret saying that volunteer firefighters don\u2019t need economic compensation for lost income because they \u201cwant to be out there\u201d? Morrison: And once again the leader of the opposition is misrepresenting what occurred for political purposes. For political purposes, as he always does, Mr Speaker. There is no issue that the leader of the opposition will not seek to exploit for personal, political gain. And this is just another example. Another example of his lack of character. Now, Mr Speaker, what he suggested, Mr Speaker, was not what I outlined when those remarks were made. Mr Speaker, what was raised in the press conference I was at was in relation to \u2013 for the first time when the suggestion was made that there may be some ... that there may be raised by the journalists about whether, Mr Speaker, we would be considering ... It was being raised with me as to whether the commonwealth would be providing compensation for the rural and regional affairs and transport references committee \u2013 Rural Fire Service volunteers. That is not a matter that is normally dealt with by the federal government. It is a matter that is traditionally dealt with by the Rural Fire Services, Mr Speaker. On that occasion, I was reflecting comments made back to me when I had advised with Rural Fire Service\u2019s members, and they had put it to me when they were out there they wanted to be out there protecting their communities. That\u2019s what I was talking about. They know that they would prefer not to have fires. They know that they would prefer to be at home with their families and their communities. What I was saying is that duty called, they wanted to answer that call to duty, because that\u2019s what our volunteers do. Michael McCormack just gave an update on the coronavirus and I have never wished to be on a cruise ship more. The UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has met with Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, with the pair holding a brief media conference ahead of question time. It is the first overseas visit for the UK foreign secretary since Brexit was finalised six days ago. Raab faced questions about the Australian government\u2019s record on climate change and the UK\u2019s ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 \u2013 a position it will be advocating in the lead up to the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow later this year. Raab said he had a \u201cgood, constructive\u201d conversation with Payne about the UK\u2019s goal and Australia\u2019s position. \u201cWe want to lead in producing a step change in the international response, the global response to this challenge of our times,\u201d he said. When he was asked about Australia\u2019s policy record on climate change, which was \u201cpolitically contentious\u201d in the wake of the summer bushfire crisis, Raab said the UK\u2019s approach was to \u201ctry to make a success\u201d of COP26. \u201cWe are also going to talk to all the countries about their contributions in getting their emissions down.\u201d Payne said that in the lead up to COP26, the Australian government would be looking at what \u201cpractical climate action we can take together\u201d. On the British government\u2019s decision to allow the Chinese tech giant Huawei a substantial role in supplying the country\u2019s 5G network \u2013 at odds with Australia\u2019s decision \u2013 Raab suggested there had been a \u201cmarket failure\u201d that had contributed to the decision. However, he said there was nothing in the agreement that would inhibit intelligence sharing among Five Eyes partners. On 20 December 2019 the AFP received a referral from NSW police regarding allegations of falsifying documents from the office of the lord mayor of Sydney by the office of the minister for energy and emissions reduction. Following inquiries undertaken and information provided by NSW police, the AFP has determined it is unlikely further investigation will result in obtaining sufficient evidence to substantiate a commonwealth offence. The AFP assessment of this matter identified there is no evidence to indicate the minister for energy and emissions reduction was involved in falsifying information. The low level of harm and the apology made by the minister for energy and emissions reduction to the lord mayor of Sydney, along with the significant level of resources required to investigate, were also factored into the decision not to pursue this matter. The AFP now considers this matter finalised. Vincent Connelly, who continues to treat question time dixers like it\u2019s an audition for the unauthorised Perth society of over-actors, asks Josh Frydenberg to turn the auditor general\u2019s report into the sports grants affair into Labor\u2019s fault, and the treasurer joins in on the chewing the scenery theme: As those opposite will be aware, this is not the only report of the auditor general that\u2019s made some interesting observations. I\u2019m reminded that there was an ANAO report number 3, 10-11, into a $550m infrastructure program, which said on page 38, and I quote: \u2018Ministers made an explicit decision to approve an application that was known to be otherwise ineligible under the guidelines.\u2019 And also went on to say: \u2018The equitable situation of all applicants was not evidence in the processes employed.\u2019 So, Mr Speaker, who are the beneficiaries of this process? Well, the auditor general went on to say on page 48, and I quote: \u2018The awarding of funding to projects disproportionately favoured ALP seats.\u2019 In fact, the auditor general found, when it came to funding, ALP electorates had a success rate almost three times the coalition, Mr Speaker. Who was the responsible minister overshowing this $550m grant program? None other than the member for Grayndler, Mr Speaker! Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor. Dude \u2013 that was a decade ago. Scott Morrison jumps up to add to his answer to Mike Kelly: I\u2018m sure the member for Eden-Monaro would like to know that the NSW government opened their program, which is funded by the federal government in relation to small business recovery, on 2 February 2020; 109 expressions of interest have been received before the program opened, 68 applications have been received, with an average amount requested of $30,981 per grant. And for the information of other members, the Victorian program has not yet opened. It\u2019s expected to open this week. These programs are run by the state governments, funded by the federal government; 114 expressions of interest have been received by 5 February. For South Australia, that opened on 30 January 2020, with 14 grants totalling $329,435 paid so far. And they have approved a further five grants. In Queensland there have been nil small business impact, with no grants program in place from at this point. The NSW loans opened on 3 February 2020, just a few days ago. That is also run by the NSW government. Queensland concessional loans opened on 3 February also, and guidelines are now being considered by South Australia and Victoria. I hope that information is helpful. Cool beans. The AFP still hasn\u2019t got back to anyone, but Anne Davies has confirmed the Sky News story with Taylor\u2019s office. No investigation. David Littleproud likes Rebekha Sharkie\u2019s mum\u2019s mulberry jam: \u201cBest I have ever tasted.\u201d Mike Kelly to Scott Morrison: The Long Stock Brewery in my community this time of year would be paying 24 to 30 casual shifts a week. Because of the bushfires they\u2019re currently paying four. Loss of wages for casual and permanent staff is hurting my community. They\u2019re losing jobs, they\u2019re leaving the region, and the government, they tell me, is not providing any help. Why is it that after they were promised bushfire-affected businesses immediate relief that they are still unable to access that help? Morrison says he\u2019ll get Stuart Robert to add to the answer, but then takes up all the time and just answers it himself: Now, when it comes to small businesses, as the member would be aware, there are qualifying criteria for businesses that have been directly impacted by those fires which is the same criteria that applies to small businesses that are affected by the floods up in north Queensland that occurred at this time last year. They apply the same criteria to those affected businesses in the bushfire-affected zones today. That is important because we will provide the same support that was provided to those in devastating disasters as to this disaster as well. ... But if the member is suggesting that the disaster recovery arrangements should change that, the taxpayer should be the insurer of last resort on all matters, then that is not a policy that your government pursued and it is not a policy that this government is pursuing. Those grants ... [are] for small businesses that need those grants, those businesses we have put the support through with the NSW government access to the support they need. These individual cases, I\u2019m sure the minister who is responsible for emergency management would be pleased to pass on through the recovery agency to provide whatever assistance we can. But this government is providing the most significant package of relief we have seen in relation to a disaster of this nature. It\u2019s initial, it\u2019s additional and it will keep rolling every single day and it will be there for years and years and years to come. The next dixer is just on how amazing the economy is. Pretty amazing, says Josh Frydenberg. The most amazing economy you\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s a beautiful economy. Everyone says it. It is so much more amazing than Labor\u2019s economy, don\u2019t cha know. Oh, also the drought and the fires and coronavirus is an issue, but don\u2019t you worry about that. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Is the prime minister aware that the deputy prime minister foreshadowed yet another reshuffle when he told Kieran Gilbert on Sky News yesterday that Senator McKenzie would be coming back? Does the prime minister intend to return Senator McKenzie to his cabinet? Morrison launches into a congratulations spree of the new ministers. You get a congratulations. And you get a congratulations. YOU ALL GET A CONGRATULATIONS. Coalition governments in this country have given Australians stronger economies, safer borders, Mr Speaker, stronger national security and a focus on the needs of rural and regional Australians. Morrison accuses Labor of voting against the drought fund (it voted for it) so Albanese asks him to withdraw. Tony Smith doesn\u2019t require Morrison to withdraw (procedure is you do this stuff after QT) but Morrison withdraws anyway. Just so he can get to this bit: But this each-way leader of the opposition, Mr Speaker, each way, he\u2019s for a drought fund, he\u2019s against a drought fund. He\u2019s for tax cuts, he\u2019s against tax cuts. ... So this each-way leader of the opposition, he\u2019s for things, he\u2019s against things. What is the leader of the opposition... Smith sits him down because the time is up. The end of Stuart Robert\u2019s answer is here: These changes are designed to make the program more robust by requiring additional evidence ... when using income information to identify potential overpayments. As stated in November this year, this means we\u2019ll no longer raise a debt where the only information we\u2019re relying on is the averaging of ATO. For those debts raised to date, the statement was made that Services Australia will be carefully and methodically working to identify those customers whose debts may have been calculated using a portioned ATO PAYG income data. It\u2019s complex to do that, it\u2019s a highly manual process. It\u2019s not appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of this process and we\u2019ll advise the House in the future when that process comes to its conclusion.\u201d So, not sorry for it being illegal, just making robodebt \u201cmore robust\u201d. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret administering an illegal robodebt scheme, a fact that was revealed in answer to a question on notice in the Senate today by the Australian Taxation Office. Stuart Robert takes it: As the House would know, on the morning of 19 November last year the government announced a further refinement of the income compliance program. This is part of my ... to strengthen and improve the scheme. The program has already undergone a number of iterations and refinements since its inception under Labor in 2011. In response to community feedback, these changes will make the program more robust by requiring additional evidence when the... Albanese interrupts with \u201cyou\u2019re breaking the law\u201d, which Tony Smith takes as a point of order on relevance. Robert continues reading his prepared answer (the release of the documents meant they knew this was coming) but does not address the question of regret. Luke Henrique-Gomes has a story on when the government received legal advice about robodebt: The government received legal advice that debts issued under the botched robodebt scheme were unlawful, confidential documents provided to a Senate committee have revealed. Emails between top tax office officials published on Thursday show that the agency was told by the Department of Social Services that debts based solely on the controversial \u2018income averaging\u2019 method were \u2018not lawful debts\u2019. The same year we were told the weekend was under attack because of electric cars, electric vehicle sales increased. I\u2019ve just been alerted that Katie Allen and Tim Wilson have just made speeches on the fires in the federation chamber (the Michael McCormack of parliamentary chambers because no one pays attention to it). Both have pushed for more action on climate. That\u2019s of note because, as Sarah Martin reported this morning, Allen has called for a minister for climate change \u2013 and there have been suggestions Wilson should be it. Earlier this week (I think it was Tuesday), Sky News political editor Andrew Clennell reported on air that he had heard there may be some \u201cgood news\u201d for Angus Taylor later this week. Sky News is reporting the Australian federal police has determined not to pick up the Angus Taylor investigation. We checked in with the AFP this morning and have not heard back \u2013 a call to the media unit made in the last few minutes also hasn\u2019t confirmed it, as yet. Adani has another statement: Adani will not have a conviction recorded after self-reporting to the Queensland government that we made an administrative error in our 2017/18 annual return for the Carmichael mine. We today pleaded guilty in the Brisbane magistrates court for providing the administering authority an erroneous document and will pay a $20,000 fine. This is in relation to an administrative error. There was no environmental harm, all relevant works were legal, and fully complied with our project conditions. We took responsibility for the administrative error at the time and introduced improvements to internal processes when it was discovered in 2018 and reported by us, to ensure paperwork errors of this nature are avoided in the future. We are pleased this matter is now resolved. Bob Katter, who stepped down as party leader to concentrate on being a gladiator against his enemies or some such thing (presumably crocodiles), has had a very Bob Katter response to David Littleproud\u2019s return to agriculture. From his statement: Our farmers are in deep trouble with drought, so what\u2019s his solution? Get rid of the farmers. Now the only people out there buying the farms are the Chinese and others with foreign interests. I\u2019m looking forward to him being Ag Minister like the Pope watching Attila the Hun coming for the Peninsula. He\u2019s a free marketeer. His party\u2019s free market policies have been the death knell of the dairy industry, the national cattle herd is down 20%, sheep are down 60% and we are a net importer of fruit and vegetables, pork and seafood. I will continue to fight for a rural reconstruction bank, dams in north Queensland and across Australia, as well as vital freight links for our rural areas. The Greens have held a press conference pressuring the government over the failure to release its anti-corruption commission bill. Greens Senate leader Larissa Waters and senators Sarah Hanson-Young and Janet Rice were also asked if they\u2019ll be keeping their portfolios after Adam Bandt became leader. Waters replied: We\u2019ve just had some new leadership arrangements and we\u2019ll be having, naturally, those discussions about what important issues we\u2019ll continue to work on. That\u2019s a matter for the leader, and always has been in our party. Hanson-Young replied: I love the environment portfolio, I love fighting for Australia\u2019s environment, and I have every intention I\u2019m going to keep doing it. That was stated with a degree of confidence. Hanson-Young didn\u2019t directly answer the question about whether she had confirmed this with Bandt but, if not, she has rowed the boat out very far. Waters also commented on the mysterious $165,000 donation the Liberal party declared from a company run by Scott Briggs \u2013 a key Scott Morrison ally \u2013 and then revoked, claiming the declaration was a mistake. Waters: It just goes to show how much we need donations reform and a federal corruption watchdog. First, there was a donation made by a mate that was wanting a favour, to get a contract. Then a couple of days later, \u2018Oh no, there was no donation.\u2019 What\u2019s the story here? And why are people able to make donations when they are applying for government approval or government contracts? Clean up the system! The Brisbane magistrates court fined Adani $20,000 after it pleaded guilty for wrongly declaring land clearing to the Queensland environment department. The court did not record a conviction. The UK\u2019s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, is in Australia to talk trade for the newly single nation, after its split from the EU. This is pretty important for Australia, which is also negotiating an EU free trade agreement. That one is a little more tricky, because as the French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told the AFR in November last year, France expects Australia to do more on climate before it agrees to any trade deal: The other priority challenge is indeed for the future agreement to be highly ambitious in terms of sustainable development. Our two countries are nearly 15,000 kilometres apart and we must show that a trade agreement between the EU and Australia plays a positive role in the face of climate change: that\u2019s a very important point for our parliament and our civil society,\u201d he said at the time. The UK is also strong on the need for more climate action. Here was Boris Johnson at the Glasgow climate conference yesterday: We\u2019ve put so much CO2 in the atmosphere collectively that the entire planet is swaddled in a tea cosy of the stuff. It\u2019s now predicted, unless we take urgent action, to get 3C hotter, and in the hurricanes and the bushfires and melting of the ice caps and the acidification of the oceans, the evidence is now overwhelming. We know as a country, as a society, as a planet, as a species, we must now act. Scott Morrison insists Australia is doing just fine. The UK may not be pushing quite as hard for Australia to do more on climate, as some in the EU, but in an interview with Sabra Lane on the ABC earlier this week, Vicky Treadall, the British high commissioner, said it was part of the talks: Well, Britain has made it very clear that they want everyone to have a greater level of ambition. We are taking a global leadership role on climate change. We are hosting COP26 (2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference) and at COP26 we will be asking all nations to look again at where they stand. Obviously we are working closely with the Australian government to see what the art of the possible is. Now I won\u2019t go into details. These are ongoing conversations that we will have in the coming months but where we know we can work very closely with Australia is in the whole area of renewables, the new technology, the new jobs that will come. The transition of our own economy, the lessons we have learnt and how we can share that with others. AAP has an update on the latest trade figures: Australia\u2019s trade surplus shrank to $5.223 billion in December, a drop of $295 million on the surplus in November 2019. In seasonally adjusted terms, exports rose 1.0% to $41.29 billion for the month and imports were up 2% to $36.07 billion, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan said the result broadly met market expectations for a surplus of $5.5 billion. He said a narrowing trade surplus was to be expected with commodity prices moderating in the quarter, notably iron ore, which had spiked in the June quarter due to the supply shock from Brazil. \u201cThe key surprise for the month of December was around exports. Metal ores, gold and fuels all moved in the right direction ... However, we were looking for stronger gains \u2013 based on partial information and mindful of a potential pre Lunar New Year bounce,\u201d he said. The Senate is dealing with the government\u2019s latest round of banking royal commission bills. Labor is in support, so there\u2019s no problem there. But the banking royal commission was handed down a year ago. So there is a lot of chat about how long this is all taking. Labor has supported a motion by Liberals Eric Abetz and Concetta Fierravanti-Wells asking schools to consider having children recite the same pledge that naturalised Australian citizens must make. The motion states that the Senate: notes the Australian citizenship pledge, which in part reads as follows: I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey; and (b) calls on all schools to consider having the citizenship pledge recited by students on appropriate occasions. This is a slight troll of Labor education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek \u2013 who supports the idea, has done since 2011, and reiterated the value of the pledge as recently as Australia Day. It got up 51 to 9, with only the Greens voting against. Among the Labor members who voted on it: Tony Sheldon, Louise Pratt, Jenny McAllister, Tim Ayres, Murray Watt, Kimberley Kitching, Deb O\u2019Neill, Helen Polley, Don Farrell and Kim Carr. Eric Abetz and Connie Fierravanti-Wells look like they are trolling Labor in the Senate, calling a Senate motion over Tanya Plibersek\u2019s repeated call for a citizenship pledge. Labor is voting with the government on the (non-binding) motion that there should be one. Mark Butler has some thoughts about Keith Pitt\u2019s elevation to the cabinet: The new minister for resources and water, Keith Pitt, is the government\u2019s biggest advocate for nuclear power and a dedicated opponent to global action on climate change through the Paris agreement. Minister Pitt\u2019s history as a nuclear power advocate is well documented, most recently through pushing the energy minister into commissioning an inquiry into nuclear power. Having appointed such a strong nuclear advocate to the resources portfolio, Scott Morrison must now come clean about his government\u2019s nuclear power plan and let Australians know which regions are in his nuclear firing line. Over 100 Australian communities have previously been identified as possible locations for nuclear reactors and nuclear dumps, including; Jervis Bay, Townsville, Gladstone, Perth, Western Port in Victoria and the New South Wales north coast. Keith Pitt\u2019s appointment to the crucial resources portfolio is also another signal that Scott Morrison is walking even further away from action on climate change. Keith Pitt\u2019s opposition to the Paris climate agreement is so deep that in 2018 he resigned from the assistant ministry in protest against Australia\u2019s participation in global action on climate change. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation has welcomed David Littleproud\u2019s return to the agriculture portfolio: National Farmers\u2019 Federation President Fiona Simson has congratulated David Littleproud on his appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management. \u2018Having held the agriculture portfolio before and most recently the responsibilities of water, drought, rural finance, natural disaster and emergency management, Minister Littleproud knows the farm sector\u2019s issues better than most,\u2019 Ms Simson said. \u2018Importantly, Minister Littleproud\u2019s appointment will provide our industry continuity during a period of unprecedented challenges.\u2019 The NFF also welcomed Keith Pitt to the all-important water portfolio. Sometimes the world looks perfect Nothing to rearrange. Sometimes you get a feeling Like you need some kind of change. No matter what the odds are this time, Nothing\u2019s going to stand in my way. This flame in my heart, And a long lost friend Gives every dark street a light at the end. Standing tall, on the wings of my dream. Rise and fall, on the wings of my dream. The department of community affairs has released a series of question on notice answers, after questions were raised over the legality of robodebt. Greens senator Rachel Siewert said the government needs to answer how long it knew there were issues over robodebt \u2013 ahead of the court case. This is a fundamental question and with the government making a claim of Public Interest Immunity over the release of legal advice it is clear that they don\u2019t want Australia to know. People in our community have been traumatised and harassed for years and years, many have large debts they don\u2019t owe and are being forced to pay with interest and they want and deserve answers. There is so much uncertainty around the review process and which debts have been paused and when. The government has a responsibility to be open and upfront about this process. It should not be up to the slow court process for us to uncover what on earth has been going on and it\u2019s clear that the government must come clean. It\u2019s a failure of both economic management and basic duty to not have provided a costing for the robodebt clean-up process in MYEFO. Marise Payne will hold a press conference with her UK counterpart, Dominic Raab, at 1.30. George Christensen spoke about Julian Assange\u2019s case in the parliament yesterday. Andrew Wilkie and Christensen will travel to visit Assange on February 16 in UK (they are paying for the trip themselves). In less than two weeks time the member for Clark and I will travel at our own expense to meet with Australian citizen and journalist-publisher Julian Assange, who is being detained in Belmarsh prison in London. The social visit with Mr Assange will take place on Sunday 16 February. We want to see firsthand how Mr Assange is fairing, because of a number of concerning reports about his health and the severity of his treatment within the UK prison system. We appreciate the cooperation of the British authorities at Belmarsh in confirming our social visit. My concern is that a foreign country, the US, is seeking to extradite an Australian citizen from another foreign country for breaching laws of a foreign country that they were not subject to as they were not in that country, the US, to breach those laws. What is the alleged breach? It is the receipt of information that was in the public interest that he then published. That should not be a crime. It is my view and the view of the Parliamentary Friends of the Bring Julian Assange Home Group that extradition proceedings should cease and Mr Assange should be brought back to Australia. Mr Assange has been pursued for 10 years, and he spent more than six years holed up in an Ecuadorian embassy ahead of his arrest and imprisonment at Belmarsh. Mr Assange must now be allowed to return home. This is also ticking away on the backbench. Andrew Wilkie and George Christensen are leading a bipartisan (backbench) push to have Julian Assange returned to Australia. They will be visiting him next week, ahead of his extradition hearing in the UK. Swimmingly well The Greens will now move a motion in the Senate calling for Adani\u2019s approval to be cancelled, using the guilty plea in the Brisbane magistrates court as a trigger. It will also wedge Labor on the issue. From Larissa Waters\u2019 statement: The federal government must now cancel Adani\u2019s approval and I\u2019ll be lodging a motion in the Senate today calling for just that. A criminal conviction is a legal trigger for the federal government to review and revoke Adani\u2019s approval. If the government keeps ignoring Adani\u2019s breaches, it\u2019s just one rule for coal donors and another for ordinary Australians. Adani will be criminally convicted today, yet it is still in line for public subsidies. But if you miss one Centrelink appointment and you\u2019re screwed. It shows where the government\u2019s priorities lie - with the coal donors, not the community. People will also be watching on Monday how Labor votes on my motion - they will have to finally pick a side on Adani and show whether they stand with the big polluters or a safe climate. The Sydney Morning Herald has reported on some comments by Malcolm Turnbull to the Coalition for Conservation, that Liberal MPs who are sceptical about climate change are \u201creinforced and amplified ... by the rightwing media\u201d, including News Corp, and \u201cbasically operates like terrorists\u201d. \u201cBasically they say, unless you give us what we want we will blow the joint up,\u201d he reportedly said. Turnbull blamed entrenched internal opposition to his climate policy for his downfall in August 2018, and he\u2019s used the \u201cterrorist\u201d line before \u2013 in comments to Guardian Australia and the BBC among others. Still, if it\u2019s any sign of the content of his upcoming autobiography, he\u2019s not holding back. Turnbull also said: If ever Australians were under any illusion that the consequences of a hotter and drier climate were real, harsh and dangerous, those illusions have been shattered this summer. These bushfires are utterly without precedent in our history ... This has branded us in a way that we would never ever imagine could happen. We are seen as very behind ... as a leader in a negative sense. That should really embarrass so many Australians. Adani has pleaded guilty to providing misleading information to Queensland environmental authorities in the Brisbane magistrates court this morning. It failed to report land clearing in its 2017/18 return. Adani has responded by calling it \u201can administrative error\u201d. After self-reporting to the Queensland Government that we made an administrative error in our 2017/18 Annual Return for the Carmichael mine, Adani will today plead guilty in the Brisbane Magistrate\u2019s Court for providing the administering authority an erroneous document. Importantly, there was no environmental harm, all relevant works were legal, and fully complied with our project conditions. We have taken responsibility for the administrative error and improvements to internal processes were introduced at the time the administrative error was discovered in 2018 and reported by us to ensure paperwork errors of this nature are avoided in the future. We look forward to this matter being resolved. The court is yet to deliver a sentence on the matter. The maximum penalty is $3m. The press conference finishes on the bushfire royal commission. Scott Morrison: I\u2019ve also said that that royal commission needs to look at the preparedness and resilience in relation to these bushfire events. And that means an understanding that that needs to be done in a hotter, longer and drier summer. And the impacts of climate change on that are acknowledged and understood. And so that means that we need to have a discussion not just about emissions reduction, which happens in the broad, but if you\u2019re talking about climate resilience, then hazard reduction is as important, if not more, for the direct safety of people affected by these fires than emissions reduction. The longer-term adaptation measures are also important. I\u2019m not going to allow a confined, narrow debate when it comes to understanding what it means to live in the climate we\u2019re going to live in. It\u2019s not just about emissions reduction. That\u2019s important. But it\u2019s also about resilience and it\u2019s also about adaptation. Asked about the push within the Coalition to build new coal fired power stations/invest in coal, Scott Morrison sticks to the same old lines about \u201cbalance\u201d. He is then asked by Sarah Martin about whether or not he is talking about retro-fitting some of the existing coal fired power stations, and his response is included below: Our policy is a common sense one. It gets the balance right. It understands the need for the maintenance and sweating of those assets which are providing reliability to the system, and where those types of assets in the future can be developed in the way that would be required under the environmental standards, then that\u2019s not ruled out either. And so it\u2019s common sense. It\u2019s a common-sense, well-balanced policy and I think that embraces everybody, not just in the Liberal party room, but right across the Coalition. Martin: Are you talking about retro-fitting existing coal-fired power stations to reduce emissions? Morrison: Well, we work with all the energy companies, because we know that we don\u2019t want to force people\u2019s power prices up. And we don\u2019t want to see a loss of capacity out of the system that is unnecessary. And so we take all of these decisions in the national interest. Martin: So government funds could be used to do that? Morrison: Look, that\u2019s your speculation. That\u2019s not what I\u2019ve said. Martin: But I\u2019m asking you ... Morrison: That\u2019s not what I\u2019ve said. Asked about the hit to the economy by the coronavirus, Scott Morrison says: So, yes, there will be an economic hit because of the coronavirus, just as there will be as a result of the bushfires. But there will also be a recovery and there will be a recovery to the bushfires with the extensive works that will be undertaken with rebuilding and equally you can expect down the track. [When?] Hard to know, because there are so many unknowns about the duration of this virus. You would have heard from [chief health office] Dr Murphy that they\u2019ve been preparing a lot of work for the government on what the various scenarios are at a global level and how that might impact domestically. So a lot of work [is] to be done but we\u2019re being very transparent about that with states and territories and we intend to be, also, with the Australian people. But we expect a hit, particularly in this quarter, on the coronavirus, and how much more it extends beyond that really does depend on how this virus continues to play out at a global level. David Littleproud\u2019s return to the agriculture portfolio was so readily expected that lobby groups already have their congratulation emails ready to go: CropLife Australia\u2019s chief executive officer, Matthew Cossey, said, \u201cCropLife Australia and our members congratulate Minister Littleproud on his appointment to the important role of minister for Agriculture. Minister Littleproud has shown he is a passionate advocate for agriculture and regional Australia more broadly. There is still work to do to further improve the performance of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to ensure Australian farmers have timely access to the crucial innovations of the plant science industry. Michael McCormack explains the need for a two-thirds majority in any future Nationals leadership spill (which, in a divided room of 21 people, would all but certainly shore up his leadership) with all the charisma of a bowl of overcooked pasta. It\u2019s a matter for the party and the party\u2019s management as to whether this goes forward. Both of the other major parties have a similar sort of rule in place. The fact is we want to make sure that for the member who brought this up and raised it, wants to end the speculation about the leadership. And I think that\u2019s probably an important thing. This is the same man who yesterday told the Seven network after being asked how many votes he held on by: Just how close I am not sure. It is National party convention not to reveal the votes and at the end of the day, the votes do not count. What counts, for me, is regional Australians. Keith Pitt has been a massive, massive, massive advocate for nuclear power. Scott Morrison is asked about whether that will be a problem. He says the government is looking at all energy options, but the nuclear policy remains (that would be a no to nuclear). \u201cOnwards and upwards from here,\u201d says Michael McCormack. The new ministry will be sworn in at 5.30pm. That\u2019s after question time, meaning the new ministers will get some time to scrub up on their portfolios before Monday when, no doubt, Labor will attempt to trip a few of them up. Scott Morrison: On Mark Coulton: Mark Coulton will continue to serve as minister for regional health, regional communications and local government. Andrew Gee: Andrew Gee will come into the ministry as minister for regional education, decentralisation and minister assisting the minister for trade and investment. Michelle Landry: Michelle Landry will continue to serve as an assistant minister for children and families, and will also serve as assistant minister for northern Australia. And you won\u2019t find a stronger champion than Michelle Landry. ... other than Keith Pitt [the guy who actually holds the portfolio] for northern Australia, when it comes to ensuring that the needs of northern Australia are addressed. Kevin Hogan: And Kevin Hogan will come into the assistant ministry, where he will be the assistant minister to the deputy prime minister. Scott Morrison: On Michael McCormack: Obviously the leader of the Nationals will continue on in his current portfolios and that will also include a very big focus on the water grid and ensuring that Australia has the water infrastructure it needs for a resilient future. On David Littleproud: David Littleproud will continue to serve in cabinet. He will take on the portfolios of minister for agriculture and that will combine with his other portfolios of drought and emergency management. The issue of natural disasters is one that encompasses all portfolios of government and obviously, as minister for emergency management, that will have particular responsibilities for him, but when it comes to dealing with natural disasters and our broader resilience to the environment and the climate we are living in \u2013 as I outlined at the Press Club last week \u2013 I believe this goes across every single portfolio of government. On Darren Chester: Darren Chester will be entering cabinet, but he will continue to do the wonderful and outstanding job he\u2019s been doing as minister for veterans\u2019 affairs and minister for defence personnel. I\u2019m advised that this is the first time veterans\u2019 affairs has been back in cabinet since the late Ben Humphreys in 1993 and I think that sends a strong message about our commitment to veterans in this government. On Keith Pitt: Keith Pitt will take on the role and enter cabinet as minister for resources, water and northern Australia, highlighting again the importance of all of those portfolio matters and their presence around the cabinet table. We are getting a short continuity with change message ahead of the cabinet reshuffle announcement. Everything is hunky dory with the Liberals and the Nationals, Scott Morrison says. Never been stronger. The heart of the relationship between the Liberals and the Nationals is our deep passion and conviction for supporting the needs of rural and regional Australians, and our belief in the future of rural and regional Australia. And at its heart, that\u2019s what the Coalition is about. That\u2019s why we have come together so willingly over such a long period of time. Andrew Giles had some things to say about Chris Knaus\u2019s story this morning on the \u201cmistaken\u201d $165,000 donation made to the Liberal party by a Scott Morrison ally, who is also vying for the visa privatisation contract: Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison won\u2019t walk away from visa privatisation. And today this issue has descended into a complete farce. Mr Scott Briggs, the principal behind one of the bids, a close Liberal party associate of the prime minister and Minister Coleman, has declared donations of $300,000 to the Liberal party, $165,000 through an entity known as Southern Strategy. This morning it\u2019s reported that he says this donation was an accident. The Liberal party won\u2019t comment or explain it. This is a complete farce. Mike Bowers was in the chamber for the Angus Taylor motion Scott Morrison will hold a press conference at 10.45 to announce the new cabinet. Keith Pitt gets Matt Canavan\u2019s former portfolio of mining, resources and northern Australia. Lucy Barbour of the ABC reports that David Littleproud won\u2019t hold onto the water portfolio but will get agriculture back \u2013 which was also expected. Darren Chester\u2019s portfolio of veteran affairs will move into the cabinet. The frontbench reshuffle we were supposed to get yesterday, is coming today. As expected, Darren Chester and Keith Pitt get the cabinet promotions. Scott Morrison also told Alan Jones that he had concerns over where the bushfire donation money was being sent: Jones: Forget what you are giving, the government are giving, I\u2019m talking about the public. People listening to you now have given a half a billion dollars. And can I just leave it with you? They\u2019re down there. They\u2019re seeing none of this money. And so something\u2019s got to be mobilised to get the money to the people. If I could leave that thought with you. Morrison: Look, absolutely Alan, I have a similar concern about this. I mean, I can tell you that over $111 million dollars has been paid out. I think it\u2019s very important that charities, and state governments for that matter, are reporting on how much money is going out the door and to where. Jones: Well \u2026 there are very few people who can tell the prime minister to stop talking but I\u2019ve got to go to the news. But we\u2019ll talk again soon about that and other issues. Alan Jones had a chat to Scott Morrison this morning. From the transcript: Jones: I was just thinking last night, when we\u2019re going to talk to you today, you must feel as though you\u2019ve gone 10 rounds with Muhammad Ali. It\u2019s been pile on the prime minister for a couple of months, hasn\u2019t it? Morrison: Well, there\u2019s been a lot of that. But, you know, that\u2019s what this job\u2019s about. You stand up to that and you stand up for what you believe in. You just put your head down and you just keep going. That\u2019s what my dad always taught me. Jones: Ah your dad, well I\u2019m sorry about all that too, you\u2019ve had a \u2026 Morrison: Yeah, thanks for your lovely message. Annastacia Palaszczuk doubled down on her attack on the federal government when speaking to the ABC this morning, calling for disaster payments to be given to Queensland tourism operators over the coronavirus impact: But we also know that this coronavirus is going to have an impact. It\u2019s going to have an impact on the Queensland economy and a very large impact on the Australian economy. So yesterday I convened large members of the stakeholder groups across Queensland, from the Gold Coast, from far north Queensland, from a whole different range of sectors, from resources to tourism, to seafood, to international education. And what they told me very clearly is that they need assistance and support, and they need it now. And they want the state and the commonwealth to work together. So, that\u2019s why I wrote to the prime minister, in the spirit of cooperation, to say, \u2018Let\u2019s treat this huge impact on our economy just as we would a natural disaster, like a cyclone or a bushfire.\u2019 We need that help and we need to work together, and we need to contribute, I believe, equal share, like we do with natural disasters. Queensland is moving forward, putting together its economic recovery group which is activated after natural disasters. The motion will fail. Tony Smith also warns Labor that the motions are \u201cbecoming far too long\u201d given that Mark Butler\u2019s motion is two pages and took three minutes to read. Butler takes it on board. Leave is not granted. Butler moves forward again, with pretty much the same motion which will also fail \u2013 but Labor takes these as a win, because it puts its allegations on the Hansard record. Here is the motion: That the House: (1) Notes: (a) New South Wales Police detectives formed Strike Force Garrad in November 2019 to investigate the creation of a fraudulent document that was disseminated by the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction as part of a political attack on the Lord Mayor of Sydney; (b) New South Wales Police concluded \u201cthe document had to have been doctored from Canberra\u201d; (c) the criminal investigation by New South Wales Police, encompassing the use of the fraudulent document by the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, was referred to the Australian Federal Police in December 2019; (d) the Australian Federal Police has not concluded its assessment of the state referral; (e) the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction has not provided a full statement to the House about the role the Minister and his office played in the creation and dissemination of a fraudulent document which gave rise to long-running, and not-yet-concluded, criminal investigations in two jurisdictions; (f) the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction has not advised if he and/or his office has assisted the criminal investigations related to his conduct by providing statements, documents and access to data; (g) the Prime Minister has failed to uphold his ministerial standards by failing to sack the Minister for Emissions Reduction for repeated breaches of those standards, including bringing the government and this House into disrepute by creating and/or disseminating a fraudulent document; (h) the Prime Minister has failed to explain why the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction holds a place in his Cabinet when the former Minister for Agriculture, Senator McKenzie, was forced to resign her place; and (2) Requires: (a) the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction to attend the House at any time before 1pm today and, for a time not exceeding 10 minutes, (i) provide a full statement to the House about his role in the creation and dissemination of a fraudulent document that targeted the Lord Mayor of Sydney (ii) advise how he has assisted New South Wales and Federal police in the conduct of their inquiries and (iii) apologise to the House for his conduct; and (b) the Prime Minister to attend the House at any time before 1.30pm today and, for a time not exceeding 10 minutes, explain to the House why the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction is fit to serve as a Minister in his government but Senator McKenzie is not. Labor has started the day\u2019s proceedings with an attempt to suspend standing orders over Angus Taylor. Mark Butler is leading this charge. The parliament bells are ringing. Sigh. Back on the economy for the moment, because this story in the Australian about cabinet ministers getting upset that the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, isn\u2019t doing their job for them is amazing. From the report: The Morrison government is increasingly frustrated with Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe\u2019s calls for it to spend more to lift the nation\u2019s flagging productivity, after a confidential cabinet briefing from the RBA boss on Monday left ministers exasperated by an absence of detailed policy ideas. Dr Lowe in a speech on Wednesday again exhorted the Coalition to do more to foster business spending as he highlighted a \u201ctroubling decline in productivity growth\u201d, despite \u201cfantastic\u201d economic fundamentals. \u201cWhile the reasons for this are complex, it is hard to escape the conclusion that higher levels of investment spending would promote productivity growth and our collective living standards,\u201d he said. The Australian understands Dr Lowe relayed those calls in a rare confidential cabinet briefing on Monday, leaving senior cabinet members frustrated by a lack of detail from the governor on specific measures and projects he wanted the government to pursue. Pro tip \u2013 coming up with government policy is YOUR job, guys. It is literally in the job description. Come up with policies and measures to keep the place ticking over is pretty much the only reason we have a government, because, as we have seen, the bureaucrats and departments are pretty good at keeping the machinery of government ticking over without you. But if only there were reports, and predictions, and information to help you \u2026 oh wait THERE IS. Binders and binders and binders of it. Going back years. It\u2019s your job to take that information and do something with it. While we\u2019re on Peter Dutton, hopefully he will be pressed in question time over his deliberate muddling of information on the ABC yesterday when he was asked about climate change: Obviously, as we\u2019ve all pointed out, we\u2019re experiencing hotter weather, longer summers, but did the bushfires start in some of these regions because of climate change? No. It started because somebody lit a match. There are 250 people as I understand it or more that have been charged with arson. That\u2019s not climate change. Pulled up by Patricia Karvelas that the most common start to the fires was lightning strikes, not arson, Dutton says: Nobody\u2019s disputing that. There\u2019s been lightning strikes for as long as there have been bushfires in this country. I\u2019m happy to accept the involvement of climate change but your point was about the views in our party room. No one is saying that climate change *started* the fires. Just that it is making the seasons worse. And in case it has to be debunked AGAIN, here is what police said in January about the numbers of arson charges. Not sure where the 250 figure came from, but the 183 legal actions police had issued from the start of the fire season, were mostly for things like ignoring the total fire ban, or throwing out lit cigarette butts. And you would hope a former police officer, and the man in charge of our border security, would be across the detail. From the police last month: Victoria police say there is no evidence any of the devastating bushfires in the state were caused by arson, contrary to the spread of global disinformation exaggerating arsonist arrestsduring the current crisis. A misleading figure suggesting 183 arsonists have been arrested \u201csince the start of the bushfire season\u201d spread across the globe on Wednesday, after initial reports in News Corp were picked up by Donald Trump Jr, US far-right websites and popular alt-right personalities. The figure included statistics from some states covering the entirety of 2019, rather than just the current bushfire season, which began in September. Late on Wednesday Peter Dutton accused the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of using the coronavirus for political point scoring (that\u2019s a common theme from the government, which also accused the federal opposition of using the bushfires for political point scoring). Dutton accused Palaszczuk of taking information from a confidential health briefing and using it for political gain: It\u2019s important to point out that premier Palaszczuk, having heard the recommendation from the expert medical committee, where her chief medical officer in Queensland was part of the discussion, knew that recommendation was coming to the PM and went out there gratuitously, calling for us to stop incoming flights from China, knowing frankly that was probably the decision we were going to make. So we need to move quickly, particularly when there\u2019s been that sort of breach, pretty egregious breach of the committee\u2019s work and premier Palaszczuk still hasn\u2019t apologised for that. Palaszczuk was asked about Dutton\u2019s comments on ABC Breakfast this morning: That\u2019s absolutely rubbish. That is absolutely rubbish. I stand up for what I believe is right. I won\u2019t be silenced by the federal government. And what I say to you and your listeners is this is a public health emergency. And my focus has been on the containment and to make sure the virus is contained and does not spread. These are big issues. And I just believed at the time that the federal government was acting too slow. So, we\u2019ve taken measures. Other states have taken measures. But it\u2019s a national issue, it\u2019s a national health emergency, and my clear message is we all need to work together. The Queensland election is in October, in case anyone was wondering. It seems Bridget McKenzie made another statement to the Senate late last night about some other memberships she had neglected to declare. Here is her statement in full (minus the sound of her phone making cricket noises): As it\u2019s been widely reported I resigned from my ministry on Sunday February the 2nd due to breaches of the prime minister\u2019s statement of ministerial standards. I\u2019ve publicly apologised for this and today I wish to further apologise to the Senate, so it\u2019s lovely we actually had a vote so that we could all be here. I do not believe the gifted membership of the Australian Clay Target Association or my paid membership to Field and Game Australia contributed any real or apparent conflict of interest. However, I acknowledge my mistake in failing to declare these as required in the statement of ministerial standards in a timely way. I\u2019ve also updated my Senate statement of interests, which states that senators much declare being an office holder or where they\u2019ve contributed more than $300 to an organisation. I am a member, a proud member, of Field and Game Australia, Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, Australian Deer Association, and the Country Women\u2019s Association. I\u2019m not an office holder of any of these organisations, nor have I provided them with any donations, which is a declarable requirement under the Senate\u2019s statement of interests. I\u2019m no longer a member of the Australian Clay Target Association and therefore Wangaratta Clay Target Club, which commenced on the 29th of January 2019 and ceased on December 30 2019. Having reviewed all my memberships in the recent weeks, I\u2019ve become aware that I was a member of the Victorian Farmers Federation Ag-Force Country Connection, the Melbourne Cricket Club and Yarrawonga-Mulwala, a fabulous golf club, during 2019. All of these memberships have since ceased. None of my memberships have caused real or apparent conflicts of interest to my role, either as minister or as senator for Victoria. However, I\u2019ve chosen to fully disclose all my memberships to the Senate on this day to ensure complete transparency both to the Senate and the broader Australian community. I\u2019ve been a senator for nine years and have the deepest respect for this chamber of parliament, which is so important to our democracy. I regret any confusion caused concerning my declaration of interests, and I apologise to each and every one of my fellow senators, for my transgression with regard to the register of interest. Thank you. In case you missed it, Sarah Martin had this story late yesterday: The new Liberal MP Katie Allen has canvassed the need for the government to appoint a dedicated climate change minister as the Coalition splits on how best to \u201cevolve\u201d its policy response. Allen, who was elected for the seat of Higgins in May, is one of a number of Liberal MPs who have been arguing internally for the government to increase its ambition on climate change against resistance from conservatives in the Coalition. Allen\u2019s suggestion for a climate change portfolio was made in a group chat of MPs in a discussion about how the government\u2019s policies could be better communicated, sources have confirmed. She did not advocate in the group that the government needed to do more, but suggested there was frustration that voters were not hearing the government\u2019s message. She argued that the \u201csignificant investment\u201d being made by the government did not appear to be acknowledged in the community. Allen proposed that her fellow Victorian MP Tim Wilson would be a good advocate to communicate the government\u2019s policies. That comes on top of John Alexander publicly pushing for the government to do more on climate policy. But there are still some very loud voices who are pushing for more coal-fired power stations. And climate action now! apparently means more dams and hazard reduction burns, and no actual climate action, so don\u2019t hold your breath. This is also something which will come up today: I\u2019ve often mistakenly donated $165,000. It\u2019s a real problem and my 2020 new year\u2019s resolution was to stop doing it. Chris Knaus has a story on someone else who apparently had that problem: The Liberal party is refusing to say why it scrubbed records of a $165,000 donation from a company run by Scott Briggs, a key Scott Morrison ally who is currently vying to win the government\u2019s $1bn visa privatisation contract. On Monday, the Liberal party declared it had received $165,000 from a company named Southern Strategy, a largely inactive political consultancy business Briggs started four years ago. Briggs is a close friend and confidant of Morrison, a former New South Wales Liberal party deputy state director, a former colleague of immigration minister David Coleman, and a director of the Cronulla Sharks, where the prime minister is the number one ticket holder. He is also leading a bid to win a highly lucrative but controversial contract to privatise Australia\u2019s visa processing system on behalf of a consortium named Australian Visa Processing Pty Ltd \u2026 When the Guardian queried the $165,000 donation, Briggs said Southern Strategy had never made it and that the Liberal party had made a mistake. The Liberal party also said the disclosure was a mistake. You\u2019ll find the whole story, here. The Australian has an interesting story on a NSW Liberal branch president acting in \u2013well, read it for yourself. A NSW Liberal Party branch president is under investigation and faces sanctions after launching a controversial website that ridicules his own side of politics, accuses senior figures of heresy, and mocks the sexual orientations of former cabinet ministers. The website, launched by Sean Burke, the NSW Liberal Party\u2019s Freshwater branch president, bills itself as \u201cunapologetically biased\u201d in its coverage of centre-left politics and nerve-point issues that have occupied the NSW and federal parliaments. Party officials told The Australian on Wednesday that while some of Mr Burke\u2019s content appeared benign, some content appeared to cross the lines of basic decency, and in other cases seemed deliberately malicious. You can read the whole story, here. Josh Frydenberg has started the day on a somewhat sombre note, admitting that the impact of the coronavirus on the economy will be \u201csignificant\u201d, with the Treasury saying it\u2019s too early to say what the outcome will be. The treasurer told Sky News: It will have a significant impact because China is our No 1 trading partner. While the epidemic of Sars back in 2003 had an impact on our economy and provides us with a bit of a guide, we\u2019re more integrated economically with China today than we were back then. In fact, the Chinese economy is four times bigger today than it was in 2003, so that means that what happens in China has a larger effect on the global economy too. With the drought, the bushfires and shifting trading economies, things aren\u2019t looking quite as rosy as the budget predictions, and Scott Morrison and Frydenberg have already started talking down the promised surplus. Morrison was on the Sydney radio 2GB early this morning also talking about coronavirus: The nature of its virus and how it spreads across the global economy is a bit of an unknown at the moment. At this stage, it hasn\u2019t demonstrated the same sort of severe outcomes that the previous viruses \u2013 Sars and Mers \u2013 did but the rates of transmission are much higher. The Reserve Bank governor, Phil Lowe, warned of much the same thing in his address to the National Press Club in Sydney yesterday. As Ben Butler reported: Sectors including tourism and education are likely to suffer billions of dollars worth of damage if the Morrison government keeps travel bans in place for more than six months, while the price of another key export to China, iron ore, has fallen by more than 10% in a month. The RBA expects the ongoing drought to cut 0.25 percentage points from growth this year. So keep an eye on that. We\u2019ll also have the parliament shenanigans, as well as everything else that happens in the hallways and beyond. Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp are your team today, with a half-coffee Amy on the blog. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

He thus has an exceptional opportunity to put his ideas into practice. But what are his ideas? Commentators seem vaguely aware that, although he studied history at university, he has dabbled in more than one scientific discipline over the years, but no one, it appears, has really tried to take the measure of Cummings as a serious thinker.</p> <p>There has, of course, been no shortage of comment on the various roles he has played in British political life in the last couple of decades. He came to the fore as a special adviser to the Tory politician Michael Gove between 2007 and 2013 (ie both before and during Gove\u2019s tumultuous years as secretary of state for education); he attracted further attention as the chief administrative mastermind behind the successful leave campaign in the 2016 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU; and when Boris Johnson became prime minister in July 2019, Cummings was installed as his chief aide, directing operations from within Downing Street.</p> <p>What may be less well known is that for much of this period Cummings has maintained <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/\" title=\"\">an unusual blog</a>, where he has posted extensive ruminations on his reading, enthusiastic reports about breakthroughs in science and pungent contributions to debates about education, spicing the mix with some notably unbuttoned ad hominem side-swipes \u2013 for example, describing David Davis, then the Brexit minister, as \u201cthick as mince\u201d. Several of these posts have an intrinsic intellectual interest, but, given his current role at the heart of power, they may also yield insights into the thinking of someone whose ideas could soon have consequences for all of us.</p> <p>I can\u2019t honestly claim to do much by way of community service but, as some twisted equivalent of a new year resolution, I decided I would sacrifice myself for the common good in January by spending the greater part of the month reading The Complete Blogs of Dominic Cummings. Well, perhaps not quite complete, as I have only gone back to 2013 and I have skipped several of the more functional or repetitive pieces, but I have more than compensated for any light-footed skimming by reading all 133,000 words of his magnum opus, posted in 2014 and titled \u201c<a href=\"https://dominiccummings.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/20130825-some-thoughts-on-education-and-political-priorities-version-2-final.pdf\" title=\"\">Some thoughts on education and political priorities</a>\u201d, in which he described his ideal of \u201can Odyssean education\u201d. What follows is my report on this unusual body of work.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Dominic Cummings is the best-known unknown historian of ideas in the country. Learned contributions to this scholarly field are, of course, not what he is celebrated for, but a surprising amount of what he writes falls under this label. He is fascinated by ideas \u2013 partly fascinated by their beauty and power, partly fascinated in the same way as a small boy is fascinated by firecrackers that can be let off behind unsuspecting old ladies. In Cummings\u2019s view, the world seems to be largely populated by old ladies, metaphorically speaking \u2013 timid, easily spooked people whom he delights in unsettling.</p> <p>But his firecrackers are assembled from genuine scientific components. Cummings is knowledgeable about an impressive variety of disciplines, and from this formidable if eclectic reading he has attempted to synthesise ideas he believes would transform the way the world is run (lack of ambition is not a defect of his thinking). The sense in which I am, tongue only slightly in cheek, calling him a \u201chistorian of ideas\u201d is that he traces in some detail the evolution of the ideas that interest him, and gives us, especially in his remarkable book-length essay on the elements of a university curriculum that comprise his \u201cOdyssean education\u201d, a crash course in the history of mathematics, physics, genetics, psychology, economics and much more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e04c42d07bbc16784921712dd670b3b70ddc06c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e04c42d07bbc16784921712dd670b3b70ddc06c/0_116_2576_1546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings at the Nato leaders\u2019 summit in Watford, Hertfordshire, December 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings at the Nato leaders\u2019 summit in Watford, Hertfordshire, December 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He takes the term \u201cOdyssean education\u201d from the Nobel-winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, referring to \u201can education that starts with the biggest questions and problems and teaches people to understand connections between them\u201d. The aim would be to \u201ctrain synthesisers\u201d. He appears contemptuous of most politicians, almost all media commentators, and all civil servants: none of these people really understand statistical modelling, quantum computation, synthetic biology, and so on. (Too many of them studied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain\" title=\"\">PPE (philosophy, politics and economics)</a> at Oxford University \u2013 which, in his view, just turns duffers into bluffers.) As a result, they make or encourage poor decisions. Better \u201cproject management in complex organisations\u201d is what we need, and his essay sketches a wide-ranging syllabus that would educate the effective decision-makers of the future.</p> <p>More broadly, Cummings repeatedly argues that the processes of government need to include 1) a number of outstanding scientists capable of bringing fundamental science to bear on policy formation, and 2) a general level of scientific and numerical literacy such that MPs, officials, journalists and others can understand basic scientific discoveries and their significance. The overall aim should be to make the UK \u201cthe leading country for education and science\u201d.</p> <p>At times, he can make this seem like the merest common sense; at other times he sounds like CP Snow on speed (Snow\u2019s <a href=\"http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/2cultures/Rede-lecture-2-cultures.pdf\" title=\"\">Two Cultures</a> lecture of 1959 is mainly remembered for its ardent advocacy of the need for scientific literacy among policymakers). He has attained an impressive level of scientific understanding himself, but with it has come more than a touch of the boffin\u2019s bee-filled bonnet. A good example of this unsteady combination is provided by his attempt to imagine the effect that genome-sequencing may have on the NHS in terms of identifying risk factors for certain diseases, eliminating congenital defects, and so on. The potential benefits and efficiencies are certainly striking. But he cannot resist going further, a little too quickly: \u201cWe will soon be able to <em>re-make human nature itself</em>,\u201d he writes. No point in pussy-footing around just doing hip replacements \u2013 let\u2019s do a complete makeover while we\u2019re in there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/09/the-brutal-truth-about-dominic-cummings\">The brutal truth about Dominic Cummings | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As all this suggests, Cummings is undeniably clever, even if not always notably judicious. Intellectual restlessness is one of his hallmarks: his capacity to stretch his mind, to absorb new ideas, to see parallels and analogies that jump across the tracks, is constantly on display. He is an Oxford history graduate who has turned himself into a numbers guy, or at least into the frontman for the numbers people \u2013 someone who understands enough of what they do to make the case for its importance to the rest of us. He says he\u2019s happy to be told where he\u2019s wrong, though you can\u2019t help feeling that he doesn\u2019t expect there will be much call for such frankness.</p> <p>And there are any number of things he is right about, or anyway right-ish. One is the foolishness of diverting funding away from basic \u201cblue skies\u201d scientific research in order to promote more applied work. Governments are prone to think that doing this will lead to more immediately useful outcomes, and hence it will be easier to justify the public expenditure involved, but the historical record is against them. Over and over again, theoretical enquiries that looked at the time to have no useful application turn out to be what enabled various later practical advances and inventions, from code-breaking to computers. Cummings understands this: he not only prioritises basic science, but he gets the need to give people the autonomy and security to explore not obviously useful-looking avenues of enquiry.</p> <p>At times, he can seem to flirt with a kind of anarchic libertarianism, attracted by a vision of unconstrained individual creativity, but against this is his recognition of the need for central state funding of basic science. He rightly stresses the role of federal funding in providing the research base for the Silicon Valley phenomenon in the US, for example, and he looks favourably on institutions such as the <a href=\"http://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrs\" title=\"\">CNRS</a> in France that are designed to sustain research on a long-term basis. (He also says, rather gnomically, that he is not a libertarian because it\u2019s \u201cnot consistent with evolutionary biology\u201d.) Overall he is surely right that public debate desperately needs more statistical literacy, as well as a better appreciation of the long-term benefits of basic research.</p> <p>Cummings\u2019s call for a curriculum that might combine, say, maths, science and history is driven by his focus on \u201cproject management\u201d in politics. Such an education would, he contends, provide a training in the calculation of probabilities when weighing competing proposals. But there is a recurring difficulty with schemes that attempt to build in \u201cinterdisciplinarity\u201d from the start. Yes, it sounds great to scorn those who are \u201cstuck in their disciplinary silos\u201d and to laud imaginative thinkers who address the really \u201cbig problems\u201d, and so on, but the fact is that you can\u2019t educate someone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/12/generalise-dont-specialise-why-focusing-too-narrowly-is-bad-for-us\" title=\"\">to be interdisciplinary</a>. You have to educate them in particular disciplines (possibly more than one), and then set up more specific or temporary or opportunistic arrangements for bringing them together and cross-pollinating. If we are to stay on Cummings\u2019s preferred ground of intellectual history, we would have to point out that, in modern times, nearly all the influential ideas and great discoveries have come from people working within a particular discipline. Specialisation is the precondition of intellectual advance, even if subsequent interdisciplinary thinking can then sometimes be an effective way to address complex practical problems.</p> <p>In his ambitious intellectual and educational synthesis there are some obvious, and rather predictable, lacunae. He is dismissive of most of the social sciences, especially sociology and anthropology, precisely because they purport to explore the distinctive power of \u201cthe social\u201d: their practitioners are mostly \u201ccharlatans\u201d. Here he sounds like a souped-up version of Margaret Thatcher: there is no such thing as \u201csociety\u201d, just the patterned interaction of evolutionarily moulded individuals. There are frequent irritable swipes at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jan/13/death-of-the-author\" title=\"\">something called</a> \u201cFrench literary theory\u201d and the damage it has allegedly done to the humanities; here we seem to be encountering nothing more than a lazy journalistic stereotype, a headline-happy approach that contrasts so strikingly with the care with which he expounds ideas from, say, evolutionary psychology.</p> <p>His voluminous writings suggest no cultivated interest in the study of art or music, nor, a few allusions to Dostoevsky and Tolstoy aside, in literature, or anyway not in literary criticism, though one wonders whether he might not have a taste for certain forms of science fiction. A few philosophers get walk-on parts (he quotes Nietzsche fairly often, but then who doesn\u2019t?), but on the whole he seems to treat modern philosophy, certainly the discipline of academic philosophy, as an irrelevance or an obstruction. Although he expresses a general commitment to including the humanities in his synthesis, in practice they (with the exception of history) seem marginal to his main interests.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>However, there is another omission that is less predictable, yet, in its way, more revealing. Cummings is practically silent about jurisprudence and the law. (In his diatribes against the always obstructive civil service, \u201clegal arguments\u201d are occasionally mentioned, but only to be swatted aside as another typical ruse by these masters of delay.) This is significant because legal systems and legal reasoning involve attempts to draw up general rules and procedures to govern human interaction. The law, especially in a common-law system, is a historical enterprise in a way that Cummings should, in principle, approve of. That is to say, it seeks constantly to modify the agreed rules in the light of new circumstances; in this respect, it is one large feedback loop. And it attempts to take into account not just the purposes informing any given individual\u2019s actions, but the likely effect of such actions on the interests of others, now and in the future. Accumulated legal reasoning becomes, therefore, the great repository of wisdom about the social consequences of allowing this action or preventing that action, and it is, in an important sense, no respecter of persons: no one, as the phrase has it, is above the law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c9687d6255d4feee119e6e40e86fdc6acc1459a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c9687d6255d4feee119e6e40e86fdc6acc1459a/0_0_4364_2618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson leaving 10 Downing Street, October 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson leaving 10 Downing Street, October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Summers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Great leaders, revolutionaries, \u201cmen of action\u201d and over-confident mavericks of all types always want to sweep the law aside, seeing only its negative character as a slow-moving body of outdated constraints on freedom of action \u2013 but that, of course, suggests why it is so precious. There\u2019s a fine exchange in Robert Bolt\u2019s play A Man for All Seasons between Sir Thomas More, the lord chancellor who was to be executed for his opposition to Henry VIII\u2019s break with Rome, and his earnest son-in-law, William Roper, in which Roper says he would cut down every law in England to get after the Devil, and More replies: \u201cOh? And, when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you \u2013 where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?\u201d</p> <p>More\u2019s point, of course, is that if, when we have the power, we impatiently strike down all the laws that stand in our way, we shall have no protections to turn to when power is in the hands of others. Cummings writes from the perspective of someone who\u2019s in a hurry to get the thing done, never from the perspective of the judge who has been schooled to reflect on the potentially damaging consequences in the future of licensing this particular action in the present.</p> <p>To balance Cummings\u2019s imagined course of maths, science and history, I could, teasingly, suggest that a no less valuable preparation for public life might be a combination of philosophy, jurisprudence and literature. Philosophy would introduce habits of analysis and undermine certainty or dogmatism; jurisprudence would teach an appreciation of rules, procedures and the judgment of consequences; and the study of literature would weaken the hold of cliche and all exaggerated beliefs in the fixity of meaning. It might be said, not altogether unfairly, that Cummings\u2019s course would produce doers and mine would produce critics (though the disciplines I suggest constantly generate new ideas rather than merely criticising old ones), but I would say that a healthy politics needs both, and that the more we emphasise the first category and try to give its occupants their head, the more we need the virtues of the second category to hold them in check.</p> <p>Cummings, of course, believes that this is just what we don\u2019t need. We \u201cdon\u2019t want more Oxbridge English graduates who chat about Lacan at dinner parties with TV producers and spread <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/19/why-cant-we-agree-on-whats-true-anymore\" title=\"\">fake news</a> about fake news\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/02/dominic-cummings-calls-for-weirdos-and-misfits-for-no-10-jobs\" title=\"\">he wrote last month</a>. This is an economical bit of target practice \u2013 everyone knows, don\u2019t they, that one can hardly move in north London these days without falling over \u201cchat about Lacan at dinner parties\u201d \u2013 but there may be deeper cultural antagonisms at work here. The datedness of the jibe about Lacan may suggest a long-nurtured touchiness. At one point Cummings says of himself, rather engagingly, \u201cI am not articulate\u201d, but you sense that he doesn\u2019t particularly rate articulateness in the first place. So much of what others think of as \u201cculture\u201d he regards as \u201cnoise\u201d. Perhaps his recent call for \u201csuper-talented weirdos\u201d to apply for staff jobs in Downing Street should be seen as something of a dating pitch.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In Cummings\u2019s ontology, the world appears to be made up of an extremely small number of outstandingly clever individuals and a mass of mediocrities. Human progress depends on giving those with the highest IQ (he\u2019s very keen on the notion of IQ) the education that will allow them fully to develop their talents and then the freedom to apply them. His culture heroes are those few outstanding mathematicians and scientists who fundamentally changed a whole intellectual field, such as Kurt G\u00f6del, John von Neumann and Richard Feynman. He has an abiding interest not just in what kinds of conditions have favoured scientific breakthroughs in the past and how we might replicate those today, but even more in the organisational or management processes that enabled complex, long-term, science-based projects to translate brilliant new ideas into successful practical outcomes, such as Nasa (putting the first man on the moon) or Parc (the Palo Alto Research Center, which was the foundation of Silicon Valley\u2019s triumphs), and he gives illuminating accounts of their modus operandi. Just how far such procedures could be transferred to the muddy, shifting, contested world of politics is an open question, but Cummings insists they would be a big improvement on what we have now.</p> <p>Politics is, by definition, the terrain of conflicting convictions, and although in principle Cummings lauds the idea of \u201cfeedback\u201d and the correction of error, in practice he seems to struggle with the idea of genuine intellectual disagreement. There are traces of that kind of absolute certainty that is more often shown by fellow-travellers of science rather than by first-rate scientists themselves. And he is a bit quick to write off opposition to his ideas as yet another example of the self-protective vested interests of the establishment (as the maverick\u2019s maverick, he, of course, is not part of \u201cthe establishment\u201d). \u201cThe political-media system actively suppresses thinking about, and focus on, what\u2019s important\u201d, he writes. One of the things that irks him about politics is that it involves so much damn <em>talk</em>. For example, he speaks contemptuously of the debate about the EU referendum in 2016, the outcome of which he played such a signal part in influencing: \u201cMost of the \u2018debate\u2019 was moronic as political debate always is.\u201d At least he cannot be accused of seeking cheap popularity.</p> <p>In a curious way, there is very little politics in Cummings\u2019s political thinking: it\u2019s largely about the operational process, not about the substantive aims, and there does not seem to be much feel for the irresolvable conflicts over fundamental values that are at the heart of political life. He extols the speed at which the denizens of Parc got things done: meetings in the political world, by contrast, \u201ctend to be just jibber-jabber\u201d. He has a natural antipathy to entities that seem to him to do little but block innovation \u2013 professional associations, the civil service, trade unions, big organisations generally. His ideal form of government is one that operates like a small start-up: a few bright guys (they mostly seem to be guys), some unconventional thinking, no red tape and hey presto, something actually gets done. If Cummings has some claims to be regarded as an intellectual among technocrats, there is also a sense in which he is a technocrat among intellectuals. He is far more interested in abstract ideas than most technocrats, but he is far more interested in results than most intellectuals.</p> <p>A striking further aspect of Cummings\u2019s worldview is a lively conviction that total disaster for humanity may be right around the corner: as he says darkly, \u201cit\u2019s just a matter of when\u201d. Think about the possibility of pathogens escaping from high-security bio-labs and causing a global pandemic: we urgently need to be testing these labs\u2019 security by setting up a new team that should include \u201cspecialist criminals\u201d (well, yes, I suppose they are the experts in \u201ctesting security\u201d). Or again, if you can understand probability \u2013 few can, in his view \u2013 then you will know that the Earth will be destroyed by an asteroid before long unless we do something about it: \u201cWe know this for sure\u201d. One major reason for exploring outer space is to find somewhere habitable in which humans can sit out the destruction of the Earth (no, really), \u201cthus avoiding the difficult problems of keeping humans alive for thousands of years on spaceships\u201d (just when you thought you had enough to worry about). Existential paranoia on a galactic scale is, it seems, the new normal.</p> <p>But no summary does justice to the fizz and energy of his forays into the world of ideas. Here\u2019s a representative example of Cummings wearing his historian-of-ideas hat:</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have learned about our world vindicates the <em>evolutionary</em> perspective of the pre-Socratics (Anaximander, Heraclitus), Thucydides, Hume, Smith, Darwin, and Hayek over the <em>anthropocentric</em> perspective of Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Hobbes, Rousseau (\u201cthe general will\u201d), Bentham, Mill (who introduced the concept of the \u201cnatural monopoly\u201d) and Marx. Evolutionary biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and behavioural genetics have undermined the basis for Descartes\u2019 Ghost in the Machine, Locke\u2019s Blank Slate, and Rousseau\u2019s Noble Savage and have established a scientific basis for exploring a universal human nature. Economic theory, practice, and experiment have undermined the basis for Cartesian central planning: decentralised coordination via market prices is generally a better method for dealing with vast numbers of possibilities than Cartesian or Soviet planning, though obviously markets have problems particularly with monetary policy and financial regulation.\u201d</p> <p>There is a grandeur and sweep here that it is hard not be impressed by. Just think: all those big names in the second list \u2013 they all got it wrong. It turns out that evolution and neuroscience and all that neat stuff explain everything. Descartes and Soviet planning can be put in the same box because they\u2019re both about people deciding things, and that\u2019s so last millennium.</p> <p>But wait \u2013 aren\u2019t some people playing for the wrong team? If the first group are all about impersonal evolutionary systems and the second about individual human reasoners, shouldn\u2019t Marx be in (perhaps even captain of) the first team? Come to that, is Thucydides such an evolutionary thinker, or doesn\u2019t he emphasise the power of unchanging basic human motives in a way that has some affinities with, let\u2019s say, Hobbes? (Certainly that was Hobbes\u2019s own view.)</p> <p>The point is not to juggle the team selections so much as to wonder whether any useful historical purpose can be served by operating at such a high, and high-handed, level of generality. The differences among the names on the first list alone are far more interesting than any putative common characteristic. But also, is there really a logical connection between the diverse ideas of the first group and a commitment to markets, or is that list of big names a cross between window-dressing and bullying? Aren\u2019t we moving a tad quickly to the conclusion that prices do better than planning? (It\u2019s hard to know what \u201cCartesian planning\u201d would look like: \u201cI think, therefore I plan\u201d?)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"134db883ce1668e7a5a753da613b0eabd8328200\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/134db883ce1668e7a5a753da613b0eabd8328200/0_45_3937_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings at the Conservative party conference in Manchester, September 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings at the Conservative party conference in Manchester, September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In so far as there is a consistent politics here, it looks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/18/neoliberalism-the-idea-that-changed-the-world\" title=\"\">Hayekian</a> \u2013 that is, akin to the anti-statist thinking of the Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek, whose 1944 book The Road to Serfdom influentially argued that central planning was inimical to liberty as well as being ultimately self-defeating. He quotes with approval Hayek\u2019s dictum that \u201corder generated without design can far outstrip plans men consciously contrive\u201d. Cummings scorns traditional political labels, but his admiration for single-minded entrepreneurs, his obsession with the role of off-the-scale IQ and his belief in self-regulating economic systems scarcely make him a promising recruit for the left.</p> <p>More generally, it\u2019s hard to know how one could decide whether his \u201cOdyssean education\u201d essay, which his subsequent blogs draw upon extensively, is a) an astonishing intellectual tour de force knowledgably knitting together material from a wide range of disciplines, or b) a load of cod-science based on cobbling together hasty conclusions from random reading. Rather to my surprise, I now think it\u2019s more of the first than the second. A lot of the time I found myself struggling to keep up, while admiring the sheer intellectual courage involved in trespassing so daringly. At other times, I felt I had been backed into a corner at a party by a wild-eyed obsessive jabbing his finger into my chest and saying, \u201cNot many people know this, but \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>Cummings clearly has a talent as well as an enthusiasm for expounding really quite technical scientific ideas. Even I had moments, reading his account, where I thought I half-understood something of what is involved in, say, sequencing the genome. But at other times, the jump from the science to the policy seemed altogether too confident to be persuasive. For example:</p> <p>\u201cMost of our politics is still conducted with the morality and the language of the simple primitive hunter-gatherer tribe\u2026 Our \u2018chimp politics\u2019 has an evolutionary logic: our powerful evolved instinct to <em>conform</em> to a group view is a flip-side of our evolved in-group <em>solidarity</em> and <em>hostility</em> to out-groups \u2026 This partly explains the persistent popularity of collectivist policies \u2026 and why \u2018groupthink\u2019 is a recurring disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Whoa, hold on! There is a good reason why all attempts to draw a straightforward inference for current social life from something referred to as \u201cevolution\u201d always end up with a lot of egg on face: the supposed \u201cevolutionary logic\u201d explains everything and nothing. No amount of Attenborough-like attention to the gambolling of chimps in trees (a gaze already vitiated by its anthropomorphising tendencies) can yield an explanation for the \u201cpersistent popularity of collectivist policies\u201d. After all, quite a few \u201cchimps\u201d, it turns out, prefer to vote Tory. And anyway, why is the popularity of \u201ccollectivist policies\u201d any more in need of deep (and in some sense discrediting) explanation than that of, say, individualist policies? Somewhere along the journey from the science to the politics, an awful lot of non-scientific baggage seems to have got stacked on the wagon.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Dominic Cummings is now, in effect, the country\u2019s project manager. He\u2019s the Downing Street version of the Deliveroo guy who doesn\u2019t care whether you\u2019ve ordered pepperoni or four-cheese: his job is to make it happen, and if that involves cycling the wrong way up one-way streets then that\u2019s probably a plus. His writing displays an alarming ability to focus on a goal to the exclusion of noticing, or caring about, any amount of collateral damage. Emotions mostly figure as forms of irrational distraction. Toes, after all, were put in the world largely to be trodden on. People around him don\u2019t have to <em>take</em> umbrage: he gives it to them, makes a present of it, with a liberality that would put a drunk in a bar to shame. He knows he has the intellectual firepower to be able to say: \u201cGet your thinktanks off my lawn.\u201d</p> <p>Cummings himself quotes William James\u2019s pronouncement: \u201cWhen superior intellect and a psychopathic temperament coalesce \u2026 we have the best possible conditions for the kind of effective genius that gets into the biographical dictionaries.\u201d It may be that that\u2019s how we should think of Cummings \u2013 as \u201can effective genius\u201d, or, rather, a genius of effectiveness. He is admirably committed to learning from science and to basing policies on evidence in a more than cursory way, but in the end, delivery is the point. \u201cGet x done\u201d, where (we might pseudo-mathematically say) the value of x equals a multiple of results from focus groups plus the square root of whatever appears to favour breakout thinking.</p> <p>I would hesitate to treat Cummings as representative of anything: he\u2019s made being a one-off into an art form. But in so far as his writing chimes with certain contemporary cultural traits, perhaps one common element is a kind of dismissive impatience. The widely remarked decline of deference over the past couple of generations has been welcome on several counts, but in many quarters it has gone along with an unwillingness to find much of value or interest in anything that doesn\u2019t speak directly to one\u2019s own wishes in the present. When expressed in political terms, this kind of impatience is obviously not a monopoly of the left or the right; if anything, it can tend towards a rejection of the traditional forms of politics and political debate altogether. When combined with a fascination with the potential of science and technology, this urge translates into a form of technocracy; when laced with a hostility to traditional \u201celites\u201d, this generates that distinctive modern hybrid, populist technocracy. Screw all those convoluted arguments: this is what we want, let\u2019s get it done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain\">PPE: the Oxford degree that runs Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may be that the left has more to fear than the right from this irritable dismissal of political argument, since any progressive politics is reliant on reasoned discourse in making the case against the injustices of the status quo, and such discourse is inevitably a laborious, uneven business, much indebted to the thinking of earlier generations. Cummings is clearly not a conventional Tory, but perhaps his impatient individualism does express one of the most fundamental structures of feeling informing contemporary attitudes towards politics \u2013 one that the left needs to challenge rather than simply to accommodate.</p> <p>There is a long tradition of advisers to princes sharing their political understanding with the rest of us. To take just the best-known example, Machiavelli\u2019s reflections after working in Renaissance Florence\u2019s equivalent of Whitehall became a classic. Nothing Cummings has written up till now is in this league, but it will be interesting to see what he produces once he has laid down his carrier bag. Thus far, if there\u2019s timeless political wisdom here, it\u2019s more Warren Buffett than Walter Bagehot (Buffett is another of Cummings\u2019s heroes, a model of focus). But I suspect his place in future \u201cbiographical dictionaries\u201d will depend more on what he does than what he writes, despite all the indisputable power of mind exhibited in his forays into recent quantitative and biological research. And from that perspective, I only hope that, rather than figuring as an amalgam of Thucydides and Stephen Hawking, he doesn\u2019t end up looking more like an unnerving cross between Robespierre and Dr Strangelove.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the prime minister of the day describes you as a \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d, your chances of preferment in the political world may not seem rosy. When associates of a leading minister refer to you as \u201cthat jumped-up oik\u201d, you may sense you\u2019re not winning friends in high places. When a senior official in the department where you are employed calls you \u201ca mutant virus\u201d, you may feel less than wholly accepted. And when a prominent MP in the party you work for denounces you as \u201can unelected foul-mouthed oaf\u201d, it may seem that the game is up. Furnished with these testimonials, some downsizing of career ambitions may appear to be in order. But Dominic Cummings has never played by the rules, and now, as Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief-of-staff, he has become perhaps the most powerful unelected political figure in the country. He thus has an exceptional opportunity to put his ideas into practice. But what are his ideas? Commentators seem vaguely aware that, although he studied history at university, he has dabbled in more than one scientific discipline over the years, but no one, it appears, has really tried to take the measure of Cummings as a serious thinker. There has, of course, been no shortage of comment on the various roles he has played in British political life in the last couple of decades. He came to the fore as a special adviser to the Tory politician Michael Gove between 2007 and 2013 (ie both before and during Gove\u2019s tumultuous years as secretary of state for education); he attracted further attention as the chief administrative mastermind behind the successful leave campaign in the 2016 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU; and when Boris Johnson became prime minister in July 2019, Cummings was installed as his chief aide, directing operations from within Downing Street. What may be less well known is that for much of this period Cummings has maintained an unusual blog, where he has posted extensive ruminations on his reading, enthusiastic reports about breakthroughs in science and pungent contributions to debates about education, spicing the mix with some notably unbuttoned ad hominem side-swipes \u2013 for example, describing David Davis, then the Brexit minister, as \u201cthick as mince\u201d. Several of these posts have an intrinsic intellectual interest, but, given his current role at the heart of power, they may also yield insights into the thinking of someone whose ideas could soon have consequences for all of us. I can\u2019t honestly claim to do much by way of community service but, as some twisted equivalent of a new year resolution, I decided I would sacrifice myself for the common good in January by spending the greater part of the month reading The Complete Blogs of Dominic Cummings. Well, perhaps not quite complete, as I have only gone back to 2013 and I have skipped several of the more functional or repetitive pieces, but I have more than compensated for any light-footed skimming by reading all 133,000 words of his magnum opus, posted in 2014 and titled \u201cSome thoughts on education and political priorities\u201d, in which he described his ideal of \u201can Odyssean education\u201d. What follows is my report on this unusual body of work. * * * Dominic Cummings is the best-known unknown historian of ideas in the country. Learned contributions to this scholarly field are, of course, not what he is celebrated for, but a surprising amount of what he writes falls under this label. He is fascinated by ideas \u2013 partly fascinated by their beauty and power, partly fascinated in the same way as a small boy is fascinated by firecrackers that can be let off behind unsuspecting old ladies. In Cummings\u2019s view, the world seems to be largely populated by old ladies, metaphorically speaking \u2013 timid, easily spooked people whom he delights in unsettling. But his firecrackers are assembled from genuine scientific components. Cummings is knowledgeable about an impressive variety of disciplines, and from this formidable if eclectic reading he has attempted to synthesise ideas he believes would transform the way the world is run (lack of ambition is not a defect of his thinking). The sense in which I am, tongue only slightly in cheek, calling him a \u201chistorian of ideas\u201d is that he traces in some detail the evolution of the ideas that interest him, and gives us, especially in his remarkable book-length essay on the elements of a university curriculum that comprise his \u201cOdyssean education\u201d, a crash course in the history of mathematics, physics, genetics, psychology, economics and much more. He takes the term \u201cOdyssean education\u201d from the Nobel-winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, referring to \u201can education that starts with the biggest questions and problems and teaches people to understand connections between them\u201d. The aim would be to \u201ctrain synthesisers\u201d. He appears contemptuous of most politicians, almost all media commentators, and all civil servants: none of these people really understand statistical modelling, quantum computation, synthetic biology, and so on. (Too many of them studied PPE (philosophy, politics and economics) at Oxford University \u2013 which, in his view, just turns duffers into bluffers.) As a result, they make or encourage poor decisions. Better \u201cproject management in complex organisations\u201d is what we need, and his essay sketches a wide-ranging syllabus that would educate the effective decision-makers of the future. More broadly, Cummings repeatedly argues that the processes of government need to include 1) a number of outstanding scientists capable of bringing fundamental science to bear on policy formation, and 2) a general level of scientific and numerical literacy such that MPs, officials, journalists and others can understand basic scientific discoveries and their significance. The overall aim should be to make the UK \u201cthe leading country for education and science\u201d. At times, he can make this seem like the merest common sense; at other times he sounds like CP Snow on speed (Snow\u2019s Two Cultures lecture of 1959 is mainly remembered for its ardent advocacy of the need for scientific literacy among policymakers). He has attained an impressive level of scientific understanding himself, but with it has come more than a touch of the boffin\u2019s bee-filled bonnet. A good example of this unsteady combination is provided by his attempt to imagine the effect that genome-sequencing may have on the NHS in terms of identifying risk factors for certain diseases, eliminating congenital defects, and so on. The potential benefits and efficiencies are certainly striking. But he cannot resist going further, a little too quickly: \u201cWe will soon be able to re-make human nature itself,\u201d he writes. No point in pussy-footing around just doing hip replacements \u2013 let\u2019s do a complete makeover while we\u2019re in there. As all this suggests, Cummings is undeniably clever, even if not always notably judicious. Intellectual restlessness is one of his hallmarks: his capacity to stretch his mind, to absorb new ideas, to see parallels and analogies that jump across the tracks, is constantly on display. He is an Oxford history graduate who has turned himself into a numbers guy, or at least into the frontman for the numbers people \u2013 someone who understands enough of what they do to make the case for its importance to the rest of us. He says he\u2019s happy to be told where he\u2019s wrong, though you can\u2019t help feeling that he doesn\u2019t expect there will be much call for such frankness. And there are any number of things he is right about, or anyway right-ish. One is the foolishness of diverting funding away from basic \u201cblue skies\u201d scientific research in order to promote more applied work. Governments are prone to think that doing this will lead to more immediately useful outcomes, and hence it will be easier to justify the public expenditure involved, but the historical record is against them. Over and over again, theoretical enquiries that looked at the time to have no useful application turn out to be what enabled various later practical advances and inventions, from code-breaking to computers. Cummings understands this: he not only prioritises basic science, but he gets the need to give people the autonomy and security to explore not obviously useful-looking avenues of enquiry. At times, he can seem to flirt with a kind of anarchic libertarianism, attracted by a vision of unconstrained individual creativity, but against this is his recognition of the need for central state funding of basic science. He rightly stresses the role of federal funding in providing the research base for the Silicon Valley phenomenon in the US, for example, and he looks favourably on institutions such as the CNRS in France that are designed to sustain research on a long-term basis. (He also says, rather gnomically, that he is not a libertarian because it\u2019s \u201cnot consistent with evolutionary biology\u201d.) Overall he is surely right that public debate desperately needs more statistical literacy, as well as a better appreciation of the long-term benefits of basic research. Cummings\u2019s call for a curriculum that might combine, say, maths, science and history is driven by his focus on \u201cproject management\u201d in politics. Such an education would, he contends, provide a training in the calculation of probabilities when weighing competing proposals. But there is a recurring difficulty with schemes that attempt to build in \u201cinterdisciplinarity\u201d from the start. Yes, it sounds great to scorn those who are \u201cstuck in their disciplinary silos\u201d and to laud imaginative thinkers who address the really \u201cbig problems\u201d, and so on, but the fact is that you can\u2019t educate someone to be interdisciplinary. You have to educate them in particular disciplines (possibly more than one), and then set up more specific or temporary or opportunistic arrangements for bringing them together and cross-pollinating. If we are to stay on Cummings\u2019s preferred ground of intellectual history, we would have to point out that, in modern times, nearly all the influential ideas and great discoveries have come from people working within a particular discipline. Specialisation is the precondition of intellectual advance, even if subsequent interdisciplinary thinking can then sometimes be an effective way to address complex practical problems. In his ambitious intellectual and educational synthesis there are some obvious, and rather predictable, lacunae. He is dismissive of most of the social sciences, especially sociology and anthropology, precisely because they purport to explore the distinctive power of \u201cthe social\u201d: their practitioners are mostly \u201ccharlatans\u201d. Here he sounds like a souped-up version of Margaret Thatcher: there is no such thing as \u201csociety\u201d, just the patterned interaction of evolutionarily moulded individuals. There are frequent irritable swipes at something called \u201cFrench literary theory\u201d and the damage it has allegedly done to the humanities; here we seem to be encountering nothing more than a lazy journalistic stereotype, a headline-happy approach that contrasts so strikingly with the care with which he expounds ideas from, say, evolutionary psychology. His voluminous writings suggest no cultivated interest in the study of art or music, nor, a few allusions to Dostoevsky and Tolstoy aside, in literature, or anyway not in literary criticism, though one wonders whether he might not have a taste for certain forms of science fiction. A few philosophers get walk-on parts (he quotes Nietzsche fairly often, but then who doesn\u2019t?), but on the whole he seems to treat modern philosophy, certainly the discipline of academic philosophy, as an irrelevance or an obstruction. Although he expresses a general commitment to including the humanities in his synthesis, in practice they (with the exception of history) seem marginal to his main interests. * * * However, there is another omission that is less predictable, yet, in its way, more revealing. Cummings is practically silent about jurisprudence and the law. (In his diatribes against the always obstructive civil service, \u201clegal arguments\u201d are occasionally mentioned, but only to be swatted aside as another typical ruse by these masters of delay.) This is significant because legal systems and legal reasoning involve attempts to draw up general rules and procedures to govern human interaction. The law, especially in a common-law system, is a historical enterprise in a way that Cummings should, in principle, approve of. That is to say, it seeks constantly to modify the agreed rules in the light of new circumstances; in this respect, it is one large feedback loop. And it attempts to take into account not just the purposes informing any given individual\u2019s actions, but the likely effect of such actions on the interests of others, now and in the future. Accumulated legal reasoning becomes, therefore, the great repository of wisdom about the social consequences of allowing this action or preventing that action, and it is, in an important sense, no respecter of persons: no one, as the phrase has it, is above the law. Great leaders, revolutionaries, \u201cmen of action\u201d and over-confident mavericks of all types always want to sweep the law aside, seeing only its negative character as a slow-moving body of outdated constraints on freedom of action \u2013 but that, of course, suggests why it is so precious. There\u2019s a fine exchange in Robert Bolt\u2019s play A Man for All Seasons between Sir Thomas More, the lord chancellor who was to be executed for his opposition to Henry VIII\u2019s break with Rome, and his earnest son-in-law, William Roper, in which Roper says he would cut down every law in England to get after the Devil, and More replies: \u201cOh? And, when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you \u2013 where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?\u201d More\u2019s point, of course, is that if, when we have the power, we impatiently strike down all the laws that stand in our way, we shall have no protections to turn to when power is in the hands of others. Cummings writes from the perspective of someone who\u2019s in a hurry to get the thing done, never from the perspective of the judge who has been schooled to reflect on the potentially damaging consequences in the future of licensing this particular action in the present. To balance Cummings\u2019s imagined course of maths, science and history, I could, teasingly, suggest that a no less valuable preparation for public life might be a combination of philosophy, jurisprudence and literature. Philosophy would introduce habits of analysis and undermine certainty or dogmatism; jurisprudence would teach an appreciation of rules, procedures and the judgment of consequences; and the study of literature would weaken the hold of cliche and all exaggerated beliefs in the fixity of meaning. It might be said, not altogether unfairly, that Cummings\u2019s course would produce doers and mine would produce critics (though the disciplines I suggest constantly generate new ideas rather than merely criticising old ones), but I would say that a healthy politics needs both, and that the more we emphasise the first category and try to give its occupants their head, the more we need the virtues of the second category to hold them in check. Cummings, of course, believes that this is just what we don\u2019t need. We \u201cdon\u2019t want more Oxbridge English graduates who chat about Lacan at dinner parties with TV producers and spread fake news about fake news\u201d, he wrote last month. This is an economical bit of target practice \u2013 everyone knows, don\u2019t they, that one can hardly move in north London these days without falling over \u201cchat about Lacan at dinner parties\u201d \u2013 but there may be deeper cultural antagonisms at work here. The datedness of the jibe about Lacan may suggest a long-nurtured touchiness. At one point Cummings says of himself, rather engagingly, \u201cI am not articulate\u201d, but you sense that he doesn\u2019t particularly rate articulateness in the first place. So much of what others think of as \u201cculture\u201d he regards as \u201cnoise\u201d. Perhaps his recent call for \u201csuper-talented weirdos\u201d to apply for staff jobs in Downing Street should be seen as something of a dating pitch. * * * In Cummings\u2019s ontology, the world appears to be made up of an extremely small number of outstandingly clever individuals and a mass of mediocrities. Human progress depends on giving those with the highest IQ (he\u2019s very keen on the notion of IQ) the education that will allow them fully to develop their talents and then the freedom to apply them. His culture heroes are those few outstanding mathematicians and scientists who fundamentally changed a whole intellectual field, such as Kurt G\u00f6del, John von Neumann and Richard Feynman. He has an abiding interest not just in what kinds of conditions have favoured scientific breakthroughs in the past and how we might replicate those today, but even more in the organisational or management processes that enabled complex, long-term, science-based projects to translate brilliant new ideas into successful practical outcomes, such as Nasa (putting the first man on the moon) or Parc (the Palo Alto Research Center, which was the foundation of Silicon Valley\u2019s triumphs), and he gives illuminating accounts of their modus operandi. Just how far such procedures could be transferred to the muddy, shifting, contested world of politics is an open question, but Cummings insists they would be a big improvement on what we have now. Politics is, by definition, the terrain of conflicting convictions, and although in principle Cummings lauds the idea of \u201cfeedback\u201d and the correction of error, in practice he seems to struggle with the idea of genuine intellectual disagreement. There are traces of that kind of absolute certainty that is more often shown by fellow-travellers of science rather than by first-rate scientists themselves. And he is a bit quick to write off opposition to his ideas as yet another example of the self-protective vested interests of the establishment (as the maverick\u2019s maverick, he, of course, is not part of \u201cthe establishment\u201d). \u201cThe political-media system actively suppresses thinking about, and focus on, what\u2019s important\u201d, he writes. One of the things that irks him about politics is that it involves so much damn talk. For example, he speaks contemptuously of the debate about the EU referendum in 2016, the outcome of which he played such a signal part in influencing: \u201cMost of the \u2018debate\u2019 was moronic as political debate always is.\u201d At least he cannot be accused of seeking cheap popularity. In a curious way, there is very little politics in Cummings\u2019s political thinking: it\u2019s largely about the operational process, not about the substantive aims, and there does not seem to be much feel for the irresolvable conflicts over fundamental values that are at the heart of political life. He extols the speed at which the denizens of Parc got things done: meetings in the political world, by contrast, \u201ctend to be just jibber-jabber\u201d. He has a natural antipathy to entities that seem to him to do little but block innovation \u2013 professional associations, the civil service, trade unions, big organisations generally. His ideal form of government is one that operates like a small start-up: a few bright guys (they mostly seem to be guys), some unconventional thinking, no red tape and hey presto, something actually gets done. If Cummings has some claims to be regarded as an intellectual among technocrats, there is also a sense in which he is a technocrat among intellectuals. He is far more interested in abstract ideas than most technocrats, but he is far more interested in results than most intellectuals. A striking further aspect of Cummings\u2019s worldview is a lively conviction that total disaster for humanity may be right around the corner: as he says darkly, \u201cit\u2019s just a matter of when\u201d. Think about the possibility of pathogens escaping from high-security bio-labs and causing a global pandemic: we urgently need to be testing these labs\u2019 security by setting up a new team that should include \u201cspecialist criminals\u201d (well, yes, I suppose they are the experts in \u201ctesting security\u201d). Or again, if you can understand probability \u2013 few can, in his view \u2013 then you will know that the Earth will be destroyed by an asteroid before long unless we do something about it: \u201cWe know this for sure\u201d. One major reason for exploring outer space is to find somewhere habitable in which humans can sit out the destruction of the Earth (no, really), \u201cthus avoiding the difficult problems of keeping humans alive for thousands of years on spaceships\u201d (just when you thought you had enough to worry about). Existential paranoia on a galactic scale is, it seems, the new normal. But no summary does justice to the fizz and energy of his forays into the world of ideas. Here\u2019s a representative example of Cummings wearing his historian-of-ideas hat: \u201cWhat we have learned about our world vindicates the evolutionary perspective of the pre-Socratics (Anaximander, Heraclitus), Thucydides, Hume, Smith, Darwin, and Hayek over the anthropocentric perspective of Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Hobbes, Rousseau (\u201cthe general will\u201d), Bentham, Mill (who introduced the concept of the \u201cnatural monopoly\u201d) and Marx. Evolutionary biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and behavioural genetics have undermined the basis for Descartes\u2019 Ghost in the Machine, Locke\u2019s Blank Slate, and Rousseau\u2019s Noble Savage and have established a scientific basis for exploring a universal human nature. Economic theory, practice, and experiment have undermined the basis for Cartesian central planning: decentralised coordination via market prices is generally a better method for dealing with vast numbers of possibilities than Cartesian or Soviet planning, though obviously markets have problems particularly with monetary policy and financial regulation.\u201d There is a grandeur and sweep here that it is hard not be impressed by. Just think: all those big names in the second list \u2013 they all got it wrong. It turns out that evolution and neuroscience and all that neat stuff explain everything. Descartes and Soviet planning can be put in the same box because they\u2019re both about people deciding things, and that\u2019s so last millennium. But wait \u2013 aren\u2019t some people playing for the wrong team? If the first group are all about impersonal evolutionary systems and the second about individual human reasoners, shouldn\u2019t Marx be in (perhaps even captain of) the first team? Come to that, is Thucydides such an evolutionary thinker, or doesn\u2019t he emphasise the power of unchanging basic human motives in a way that has some affinities with, let\u2019s say, Hobbes? (Certainly that was Hobbes\u2019s own view.) The point is not to juggle the team selections so much as to wonder whether any useful historical purpose can be served by operating at such a high, and high-handed, level of generality. The differences among the names on the first list alone are far more interesting than any putative common characteristic. But also, is there really a logical connection between the diverse ideas of the first group and a commitment to markets, or is that list of big names a cross between window-dressing and bullying? Aren\u2019t we moving a tad quickly to the conclusion that prices do better than planning? (It\u2019s hard to know what \u201cCartesian planning\u201d would look like: \u201cI think, therefore I plan\u201d?) In so far as there is a consistent politics here, it looks Hayekian \u2013 that is, akin to the anti-statist thinking of the Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek, whose 1944 book The Road to Serfdom influentially argued that central planning was inimical to liberty as well as being ultimately self-defeating. He quotes with approval Hayek\u2019s dictum that \u201corder generated without design can far outstrip plans men consciously contrive\u201d. Cummings scorns traditional political labels, but his admiration for single-minded entrepreneurs, his obsession with the role of off-the-scale IQ and his belief in self-regulating economic systems scarcely make him a promising recruit for the left. More generally, it\u2019s hard to know how one could decide whether his \u201cOdyssean education\u201d essay, which his subsequent blogs draw upon extensively, is a) an astonishing intellectual tour de force knowledgably knitting together material from a wide range of disciplines, or b) a load of cod-science based on cobbling together hasty conclusions from random reading. Rather to my surprise, I now think it\u2019s more of the first than the second. A lot of the time I found myself struggling to keep up, while admiring the sheer intellectual courage involved in trespassing so daringly. At other times, I felt I had been backed into a corner at a party by a wild-eyed obsessive jabbing his finger into my chest and saying, \u201cNot many people know this, but \u2026 \u201d Cummings clearly has a talent as well as an enthusiasm for expounding really quite technical scientific ideas. Even I had moments, reading his account, where I thought I half-understood something of what is involved in, say, sequencing the genome. But at other times, the jump from the science to the policy seemed altogether too confident to be persuasive. For example: \u201cMost of our politics is still conducted with the morality and the language of the simple primitive hunter-gatherer tribe\u2026 Our \u2018chimp politics\u2019 has an evolutionary logic: our powerful evolved instinct to conform to a group view is a flip-side of our evolved in-group solidarity and hostility to out-groups \u2026 This partly explains the persistent popularity of collectivist policies \u2026 and why \u2018groupthink\u2019 is a recurring disaster.\u201d Whoa, hold on! There is a good reason why all attempts to draw a straightforward inference for current social life from something referred to as \u201cevolution\u201d always end up with a lot of egg on face: the supposed \u201cevolutionary logic\u201d explains everything and nothing. No amount of Attenborough-like attention to the gambolling of chimps in trees (a gaze already vitiated by its anthropomorphising tendencies) can yield an explanation for the \u201cpersistent popularity of collectivist policies\u201d. After all, quite a few \u201cchimps\u201d, it turns out, prefer to vote Tory. And anyway, why is the popularity of \u201ccollectivist policies\u201d any more in need of deep (and in some sense discrediting) explanation than that of, say, individualist policies? Somewhere along the journey from the science to the politics, an awful lot of non-scientific baggage seems to have got stacked on the wagon. * * * Dominic Cummings is now, in effect, the country\u2019s project manager. He\u2019s the Downing Street version of the Deliveroo guy who doesn\u2019t care whether you\u2019ve ordered pepperoni or four-cheese: his job is to make it happen, and if that involves cycling the wrong way up one-way streets then that\u2019s probably a plus. His writing displays an alarming ability to focus on a goal to the exclusion of noticing, or caring about, any amount of collateral damage. Emotions mostly figure as forms of irrational distraction. Toes, after all, were put in the world largely to be trodden on. People around him don\u2019t have to take umbrage: he gives it to them, makes a present of it, with a liberality that would put a drunk in a bar to shame. He knows he has the intellectual firepower to be able to say: \u201cGet your thinktanks off my lawn.\u201d Cummings himself quotes William James\u2019s pronouncement: \u201cWhen superior intellect and a psychopathic temperament coalesce \u2026 we have the best possible conditions for the kind of effective genius that gets into the biographical dictionaries.\u201d It may be that that\u2019s how we should think of Cummings \u2013 as \u201can effective genius\u201d, or, rather, a genius of effectiveness. He is admirably committed to learning from science and to basing policies on evidence in a more than cursory way, but in the end, delivery is the point. \u201cGet x done\u201d, where (we might pseudo-mathematically say) the value of x equals a multiple of results from focus groups plus the square root of whatever appears to favour breakout thinking. I would hesitate to treat Cummings as representative of anything: he\u2019s made being a one-off into an art form. But in so far as his writing chimes with certain contemporary cultural traits, perhaps one common element is a kind of dismissive impatience. The widely remarked decline of deference over the past couple of generations has been welcome on several counts, but in many quarters it has gone along with an unwillingness to find much of value or interest in anything that doesn\u2019t speak directly to one\u2019s own wishes in the present. When expressed in political terms, this kind of impatience is obviously not a monopoly of the left or the right; if anything, it can tend towards a rejection of the traditional forms of politics and political debate altogether. When combined with a fascination with the potential of science and technology, this urge translates into a form of technocracy; when laced with a hostility to traditional \u201celites\u201d, this generates that distinctive modern hybrid, populist technocracy. Screw all those convoluted arguments: this is what we want, let\u2019s get it done. It may be that the left has more to fear than the right from this irritable dismissal of political argument, since any progressive politics is reliant on reasoned discourse in making the case against the injustices of the status quo, and such discourse is inevitably a laborious, uneven business, much indebted to the thinking of earlier generations. Cummings is clearly not a conventional Tory, but perhaps his impatient individualism does express one of the most fundamental structures of feeling informing contemporary attitudes towards politics \u2013 one that the left needs to challenge rather than simply to accommodate. There is a long tradition of advisers to princes sharing their political understanding with the rest of us. To take just the best-known example, Machiavelli\u2019s reflections after working in Renaissance Florence\u2019s equivalent of Whitehall became a classic. Nothing Cummings has written up till now is in this league, but it will be interesting to see what he produces once he has laid down his carrier bag. Thus far, if there\u2019s timeless political wisdom here, it\u2019s more Warren Buffett than Walter Bagehot (Buffett is another of Cummings\u2019s heroes, a model of focus). But I suspect his place in future \u201cbiographical dictionaries\u201d will depend more on what he does than what he writes, despite all the indisputable power of mind exhibited in his forays into recent quantitative and biological research. And from that perspective, I only hope that, rather than figuring as an amalgam of Thucydides and Stephen Hawking, he doesn\u2019t end up looking more like an unnerving cross between Robespierre and Dr Strangelove. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

But I found a place where everything is different. Svetlana is a small village four hours away from St Petersburg. Around 40 people live there in four large houses organised around a farm with a dairy, a bakery and a sauna. The community was established in 1992 as part of the international <a href=\"https://camphillfoundation.org/\">Camphill movement</a>.</p> <p>Based on the principles of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy\">anthroposophy</a>, the latter was founded in Scotland in 1939. There is now a network of more than 100 residential communities around the world providing care for people with disabilities, mental health issues and other special needs. They make up the majority of the people who live in Svetlana. Then there are permanent members of staff and volunteers, who come from all over the world to help. But everyone there is simply referred to as a resident. The village receives occasional governmental funding but is mostly sustained by private donations and subsistence farming. Residents work on the farm, or in the bakery, selling cheese curds and the like to neighbouring villages.</p> <p>Minya, who is resting his head on the table, has lived there for over 20 years. His partner, Tatyana, in the red cardigan, came later. They both have Down\u2019s syndrome. They met in Svetlana and fell in love. Minya works in the bakery, although his health is deteriorating. He is about 50, which for someone with Down\u2019s syndrome is relatively old. Tatyana works as a cook and a cleaner in one of the houses. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I fell in love with the atmosphere of this place \u2013 the goodness, openness, honesty and acceptance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Daily life in Svetlana is very structured, with a tight schedule and lots of ritual. Everyone eats together, three times a day, and says a prayer before the meal. There\u2019s a morning meeting to talk about the business of the day, and movie night on Fridays. Once a week there\u2019s also a Bible study. A resident will always be able to tell you what\u2019s happening next. It\u2019s important for them, it gives a sense of security. </p> <p>From the moment I first arrived, in 2016, I fell in love with the atmosphere of this place \u2013 the goodness, the openness, the honesty, the acceptance. The residents with special needs were so inspiring. At the same time though, precisely what their needs were \u2013 what illness or condition they live with \u2013 was unimportant. In Svetlana, everyone is different, and valued as such. I always found it a little easier to breathe there.</p> <p>Over the course of two years, I went back every month, spending up to a week living in the village. I spent time with the residents working, drawing, listening to music, trying to understand their views on life and their dreams. I always had my camera with me, but I spent the first five months taking photographs I couldn\u2019t use.</p> <p>The first time I photographed Minya and Tatyana, it was difficult. They were performing, clowning around. As soon as the camera wasn\u2019t there, though, they were different people, calm and serious. The village has received a certain amount of media attention, but reporters and photographers only ever come for a few hours at most, and the residents are used to posing for them. It was a new experience for them to have someone come back regularly, and it took a long time before they realised they could just be themselves in front of the camera.</p> <p>So I waited, and waited. And eventually they stopped focusing on what I was doing. I became \u201cMasha (Mary) with camera\u201d, nothing special.</p> <p>I remember the day I took this photograph. It was during break time, when most people go to the bakery for tea and cake and a chat. By this point, no one paid any attention to me. They were just getting on with their lives; the camera was an extension of my hand.</p> <p>Minya and Tatyana were playing. She was putting her hands over his eyes. He was laughing. She was smiling. They were completely wrapped up in each other, oblivious to everyone else. It was so touching.</p> <p>There are a lot of myths and stereotypes about people with Down\u2019s syndrome not knowing what it is to love others. Minya and Tatyana show that isn\u2019t true. They live together in the same room (they have a print of this photograph on the wall). They wear rings, and call each other husband and wife. They care about each other; they carry each other\u2019s worries.</p> <p>One day they had a quarrel. Tatyana was very angry, screaming at Minya, and he took her by the hand, and said: \u201cTatyana, stop it, calm down. Nothing is going to happen. I love you.\u201d Everybody who witnessed that was amazed. It\u2019s not everyone who can find the words so quickly to help their partner calm down. For me that\u2019s what this image is about: love being stronger than stereotypes and limitations. And it sums up my whole experience of Svetlana.

Tatyana was very angry, screaming at Minya, and he took her by the hand, and said: \u201cTatyana, stop it, calm down. Nothing is going to happen. I love you.\u201d Everybody who witnessed that was amazed. It\u2019s not everyone who can find the words so quickly to help their partner calm down. For me that\u2019s what this image is about: love being stronger than stereotypes and limitations. And it sums up my whole experience of Svetlana. I saw a lot of different kinds of love there.

He brought the script of Paths of Glory to United Artists, and took the lead role of Colonel Dax himself. Paths of Glory became a celebrated anti-war film, and confirmed Kubrick\u2019s status as a rising star among American directors. Particularly influential was Kubrick\u2019s use of extended tracking shots in the first world war trenches \u2013 Douglas\u2019 performance, if anything, was slightly more subdued than had hitherto been his habit.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKCmyiljKo0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FKCmyiljKo0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Douglas wanted the lead role in Ben-Hur, but when it went to Charlton Heston he set up his own Roman epic. As is well-known, he turned to Kubrick after firing Spartacus\u2019s original director Anthony Mann a week into the shoot: though having only three feature films under his belt, Kubrick refused to be overawed by the gigantic scale of the project, and handled the star-stuffed cast with aplomb. Perhaps most admirably, Douglas made sure blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo received full credit for his work on the script, thus helping to end the McCarthy-inspired boycott.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ0rdbG2etQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eZ0rdbG2etQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Douglas had once again to take second billing to Lancaster for John Frankenheimer\u2019s tightly wound 1964 cold war thriller Seven Days in May, his follow-up to The Manchurian Candidate. By now Douglas had another company, Joel Productions, and Seven Days was produced through it, with Douglas instrumental in securing Lancaster\u2019s participation. The latter plays a general planning a coup against the US president; Douglas is a colonel who sniffs out the plot and reports it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kkgIe1TI5k\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7kkgIe1TI5k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Though by no means washed up, Douglas found his bull-necked, square-jaw persona in not so much favour as the 60s wore on; this was the age of anti-heroes, and his sort of movies simply weren\u2019t in vogue any more. He didn\u2019t exactly struggle, but found himself more often than not playing heavyweight roles in big, clunking war movies. In Heroes of Telemark, about the sabotage of Norway\u2019s heavy water plants during the second world war, Douglas plays a physicist, but one who joins in the raids.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHqqgfjJQsw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zHqqgfjJQsw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In the late 60s and early 70s, Douglas was still making plenty of films, almost all with big-name directors, such as Is Paris Burning (1966) with R\u00e9n\u00e9 Clement, The Brotherhood (1968) with Martin Ritt, The Arrangement (1969) with Elia Kazan, and There Was a Crooked Man... (1970) with Joseph Mankiewicz. But few were successful \u2013 the real action was going on elsewhere, with the new generation of Hollywood stars and directors. Douglas turned to directing instead; his debut was the 1973 pirate yarn Scalawag. He followed it up with Posse (1975) \u2013 one of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTOh_6tpV0w\">Quentin Tarantino\u2019s favourites</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SEFRWjATqM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5SEFRWjATqM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Douglas finally found a niche with the Movie Brat generation by taking a role in Brian De Palma\u2019s trashy psychic-horror flick The Fury in 1978. Douglas plays a former intelligence man whose psychic son has been squirrelled away by a dodgy security agency; although well out of his comfort zone, generically speaking, Douglas acquitted himself decently.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NENxIu02bvg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NENxIu02bvg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He tried another new genre \u2013 sci-fi \u2013 with 1980\u2019s Saturn 3, alongside Harvey Keitel and Farrah Fawcett. An exercise in deliberate high camp, Saturn 3 was based on an idea by composer John Barry (who was then removed from directorial duties after clashing with Douglas). A flop at the time, it\u2019s now best remembered as the inspiration for the Martin Amis novel Money. Amis worked on the script, and apparently based his novel\u2019s character Lorne Guyland on Douglas.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAGMVR_4ck\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LjAGMVR_4ck?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Douglas\u2019 last film before his stroke in 1996 was the Michael J Fox comedy Greedy, in which he played a rich uncle whose relatives are squabbling openly over their inheritance.

As is well-known, he turned to Kubrick after firing Spartacus\u2019s original director Anthony Mann a week into the shoot: though having only three feature films under his belt, Kubrick refused to be overawed by the gigantic scale of the project, and handled the star-stuffed cast with aplomb. Perhaps most admirably, Douglas made sure blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo received full credit for his work on the script, thus helping to end the McCarthy-inspired boycott. Douglas had once again to take second billing to Lancaster for John Frankenheimer\u2019s tightly wound 1964 cold war thriller Seven Days in May, his follow-up to The Manchurian Candidate. By now Douglas had another company, Joel Productions, and Seven Days was produced through it, with Douglas instrumental in securing Lancaster\u2019s participation. The latter plays a general planning a coup against the US president; Douglas is a colonel who sniffs out the plot and reports it. Though by no means washed up, Douglas found his bull-necked, square-jaw persona in not so much favour as the 60s wore on; this was the age of anti-heroes, and his sort of movies simply weren\u2019t in vogue any more. He didn\u2019t exactly struggle, but found himself more often than not playing heavyweight roles in big, clunking war movies. In Heroes of Telemark, about the sabotage of Norway\u2019s heavy water plants during the second world war, Douglas plays a physicist, but one who joins in the raids. In the late 60s and early 70s, Douglas was still making plenty of films, almost all with big-name directors, such as Is Paris Burning (1966) with R\u00e9n\u00e9 Clement, The Brotherhood (1968) with Martin Ritt, The Arrangement (1969) with Elia Kazan, and There Was a Crooked Man... (1970) with Joseph Mankiewicz. But few were successful \u2013 the real action was going on elsewhere, with the new generation of Hollywood stars and directors. Douglas turned to directing instead; his debut was the 1973 pirate yarn Scalawag. He followed it up with Posse (1975) \u2013 one of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s favourites. Douglas finally found a niche with the Movie Brat generation by taking a role in Brian De Palma\u2019s trashy psychic-horror flick The Fury in 1978. Douglas plays a former intelligence man whose psychic son has been squirrelled away by a dodgy security agency; although well out of his comfort zone, generically speaking, Douglas acquitted himself decently. He tried another new genre \u2013 sci-fi \u2013 with 1980\u2019s Saturn 3, alongside Harvey Keitel and Farrah Fawcett. An exercise in deliberate high camp, Saturn 3 was based on an idea by composer John Barry (who was then removed from directorial duties after clashing with Douglas). A flop at the time, it\u2019s now best remembered as the inspiration for the Martin Amis novel Money. Amis worked on the script, and apparently based his novel\u2019s character Lorne Guyland on Douglas. Douglas\u2019 last film before his stroke in 1996 was the Michael J Fox comedy Greedy, in which he played a rich uncle whose relatives are squabbling openly over their inheritance. Directed by My Cousin Vinny\u2019s Jonathan Lynn, it provided Douglas with a meaty final role in major pictures.",

      "body": "<p>At first glance, Corey Feldman\u2019s house looks ridiculous. A crooked Christmas wreath hangs on the front door, even though it is late January. Feldman\u2019s assistant lets me into the two-storey home in the hills of Los Angeles, and when I walk into the living room I have to bite the insides of my cheeks to stop myself from gasping: hanging above the fireplace is a drawing of Feldman from his 80s teen glory years. The bookcases are packed with vintage toys, most still in their boxes, most from Feldman\u2019s own movies: there\u2019s Goonies merch, Gremlins memorabilia, The Lost Boys souvenirs. And, of course, there are the inevitable posters of his films, including License to Drive and Stand By Me. It\u2019s like a parody of how one might imagine a former child star\u2019s house to look: one part Neverland to two parts Norma Desmond. I haven\u2019t even mentioned the picture of Michael Jackson \u2013 with whom Feldman was friends as a child \u2013 in the front hallway, greeting you as you walk past.</p> <p>I was a big Feldman fan back in the day, and maintain that his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNkPDbARQZo\" title=\"\">performance</a> in Stand By Me equals River Phoenix\u2019s more acclaimed one. But standing in his living room I find myself doing what most others do about Feldman these days: \u201cLook at this guy,\u201d I think, giving in to the siren call of snark. \u201cWhat a joke!\u201d</p> <p>Feldman, 48, eventually appears and he doesn\u2019t look much less absurd than his house. It\u2019s hot outside, but he is in a lavishly patterned shirt, a waistcoat and suit trousers. He still has that thin-lipped wide grin that made him so recognisable as a child actor, but set alongside his skinny build, it now emphasises his jagged, cracked appearance. But he\u2019s very solicitous, making sure I have a drink, that I\u2019m comfortable on the sofa, even though he\u2019s having a terrible day. We\u2019ll get to that, but first, I have to ask, doesn\u2019t he find having all these old toys around him a bit, well, depressing?</p> <p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he says. \u201cThe experiences that were bad weren\u2019t working on Gremlins or Goonies. This is all the fun stuff.\u201d</p> <p>And then I belatedly realise Feldman isn\u2019t showing off his past glories. He\u2019s hugging close the all-too-brief pocket in time when he was starting to get away from his exploitative parents, but before he was sexually molested as a teenager. That tiny sliver of his childhood that was not ruined by the adults who should have been looking after him.</p> <p>Back in the mid to late 80s, Feldman was known for being one of the most popular teen pin-ups in the world. He and his fellow child actor Corey Haim \u2013 best friends and frequent co-stars \u2013 were known as the Two Coreys. Girls covered their schoolbooks in Corey stickers, called up the Coreys\u2019 cash-in phone lines, stood outside their homes screaming. Those days are long gone, and now Feldman is better known for something else. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/11/corey-haim-obituary\" title=\"\">Haim died at the age of 38 in 2010</a> of pneumonia, after years of painfully public substance addiction, Feldman spoke out about the sex abuse he and Haim suffered in the film industry.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest problem in Hollywood,\u201d he repeats, mantra-like, \u201cis paedophilia.\u201d His fellow former child actor Alison Arngrim <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/recent-charges-of-sexual-abuse-of-children-in-hollywood-just-tip-of-iceberg-experts-say\" title=\"\">has said</a>, \u201cI literally heard that [the Two Coreys] were \u2018passed around\u2019. The word was they were given drugs and being used for sex.\u201d</p> <p>According to Feldman, Haim was raped by \u201ca major Hollywood figure\u201d while making the 1986 film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phXMs5yn76Y\" title=\"\">Lucas</a>. Reviewing that film, Roger Ebert predicted that Haim would \u201cgrow into an important actor. He is that good.\u201d He was, but instead he became a bloated and bankrupt shell of a man, forced in later years to appear on reality TV shows in which he was so out of it he hardly knew where he was. \u201cHe made me promise before he died that I would get the truth out,\u201d says Feldman. It would be an understatement to say this has become a crusade for him, much to the dismay of Haim\u2019s mother, Judy, who agrees her son was abused, but says <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/corey-haim-mother-names-his-alleged-abuser/\" title=\"\">Feldman is exploiting his memory</a>.</p> <p>Today, Feldman is pacing around his house anxiously because his long-promised documentary, which he wrote, directed and financed, is likely to be delayed yet again because of a problem with the insurance. It is provisionally titled <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/cory-feldman-truth-the-rape-of-two-coreys-hollywood-abuse-jon-grissom-a8888011.html\" title=\"\">Truth: The Rape of the Two Coreys</a>. Feldman says he not only names his and Haim\u2019s abusers after almost a decade of hints and promises, but also taps into what he insists is a conspiracy to protect them. The fact that he can\u2019t get his film out is, in his eyes, proof of this. \u201cNobody wants to go after the bad guys,\u201d he says and he shows me emails from lawyers denying him access to police reports and video footage. \u201cWhat the hell is really going on here?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>It must drive you crazy with frustration, I say.</p> <p>\u201cDo I look crazy?\u201d he asks, eyes blazing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e59a48434999438b1dd2449885b9a76012fb513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e59a48434999438b1dd2449885b9a76012fb513/0_0_3008_2017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Lost Boys ...

Feldman (right) with Jamison Newlander (left) and Corey Haim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros/Allstar/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The truth is, surrounded by his toys, raging about \u201cdeep, dangerous\u201d conspiracies, yes, he absolutely does. But Harvey Weinstein <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/07/harvey-weinstein-hired-ex-mossad-agents-to-suppress-abuse-allegations-new-yorker-report-claims\" title=\"\">hired ex-Mossad agents</a> to discredit journalists who were investigating him and women who accused him of rape. So crazy can sometimes be the truth.</p> <p>Feldman was born and raised just outside Los Angeles, the son of a largely absent musician father and a former Playboy Club waitress. According to him, his parents looked at their baby, saw a potential money-making machine and sent him to auditions from the age of three. His mother peroxided his hair when he was four and put him on diet pills just a few years later to improve his chances of getting roles. (Feldman legally emancipated himself from his parents when he was a teenager, just as Drew Barrymore and, later, Macaulay Culkin later did, too. The history of child stars and their parents is rarely a happy one.)</p> <p>Feldman worked steadily, progressing from adverts to sitcoms and finally movies. He says he loved being on set with other kids and the chance to get away from what he describes as his miserable home life and occasionally violent parents. He describes this brief happy period in his 2013 memoir, which, like Feldman\u2019s house and Feldman himself, looks at first glance completely absurd. It is called, inevitably, Coreyography, and in the acknowledgments he thanks, among others, Hugh Hefner \u201cand the rest of the Playboy family\u201d and \u201cKatherine Jackson and the Jackson family\u201d.</p> <p>But again, first impressions do Feldman a disservice because Coreyography is pretty good. It evokes that weird bubble in the 80s when Hollywood was suddenly overrun with child stars \u2013 Ricky Schroeder, Sean Astin, the Phoenixes, Ethan Hawke \u2013 as the entertainment industries tapped into the exploding children\u2019s market. Many of these films were made by Steven Spielberg, who comes across in the book as a kindly figure, if, retrospectively, one with questionable judgment. He invited Michael Jackson to his sets and introduced him to the child actors, including Feldman. Spielberg drew the line at allowing the kids to go to Jackson\u2019s hotel room with him, but only because he worried they might be too rambunctious for the pop star.</p> <p>Feldman met Haim when the two were cast in The Lost Boys and it seemed to them that they were destined to be best friends: they had the same name, were the same age (14) and were even the same religion (Jewish). According to Feldman, Haim confided in him that his rapist had told him: \u201cIf you want to be in this business, you have to do these things.\u201d Just a year later, Feldman has said, he was regularly being molested by Jon Grissom, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4832783/jon-grissom-corey-feldman-alleged-paedophile-abuser-hollywood/\" title=\"\">now a convicted paedophile</a>, who was hired by Feldman\u2019s father to look after him. In an attempt to get away from Grissom, Feldman went to stay with a man he calls \u201cRalph Kaufman\u201d in the book, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/who-alphy-hoffman-corey-feldman-reveals-name-third-alleged-child-abuser-710384\" title=\"\">since identified as Alphy Hoffman</a>, who ran a social club for young Hollywood stars. Feldman says he molested him, too. \u201cI needed some normalcy in my life,\u201d Feldman writes in his memoir. His parents weren\u2019t an option, \u201cso I called Michael Jackson\u201d.</p> <p>Two years ago, I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/19/i-want-everyone-to-be-happy-how-rob-reiner-became-a-great-director-and-a-political-hero\" title=\"\">interviewed Rob Reiner</a>, who directed Feldman in Stand By Me, and we discussed the fates of the four young child stars in it: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/25/the-untold-story-of-lost-star-river-phoenix-25-years-after-his-death\" title=\"\">River Phoenix overdosed at 23</a>, Feldman claims he was abused, Wil Wheaton and Jerry O\u2019Connell got through unscathed. I asked Reiner if he thought that reflected a child star\u2019s chances: 50/50 that they would end up OK. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s reflective of child actors exactly, but more about whether child actors have enough of a familial foundation to withstand the difficulties,\u201d Reiner replied. In other words, the problem is the parents, not the movies. After all, despite Feldman\u2019s claims of a conspiracy in the movie business, the few men who he has named so far as abusers were hardly top-level Hollywood executives and unlikely to be protected by anyone.</p> <p>Feldman bristles when I tell him Reiner\u2019s theory. \u201cI think that\u2019s a nice excuse. I love Rob, but he\u2019s off base. What happened to Corey Haim on the set of Lucas was, yes, of course, because his parents were negligent. But there were bad actors on the set who shouldn\u2019t have been there and have been protected since,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fbd56cfc2b4376634e088d6292fa1e2b0181190e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd56cfc2b4376634e088d6292fa1e2b0181190e/0_0_4088_6038/677.jpg\" alt=\"Promo poster for Corey Feldman\u2019s new film.\" width=\"677\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Promo poster for Corey Feldman\u2019s new film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been many rumours over the years about who Haim\u2019s alleged rapist was, and Haim\u2019s mother is not alone in suggesting that Feldman is stringing out the big reveal for his own benefit. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he just name him?\u201d she has said, echoing various journalists\u2019 pleas. Feldman retorts that he can\u2019t because he will be sued. But given that he names the man in his movie, can\u2019t he tell me now?</p> <p>\u201cWell, the insurance hasn\u2019t come through yet,\u201d he reminds me. \u201cAlso I don\u2019t want to give it away because I need people to see the movie.\u201d</p> <p>At 14, Feldman and Haim were two of the biggest young stars in the business. By 19, they were washed up, their addictions rendering them unemployable. Few falls have been faster or crueller. But Feldman insists the drugs were just an excuse for the industry, desperate to wash its hands of them.</p> <p>\u201cWhat person in Hollywood didn\u2019t do cocaine in the 1980s? And how many were publicised? Think about that!\u201d he says. That may be true, but I don\u2019t know of many other Hollywood figures who sold their CD collection to buy crack, as Feldman did, or appeared on TV out of his mind on drugs as much as Haim did. By any standards, Feldman and Haim\u2019s addictions were horrific. Feldman cleaned up in 1995, but, although he continues to act in small projects, his career has never recovered.</p> <p>It infuriates Feldman that while the movie industry pays at least lip service to #MeToo, it has completely ignored his allegations of paedophilia. \u201cThey go to the Sag [Screen Actors Guild] awards and they get all dressed in black and they honour Patricia Arquette. But why was I not invited?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>It may well be that there is a conspiracy of silence around paedophilia \u2013 it still seems bizarre that Haim was omitted from the In Memoriam section of the Academy Awards the year that he died. But there is no getting around the fact that part of the reason Corey Feldman has been ignored is because he is Corey Feldman. He is often portrayed in the media as a sleaze and a crackpot, and he has done plenty to earn both titles. His <a href=\"https://www.wetv.com/shows/marriage-boot-camp-reality-stars-family-edition/videos/season-13/funfactfriday-corey-feldman\" title=\"\">regularity</a><a href=\"https://www.wetv.com/shows/marriage-boot-camp-reality-stars-family-edition/videos/season-13/funfactfriday-corey-feldman\" title=\"\"> on reality TV</a> and decidedly weird appearances on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZX7UJSXCiU\" title=\"\">daytime TV</a> have not helped his credibility; his attempt, a few years back, to turn himself into a 21st-century Hugh Hefner, living with <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/corey-feldman-explains-coreys-angels-938512\" title=\"\">a troupe of lingerie-clad women </a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/corey-feldman-explains-coreys-angels-938512\" title=\"\">known as \u201cCorey\u2019s Angels\u201d</a>, did even less.</p> <p>Does he regret that?</p> <p>\u201cNo, no. It was spun to look like a negative, but it was never a negative,\u201d he insists, his eyes fiery again.</p> <p>At this point, a tall young woman with long blond hair appears and sits quietly behind him. I assume she is his PR, but she turns out to be his wife, Courtney, a former Corey\u2019s Angel.</p> <p>\u201cCourtney\u2019s life was saved because of the Angels, because what we were doing was helping girls. I said: \u2018I want to give you the opportunity to not have to sell yourself or be a stripper or porn star. We\u2019re going to give you the support you need, like a family would, so that you don\u2019t need to go do those things,\u2019\u201d he insists, outraged that his desire to save women by moving them into his house, and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wd4ezq/i-went-to-corey-feldmans-birthday-party\" title=\"\">charging men to attend parties with them</a>, has been so egregiously misunderstood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5c10a6dae92ad9075a08a51ff9233e547e3289de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c10a6dae92ad9075a08a51ff9233e547e3289de/0_0_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I needed some normalcy in my life ... so I called Michael Jackson.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I needed some normalcy in my life ... so I called Michael Jackson.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Pons/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Feldman is right that people do tend to look away from stories of paedophilia. The one recent exception to that rule has been the case against Jackson. Ever since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/25/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland\" title=\"\">Dan Reed\u2019s documentary, Leaving Neverland</a>, was aired last year, most people have accepted that Jackson was, in all likelihood, a paedophile. Except for Feldman. Seemingly determined to constantly undermine his own cause, Feldman has scoffed at Jackson\u2019s accusers and insisted Jackson never touched him in all the time they spent together. After enormous online criticism, Feldman rowed back a little last year, saying: \u201cI cannot in good conscience defend anyone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/04/the-michael-jackson-accusers-the-abuse-didnt-feel-strange-because-he-was-like-a-god\" title=\"\">who\u2019s being accused of such horrendous crimes</a>.\u201d Today he seems to be rowing back on the rowing back; there is, after all, the portrait of Jackson in the front hall and I spot at least one photo of Jackson with Feldman. When I ask about them, Feldman insists his response to the Jackson case is based on experience: he wasn\u2019t abused by Jackson, so of course he defends him. Given that he now styles himself a defender of child victims, this makes little sense, and I suspect the truth is more complicated: he desperately needs to believe that at least one adult from his childhood wasn\u2019t out to damage him.</p> <p>When it comes to sexual assault, victims are often deemed to be not perfect enough: their sexual history too louche, their behaviour afterwards too wild. Yet predators pick off the vulnerable and survivors sometimes process trauma in deeply damaged and self-destructive ways. Instead of these factors being taken as evidence that something terrible has happened, too often they are cited as reasons that the victim should not be believed. The focus is placed on the effect, not the cause.</p> <p>We are going to have to learn how to make room for imperfect victims, and to understand that the key to their stories lies in their imperfections. Few are more imperfect than Feldman. It was easy to believe the accusations against Weinstein when they were coming from such impeccable sources as Ashley Judd and Angelina Jolie. Things are a little more complicated when abuse allegations are coming from a former child star who does wacky things on TV. Really, you need only to look at Feldman and Haim to know that something, somewhere, went extremely wrong. But that requires you to look at them and not turn queasily away.</p> <p>While Feldman and I talk, Hollywood is deep in awards season, and another former child star, Joaquin Phoenix, the brother of Feldman\u2019s late former co-star and friend, is scooping up all the best-actor awards for his performance in Joker. Meanwhile, Feldman is desperately trying to find a way to release his self-funded documentary about the abuse he suffered. There really are no guaranteed paths in life.</p> <p>We talk about his teenage son, Zen, and when I ask if he would let Zen go into the movie business, his eyes pop out in horror: \u201cHell, no!\u201d There is no doubt that Feldman is trying to use his trauma for good: he says he is working with the Screen Actors Guild to improve safeguarding laws for children on movie sets, and he is certain that his movie \u201cwill save thousands\u201d. He just doesn\u2019t understand why people won\u2019t listen to him and why they laugh at him. He mentions another recent article that cast doubt on his credibility. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice, you know? Why would they do that?\u201d he asks, his eyes wide, and he doesn\u2019t sound like a 48-year-old man trying to deal with the media. He sounds like a child who, once again, has been let down by the adults around him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At first glance, Corey Feldman\u2019s house looks ridiculous. A crooked Christmas wreath hangs on the front door, even though it is late January. Feldman\u2019s assistant lets me into the two-storey home in the hills of Los Angeles, and when I walk into the living room I have to bite the insides of my cheeks to stop myself from gasping: hanging above the fireplace is a drawing of Feldman from his 80s teen glory years. The bookcases are packed with vintage toys, most still in their boxes, most from Feldman\u2019s own movies: there\u2019s Goonies merch, Gremlins memorabilia, The Lost Boys souvenirs. And, of course, there are the inevitable posters of his films, including License to Drive and Stand By Me. It\u2019s like a parody of how one might imagine a former child star\u2019s house to look: one part Neverland to two parts Norma Desmond. I haven\u2019t even mentioned the picture of Michael Jackson \u2013 with whom Feldman was friends as a child \u2013 in the front hallway, greeting you as you walk past. I was a big Feldman fan back in the day, and maintain that his performance in Stand By Me equals River Phoenix\u2019s more acclaimed one. But standing in his living room I find myself doing what most others do about Feldman these days: \u201cLook at this guy,\u201d I think, giving in to the siren call of snark. \u201cWhat a joke!\u201d Feldman, 48, eventually appears and he doesn\u2019t look much less absurd than his house. It\u2019s hot outside, but he is in a lavishly patterned shirt, a waistcoat and suit trousers. He still has that thin-lipped wide grin that made him so recognisable as a child actor, but set alongside his skinny build, it now emphasises his jagged, cracked appearance. But he\u2019s very solicitous, making sure I have a drink, that I\u2019m comfortable on the sofa, even though he\u2019s having a terrible day. We\u2019ll get to that, but first, I have to ask, doesn\u2019t he find having all these old toys around him a bit, well, depressing? \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he says. \u201cThe experiences that were bad weren\u2019t working on Gremlins or Goonies. This is all the fun stuff.\u201d And then I belatedly realise Feldman isn\u2019t showing off his past glories. He\u2019s hugging close the all-too-brief pocket in time when he was starting to get away from his exploitative parents, but before he was sexually molested as a teenager. That tiny sliver of his childhood that was not ruined by the adults who should have been looking after him. Back in the mid to late 80s, Feldman was known for being one of the most popular teen pin-ups in the world. He and his fellow child actor Corey Haim \u2013 best friends and frequent co-stars \u2013 were known as the Two Coreys. Girls covered their schoolbooks in Corey stickers, called up the Coreys\u2019 cash-in phone lines, stood outside their homes screaming. Those days are long gone, and now Feldman is better known for something else. After Haim died at the age of 38 in 2010 of pneumonia, after years of painfully public substance addiction, Feldman spoke out about the sex abuse he and Haim suffered in the film industry. \u201cThe biggest problem in Hollywood,\u201d he repeats, mantra-like, \u201cis paedophilia.\u201d His fellow former child actor Alison Arngrim has said, \u201cI literally heard that [the Two Coreys] were \u2018passed around\u2019. The word was they were given drugs and being used for sex.\u201d According to Feldman, Haim was raped by \u201ca major Hollywood figure\u201d while making the 1986 film Lucas. Reviewing that film, Roger Ebert predicted that Haim would \u201cgrow into an important actor. He is that good.\u201d He was, but instead he became a bloated and bankrupt shell of a man, forced in later years to appear on reality TV shows in which he was so out of it he hardly knew where he was. \u201cHe made me promise before he died that I would get the truth out,\u201d says Feldman. It would be an understatement to say this has become a crusade for him, much to the dismay of Haim\u2019s mother, Judy, who agrees her son was abused, but says Feldman is exploiting his memory. Today, Feldman is pacing around his house anxiously because his long-promised documentary, which he wrote, directed and financed, is likely to be delayed yet again because of a problem with the insurance. It is provisionally titled Truth: The Rape of the Two Coreys. Feldman says he not only names his and Haim\u2019s abusers after almost a decade of hints and promises, but also taps into what he insists is a conspiracy to protect them. The fact that he can\u2019t get his film out is, in his eyes, proof of this. \u201cNobody wants to go after the bad guys,\u201d he says and he shows me emails from lawyers denying him access to police reports and video footage. \u201cWhat the hell is really going on here?\u201d he asks. It must drive you crazy with frustration, I say. \u201cDo I look crazy?\u201d he asks, eyes blazing. The truth is, surrounded by his toys, raging about \u201cdeep, dangerous\u201d conspiracies, yes, he absolutely does. But Harvey Weinstein hired ex-Mossad agents to discredit journalists who were investigating him and women who accused him of rape. So crazy can sometimes be the truth. Feldman was born and raised just outside Los Angeles, the son of a largely absent musician father and a former Playboy Club waitress. According to him, his parents looked at their baby, saw a potential money-making machine and sent him to auditions from the age of three. His mother peroxided his hair when he was four and put him on diet pills just a few years later to improve his chances of getting roles. (Feldman legally emancipated himself from his parents when he was a teenager, just as Drew Barrymore and, later, Macaulay Culkin later did, too. The history of child stars and their parents is rarely a happy one.) Feldman worked steadily, progressing from adverts to sitcoms and finally movies. He says he loved being on set with other kids and the chance to get away from what he describes as his miserable home life and occasionally violent parents. He describes this brief happy period in his 2013 memoir, which, like Feldman\u2019s house and Feldman himself, looks at first glance completely absurd. It is called, inevitably, Coreyography, and in the acknowledgments he thanks, among others, Hugh Hefner \u201cand the rest of the Playboy family\u201d and \u201cKatherine Jackson and the Jackson family\u201d. But again, first impressions do Feldman a disservice because Coreyography is pretty good. It evokes that weird bubble in the 80s when Hollywood was suddenly overrun with child stars \u2013 Ricky Schroeder, Sean Astin, the Phoenixes, Ethan Hawke \u2013 as the entertainment industries tapped into the exploding children\u2019s market. Many of these films were made by Steven Spielberg, who comes across in the book as a kindly figure, if, retrospectively, one with questionable judgment. He invited Michael Jackson to his sets and introduced him to the child actors, including Feldman. Spielberg drew the line at allowing the kids to go to Jackson\u2019s hotel room with him, but only because he worried they might be too rambunctious for the pop star. Feldman met Haim when the two were cast in The Lost Boys and it seemed to them that they were destined to be best friends: they had the same name, were the same age (14) and were even the same religion (Jewish). According to Feldman, Haim confided in him that his rapist had told him: \u201cIf you want to be in this business, you have to do these things.\u201d Just a year later, Feldman has said, he was regularly being molested by Jon Grissom, now a convicted paedophile, who was hired by Feldman\u2019s father to look after him. In an attempt to get away from Grissom, Feldman went to stay with a man he calls \u201cRalph Kaufman\u201d in the book, since identified as Alphy Hoffman, who ran a social club for young Hollywood stars. Feldman says he molested him, too. \u201cI needed some normalcy in my life,\u201d Feldman writes in his memoir. His parents weren\u2019t an option, \u201cso I called Michael Jackson\u201d. Two years ago, I interviewed Rob Reiner, who directed Feldman in Stand By Me, and we discussed the fates of the four young child stars in it: River Phoenix overdosed at 23, Feldman claims he was abused, Wil Wheaton and Jerry O\u2019Connell got through unscathed. I asked Reiner if he thought that reflected a child star\u2019s chances: 50/50 that they would end up OK. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s reflective of child actors exactly, but more about whether child actors have enough of a familial foundation to withstand the difficulties,\u201d Reiner replied. In other words, the problem is the parents, not the movies. After all, despite Feldman\u2019s claims of a conspiracy in the movie business, the few men who he has named so far as abusers were hardly top-level Hollywood executives and unlikely to be protected by anyone. Feldman bristles when I tell him Reiner\u2019s theory. \u201cI think that\u2019s a nice excuse. I love Rob, but he\u2019s off base. What happened to Corey Haim on the set of Lucas was, yes, of course, because his parents were negligent. But there were bad actors on the set who shouldn\u2019t have been there and have been protected since,\u201d he says. There have been many rumours over the years about who Haim\u2019s alleged rapist was, and Haim\u2019s mother is not alone in suggesting that Feldman is stringing out the big reveal for his own benefit. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he just name him?\u201d she has said, echoing various journalists\u2019 pleas. Feldman retorts that he can\u2019t because he will be sued. But given that he names the man in his movie, can\u2019t he tell me now? \u201cWell, the insurance hasn\u2019t come through yet,\u201d he reminds me. \u201cAlso I don\u2019t want to give it away because I need people to see the movie.\u201d At 14, Feldman and Haim were two of the biggest young stars in the business. By 19, they were washed up, their addictions rendering them unemployable. Few falls have been faster or crueller. But Feldman insists the drugs were just an excuse for the industry, desperate to wash its hands of them. \u201cWhat person in Hollywood didn\u2019t do cocaine in the 1980s? And how many were publicised? Think about that!\u201d he says. That may be true, but I don\u2019t know of many other Hollywood figures who sold their CD collection to buy crack, as Feldman did, or appeared on TV out of his mind on drugs as much as Haim did. By any standards, Feldman and Haim\u2019s addictions were horrific. Feldman cleaned up in 1995, but, although he continues to act in small projects, his career has never recovered. It infuriates Feldman that while the movie industry pays at least lip service to #MeToo, it has completely ignored his allegations of paedophilia. \u201cThey go to the Sag [Screen Actors Guild] awards and they get all dressed in black and they honour Patricia Arquette. But why was I not invited?\u201d he asks. It may well be that there is a conspiracy of silence around paedophilia \u2013 it still seems bizarre that Haim was omitted from the In Memoriam section of the Academy Awards the year that he died. But there is no getting around the fact that part of the reason Corey Feldman has been ignored is because he is Corey Feldman. He is often portrayed in the media as a sleaze and a crackpot, and he has done plenty to earn both titles. His regularity on reality TV and decidedly weird appearances on daytime TV have not helped his credibility; his attempt, a few years back, to turn himself into a 21st-century Hugh Hefner, living with a troupe of lingerie-clad women known as \u201cCorey\u2019s Angels\u201d, did even less. Does he regret that? \u201cNo, no. It was spun to look like a negative, but it was never a negative,\u201d he insists, his eyes fiery again. At this point, a tall young woman with long blond hair appears and sits quietly behind him. I assume she is his PR, but she turns out to be his wife, Courtney, a former Corey\u2019s Angel. \u201cCourtney\u2019s life was saved because of the Angels, because what we were doing was helping girls. I said: \u2018I want to give you the opportunity to not have to sell yourself or be a stripper or porn star. We\u2019re going to give you the support you need, like a family would, so that you don\u2019t need to go do those things,\u2019\u201d he insists, outraged that his desire to save women by moving them into his house, and charging men to attend parties with them, has been so egregiously misunderstood. Feldman is right that people do tend to look away from stories of paedophilia. The one recent exception to that rule has been the case against Jackson. Ever since Dan Reed\u2019s documentary, Leaving Neverland, was aired last year, most people have accepted that Jackson was, in all likelihood, a paedophile. Except for Feldman. Seemingly determined to constantly undermine his own cause, Feldman has scoffed at Jackson\u2019s accusers and insisted Jackson never touched him in all the time they spent together. After enormous online criticism, Feldman rowed back a little last year, saying: \u201cI cannot in good conscience defend anyone who\u2019s being accused of such horrendous crimes.\u201d Today he seems to be rowing back on the rowing back; there is, after all, the portrait of Jackson in the front hall and I spot at least one photo of Jackson with Feldman. When I ask about them, Feldman insists his response to the Jackson case is based on experience: he wasn\u2019t abused by Jackson, so of course he defends him. Given that he now styles himself a defender of child victims, this makes little sense, and I suspect the truth is more complicated: he desperately needs to believe that at least one adult from his childhood wasn\u2019t out to damage him. When it comes to sexual assault, victims are often deemed to be not perfect enough: their sexual history too louche, their behaviour afterwards too wild. Yet predators pick off the vulnerable and survivors sometimes process trauma in deeply damaged and self-destructive ways. Instead of these factors being taken as evidence that something terrible has happened, too often they are cited as reasons that the victim should not be believed. The focus is placed on the effect, not the cause. We are going to have to learn how to make room for imperfect victims, and to understand that the key to their stories lies in their imperfections. Few are more imperfect than Feldman. It was easy to believe the accusations against Weinstein when they were coming from such impeccable sources as Ashley Judd and Angelina Jolie. Things are a little more complicated when abuse allegations are coming from a former child star who does wacky things on TV. Really, you need only to look at Feldman and Haim to know that something, somewhere, went extremely wrong. But that requires you to look at them and not turn queasily away. While Feldman and I talk, Hollywood is deep in awards season, and another former child star, Joaquin Phoenix, the brother of Feldman\u2019s late former co-star and friend, is scooping up all the best-actor awards for his performance in Joker. Meanwhile, Feldman is desperately trying to find a way to release his self-funded documentary about the abuse he suffered. There really are no guaranteed paths in life. We talk about his teenage son, Zen, and when I ask if he would let Zen go into the movie business, his eyes pop out in horror: \u201cHell, no!\u201d There is no doubt that Feldman is trying to use his trauma for good: he says he is working with the Screen Actors Guild to improve safeguarding laws for children on movie sets, and he is certain that his movie \u201cwill save thousands\u201d. He just doesn\u2019t understand why people won\u2019t listen to him and why they laugh at him. He mentions another recent article that cast doubt on his credibility. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice, you know? Why would they do that?\u201d he asks, his eyes wide, and he doesn\u2019t sound like a 48-year-old man trying to deal with the media. He sounds like a child who, once again, has been let down by the adults around him.",

The novel has it all \u2013 humor, history, politics, emotions, all packaged into a highly readable account of a Mexican American family that straddles the border of the United States and Mexico. This is the Great American Novel, if by \u201cAmerican\u201d we mean the greater America that is both north and south of the border. Urrea is an expert on the border and migration, having spent years and many books exploring these topics. He combines that intimate knowledge with a master novelist\u2019s flair to pull us into a family whose struggles have historical roots but whose feelings are ones that we all know \u2013 love, loss and longing.</p> <p><strong>Elaine Castillo</strong>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/23/america-is-not-in-the-heart-elaine-castillo-review\">America is Not the Heart</a> has a special place in my heart because it\u2019s set in the 408 \u2013 the area code for the south bay of the Bay Area. The Bay is dominated by San Francisco, but the 408 is the less than glamorous land of bedroom communities including Castillo\u2019s Milpitas and my San Jose. Castillo, of Filipina descent herself, focuses on the lives of documented and undocumented Filipina/os and traces their origins to the impact of American colonization in the Philippines and the US support for the martial law regime of Ferdinand Marcos. While politics and revolution form the background of the novel, the foreground is all about the power, pleasure and peril of kinship and romance, set in a beautifully, intimately drawn portrait of the Filipino American community.

It would be nearly impossible for me to suggest *the book* on this subject. But one of the books that weighs on my mind is this moving work of witness by <strong>Tim Hernandez</strong>, All They Will Call You. He tells a forgotten story about the fate of a group of migrants, deported by the US government in 1948, who died in the worst airplane disaster in California history. The thing that haunts me is his care for the stories of the dead, his refusal to allow those human beings to be forgotten. It is a quintessential migrant story, which makes it a truly American story.</p> <ul> <li><p>Urrea is the author of 17 books, including Nguyen\u2019s top pick above, the short story collection The Water Museum, The Devil\u2019s Highway, a Pulitzer finalist in non-fiction, and several volumes of poetry.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Angie Cruz </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cdc31b9c1e4757c844ed9b85c81bf04226449ccc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdc31b9c1e4757c844ed9b85c81bf04226449ccc/0_267_1009_605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Angie Cruz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Angie Cruz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9Erika Morillo / The Shipman Agency</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I highly recommend Bang by <strong>Daniel Pe\u00f1</strong><strong>a</strong>, Butterfly Boy by <strong>Rigoberto Gonz</strong><strong>\u00e1lez</strong>, Mean by <strong>Myriam Gurba</strong> and The Moths and Other Stories by <strong>Helena Mar\u00eda Viramontes,</strong> all of which are by Chicano writers who have dedicated themselves to researching, exploring and writing about and around the border and immigration. I read Viramontes as an undergrad. Her work was being taught in a sociology class. In my creative writing and lit classes I was taught writers like Simpson, Gaitskill and Atwood. All of whom were writers in the same generation as Viramontes but stocked on different shelves in the bookstores. And this is obviously a problem because Viramontes\u2019 stories are innovative, acute and beautifully written and if published today, one hopes her collection wouldn\u2019t have had to include a long academic introduction to create context and validity for her work and instead would have been reviewed and celebrated in mainstream literary spaces for the explosive content, the nuanced characters and her singular literary style.</p> <p>Another work I\u2019m excited about by a storyteller who works for the stage is <strong>Andrea Thome</strong>\u2019s Fandango for Butterflies (and Coyotes). If you are in NYC you don\u2019t want to miss the show that tells the story of undocumented immigrants coming together for a fandango on the evening of an Ice raid in New York City, as they wait for a loved one to arrive from Honduras.

He studies, immerses himself in a different culture, and comes back changed, both angry and anger-inducing, but also perplexed and deeply unsettled. It\u2019s a seminal text, not of the migrant who assimilates and achieves the so-called dream, but of the migrant who goes and comes back. There\u2019s a very strong awareness in this book about the sexualisation of the migrant and the self-exoticisation that occurs, but also about the impossibility of return. You can go back to where you come from but the person who goes back is no longer the person who left. That is a theme we see echoing again and again across migrant fiction. It\u2019s important to remember that we need antidotes to the idea that migrant fiction is simply people going north or going west. Very often, it\u2019s people who willingly or unwillingly have to return, altered, to where they began.</p> <p><strong>Julie</strong><strong> Otsuka</strong>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/08/buddha-in-attic-julie-otsuka-review\">The Buddha in the Attic</a> is an incredible work on multiple levels. It tells the story of a generation of women, a shipload of Japanese wives who head to California, employing a first person plural, which is very unusual. We sometimes hear about the danger in fiction of a writer depicting a group as a \u201cfaceless mass\u201d, or of presuming to speak for an entire group through underhanded means. Otsuka\u2019s book is remarkable: it does speak for a group but uses form to subvert and interrogate that critique. The narrative voice that emerges is of a group of people with constantly individualized particulars. That\u2019s a very difficult task to pull off but I think Otsuka succeeds magnificently. I would suggest this book as an antidote to the limited imaginings of what we think a narrative can be and as a reminder of the power of literary fiction to unlock some of those puzzles. It\u2019s truly a unique and awe-inspiring book.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hamid is the author of four novels, including The Reluctant Fundamentalist and Exit West.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Matt de la Pe\u00f1a</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0b47683e0945dbe8352a093bc70d5bdf6123d21f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b47683e0945dbe8352a093bc70d5bdf6123d21f/0_173_1841_1104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Matt de la Pe\u00f1a.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Matt de la Pe\u00f1a.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9Heather Waraksa / Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ll never forget the visceral experience I had the first time I read <strong>Luis Alberto Urrea</strong>\u2019s powerful The Devil\u2019s Highway. I was living in Brooklyn, NY, and my wife and I were expecting our first child. Back then I was reading a lot of books set on the Mexican border. Having grown up in a border community myself, I think it was my way of staying connected to home. We used to make the short drive into Tijuana frequently when I was young, to visit family, and I remember staring outside the windows of our Volkswagen Vanagon, fascinated by how drastically everything changed the second we officially left San Diego and entered Mexico. But it was The Devil\u2019s Highway that woke me up to the political travesties surrounding this barrier between the two countries. I was so shaken by Urrea\u2019s brutal account of 26 men and their passage across the border, into the Arizona desert, that as soon as I finished, I started again. This time I listened to the audiobook, read by Urrea himself, as I pushed my sleeping newborn around Prospect Park in a stroller. It was on these walks, listening to The Devil\u2019s Highway, staring at my baby girl, that I realized all writing is political writing. And my own work was forever changed.</p> <ul> <li><p>De la Pe\u00f1a\u2019s books for young adults include Mexican WhiteBoy and We Were Here.

      "bodyText": "Not all writers think of migrants as a \u201cfaceless brown mass\u201d. Indeed, if there is one thing that readers should take away from the ill-fated release of the over-hyped American Dirt, it is that the stories of migrants and refugees have been and are continuing to be told by writers around the world, richly, with nuance, and without relying on trite stereotypes. We asked the authors of some of our favorite novels about immigrants and migration to recommend an alternative reading list to American Dirt. Here are their selections. Viet Thanh Nguyen Luis Alberto Urrea\u2019s The House of Broken Angels is the Latinx novel that Oprah should have picked for her book club. The novel has it all \u2013 humor, history, politics, emotions, all packaged into a highly readable account of a Mexican American family that straddles the border of the United States and Mexico. This is the Great American Novel, if by \u201cAmerican\u201d we mean the greater America that is both north and south of the border. Urrea is an expert on the border and migration, having spent years and many books exploring these topics. He combines that intimate knowledge with a master novelist\u2019s flair to pull us into a family whose struggles have historical roots but whose feelings are ones that we all know \u2013 love, loss and longing. Elaine Castillo\u2019s America is Not the Heart has a special place in my heart because it\u2019s set in the 408 \u2013 the area code for the south bay of the Bay Area. The Bay is dominated by San Francisco, but the 408 is the less than glamorous land of bedroom communities including Castillo\u2019s Milpitas and my San Jose. Castillo, of Filipina descent herself, focuses on the lives of documented and undocumented Filipina/os and traces their origins to the impact of American colonization in the Philippines and the US support for the martial law regime of Ferdinand Marcos. While politics and revolution form the background of the novel, the foreground is all about the power, pleasure and peril of kinship and romance, set in a beautifully, intimately drawn portrait of the Filipino American community. Plus lots of hot queer sex. Nguyen is the Pulitzer prize-winning author of The Sympathizer and The Refugees. Luis Alberto Urrea The crisis of representation and appropriation ignited by American Dirt has made my mind turn to scores of worthy books in every genre about this issue. It would be nearly impossible for me to suggest *the book* on this subject. But one of the books that weighs on my mind is this moving work of witness by Tim Hernandez, All They Will Call You. He tells a forgotten story about the fate of a group of migrants, deported by the US government in 1948, who died in the worst airplane disaster in California history. The thing that haunts me is his care for the stories of the dead, his refusal to allow those human beings to be forgotten. It is a quintessential migrant story, which makes it a truly American story. Urrea is the author of 17 books, including Nguyen\u2019s top pick above, the short story collection The Water Museum, The Devil\u2019s Highway, a Pulitzer finalist in non-fiction, and several volumes of poetry. Angie Cruz I highly recommend Bang by Daniel Pe\u00f1a, Butterfly Boy by Rigoberto Gonz\u00e1lez, Mean by Myriam Gurba and The Moths and Other Stories by Helena Mar\u00eda Viramontes, all of which are by Chicano writers who have dedicated themselves to researching, exploring and writing about and around the border and immigration. I read Viramontes as an undergrad. Her work was being taught in a sociology class. In my creative writing and lit classes I was taught writers like Simpson, Gaitskill and Atwood. All of whom were writers in the same generation as Viramontes but stocked on different shelves in the bookstores. And this is obviously a problem because Viramontes\u2019 stories are innovative, acute and beautifully written and if published today, one hopes her collection wouldn\u2019t have had to include a long academic introduction to create context and validity for her work and instead would have been reviewed and celebrated in mainstream literary spaces for the explosive content, the nuanced characters and her singular literary style. Another work I\u2019m excited about by a storyteller who works for the stage is Andrea Thome\u2019s Fandango for Butterflies (and Coyotes). If you are in NYC you don\u2019t want to miss the show that tells the story of undocumented immigrants coming together for a fandango on the evening of an Ice raid in New York City, as they wait for a loved one to arrive from Honduras. Inspired by interviews with undocumented immigrants from Latin America living in New York, the piece will be a community celebration where stories are brought to life through live performance, music and dance. Cruz is the author of three novels, including Dominicana, about a child forced to marry in order to secure her family\u2019s future in America. Mohsin Hamid I would like to suggest two very different books. Tayeb Salih\u2019s Season of Migration to the North is a novel about a young man going from Sudan to Europe. He studies, immerses himself in a different culture, and comes back changed, both angry and anger-inducing, but also perplexed and deeply unsettled. It\u2019s a seminal text, not of the migrant who assimilates and achieves the so-called dream, but of the migrant who goes and comes back. There\u2019s a very strong awareness in this book about the sexualisation of the migrant and the self-exoticisation that occurs, but also about the impossibility of return. You can go back to where you come from but the person who goes back is no longer the person who left. That is a theme we see echoing again and again across migrant fiction. It\u2019s important to remember that we need antidotes to the idea that migrant fiction is simply people going north or going west. Very often, it\u2019s people who willingly or unwillingly have to return, altered, to where they began. Julie Otsuka\u2019s The Buddha in the Attic is an incredible work on multiple levels. It tells the story of a generation of women, a shipload of Japanese wives who head to California, employing a first person plural, which is very unusual. We sometimes hear about the danger in fiction of a writer depicting a group as a \u201cfaceless mass\u201d, or of presuming to speak for an entire group through underhanded means. Otsuka\u2019s book is remarkable: it does speak for a group but uses form to subvert and interrogate that critique. The narrative voice that emerges is of a group of people with constantly individualized particulars. That\u2019s a very difficult task to pull off but I think Otsuka succeeds magnificently. I would suggest this book as an antidote to the limited imaginings of what we think a narrative can be and as a reminder of the power of literary fiction to unlock some of those puzzles. It\u2019s truly a unique and awe-inspiring book. Hamid is the author of four novels, including The Reluctant Fundamentalist and Exit West. Matt de la Pe\u00f1a I\u2019ll never forget the visceral experience I had the first time I read Luis Alberto Urrea\u2019s powerful The Devil\u2019s Highway. I was living in Brooklyn, NY, and my wife and I were expecting our first child. Back then I was reading a lot of books set on the Mexican border. Having grown up in a border community myself, I think it was my way of staying connected to home. We used to make the short drive into Tijuana frequently when I was young, to visit family, and I remember staring outside the windows of our Volkswagen Vanagon, fascinated by how drastically everything changed the second we officially left San Diego and entered Mexico. But it was The Devil\u2019s Highway that woke me up to the political travesties surrounding this barrier between the two countries. I was so shaken by Urrea\u2019s brutal account of 26 men and their passage across the border, into the Arizona desert, that as soon as I finished, I started again. This time I listened to the audiobook, read by Urrea himself, as I pushed my sleeping newborn around Prospect Park in a stroller. It was on these walks, listening to The Devil\u2019s Highway, staring at my baby girl, that I realized all writing is political writing. And my own work was forever changed. De la Pe\u00f1a\u2019s books for young adults include Mexican WhiteBoy and We Were Here. He has also written several books for younger readers, including the Newbery Medal-winning Last Stop on Market Street. Dina Nayeri \u201cWe lost our home, which means the familiarity of daily life. We lost our occupation, which means the confidence that we are of some use in this world. We lost our language, which means the naturalness of reactions, the simplicity of gestures, the unaffected expression of feelings.\u201d Hannah Arendt wrote these words in the 1943 essay We Refugees. I think of these words when I read immigrant stories to remind myself of what an honest story owes to the reader. Has the author struggled over these private and subtle calculations? Does she understand these specific indignities? Or does she want to portray the drama for the entertainment of others? The books below impressed me because they understood deeper truths about displaced lives. They honored immigrants even in humiliating moments, instead of exploiting their stories. Years ago, I read Dinaw Mengestu\u2019s novels The Beautiful Things that Heaven Bears, and All Our Names in quick succession. Both are stories of Ethiopian men struggling to make a new life in DC and Chicago, to find companionship and love, despite poverty, the heartbreak of a ravaged home, and so much American hostility. Both novels show well-meaning American women who, as they try to help, trample on the men\u2019s dignity, safety and much else. 99 Nights in Logar by Jamil Jan Kochai is so well rooted in the Afghan narrator\u2019s voice and experience, it goes beyond empathy, transporting the reader. It ignores the western gaze and tells the story the way its subjects need it to be told. The result is funny and sharp and devastating. One chapter, a private family story, is written in Pashto \u2013 because it isn\u2019t meant for everyone. Catherine Chung\u2019s Forgotten Country is gorgeously written and full of heart. And that\u2019s another way to honor the subject matter: write it well. Bother to learn the craft (as many have failed to do). Chung\u2019s book is about sisters, family loyalty and war. It is illuminating and sensory and the characters come alive in the care of a precise and compassionate author who has made a lifelong study of her craft. Nayeri is the author of two novels, Refuge and A Teaspoon of Earth and Sea, as well as the memoir The Ungrateful Refugee. Aida Salazar These recently published or upcoming books for children and young adults are part of a larger dialogue about immigrant realities and migrant justice that was taking place before the American Dirt fiasco. It must be acknowledged that there is no one definitive migrant story but many and must include not only Mexican voices but the many voices of migrants to the United States.

Often in red pen is a note chivvying herself along.</p> <p>One reads: \u201cCould you try plotting out the book a bit\u2026 It shouldn\u2019t be that hard, should it?\u2019</p> <p>Another is motivational: \u201cI have to remember that only I can do it this way. I have to remember that I will have no idea what I will produce and that there is no reason on earth why it should not be good.\u201d</p> <p>The archive stretches from the creative writing classes Levy took in her 30s at City Lit, an adult education college in central London, to just before her death.</p> <p>One jotter has Levy\u2019s ideas for her next novel, Number Six, which will have at its centre a newly married couple, the woman black, the man white.</p> <p>He inherits something which takes him on a journey into his past, and to Jamaica. She writes that the story should be rich, think Heat and Dust, Behind the Scenes at the Museum, and The Da Vinci Code.</p> <p>Levy tells herself: \u201cBe playful and broad with the stories. It is a book about the British Empire and its impact on the lives of people \u2013 both white and black \u2026 both top of tree and those oppressed by it. How that British Empire and that relationship shaped modern Britain.\u201d</p> <p>Levy\u2019s best-known novel remains Small Island which in 2004 won the Whitbread novel prize, the Orange Prize and the following year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/oct/04/books.orangeprizeforfiction2005\">the \u2018Orange of Oranges\u2019</a>.</p> <p>Her notes reveal an idea for its structure came to her in a dream on \u201830-7-97\u2019. She has drawn a diagram which suggests a main story line and lots of tributary stories.

There is also an as yet unproduced screenplay of the life of Mary Seacole.</p> <p>Cox said Levy\u2019s voice was vividly present throughout the papers. Whether she was motivating herself or writing about role models such as James Baldwin or Julie Andrews, her \u201cmodesty, humour and commitment to confronting the truth\u201d shines through.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a0aa80cc46bcc11ea52e102fc9a3fde483902fdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0aa80cc46bcc11ea52e102fc9a3fde483902fdc/0_58_6837_5090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Working draft of Small Island referencing Hortense and Queenie\u2019s shopping trip.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Working draft of Small Island referencing Hortense and Queenie\u2019s shopping trip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 10009/copyright Estate of Andrea Levy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The library has purchased the archive for \u00a3140,000 and items from it will go on display in the Treasures Gallery from late-February.</p> <p>It joins contemporary literary archives at the Library which include the papers of Hanif Kureishi, Margaret Forster, Will Self and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.</p> <p>Levy\u2019s husband Bill Mayblin said it had come as a surprise to her that her carefully saved boxes could be considered an archive.

      "bodyText": "Andrea Levy was thinking big as she jotted down notes for what would have been her sixth novel: it would be a love story entwined with colonial history and a richness that was Heat and Dust, Behind the Scenes at the Museum and even a touch of The Da Vinci Code. \u201cIt would have been so much better than the Da Vinci Code, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said British Library curator Zo\u00eb Wilcox, reading one of the hundreds of notebooks that Levy stored in her cellar and are now in her care. The notebooks, as well as research material, correspondence, emails and audio recordings, are all part of a Levy\u2019s literary archive, newly acquired by the British Library. Levy, the supreme chronicler of the Windrush generation best known for her novels Small Island and The Long Song, died 12 months ago aged 62. Before her death, Levy was in discussions with the British Library about her archive although she took some convincing, said Wilcox, the curator of the contemporary performance and creative archives at the library. \u201cWhen I first spoke to her about it she couldn\u2019t really believe that all the boxes of paper she had in the cellar really were an archive, she thought that was something much too posh for her.\u201d Wilcox went to visit Levy at her north London home. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed in the cellar. Andrea was so modest about her work that she was quite scared about people seeing her drafts, her crossings out and her notes.\u201d The truth though, said Wilcox, is an incredibly rich and important archive which shines light on the thought processes and working practices of \u201can extraordinary writer whose literary significance will be celebrated for years to come\u201d. There are piles of notebooks with drafts and outlines of her novels and short stories. Often in red pen is a note chivvying herself along. One reads: \u201cCould you try plotting out the book a bit\u2026 It shouldn\u2019t be that hard, should it?\u2019 Another is motivational: \u201cI have to remember that only I can do it this way. I have to remember that I will have no idea what I will produce and that there is no reason on earth why it should not be good.\u201d The archive stretches from the creative writing classes Levy took in her 30s at City Lit, an adult education college in central London, to just before her death. One jotter has Levy\u2019s ideas for her next novel, Number Six, which will have at its centre a newly married couple, the woman black, the man white. He inherits something which takes him on a journey into his past, and to Jamaica. She writes that the story should be rich, think Heat and Dust, Behind the Scenes at the Museum, and The Da Vinci Code. Levy tells herself: \u201cBe playful and broad with the stories. It is a book about the British Empire and its impact on the lives of people \u2013 both white and black \u2026 both top of tree and those oppressed by it. How that British Empire and that relationship shaped modern Britain.\u201d Levy\u2019s best-known novel remains Small Island which in 2004 won the Whitbread novel prize, the Orange Prize and the following year the \u2018Orange of Oranges\u2019. Her notes reveal an idea for its structure came to her in a dream on \u201830-7-97\u2019. She has drawn a diagram which suggests a main story line and lots of tributary stories. The main story \u201ccould be a love story or something quite tangible and engaging to the reader\u201d. Other papers touch on collaborations with the Lenny Henry, Baroness Lola Young and the Guardian\u2019s Gary Younge. There is also an as yet unproduced screenplay of the life of Mary Seacole. Cox said Levy\u2019s voice was vividly present throughout the papers. Whether she was motivating herself or writing about role models such as James Baldwin or Julie Andrews, her \u201cmodesty, humour and commitment to confronting the truth\u201d shines through. The library has purchased the archive for \u00a3140,000 and items from it will go on display in the Treasures Gallery from late-February. It joins contemporary literary archives at the Library which include the papers of Hanif Kureishi, Margaret Forster, Will Self and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Levy\u2019s husband Bill Mayblin said it had come as a surprise to her that her carefully saved boxes could be considered an archive. Once convinced, there was only one place she wanted it to go. \u201cNot only had the Library greatly helped her research as a writer, but because much of her work examined British colonial history \u2013 a history full of omission and injustice \u2013 it seemed fitting, and somehow just, that her archive should finally find a home in a truly national institution. \u201cShe would be very pleased that through the British Library her work and her story is now owned, and valued, by we British.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In the trash under trees battered by storms lie sticks covered with what looks like flaky aluminium. This stuff is shield lichen, <em>Parmelia sulcata</em>, which is still alive, even though the branches it grew on are now rotting on the ground. Shield lichen is a foliose lichen, the ones that form leafy lobes called thalli. These are about 5mm wide, loosely attached in sprawly rosettes, and grow on branches, twigs and tree trunks. From a distance, the lichen is silvery grey but looking closer, the thalli have a bluey-green cast.</p> <p>Lichens are an intimate association, a symbiosis, between different and unrelated microorganisms \u2013 alga and fungus. The shield lichen is a community that includes<em> Marchandiomyces </em>and<em> Nesolechia </em>fungi, which create the architecture that harbours the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebouxia\">single-celled green alga</a> <em>Trebouxia</em> \u2013 a photobiont, turning sunlight into carbohydrates for the fungi and receiving some nutrients and vitamins in return. Shield lichen are fairly resistant to pollution and so are cosmopolitan and common, and their thalli grow 2mm-5mm in a year. There are some species, particularly those growing on rock in the Arctic, that only grow 0.5mm a year and there are individuals that are 5,000 years old.</p> <p>The study of lichenometry over the past 25 years uses the growth rates of lichens to tell the story of climatic change and how long rock surfaces and glacial deposits in the Arctic have been exposed. That these complex and sophisticated living communities of very different organisms can be read as historical documents is fascinating.

      "bodyText": "In the trash under trees battered by storms lie sticks covered with what looks like flaky aluminium. This stuff is shield lichen, Parmelia sulcata, which is still alive, even though the branches it grew on are now rotting on the ground. Shield lichen is a foliose lichen, the ones that form leafy lobes called thalli. These are about 5mm wide, loosely attached in sprawly rosettes, and grow on branches, twigs and tree trunks. From a distance, the lichen is silvery grey but looking closer, the thalli have a bluey-green cast. Lichens are an intimate association, a symbiosis, between different and unrelated microorganisms \u2013 alga and fungus. The shield lichen is a community that includes Marchandiomyces and Nesolechia fungi, which create the architecture that harbours the single-celled green alga Trebouxia \u2013 a photobiont, turning sunlight into carbohydrates for the fungi and receiving some nutrients and vitamins in return. Shield lichen are fairly resistant to pollution and so are cosmopolitan and common, and their thalli grow 2mm-5mm in a year. There are some species, particularly those growing on rock in the Arctic, that only grow 0.5mm a year and there are individuals that are 5,000 years old. The study of lichenometry over the past 25 years uses the growth rates of lichens to tell the story of climatic change and how long rock surfaces and glacial deposits in the Arctic have been exposed. That these complex and sophisticated living communities of very different organisms can be read as historical documents is fascinating. Looking at the shield lichen under the trees growing on something that is already dead, I wonder what it can tell us. Will the chronicles in its thalli be read like ancient illuminated texts that hold secrets about what lies beyond the world as we see it? Is it sensitive to extra-terrestrial forces? Did it pick up anything from the \u201cheatwave\u201d of masers \u2013 microwave lasers \u2013 that burst from the new star, called G358-MM1, 22,000 light years away last year? We are, despite our destructive self-obsessions, communities of organisms affected by the universe. With only this rapidly changing planet to cling to like a dead stick, perhaps lichens can also be read as the poetry of peaceful coexistence.",

It was never greeted with fear by the villagers in this remote corner of northern Goa; the name Vagheri translates as \u201chome of the tigers\u201d and coexistence with India\u2019s national animal was part of their way of life.</p> <p>Yet according to state authorities, these tigers do not exist; or if they do, they are just passing through. Unlike other states in India, where the presence of tigers has been celebrated, embraced and in many cases exploited for tourism, Goa\u2019s tigers have instead been subjected to a strange charade, whereby their existence has repeatedly been denied or covered up by those in government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Officials and local community leaders have been feeding the fear of tiger reserves to locals to serve their own agenda</p> <footer> <cite>Abhijit Prabhudesai, activist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So when a mother and her three cubs were found dead in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in the Sattari region of Goa last month, allegedly poisoned by disgruntled locals, the deaths \u2013 one of the biggest losses to India\u2019s tiger population in years \u2013 brought an uncomfortable issue to the surface.</p> <p>\u201cI have spent my whole life tracking tigers, so I know they are living in Goa,\u201d says Kerkar, a well-known environmental activist in the state. \u201cBut even with all these years of proof, still the government have failed to acknowledge tigers in Goa. They have looked away to serve their economic interests, to keep on cutting down the forests for mines and tourism until there will be nothing left for the tigers.\u201d</p> <p>Tigers have been touted by India as one of its great environmental success stories, with the most recent figures showing the population now at close to 3,000, a third higher than four years ago. Although there has been <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2020-01-indian-authorities-flaws-tiger-criticism.html\">some dispute over the numbers</a>, prime minister Narendra Modi presented the most recent tiger census with the claim that India was \u201cnow one of the biggest and most secure habitats of the tiger\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80f4a47d2df744bc453e59e4b2603a9a6f2b04bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80f4a47d2df744bc453e59e4b2603a9a6f2b04bb/0_0_858_515/500.jpg\" alt=\"An adult tiger walking her cubs in Dudhwa National Park, Uttar Pradesh, Northern India.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An adult tiger walking her cubs in Dudhwa National Park, Uttar Pradesh, Northern India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shared by Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Parveen Kaswan on Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The currently unprotected area of the Western Ghats in Goa forms a crucial part of the tiger corridor running from Maharashtra to Karnataka, which activists and the WWF have described as \u201cthe best and only hope for the continued survival of the tigers of India\u201d.</p> <p>But in a state heavily dependent on tourism, real estate and, until recently, iron ore mining, protecting the tiger\u2019s forest habitat has been portrayed as a threat to industry and development. \u201cIf you are using wildlife to block the economy, you create enemies of wildlife,\u201d said Goa\u2019s chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, in 2013.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/29/india-wild-tiger-population-rises-conservation\">India\u2019s wild tiger population rises 33% in four years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite tigers first being officially recorded in Goa in 2002, and the tiger census and local rangers putting the current population in Goa between five and 10, <a href=\"https://www.conservationindia.org/ask-ci/what-is-the-difference-between-a-tiger-reserve-and-a-national-parkwildlife-sanctuary-what-is-the-structure-of-a-tiger-reserve-as-in-does-it-have-a-zonation-approach\">there is still no tiger reserve in the state</a> and therefore no official protection.</p> <p>\u201cThe Goa state government has been trying to suppress the presence of tigers for at least the past 40 years for the simple reason of mining and real estate,\u201d says activist Abhijit Prabhudesai.</p> <p>One issue driving the resistance is that creating a tiger reserve would mean establishing a buffer zone around the protected forest. This no-build area would encroach on land already occupied by extractive industries or owned by powerful landlords. While the supreme court banned mining in Goa in 2018, many expect it to eventually resume, but a tiger reserve would make that less likely. Some Goa government figures have business interests linked to mining.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/07_tigers_goa-zip/giv-3902VmlD1RWO0IS3/\" data-alt=\"The unprotected area of the Western Ghats in Goa is part of a tiger corridor\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/07_tigers_goa-zip/giv-3902VmlD1RWO0IS3/\">The unprotected area of the Western Ghats in Goa is part of a tiger corridor</a> </figure>  <p>A shroud of secrecy surrounds the tigers in this part of northern Goa, where locals will deny ever having seen one, or scurry away whenever tigers are mentioned. Resistance to a tiger reserve is strong. \u201cNo tigers here,\u201d says one woman interviewed by the Guardian, despite the fact that according to local reports the night before her cow had been killed by a tiger.</p> <p>\u201cIt is government officials and local community leaders who have been feeding the fear of tiger reserves to locals to serve their own agenda, so they can keep tearing up the land for hotels and mines,\u201d Prabhudesai adds. \u201cThey have been telling them that if you accept the presence of the tigers then you will be relocated and you will be thrown out from your villages. Fear has been planted in the minds of the people.\u201d</p> <p>After the four tiger deaths, denials from the state government once again emerged. \u201cTigers found in the wild in Sattari are basically transitory tigers, coming from Karnataka,\u201d said Vishwajit Rane, Goa\u2019s health minister, who represents the district where the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary is located. \u201cI will not allow the tiger reserve in Sattari,\u201d he added. \u201cEnvironmentalists don\u2019t run Sattari, people there do.

      "bodyText": "As a child living in the Vagheri hills at the foot of the Western Ghats, Rajendra Kerkar would often hear the majestic roar of tigers echo across the mountains. It was never greeted with fear by the villagers in this remote corner of northern Goa; the name Vagheri translates as \u201chome of the tigers\u201d and coexistence with India\u2019s national animal was part of their way of life. Yet according to state authorities, these tigers do not exist; or if they do, they are just passing through. Unlike other states in India, where the presence of tigers has been celebrated, embraced and in many cases exploited for tourism, Goa\u2019s tigers have instead been subjected to a strange charade, whereby their existence has repeatedly been denied or covered up by those in government. So when a mother and her three cubs were found dead in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in the Sattari region of Goa last month, allegedly poisoned by disgruntled locals, the deaths \u2013 one of the biggest losses to India\u2019s tiger population in years \u2013 brought an uncomfortable issue to the surface. \u201cI have spent my whole life tracking tigers, so I know they are living in Goa,\u201d says Kerkar, a well-known environmental activist in the state. \u201cBut even with all these years of proof, still the government have failed to acknowledge tigers in Goa. They have looked away to serve their economic interests, to keep on cutting down the forests for mines and tourism until there will be nothing left for the tigers.\u201d Tigers have been touted by India as one of its great environmental success stories, with the most recent figures showing the population now at close to 3,000, a third higher than four years ago. Although there has been some dispute over the numbers, prime minister Narendra Modi presented the most recent tiger census with the claim that India was \u201cnow one of the biggest and most secure habitats of the tiger\u201d. The currently unprotected area of the Western Ghats in Goa forms a crucial part of the tiger corridor running from Maharashtra to Karnataka, which activists and the WWF have described as \u201cthe best and only hope for the continued survival of the tigers of India\u201d. But in a state heavily dependent on tourism, real estate and, until recently, iron ore mining, protecting the tiger\u2019s forest habitat has been portrayed as a threat to industry and development. \u201cIf you are using wildlife to block the economy, you create enemies of wildlife,\u201d said Goa\u2019s chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, in 2013. Despite tigers first being officially recorded in Goa in 2002, and the tiger census and local rangers putting the current population in Goa between five and 10, there is still no tiger reserve in the state and therefore no official protection. \u201cThe Goa state government has been trying to suppress the presence of tigers for at least the past 40 years for the simple reason of mining and real estate,\u201d says activist Abhijit Prabhudesai. One issue driving the resistance is that creating a tiger reserve would mean establishing a buffer zone around the protected forest. This no-build area would encroach on land already occupied by extractive industries or owned by powerful landlords. While the supreme court banned mining in Goa in 2018, many expect it to eventually resume, but a tiger reserve would make that less likely. Some Goa government figures have business interests linked to mining. A shroud of secrecy surrounds the tigers in this part of northern Goa, where locals will deny ever having seen one, or scurry away whenever tigers are mentioned. Resistance to a tiger reserve is strong. \u201cNo tigers here,\u201d says one woman interviewed by the Guardian, despite the fact that according to local reports the night before her cow had been killed by a tiger. \u201cIt is government officials and local community leaders who have been feeding the fear of tiger reserves to locals to serve their own agenda, so they can keep tearing up the land for hotels and mines,\u201d Prabhudesai adds. \u201cThey have been telling them that if you accept the presence of the tigers then you will be relocated and you will be thrown out from your villages. Fear has been planted in the minds of the people.\u201d After the four tiger deaths, denials from the state government once again emerged. \u201cTigers found in the wild in Sattari are basically transitory tigers, coming from Karnataka,\u201d said Vishwajit Rane, Goa\u2019s health minister, who represents the district where the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary is located. \u201cI will not allow the tiger reserve in Sattari,\u201d he added. \u201cEnvironmentalists don\u2019t run Sattari, people there do. No one has the right to declare Sattari a tiger reserve and we will not allow it.\u201d Rane\u2019s comments are the latest in a long line of official flip-flopping between acceptance and denial on tigers since Mhadei was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1999.

They should be receiving at least the minimum wage of \u20ac950 a month, but many make closer to \u20ac800 despite working 18-hour days, six days a week.</p> <p>\u201cWe look after old people, we look after children \u2013 we\u2019re responsible for all that\u2019s most precious in people\u2019s families,\u201d said Janina Flores, from Peru. \u201cWe act as psychologists and confidants, we double up as seamstresses. But we\u2019re not valued.\u201d</p> <p>Another Peruvian, Adriana Araujo, added cook, butler and pet-sitter to the list. \u201cWe do everything you can imagine and more because we\u2019re seen as the right kind of domestic tool,\u201d she said. \u201cBut very often we\u2019re valued less than a kitchen blender.\u201d</p> <p>When the women had finished speaking, <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/poverty/pages/srextremepovertyindex.aspx\">Philip Alston</a>, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, told them he was well aware of the irony they had outlined \u2013 \u201cthat people can rely so heavily and so intimately on another person but, at the same time, not really relate to them as a fellow human being.\u201d</p> <p>While Spain has largely bounced back from the economic crisis of 2008, the <em>internas</em>\u2019 stories, like so many Alston heard on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/27/un-poverty-expert-visit-spain-fact-finding-mission-philip-alston\">12-day fact-finding mission</a>, are a reminder that the recovery masks deeply entrenched socio-economic problems.</p> <p>According to figures from Spain\u2019s National Statistics Institute, 26.1% of the population lives at risk of <a href=\"https://www.ine.es/en/prensa/ecv_2018_en.pdf\">poverty</a> or social exclusion, up from 24.7% in 2008, while the unemployment rate of 14.1% is more than double <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics\">the EU average</a>.

For the past six months the centre has relied on a \u20ac200,000 grant awarded by the last Madrid city council, led by the leftwing former mayor Manuela Carmena.</p> <p>The money has allowed it to provide legal advice, psychological support, tai chi and drama classes and lessons in cooking Spanish food to hundreds of migrant workers. The centre is also a place where the workers can come to meet so they do not end up isolated and alone.</p> <p>This year the new city council, led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/15/spanish-parties-far-right-vox-madrid\">two rightwing parties</a> and propped up by the far-right Vox party, decided <a href=\"https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/empleadas-domesticas-Madrid-financiacion-Ayuntamiento_0_975702516.html\">not to renew</a> the subsidy, throwing the centre\u2019s future into doubt.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the council said the money had always been a one-year grant that was not eligible for renewal, adding: \u201cThere are dozens of local associations that offer charitable support to neighbours and which are able to apply for different kinds of subsidies to fund their activities or running costs. It is in the interest of the new council to ensure that competition for them is free and competitive.\u201d</p> <p>Before heading off for his next visit, Alston said he hoped the funding \u201cwill be reconsidered or replaced by a more enlightened source\u201d. He counselled the <em>internas</em> to be realistic in their hopes. \u201cI don\u2019t think any government in Spain or in most other countries is suddenly going to transform your status because you provide a very low-cost, indispensable service,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He advised them to choose their issues and battles carefully. \u201cYou need a political campaign that will go step by step and identify certain priorities, because to ask for everything usually results in getting nothing.\u201d He paused. \u201cAt least until the revolution comes.\u201d The women laughed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe2ffa72e39b0d85911102ef65cc5c39d6bf3cfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe2ffa72e39b0d85911102ef65cc5c39d6bf3cfb/389_556_4539_2724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Madrid Tenants Union\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Madrid Tenants Union protest outside a housing block.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Doyle/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Half an hour later, Alston arrived at a housing estate in Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz, a town a little north-east of the capital, where he was offered concrete proof of Spain\u2019s housing crisis. He had always expected the issue to loom large in his research, telling the Guardian \u2013 with more than a little understatement \u2013 that the country\u2019s economic recovery was more complex than it might appear and that \u201canyone who reads reports will know that there\u2019s something of a housing crisis in Spain\u201d.</p> <p>Homemade banners decrying soaring rents hung from balconies, and dozens of locals people had turned out to tell the UN expert how they had been affected by the arrival of investment funds that bought up billions of euros\u2019 worth of housing stock during the crisis.</p> <p>Rents have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-realestate/spain-takes-steps-to-cap-home-rents-as-election-nears-idUSKCN1QI4X3\">risen 50% since 2014</a>, and some residents say they are now being asked to pay big increases by their multinational landlords. The situation has led to the formation of tenants\u2019 groups and the eruption of <em><a href=\"http://www.inquilinato.org/sindicato/\">bloques en lucha</a></em> \u2013 entire blocks where residents are protesting by staying put, paying the previous rental rates and refusing to sign new contracts that they consider to be grotesquely unfair.</p> <p>A woman from M\u00f3stoles, south-west of Madrid, told Alston that most people had to rent as they did not have the savings to put down a deposit to buy. And besides, she added, most of the housing had already been bought up by the vulture funds.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got four kids,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere does the government want us to go and live? On the streets? Under a bridge? All we\u2019re asking is that they keep the rent at the level it was before.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7127ad55c095adeb83982130ecbfd7dbc0dc8e83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7127ad55c095adeb83982130ecbfd7dbc0dc8e83/0_117_4400_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protest banners at the housing block\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protest banners at the housing block.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Doyle/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jes\u00fas Alcocer, 58, a private hire driver from Torrej\u00f3n, said he couldn\u2019t hang on much longer. His last flat was repossessed during the crash and he and his partner, Manoli Navarro, were sharing their current one with their three daughters and a granddaughter.</p> <p>He made around \u20ac900 a month, Navarro worked part-time at a nursery, and their children gave what they could. But their rent had jumped from \u20ac816 a month to \u20ac1,400.</p> <p>\u201cI just can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Alcocer. \u201cAll I can do is keep paying the rent at the old rate and hope that they\u2019ll agree to that. I\u2019ve always paid but I just can\u2019t afford the rise.\u201d</p> <p>Alston told the crowd that \u201csomething drastic needs to be done\u201d, adding: \u201cSuccessive Spanish governments have done very little when it comes to housing rights.\u201d His promise to include the issue in his report was greeted with a loud cheer.</p> <p>What happens next will depend in large part on Spain\u2019s new coalition government. The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has pledged to bring about a transformation in equality and social justice, and has already <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-12/blackstone-hit-by-rental-cap-in-spain-as-populists-push-agenda\">moved to cap rent rises</a>. His partner in government, the Podemos party, meanwhile, was born of widespread anger over austerity, inequality and the old political status quo that had dominated Spain for decades.</p> <p>As the crowd thinned and Alston headed off to his next appointment, Navarro began to cry and then apologised for doing so. The frustration and anger, the injustice and humiliation, were just too much.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t realise what we\u2019re living through or what it\u2019s like to get back on your feet only to be crushed all over again,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in Spain these days, things are getting worse and worse. We\u2019ve got politicians up to our eyeballs but none of them do anything. It\u2019s just so hard. But I won\u2019t put up with them trying to put my daughters and granddaughter out of our flat. I don\u2019t want to leave. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "On what was probably their only day off all week, two dozen Latin American women had gathered in south Madrid to explain to a UN human rights expert the paradox of their invisibility. They were of different ages and were born in different countries \u2013 Bolivia, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, to name a few \u2013 but their stories soon entwined to form a single narrative. As carers or internas (live-in maids), they are underpaid, overworked, unappreciated, trapped, sometimes scared, frequently disdained and often abused. They should be receiving at least the minimum wage of \u20ac950 a month, but many make closer to \u20ac800 despite working 18-hour days, six days a week. \u201cWe look after old people, we look after children \u2013 we\u2019re responsible for all that\u2019s most precious in people\u2019s families,\u201d said Janina Flores, from Peru. \u201cWe act as psychologists and confidants, we double up as seamstresses. But we\u2019re not valued.\u201d Another Peruvian, Adriana Araujo, added cook, butler and pet-sitter to the list. \u201cWe do everything you can imagine and more because we\u2019re seen as the right kind of domestic tool,\u201d she said. \u201cBut very often we\u2019re valued less than a kitchen blender.\u201d When the women had finished speaking, Philip Alston, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, told them he was well aware of the irony they had outlined \u2013 \u201cthat people can rely so heavily and so intimately on another person but, at the same time, not really relate to them as a fellow human being.\u201d While Spain has largely bounced back from the economic crisis of 2008, the internas\u2019 stories, like so many Alston heard on a 12-day fact-finding mission, are a reminder that the recovery masks deeply entrenched socio-economic problems. According to figures from Spain\u2019s National Statistics Institute, 26.1% of the population lives at risk of poverty or social exclusion, up from 24.7% in 2008, while the unemployment rate of 14.1% is more than double the EU average. About half the population have some difficulty making ends meet, and poverty is persistently higher among children, migrants, and Roma populations. Blanca Coronel, a 71-year-old Paraguayan woman who had been in Spain since 2006, said that despite her age and a knee injury she would need to work for another 10 years before she would have accrued enough pension contributions to retire. Sandra Delgadillo, from Bolivia, recalled being interviewed for a job looking after an old man with a broken hip and being told there would be a bonus if she were prepared to be sexually assaulted. An hour before he sat down with the women, Alston was given a tour of the Centre for the Empowerment of Domestic and Care Workers, where the meeting was to be held. For the past six months the centre has relied on a \u20ac200,000 grant awarded by the last Madrid city council, led by the leftwing former mayor Manuela Carmena. The money has allowed it to provide legal advice, psychological support, tai chi and drama classes and lessons in cooking Spanish food to hundreds of migrant workers. The centre is also a place where the workers can come to meet so they do not end up isolated and alone. This year the new city council, led by two rightwing parties and propped up by the far-right Vox party, decided not to renew the subsidy, throwing the centre\u2019s future into doubt. A spokeswoman for the council said the money had always been a one-year grant that was not eligible for renewal, adding: \u201cThere are dozens of local associations that offer charitable support to neighbours and which are able to apply for different kinds of subsidies to fund their activities or running costs. It is in the interest of the new council to ensure that competition for them is free and competitive.\u201d Before heading off for his next visit, Alston said he hoped the funding \u201cwill be reconsidered or replaced by a more enlightened source\u201d. He counselled the internas to be realistic in their hopes. \u201cI don\u2019t think any government in Spain or in most other countries is suddenly going to transform your status because you provide a very low-cost, indispensable service,\u201d he said. He advised them to choose their issues and battles carefully. \u201cYou need a political campaign that will go step by step and identify certain priorities, because to ask for everything usually results in getting nothing.\u201d He paused. \u201cAt least until the revolution comes.\u201d The women laughed. Half an hour later, Alston arrived at a housing estate in Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz, a town a little north-east of the capital, where he was offered concrete proof of Spain\u2019s housing crisis. He had always expected the issue to loom large in his research, telling the Guardian \u2013 with more than a little understatement \u2013 that the country\u2019s economic recovery was more complex than it might appear and that \u201canyone who reads reports will know that there\u2019s something of a housing crisis in Spain\u201d. Homemade banners decrying soaring rents hung from balconies, and dozens of locals people had turned out to tell the UN expert how they had been affected by the arrival of investment funds that bought up billions of euros\u2019 worth of housing stock during the crisis. Rents have risen 50% since 2014, and some residents say they are now being asked to pay big increases by their multinational landlords. The situation has led to the formation of tenants\u2019 groups and the eruption of bloques en lucha \u2013 entire blocks where residents are protesting by staying put, paying the previous rental rates and refusing to sign new contracts that they consider to be grotesquely unfair. A woman from M\u00f3stoles, south-west of Madrid, told Alston that most people had to rent as they did not have the savings to put down a deposit to buy. And besides, she added, most of the housing had already been bought up by the vulture funds. \u201cI\u2019ve got four kids,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere does the government want us to go and live? On the streets? Under a bridge? All we\u2019re asking is that they keep the rent at the level it was before.\u201d Jes\u00fas Alcocer, 58, a private hire driver from Torrej\u00f3n, said he couldn\u2019t hang on much longer. His last flat was repossessed during the crash and he and his partner, Manoli Navarro, were sharing their current one with their three daughters and a granddaughter. He made around \u20ac900 a month, Navarro worked part-time at a nursery, and their children gave what they could. But their rent had jumped from \u20ac816 a month to \u20ac1,400. \u201cI just can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Alcocer. \u201cAll I can do is keep paying the rent at the old rate and hope that they\u2019ll agree to that. I\u2019ve always paid but I just can\u2019t afford the rise.\u201d Alston told the crowd that \u201csomething drastic needs to be done\u201d, adding: \u201cSuccessive Spanish governments have done very little when it comes to housing rights.\u201d His promise to include the issue in his report was greeted with a loud cheer. What happens next will depend in large part on Spain\u2019s new coalition government. The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has pledged to bring about a transformation in equality and social justice, and has already moved to cap rent rises. His partner in government, the Podemos party, meanwhile, was born of widespread anger over austerity, inequality and the old political status quo that had dominated Spain for decades. As the crowd thinned and Alston headed off to his next appointment, Navarro began to cry and then apologised for doing so. The frustration and anger, the injustice and humiliation, were just too much. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise what we\u2019re living through or what it\u2019s like to get back on your feet only to be crushed all over again,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in Spain these days, things are getting worse and worse. We\u2019ve got politicians up to our eyeballs but none of them do anything. It\u2019s just so hard. But I won\u2019t put up with them trying to put my daughters and granddaughter out of our flat. I don\u2019t want to leave. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Australian federal police has dropped its investigation into a doctored document used by energy minister Angus Taylor to attack Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore\u2019s record on climate change. On Thursday the AFP confirmed it had finalised the matter because it had \u201cdetermined it is unlikely further investigation will result in obtaining sufficient evidence to substantiate a commonwealth offence\u201d. \u201cThe AFP assessment of this matter identified there is no evidence to indicate the minister for energy and emissions reduction was involved in falsifying information,\u201d an AFP spokesman said. \u201cThe low level of harm and the apology made by the [minister] to the Lord Mayor of Sydney, along with the significant level of resources required to investigate were also factored into the decision not to pursue this matter.\u201d Taylor welcomed the news and accused Labor of a \u201ctrack record of using police referrals as a political tool\u201d. \u201cThe leader of the opposition [Anthony Albanese] and shadow attorney-general [Mark Dreyfus]\u2019s pursuit of this matter is a shameful abuse of their office and a waste of our policing agencies\u2019 time,\u201d he said in a statement. But Dreyfus and shadow climate change minister Mark Butler said that \u201cserious questions remain unanswered\u201d about the scandal because \u201ctwo police investigations have now failed to clarify where Angus Taylor got his dodgy figures from\u201d. Clover Moore said: \u201cI am shocked and disappointed the AFP will not further investigate the matter and shed light on a situation that has further eroded the community\u2019s faith in the federal government.\u201d The document, which contained grossly inflated travel figures for the 10 Sydney city councillors \u2013 it claimed they had spent $15m in a year \u2013 was quoted in a letter sent by Taylor to Moore on 29 September and provided to the Daily Telegraph, which used the figures in an article published the same day. Labor referred the issue to the New South Wales police in October, questioning whether the document constituted a forgery used to influence an official in the conduct of their duty, and whether Taylor could have committed an offence by failing to report it. The NSW police established strike force Garrad to investigate, but Taylor did not stand down, receiving the backing of Scott Morrison to stay in his ministerial position. Morrison personally contacted the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, by phone, leading to allegations, which were strongly denied, he had influenced the investigation. In November Fuller said he believed the matter would be wrapped up in a week. \u201cTo be honest with you, I actually don\u2019t feel as though the allegations themselves are serious, in terms of the things that I would normally stand up and talk about the types of crimes,\u201d he said. On 20 December, the NSW Police referred the matter to the AFP, reportedly because if any crime were committed, it would have occurred in Canberra, not Sydney. Taylor has \u201cunreservedly\u201d apologised to Moore for relying on the falsified figures but has denied consistently that either he, or anyone in his office, altered the City of Sydney document to inflate travel expenditure. Taylor has said the document with the incorrect numbers was obtained from the council website. But the council has produced evidence showing that its publicly available annual reports has only ever contained accurate figures. Metadata and screenshots from the council\u2019s content management system showed the annual reports on its website had not been changed since they were originally uploaded. In a statement Dreyfus and Butler noted Taylor had assured parliament the fabricated report was \u201cdirectly downloaded\u201d from the City of Sydney Council website but public archives show \u201cthe correct version of the report was on the internet all through 2019\u201d. \u201cIf Angus Taylor continues to refuse to come clean, then the prime minister must order a proper, independent and transparent investigation into his minister, and commit to making the findings public.\u201d Moore said it was \u201cnearly beyond belief that the minster is still, after months of intense scrutiny, yet to explain the origin of the fraudulent document he used to accuse the City of egregious spending on travel\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Artists and activists who oppose arts sponsorship from fossil fuel companies have said they intend to continue protesting as Western Australia\u2019s leading international arts festival, Perth festival, prepares to open this week. Artists have been staging protests around Perth\u2019s annual fringe festival, Fringe World, calling for the organisation to end its eight-year sponsorship arrangement with oil and gas giant Woodside in light of the intensifying climate crisis. Attention is likely to shift this week to the more upmarket Perth festival and its relationship with oil and gas company Chevron, which operates Australia\u2019s largest onshore oilfield, among other projects. The actions began in October last year, when a climate coalition of artists, activists and environmental organisations wrote to Sharon Burgess, CEO of Artrage Inc \u2013 the company that runs Fringe World \u2013 calling on the festival to terminate its relationship with Woodside. Woodside has supported Fringe World since 2012. The festival is currently in the second of a three-year partnership with the company, which it lists as a \u201cprincipal partner\u201d. Artrage would not disclose the funding specifics of that arrangement, but arts companies tend to structure their partnerships in tiers, based upon the value of the sponsorship. Top-billed partnerships generally indicate the highest level of investment. Artrage told Guardian Australia that Fringe World received a total of $1.4m in cash sponsorship and $2.5m of in-kind sponsorship in 2019. Woodside\u2019s partnership includes naming rights to the main festival hub, its awards program, and prominent logo presentation on many of the festival\u2019s marketing materials. In her written response to the coalition on 22 October, Burgess said Fringe World\u2019s priority was \u201csupporting our artists and delivering a safe and friendly environment\u201d. \u201cWe respect everyone\u2019s right to protest, and so long as protest does not impede with our priorities then there will not be any change in this respect,\u201d she wrote. The activist coalition had requested a meeting with Burgess, which was declined. The activists followed up with an email writing campaign in which more than 100 emails were sent to the festival. In December, a cease and desist letter was sent from legal firm K&amp;L Gates to the coalition on behalf of Artrage demanding they remove all Fringe logos and copyrighted property from their campaign material. Perth festival, which opens on Friday, would not disclose details of its partnership with Chevron, but the company has naming rights for its festival hub and the festival claims that more than 2.3 million people have attended \u201cChevron-aligned festival events\u201d since 2013. The artists are concerned that the relationship between fossil fuels companies and arts organisations contributes to a \u201csocial licence\u201d or \u201cveneer of respectability\u201d that normalises the dominance of fossil fuels companies in the face of climate crisis. \u201cFor a lot of companies that do some more questionable things to the Earth \u2026 it\u2019s in their best interests to saddle up with arts organisations \u2026 because it creates a different picture [of the company] in people\u2019s minds,\u201d artist and activist Ash Traylia told Guardian Australia. Traylia was one of three artists who protested at Fringe World\u2019s launch event in January, taking the stage in faux-medieval costume just before festival director Amber Hasler was due to speak, to read a statement on behalf of Fringe artists. \u201cOur art [is being] tarnished and exploited as a multipurpose billboard for this corporation,\u201d the statement said. Follow-up protests around the Fringe festival drew hundreds of people. The artists told Guardian Australia there would be more actions to come. \u201cYou\u2019re hearing about two weeks of Indigenous art lined up at the Chevron Lighthouse,\u201d said Traylia. \u201cIt has not sat well with me for a long time that there\u2019s this weird disconnect [here].\u201d Artists who spoke to Guardian Australia said they observed widespread frustration in Perth\u2019s artistic community about the \u201cimpossible choice\u201d of operating ethically in a city in which money from the resource sector is one of the primary sources of arts funding, and in which opportunities for mid-level artists were limited to festival season, thanks to complex shifts in the economic landscape since the mining boom. \u201cThe independent venues that used to fit mid-tier artists dried up, so [we lost] the stepping stones that used to be available for young, independent artists,\u201d writer and stand-up comedian Patrick Marlborough told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat combined with Perth itself being all but unaffordable. \u201cThe arts have now been funnelled into a six-week \u2018art zone\u2019 experience, almost like a holiday, where we get it out of the way by March.

Meanwhile <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/284156/trump-job-approval-personal-best.aspx\">a Gallup poll</a> has his approval rating at 49%, the highest level for that survey since 2017.<br></p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a rundown:</p> \n  <h2>Iowa</h2> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2fa93daa7d9b1cdd7085e8c268859662da314a2\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2fa93daa7d9b1cdd7085e8c268859662da314a2/0_323_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pete Buttigieg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pete Buttigieg.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>As we speak just over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/feb/03/iowa-caucus-results-winner-live-tracker-county-primary-polls\">70% of the vote is in</a>, and former small-town mayor Pete Buttigieg is slightly ahead of socialist senator Bernie Sanders, with his liberal rival Elizabeth Warren in third and Joe Biden trailing in fourth - a very worrying result for the centrist former vice-president. <br></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s not clear exactly when the Iowa Democratic party will release the rest of the results, following the shambles on Monday night when technical problems with an app caused their reporting system to collapse.<br></p> \n  <p>This looks like a good result for Buttigieg, who can claim that he\u2019s a serious, top-tier candidate. He will now argue that Biden is not as electable as he seems on paper and that the centrist Democratic establishment should instead unite around him. But he has very little support among non-white voters and it\u2019s not clear he\u2019ll be able to pick up sufficient votes in the bigger and more diverse states that are coming up in the next few weeks.<br></p> \n  <p>Sanders \u2013 who is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/04/takeaways-iowa-caucuses/?utm_campaign=wp_politics_am&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_politics\">leading in the popular vote</a>, although not the delegate count \u2013 will be disappointed if he doesn\u2019t end up coming first, although a strengthened Buttigieg might be good for him in the long term if the centrist vote ends up splitting three ways between Buttigieg, Biden and Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who is joining the race next month. Bloomberg doubled his spending on TV ads in the wake of the debacle yesterday, clearly sensing an opening. <br></p> \n  <p>The focus moves now to New Hampshire, where <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-6276.html\">Sanders has a clear lead</a>.

That leaves only Mitt Romney, the former presidential candidate, as the one possible vote against the president. <br></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s hard to say at present whether the impeachment trial has been a net gain or a net loss for Trump. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> may feel that if even half a percentage point ends up being knocked off Trump\u2019s vote tally in November by impeachment, that\u2019s a success.

      "bodyText": "Iowa Democrats have released a few more results from the caucuses. With 92% of precincts reporting, the ordering hasn\u2019t changed. Pete Buttigieg maintains still the highest count of state delegates, with Bernie Sanders trailing close behind. Sanders still leads the popular vote. Sanders\u2019 Iowa campaign director has apparently sent a memo to aides, saying they \u201chave a viable path\u201d to overtake Buttigieg. It\u2019s still unclear when we\u2019ll have results from all the precincts. The Guardian is continuing to track the results as they come in. The Senate voted to acquit Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, almost entirely along party lines. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah was the only Republican to cast a \u201cguilty\u201d vote, denying the president his talking point that Republicans were united behind him. Shortly after his acquittal, Trump tweeted a video that cast Romney as \u201cslippery\u201d. Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump, Jr. called for the Utah senator and former Republican nominee for president to be \u201cexpelled\u201d from the Republican party. All the Democrats cast \u201cguilty\u201d verdicts on both articles. Democratic leaders have promised to continue investigating Trump and his conduct toward Ukraine, though leaders say they\u2019re still weighing how to proceed. The president and his supporters rejoiced at his acquittal. Vice President Mike Pence said, \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible week.\u201d Trump tweeted a meme about never leaving office. Trump said he would publicly discuss his acquittal at the White House tomorrow at 12 pm ET. The full results of the Iowa caucuses still haven\u2019t been released. With 85% of precincts reporting, Pete Buttigieg has maintained his narrow lead over Bernie Sanders. Sanders, however, leads in the popular vote. Will Democrats keep investigating Trump? The impeachment trial has ended in acquittal, but Congress can continue investigating the president\u2019s conduct toward Ukraine, fight to access his financial documents and hear testimony from witnesses that the Senate chose not to question. Democrats have promised to hold the president to account, though Democratic leaders are still weighing how to proceed, according to Politico: \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decisions about what comes next,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the House\u2019s lead impeachment prosecutor, said in an interview. \u201cWe wanted to get through the trial, and so we\u2019ll have those conversations among our caucus, within leadership. Right now we\u2019re just trying to take stock of what just took place.\u201d Pelosi did not respond to a question late Wednesday about her plans for the Ukraine investigation. But in a statement she more broadly foreshadowed continued efforts to investigate Trump \u2014 ones that also center on Trump\u2019s finances and allegations of self-dealing. \u201cThe House will continue to protect and defend the checks and balances in the Constitution that safeguard our Republic, both in the courts of law and in the court of public opinion,\u201d Pelosi said. How did Donald Trump escape impeachment? The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy reviews the many factors that that all but guaranteed Trump\u2019s acquittal. House Republicans have introduced legislation to register disapproval of Speaker Nancy Pelosi after she ripped up a copy of Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech. \u201cWhereas, the conduct of Speaker Pelosi was a breach of decorum and degraded the proceedings of the joint session to the discredit of the House,\u201d the resolution reads. \u201cResolved, That the House of Representatives disapproves of the behavior of Speaker Pelosi during the joint session of Congress held on February 4, 2020.\u201d The resolution, introduced by Texas Representative Kay Granger is unlikely to get anywhere \u2014 Representatives are expected to vote to table it tomorrow. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign sent a fundraising blast soon after the Senate voted to acquit him. \u201cWe are STRONGER THAN EVER,\u201d the email reads: The White House has claimed \u201cfull vindication and exoneration\u201d following the acquittal. Trump, meanwhile, has tweeted a video casting Mitt Romney, the only Republican senator to vote for an article of impeachment, as \u201cslippery\u201d. The president\u2019s son, Donald Trump, Jr. has called for Romney to be expelled from the Republican Party. In an op-ed published in the Washington Post, the House managers who argued the case against Donald Trump over the past two weeks once more condemned the president\u2019s actions, and the Senate\u2019s decision to acquit him. \u201cIf left in office, the president will not stop trying to cheat in the next election until he succeeds,\u201d they wrote, adding that the only option was to vote him out of office. Because of the impeachment process, voters can now stand forewarned of the lengths to which the president will go to try to secure his reelection, violating the law and undermining our national security and that of our allies. By denying the American people a fair trial, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also deprived the president of something that he desperately sought \u2014 exoneration. There can be no exoneration without a legitimate trial. Out of fear of what they would learn, the Senate refused to hold one. The president will not be vindicated, and neither will the Senate, certainly not by history. In case any representatives missed the big news... Congress was formally notified of Donald Trump\u2019s acquittal. That\u2019s it from me after another historic day in Washington. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands: As expected, the Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit Trump on both articles of impeachment, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Republican senator Mitt Romney broke ranks to vote for conviction on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, although he voted for acquittal on obstruction of Congress. The stunning move robbed Trump of his key talking point that Republicans were unified in opposing his removal from office. Every Democratic senator cast \u201cguilty\u201d verdicts on both articles of impeachment, meaning Senate Democrats were actually more unified than their Republican colleagues on the impeachment vote. Trump said he would addess the acquittal in a public statement at the White House tomorrow at 12 pm ET. More results are trickling out from the Iowa caucuses, but Pete Buttigieg has maintained his narrow lead over Bernie Sanders. Maanvi will have more updates and analysis coming, so stay tuned. Speaking in Pennsylvania at a \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d event, vice president Mike Pence praised Trump\u2019s State of the Union address and celebrated his acquittal. \u201cLast night I had a real good seat at the State of the Union,\u201d Pence said to cheers. He then made a veiled reference to House speaker Nancy Pelosi tearing up her copy of Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cI get the feeling the woman sitting next to me didn\u2019t like the speech as much as I did,\u201d Pence said. He then turned his focus to the Senate acquittal vote. \u201cAfter a sham investigation and partisan impeachment, it\u2019s over, America,\u201d Pence said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible week.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi has issued a statement denouncing the Senate\u2019s vote to acquit Trump and reiterating that he will be impeached \u201cforever.\u201d \u201cToday, the President and Senate Republicans have normalized lawlessness and rejected the system of checks and balances of our Constitution,\u201d Pelosi said. The speaker once again lamented the Senate\u2019s decision not to hear from new witnesses, arguing the lack of evidence delegitimized Trump\u2019s acquittal. \u201cThe President will boast that he has been acquitted. There can be no acquittal without a trial, and there is no trial without witnesses, documents and evidence,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe President has been impeached forever.\u201d In a letter to the Secret Service requesting Hunter Biden\u2019s travel records, Republican senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson said they were \u201creviewing potential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates during the Obama administration, particularly with respect to his business activities in Ukraine and China.\u201d Grassley, the chairman of the Senate finance committee, and Johnson, the chairman of the homeland security committee, wrote, \u201cWe write to request information about whether Hunter Biden used government-sponsored travel to help conduct private business, to include his work for Rosemont Seneca and related entities in China and Ukraine.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that Republicans controlled the Senate for the final two years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, when Hunter Biden was serving on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. They could have launched the investigation then, but they only raised concerns about Biden\u2019s business activities after Trump\u2019s allies tried to pressure Ukraine to look into the matter. Moments after Trump\u2019s acquittal in the impeachment trial, two Republican senators indicated they intend to continue investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities in Ukraine. During the trial, Republicans repeatedly tried to deflect attention away from the allegations against Trump by raising concerns about the business activities of the former vice president\u2019s son. But US and Ukrainian officials have said there is no evidence Joe Biden or his son violated any corruption laws when Hunter was serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. In a new statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham lambasted \u201cthe sham impeachment attempt\u201d and claimed Trump had been completely vindicated after the Senate voted for his acquittal. \u201cToday, the sham impeachment attempt concocted by Democrats ended in the full vindication and exoneration of President Donald J. Trump,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cAs we have said all along, he is not guilty.\u201d Grisham also took aim at Mitt Romney, who voted to convict on the first article of impeachment, in the statement: \u201cThe Senate voted to reject the baseless articles of impeachment, and only the President\u2019s political opponents \u2013 all Democrats, and one failed Republican presidential candidate \u2013 voted for the manufactured impeachment articles.\u201d As senators were voting in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, more results trickled out of Iowa. But something seemed off. As the New York Times\u2019 Nate Cohn pointed out, it seemed as if SDEs for Bernie Sanders had gone to Deval Patrick or Tom Steyer. SDE\u2019s owed to Elizabeth Warren may have gone to Steyer as well. The Iowa Democratic Party noted the error, and issued a correction soon after. Sanders\u2019 delegates from counties he\u2019d clearly won were restored. Per the latest numbers, with 85% of precincts reporting, it appears Pete Buttigieg has maintained a narrow lead. Trump said in a tweet that he would address his acquittal in the impeachment trial in a public statement at the White House tomorrow at 12 pm ET. Considering Trump\u2019s first response to the acquittal was to tweet a meme about his presidency lasting \u201c4EVA,\u201d it seems unlikely he will be particularly contrite in the statement. In comparison, when Bill Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999, he reacted by telling the American people that he was \u201cprofoundly sorry for all I have done wrong in words and deeds.\u201d Trump\u2019s allies, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, are boasting that the president has been \u201cacquitted for life\u201d following the Senate\u2019s impeachment vote. The phrase seems to be a jab at House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has said that Trump\u2019s legacy will forever be marred by the impeachment. \u201cI think that we have pulled back a veil of behavior totally unacceptable to our founders, and that the public will see this with a clearer eye, an unblurred eye,\u201d Pelosi told the New York Times earlier this week. \u201cWhatever happens, he has been impeached forever.\u201d Speaking to reporters after the acquittal vote, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said vulnerable Republicans facing difficult reelections have been politically aided by the impeachment trial. \u201cI can tell you as a poll watcher who\u2019s looking at polls in certain Senate races, every one of our people in tough races \u2026 is in better shape today than they were before the impeachment trial started,\u201d McConnell said. The majority leader added he was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d by Mitt Romney\u2019s decision to convict on the first article of impeachment, but he did not seem to give any credence to the far-fetched idea of expelling Romney from the Republican conference. McConnell also repeatedly dodged a question about whether it was appropriate for the president to ask Ukraine to investigate a political rival. \u201cI\u2019m here to talk about the political impact of this,\u201d McConnell said. Hillary Clinton has weighed in on Trump\u2019s acquittal, accusing the Republican senators who opposed the president\u2019s removal of betraying their oath to defend the Constitution. Trump has offered his first commentary on the impeachment trial, resharing a meme imagining his presidency extending well beyond the two-term limit established by the Constitution. Trump has repeatedly joked with supporters about extending his presidency beyond eight years, causing heartburn on the left even as legal scholars insist there is no means for him to do so. Before adjourning the impeachment trial, Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts thanked the senators for their conduct as he carried out \u201cill-defined responsibilities in an unfamiliar setting.\u201d \u201cYou have been generous hosts, and I look forward to seeing you again under happier circumstances,\u201d Roberts said. With that, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell called for the chamber to adjourn, and Roberts gaveled out the session. The impeachment trial of Donald Trump has officially ended. Moments after Trump was acquitted, his reelection campaign jumped at the chance to declare victory over Democrats. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said the acquittal \u201ctotally vindicated\u201d the president, criticizing the impeachment as a \u201cterrible ordeal\u201d: The Trump campaign\u2019s Twitter account also tweeted out a meme of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s face photoshopped onto Nancy Pelosi\u2019s in the clip of the House speaker tearing up the president\u2019s State of the Union last night: Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts has read the final votes on both articles of impeachment and declared Trump to be acquitted. Roberts said, \u201cThe Senate having tried Donald John Trump, President of the United States, upon two Articles of Impeachment exhibited against him by the House of Representatives, and two-thirds of the Senators present not having found him guilty of the charges contained therein: it is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the said Donald John Trump be, and he is hereby, acquitted of the charges in said articles.\u201d Before adjourning, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell thanked Roberts for his service and awarded him \u201cthe golden gavel\u201d for his work. McConnell also thanked the Senate pages who helped to keep the floor running during the proceedings. Trump has officially been acquitted of both articles of impeachment, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The votes -- 52-48 and 53-47 -- fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to remove the president from office. Instead, Democrats hoping to oust Trump will have to wait until the November election to try to end his presidency. Senators are now casting their votes on the second article, saying whether Trump is \u201cguilty\u201d or \u201cnot guilty\u201d of obstruction of Congress. Republicans have already cast enough votes to acquit Trump, but the vote is not official until it is gaveled in. The vote is under way on the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress. The final vote is expected to be 53-47 because Mitt Romney, who voted \u201cguilty\u201d on the first article of abuse of power, has said he will vote \u201cnot guilty.\u201d As with the first article, the vote is expected to fall well short of the two-thirds majority needed to remove Trump from office. It\u2019s official: Trump has been acquitted on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. The final vote, as expected, was 52-48, with all Democrats and Mitt Romney supporting conviction. As expected, Mitt Romney just cast his \u201cguilty\u201d verdict on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. But the Republican senator is expected to vote \u201cnot guilty\u201d on the second article, obstruction of Congress. The Senate vote began with Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts asking members, \u201cSenators how say you? Is the defendant, Donald John Trump, guilty or not guilty?\u201d Each senator, in alphabetical order, is now saying whether Trump is \u201cguilty\u201d or \u201cnot guilty\u201d on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. Today\u2019s impeachment vote is historic for two reasons: it marks the first time a member of the president\u2019s party has voted for his removal from office, and it is also the first time the opposite party has been unified in supporting the president\u2019s conviction. The Senate vote on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, is now under way. The final vote is expected to be 52-48 in favor of acquittal, with every Democrat plus Mitt Romney voting for conviction. In order to remove from the president from office, two-thirds of the Senate would have to support conviction, so the vote will fall well short of that. But Democrats will likely declare victory with having been able to forge a (barely) bipartisan coalition to support Trump\u2019s removal from office. Moments before the Senate is scheduled to vote on whether to remove Trump from office, majority leader Mitch McConnell issued a final denunciation of the president\u2019s impeachment in a floor speech. McConnell criticized Democrats like House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who have said Trump\u2019s expected acquittal will be illegitimate because there was no \u201cfair trial.\u201d \u201cPerhaps she\u2019ll tear up the verdict like she tore up the State of the Union address,\u201d McConnell said. The Kentucky Republican concluded, \u201cI hope we will look back on this vote and say this is the day the fever began to break. I hope we will not say this was just the beginning.\u201d Senator Joe Manchin has said he will vote to convict Trump on both articles of impeachment, indicating every Democrat will vote for the president\u2019s removal from office. Trump and his allies had hoped to pick off at least one moderate Democrat on the impeachment vote, in the hope of being able to claim a bipartisan acquittal. Instead, Democrats will be able to claim a bipartisan push for conviction with Mitt Romney\u2019s vote in favor of the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. Republican senator Susan Collins, who has said she will vote to acquit Trump, walked back her comment yesterday, \u201cI believe that the president has learned from this case.\u201d The Maine Republican told a reporter that it was more accurate to say she \u201chopes\u201d Trump has learned from the impeachment trial. During an off-the-record luncheon with news anchors yesterday, Trump reportedly dismissed the notion that any of his actions toward Ukraine were inappropriate. \u201cIt was a perfect call,\u201d Trump told the anchors of his July conversation with the Ukrainian president, during which he asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d from the foreign leader and went on to discuss potential corruption investigations. Speaking on the Senate floor, minority leader Chuck Schumer outlined the charges against Trump and made the case for his removal from office, even as the president\u2019s acquittal appears all but certain. Schumer once again quoted Michael Gerhardt, one of the legal experts who testified during the public hearings of the House impeachment inquiry. Gerhardt told the House judiciary committee in December, \u201cI want to stress that if what we\u2019re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable.\u201d Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema will reportedly vote to convict Trump on both articles of impeachment, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Arizona Republic reports: The decision by Sinema, a moderate Arizona Democrat who was seen as a swing vote, was one of the last remaining questions hanging over Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. On both counts, when asked if the president is guilty or not guilty, Sinema will say, \u2018Guilty.\u2019 Sinema\u2019s votes will put her in line with most of her Democratic colleagues and come hours after the president gave vocal support in his State of the Union address to a bipartisan Sinema bill to provide new parents with cash advances on their taxes. In deeming the president guilty, Sinema said in a lengthy statement provided first to The Arizona Republic, that she is upholding her duty to the U.S. Constitution, and putting the interests of the country ahead of partisan politics or personal interest. The last remaining Democratic senator whose stance remains unknown is Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has declined to say how he will vote. The Senate is just 30 minutes away from voting on whether to remove Trump from office, and more results are trickling in from the Iowa caucuses. With 75% of precincts reporting, up from 71% last night, Pete Buttigieg has retained his narrow lead over Bernie Sanders. Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report has now projected that Buttigieg will win the most state delegate equivalents, wich is the metric used to determine the winner of the Iowa caucuses. But the fact that Sanders won the highest number of caucusgoers in the first alignment makes it likely that the Vermont senator will also declare victory from Iowa. Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama, predicted Mitt Romney\u2019s speech explaining his decision to vote to convict on the first article of impeachment would quickly find its way into Democratic attack ads against the vulnerable Republican senators who are voting to acquit. Some of Mitt Romney\u2019s critics have speculated that his criticism of Trump is meant to set him up for a presidential bid in 2024, but the Republican senator laughed at this idea in an interview with the Atlantic. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager is also mocking Mitt Romney after the Republican senator announced he would vote to convict the president on the first article of impeachment. Trump has not yet weighed in on Romney\u2019s announcement, but it seems very likely that the president will similarly lash out against the Republican senator, considering the long-standing tension between the two. Romney spoke out against Trump\u2019s election during the 2016 campaign, and as recently as October, the president mocked Romney for having \u201cchoked\u201d in his 2012 race against Barack Obama. The president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, lashed out against Mitt Romney after the Republican senator announced he would vote to convict Trump on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. Don Jr said Romney, who lost the 2012 presidential election to Barack Obama, was \u201cforever bitter\u201d about not being president and \u201cshould be expelled\u201d from the Republican Party. But at least one of Romney\u2019s Republican colleagues pushed back against that idea, saying it was up for voters to decide. Echoing his Senate floor speech, Mitt Romney said in an interview with Fox News that he believed Trump should be removed from office. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine a more serious attack on the Constitution and on a republic like ours than saying that a president would be able to enlist a foreign government to corrupt our elections so that our president could keep in power,\u201d the Republican senator told Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens in tinhorn autocracies. It does not happen in the United States of America.\u201d But Romney noted that he believed his Republican colleagues, who are voting to acquit Trump, also \u201cfollowed their conscience as they understood it.\u201d Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee and the niece of senator Mitt Romney, said she \u201cdisagreed\u201d with her uncle\u2019s decision to vote to convict on the first article of impeachment but believed the party was \u201cmore united than ever\u201d behind Trump. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff applauded Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cmoral courage\u201d after the Republican senator announced he would vote to convict Trump on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. In his Senate floor speech, Mitt Romney noted he had hoped to hear from John Bolton in part to see if Trump\u2019s former national security adviser could provide exculpatory evidence in connection to the allegations at the heart of the impeachment trial: I sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he said might raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment. Like each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I am convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We have come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience. ... We\u2019re all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that is distinction enough for any citizen. Democratic senators raced to applaud their Republican colleague Mitt Romney after he announced he would vote to convict Trump on the first article of impeachment. As Republican senator Mitt Romney was wrapping up his Senate speech explaining he will vote to convict Trump on the first article of impeachment, the White House canceled a planned pool spray with the president and Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader. Republican senator Mitt Romney\u2019s decision to vote to convict Trump is not only stunning; it\u2019s also historic in terms of past impeachment trials. Republican senator Mitt Romney said he would vote to convict Trump on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, but would vote to acquit on the second article, obstruction of Congress. Romney acknowledged his vote would not be enough to change Trump\u2019s ultimate acquittal, but he cast his decision as a matter of duty to his office. \u201cWith my vote I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty,\u201d Romney said. \u201cWhat the president did was wrong. Grievously wrong.\u201d In an emotional speech on the Senate floor, Republican senator Mitt Romney announced he would vote to convict Trump in the impeachment trial. \u201cMy faith is at the heart of who I am,\u201d Romney said, choking up for several seconds. \u201cI take an oath before God as consequential.\u201d Romney said this was \u201cthe most difficult decision I have ever faced\u201d but had concluded that Trump was \u201cguilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\u201d \u201cThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the President committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a \u2018high crime and misdemeanor,\u2019\u201d Romney said. \u201cYes, he did.\u201d Romney\u2019s decision robs Trump of a key talking point -- that every Republican senator supported his acquittal. Instead, Democrats will be able to claim the push to convict Trump was (barely) bipartisan. If you thought waiting two days for the Iowa results was fun, then you\u2019ll love this: Texas Democrats say they are also anticipating a delay in the reporting of results when voters head to the polls there on Super Tuesday. The Texas Tribune reports: Officials with the Texas Democratic Party said they were recently told by the Texas Secretary of State\u2019s office that it will not be able to provide on election night the numbers needed to allocate a majority of the 228 delegates up for grabs in the state on Super Tuesday. In a Jan. 23 meeting, the Democrats said, top state election officials cited limitations to their revamped reporting system, which is used to compile returns from the state\u2019s 254 counties. \u2018They basically said that\u2019s not built out yet,\u2019 said Glen Maxey, the special projects director for the Texas Democratic Party who attended the meeting with state officials. At issue are 149 delegates that will be won by Democratic presidential candidates through a complex formula that divvies up those delegates based on the distribution of votes in each of Texas\u2019 31 state Senate districts. Maxey said he and other officials were told the state initially will collect election returns at the county level but not at the senatorial district or precinct level, which are needed to calculate how many delegates each candidate picks up. Party officials were told those more detailed numbers would be made available \u2018the next day or so,\u2019 Maxey said. On top of that delay, California officials have said it may take up to a week to determine delegate allocation because of the state\u2019s high number of Democratic voters. (California is also voting on Super Tuesday and is the top prize in the Democratic presidential primary.) It looks like members of Trump\u2019s impeachment defense team, who have consistently dismissed any notion that the president\u2019s actions toward Ukraine were improper, will be present for today\u2019s acquittal vote. Pete Buttigieg\u2019s energetic campaigning in a clutch of counties in rural northeastern Iowa that flipped to Trump four years ago paid off when he triumphed in almost all of them. In a shift among Democrats to the centre, Buttigieg took Howard County - notable as the US county that had the biggest swing from Barack Obama to Trump in 2016. It was won handily by Bernie Sanders in the caucuses against Hillary Clinton that year. But on Monday, Sanders was driven into third place in Howard behind Buttigieg and Joe Biden as a majority of local Democrats focussed on who they thought would be most electable over more ideological considerations. The same was true in more than a dozen counties in northeastern Iowa that switched from Obama to Trump, some of which had also backed Sanders four years ago. Buttigieg won 12 state delegates in Howard County to seven for Biden and six for Sanders. Elizabeth Warren took just two. Amy Klobuchar did well in the region too, winning in one county and coming in second in several others, in part because she is a senator for neighbouring Minnesota. One of those who switched horses from Sanders was the chair of the county Democrats, Laura Hubka. Hubka, a US navy veteran who works in radiology at the local hospital, was a fervent supporter of the Vermont senator four years ago but then decided he was unelectable. As she looked around for an alternative, she liked what she heard from Buttigieg. \u201cI really liked Warren to begin with but then I sat down and talked to Pete at an event. Then as I talked to more and more Democratic voters I realised that in this county and this nation people aren\u2019t as far left as I am in wanting single-payer health care and that we had to find a way to be behind somebody that had more realistic views. As I looked around, it seemed to be Pete,\u201d she said. Hubka said the swing away from Sanders is not as dramatic as it might seem given that she thinks much of his vote in Howard four years ago was a reaction against Clinton. \u201cBefore it was Clinton or Sanders and now we had a more moderate candidate that really spent time talking to people and didn\u2019t have all the baggage. This county was not friendly for Hillary Clinton. This time there was a moderate candidate that just appealed more to the people without having all the baggage of Bill Clinton and the Democratic party establishment behind them,\u201d she said. Buttigieg put months of campaigning into Iowa, crisscrossing the state, appearing in small cities and towns, meeting large numbers of voters face to face, and building momentum. But he\u2019s not going to be able to do that in every state, so can he go on pulling off upset wins? Hubka thinks so. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many people come into the office at work today, registered Republicans, saying I really wasn\u2019t looking into Pete but now I\u2019m going to look into him,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s those people who don\u2019t want to register as Democrats but who are now going to take a look at Pete just over the last 24 hours and hear what he\u2019s all about. It does make a difference when he meets people but he\u2019s going to be doing more town halls, he\u2019s going to be on CNN. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll elevate him nationally.\u201d Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to Joe Biden, repeatedly dodged a question from CNN about whether the Iowa results can be trusted, considering the reporting of the numbers has been so delayed. The current results show Biden in fourth place, a dismal showing for the former vice president that Biden himself described earlier today as a \u201cgut punch.\u201d But some of Biden\u2019s allies and advisers have apparently sought to cast doubt on the results because of the reporting delay. When asked on Monday night whether the results were discredited because of the reporting inconsistencies, senator Chris Dodd, a Biden ally, said, \u201cYeah, sounds to me like if you can\u2019t\u2014you know, if this is wrong what else is wrong?\u201d However, the Iowa Democratic Party has said the data officials have is accurate and substantiated by a paper trail. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Amanda Holpuch. As we await more results from Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses, the candidates are clearly wasting no time in going after the current top-two finishers, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders. At a campaign event in Somersworth, New Hampshire, Joe Biden went after both Buttigieg and Sanders. He said it would be \u201ca risk\u201d to nominate Buttigieg, considering his most recent job was as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, an argument the former vice president echoed over Twitter. On Sanders, Biden warned the Vermont senator was too far left for the party and said down-ballot Democratic candidates would \u201chave to carry the label he chose for himself,\u201d referring to Sanders\u2019 self-description as a Democratic socialist. Going into today, there were a handful of senators who have not indicated how they would vote on impeachment. One of those senators, Alabama Democrat Doug Jones, said this morning he would vote to convict. We\u2019re still waiting to see how a few others will vote, including: Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia; Republican Mitt Romney, of Utah; Democrat Diane Feinstein, of California; and Democrat Krysten Sinema, of Arizona. House judiciary chairman, Jerry Nadler, told CNN it is \u201clikely\u201d they will subpoena former national security adviser, John Bolton. California senator Diane Feinstein said she would back a proposal by fellow Democrat, Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, to censure Donald Trump, according to the Washington Post. On Monday, Manchin called on senators to censure, a formal rebuke to the president less dramatic than impeachment. \u201cI do believe a bipartisan majority of this body would vote to censure president Trump for his action in this matter. Censure would allow this body to unite across party lines,\u201d Manchin said Monday on the Senate floor. \u201cHis behavior cannot go unchecked by the Senate and censure would allow a bipartisan statement condemning his unacceptable behavior in the strongest terms.\u201d Feinstein is one of few Democrats who has said or suggested she would not vote to convict the president. Last week, she told reporters she was unsure about how she would vote. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren has released a campaign video for her presidential run which touts her relationship with president Barack Obama. The 30 second spot quotes a speech Obama gave in September 2010 to announce Warren, then a Harvard Law professor, would be head of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It was Warren\u2019s idea to create the agency, but it was not certain she would be picked to helm it. \u201cShe\u2019s a native of Oklahoma and a janitor\u2019s daughter who has become one of the country\u2019s fiercest advocates of the middle class,\u201d Obama said in 2010. Warren is one of four Senators balancing the campaign trail with the impeachment vote. In New Hampshire this morning, she told a crowd she couldn\u2019t stay long enough to do one of her trademark selfie lines because she had to vote to impeach the president. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders also spoke about impeachment at a town hall this morning in New Hampshire, which has its presidential primary election on Tuesday. \u201cIf Trump gets away with this, I want you to appreciate the precedent that is being established,\u201d Sanders said. Donald Trump will meet today with Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, the White House announced this morning. The White House said: The visit is an opportunity to reaffirm the commitment of the United States to the people of Venezuela and to discuss how we can work with president Guaid\u00f3 to expedite a democratic transition in Venezuela that will end the ongoing crisis. We will continue to work with our partners in the region to confront the illegitimate dictatorship in Venezuela, and we will stand alongside the Venezuelan people to ensure a future that is democratic and prosperous. Guaid\u00f3 made a surprise appearance at last night\u2019s State of the Union. Alabama senator Doug Jones, one of the few Democrats who might have voted to acquit the president, just released a statement to say after \u201cmany sleepless nights\u201d he has \u201creluctantly\u201d decided to vote to convict on both articles of impeachment. \u201cI did not run for Senate hoping to participate in the impeachment trial of a duly-elected President, but I cannot and will not shrink from my duty to defend the Constitution and to do impartial justice,\u201d Jones said in a lengthy statement. Senators are elected to make tough choices. We are required to study the facts of each issue before us and exercise our independent judgement in keeping with the oaths we take. The gravity of this moment, the seriousness of the charges, and the implications for future presidencies and Congresses all contributed to the difficult with which I have arrive at my decision. Meanwhile, another Democrat who could go either way, West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin, has told reporters the public will learn how he is voting when it is time to vote. The Senate has convened for a final round of 10 minute speeches before today\u2019s 4pm impeachment votes on the two articles of impeachment. Tennessee\u2019s Lamar Alexander, a Republican, said he did not support impeachment \u201csimply for actions that are inappropriate.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe question then, is not whether the president did it,\u201d Alexander said, adding it s about what Congress and the people should do. Alexander called it a \u201cwholly partisan\u201d impeachment. He said if it went through it \u201cwould create a weapon of perpetual impeachment\u201d and would be gasoline on a fire that stokes divisions in the country. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, also used a weapon metaphor to describe impeachment, which he said is: \u201cthe nuclear option in our Constitution.\u201d He is voting for acquittal. New York senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, used his time to criticize Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech and challenge the president\u2019s claims in the remarks. There might still be room to hear from former national security adviser, John Bolton, in the halls of Congress. House judiciary chairman, Jerry Nadler, told CNN it is \u201clikely\u201d they will subpoena Bolton. When asked the same question on Sunday, House Intelligence chairman Adam Schiff was more circumspect and would not confirm or deny a plan to subpoena Bolton. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment to this point on what our plans may or may not be with respect to John Bolton, but I will say this: whether it\u2019s before -- in testimony before the House \u2013 or it\u2019s in his (forthcoming) book or it\u2019s in one form or another, the truth will come out (and) will continue to come out,\u201d Schiff told CBS. Donald Trump appears to be en route to becoming the third US president to remain in office following acquittal in a Senate impeachment trial. But what might it mean for Trump\u2019s future that he was impeached at all? Guardian national affairs correspondent, Tom McCarthy, has the answers: Heading into the impeachment vote today, one of the lone Republican senators tipped as a possible voter for impeachment, Susan Collins, said she hoped the president learned from his \u201cwrong\u201d conduct. It took only a few hours for the Maine senator to learn the president had not. On the Senate floor yesterday, Collins confirmed she would vote to acquit Trump, despite her disapproval of his request that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy investigate Joe Biden and his son in a phone call on 25 July. \u201cIt was wrong for president Trump to mention former vice President Biden on that phone call, and it was wrong for him ask a foreign country to investigate a political rival,\u201d Collins said. But, she added, \u201cI do not believe the House has met its burden of the showing the president\u2019s conduct, however flawed, warrants the extreme step of removal from office.\u201d In an interview with CBS News, Collins also said: \u201cI believe that the president has learned from this case.\u201d Later that day at a State of the Union luncheon, a reporter asked Trump what he made of Collins comments, Trump responded that he had done nothing wrong. \u201cIt was a perfect call,\u201d he said. On the other side of the aisle, Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, said Republicans decision to acquit the president was an \u201cabject failure.\u201d My colleague Tom McCarthy has written about the prospects for the impeachment vote today. Not only is it unlikely that more than one Republican might break ranks and vote to convict Trump, it\u2019s possible a handful of Democrats might vote to acquit him. With the momentum seemingly on Trump\u2019s side, the chances improved that the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, would deliver a clean party-line acquittal vote for the president on Wednesday afternoon. The Republicans hold a 53-seat majority in the Senate. Two Republicans, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, broke with the party during the trial to vote in favor of calling witnesses and issuing subpoenas for documents blocked by the Trump administration. On Tuesday afternoon, Collins announced she would vote to acquit on both articles of impeachment. \u201cI do not believe that the House has met its burden in showing that the president\u2019s conduct, however flawed, warrants the extreme step of removal from office,\u201d she said. Romney had given no public indication of how he planned to vote. Three Democrats were likewise in the spotlight as potential swing votes. Doug Jones of Alabama, who faces a difficult election in November, has joined Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia in calling for a censure of Trump \u2013 a possible indication that one or both viewed the prospective removal of Trump as a step too far. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, a moderate Democrat in a state that supported Trump in 2016, has not indicated how she is planning to vote. Trump is up and about and happy with the coverage of his State of the Union speech last night: He has also retweeted numerous critiques of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to rip her copy of his speech up. Pete Buttigieg threw everything into winning the Iowa Democratic caucuses and \u2013 with 71% of the vote in following Monday\u2019s results debacle \u2013 his gamble may well have paid off. If so, the former mayor of tiny South Bend, Indiana, may look back on this moment as the peak of his political career, or the start of a long, hard slog that could take him all the way to the White House. Buttigieg\u2019s supporters see him as a fresh, upbeat voice of moderation who could potentially unite the party and unseat Donald Trump, a military veteran and intellectual whose appeal recalls Barack Obama\u2019s. Critics say he is an inexperienced, policy-lite novice who worked as a management consultant for McKinsey, holds fund-raisers in the \u201cwine caves\u201d of the super-rich, and has no record of the support among non-whites he would need to win the Democratic nomination and the November election. The great unknown is whether the US would vote for a gay president. Those dismissing such worries point to Obama twice proving the US could elect a black man, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s netting of 3m more votes than Trump in 2016, which showed a woman could win the popular vote. Further back, John F Kennedy overcame suggestions a Catholic could never win the White House. But an October poll showed only half of American voters said they were ready for a gay president, and some have put the gender gap in Buttigieg\u2019s support down partially to male homophobia. A voter in Iowa asking to rescind her vote for Buttigieg after learning that he was gay was widely reported this week. \u201cAre you saying that he has the same-sex partner? Pete?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody like that in the White House.\u201d Born in 1982 to a Maltese-born father and an American mother, Pete Buttigieg - pronounced buddha-judge - attended Harvard and Oxford and worked as a management consultant before serving in the US naval reserve from 2009 to 2017, reaching the rank of lieutenant and being awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal following his seven-month tour in Afghanistan in 2014. After working for John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential bid, among other political campaigns, he was elected mayor of his home city of South Bend in 2012. He came out as gay in 2015 and won that year\u2019s election with 80% of the vote, marrying his partner Chasten in 2018. His time as mayor was not without controversy - some of which partly explains ongoing suspicion of him among some African-American Democrats. He notoriously received less than 1 per cent support from black Democrats in one 2019 poll. In 2012 Buttigieg asked for the resignation of the city\u2019s first black police chief amid a row over the illegal taping of officers\u2019 telephone calls, and the city was sued for racial discrimination. And in 2019 he was seen as reacting in a flat-footed way to the killing of an African-American man by a white police officer. \u201cYou\u2019re running for president and you want black people to vote for you? That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d one woman told him. It\u2019s a problem Buttigieg \u2013 who backs a publicly-run health insurance scheme, background checks for gun buyers, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and tackling climate change \u2013 will have to resolve if he is to now make the case that Joe Biden is not as electable as he seems and that the centrist Democratic establishment should unite around him instead. He can hope for a good showing in the New Hampshire primary next week, but the diverse electorates of South Carolina, California and Texas will prove much more difficult terrain, and may see him eclipsed. Meanwhile former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg \u2013 who plans to join the race in earnest in March and has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising in California and elsewhere \u2013 will be making the same argument to Democratic moderates that he is the most electable moderate. The billionaire doubled his spending on TV ads following the Iowa debacle, clearly sensing an opening. And if the centrist vote splits three ways between Buttigieg, Biden and Bloomberg that could end up benefitting the man who seems to have come second in Iowa \u2013 veteran socialist senator Bernie Sanders. \u201cIn order to govern, in order to lead, in order to move this country forward, we need a president focused on the future and ready to leave the politics of the past in the past,\u201d Buttigieg said in New Hampshire on Tuesday. His opponents will hope to leave the former mayor\u2019s strong showing in Iowa in the past instead. Hello and welcome to another big day in American politics. It\u2019s fair to say Donald Trump is probably having a pretty good week. Last night he got 80 minutes to make his case for a second term on primetime TV with his State of the Union address, as the Democrats continued to struggle to publish results from their first primary contest on Iowa on Monday. Later today, Trump will be acquitted in his impeachment trial \u2013 and despite several Republican senators admitting his conduct in holding back military aid for Ukraine as he asked its president to investigate Democrat Joe Biden was inappropriate, perhaps only one will vote to convict him. Meanwhile a Gallup poll has his approval rating at 49%, the highest level for that survey since 2017. Here\u2019s a rundown: Iowa As we speak just over 70% of the vote is in, and former small-town mayor Pete Buttigieg is slightly ahead of socialist senator Bernie Sanders, with his liberal rival Elizabeth Warren in third and Joe Biden trailing in fourth - a very worrying result for the centrist former vice-president. It\u2019s not clear exactly when the Iowa Democratic party will release the rest of the results, following the shambles on Monday night when technical problems with an app caused their reporting system to collapse. This looks like a good result for Buttigieg, who can claim that he\u2019s a serious, top-tier candidate. He will now argue that Biden is not as electable as he seems on paper and that the centrist Democratic establishment should instead unite around him. But he has very little support among non-white voters and it\u2019s not clear he\u2019ll be able to pick up sufficient votes in the bigger and more diverse states that are coming up in the next few weeks. Sanders \u2013 who is leading in the popular vote, although not the delegate count \u2013 will be disappointed if he doesn\u2019t end up coming first, although a strengthened Buttigieg might be good for him in the long term if the centrist vote ends up splitting three ways between Buttigieg, Biden and Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who is joining the race next month. Bloomberg doubled his spending on TV ads in the wake of the debacle yesterday, clearly sensing an opening. The focus moves now to New Hampshire, where Sanders has a clear lead. Tonight at 8pm ET CNN will hold the first of two town-hall style candidates\u2019 debates, the first one featuring Biden, Warren, and businessmen Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer. You can see all the Iowa results so far and watch the rest of them eventually come in with our results tracker here. Impeachment At about 4pm ET today, Donald Trump will in all likelihood become the third US president to be acquitted after an impeachment trial. Dashing Democratic hopes, moderate Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have both now confirmed they will not vote to convict Trump. That leaves only Mitt Romney, the former presidential candidate, as the one possible vote against the president. It\u2019s hard to say at present whether the impeachment trial has been a net gain or a net loss for Trump. Democrats may feel that if even half a percentage point ends up being knocked off Trump\u2019s vote tally in November by impeachment, that\u2019s a success. Trump and the Republicans will continue to make the case that the impeachment process was an attempt by the Democrats to overturn Americans\u2019 democratic choice in 2016, and take away their democratic choice this year. Polling so far has been inconclusive. State of the union Trump\u2019s re-election strategy is thought to be all about riling up his base against the Democrats, and his State of the Union speech last night seemed both to encourage and to illustrate the bitter divisions in American political life. \u201cEach year feels progressively worse and more hopelessly polarised than the one before,\u201d my colleague David Smith wrote. Trump hyped up the strength of the economy, and focused on immigration, abortion, guns, reglion, and judicial appointments in ways guaranteed to delight the right and infuriate the Democrats, with his usual disregard for factual accuracy. Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats\u2019 leader in the House, ripped up her copy of the speech as she stood behind Trump in full view of the cameras. Other Democrats walked out. Anti-gun campaigner Fred Guttenberg was thrown out for heckling. Trump bestowed the presidential medal of freedom on rightwing talk-show host Rush Limbaugh live then and there. Republicans chanted \u201cfour more years\u201d. \u201cThe state of our Union is stronger than ever before,\u201d Trump intoned. Everything about this event suggested the opposite. We\u2019ll be covering all this and more throughout the day right here.",

      "bodyText": "The government received legal advice that debts issued under the botched robodebt scheme were unlawful, confidential documents provided to a Senate committee have revealed. Emails between top tax office officials published on Thursday show that the agency was told by the Department of Social Services that debts based solely on the controversial \u201cincome averaging\u201d method were \u201cnot lawful debts\u201d. The 19 November email, from the Australian Taxation Office\u2019s general counsel, Jonathan Todd, to the ATO commissioner, Chris Jordan, was marked \u201cSensitive: Legal\u201d, and was sent on the same day the Morrison government announced it was overhauling the scheme. \u201cIn further discussion with DSS, it appears that what you need to raise is: they have advised you that they have received legal advice that debts based solely upon DSS own income averaging of ATO annual tax data are not lawful debts (\u2018robodebts\u2019),\u201d the email stated. \u201cThey have also suspended the raising and recovery of robodebts as of today.\u201d In the email, Todd told Jordan that \u201cin view of that legal advice \u2026 it appears that \u2018robodebts\u2019 are not debts due to the commonwealth\u201d. The email did not say when the government received the advice. On 27 November, a federal court judgment was published revealing that the government had settled a court challenge brought by Victoria Legal Aid to a debt issued against a Melbourne woman. Legal Aid said the decision \u2013 which stated that the debt was \u201cnot validly made\u201d \u2013 represented a rebuke to the legality of all debts raised under the process. The ATO was drawn into the saga because it was asked to garnishee tax refunds to recoup money over alleged debts, a practice that Guardian Australia revealed Services Australia was accelerating last year, and because alleged debts are partly identified using welfare recipients\u2019 tax returns. Todd told Jordan he was \u201cnot in a position to garnish robodebts when served a notice under s 1233 of the Social Security Act, as the notice would not be in respect of a valid legal debt\u201d. The government overhauled the program and is now reviewing hundreds of thousands of debts, but it has never publicly conceded that the entire scheme was unlawful. It is also facing a class action from Gordon Legal that has garnered nearly 10,000 interested parties. The email was one of six published by the Senate inquiry into the robodebt scheme following a request from senators to the ATO for correspondence discussing the government\u2019s decision to overhaul the program. Labor\u2019s government services spokesman, Bill Shorten, said the emails showed the government put the \u201cemergency brakes on its pet scheme because it knows it is unlawful\u201d while the inquiry chair, Greens senator Rachel Siewert, said the public deserved to know when it received the advice. \u201cIn junking the scheme, [the minister] Stuart Robert referred to the changes as a \u2018refinement\u2019,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cSince the government maintains it has done nothing wrong then it should have nothing to fear from openly revealing what it knew about robodebt\u2019s legality and when.\u201d Siewert said: \u201cThis is a fundamental question and with the government making a claim of public interest immunity over the release of legal advice it is clear that they don\u2019t want Australia to know.\u201d The government services minister, Stuart Robert, declined to address the legality of the scheme during Question Time on Thursday, reiterating his claim that the overhaul represented \u201crefinements\u201d to make the program more \u201crobust\u201d. Robert said his department, Services Australia, was \u201ccarefully and methodically working to identify those customers whose debts may have been calculated using [averaged] income data. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of this process and we\u2019ll advise the House in the future when that process comes to its conclusion,\u201d he said. Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that Robert, the government services minister, had declined to provide the committee with any legal advice the government had about the scheme, citing a precedent set by past Coalition and Labor governments. In a less common move, he also declined to state when any advice might have been received, noting that the government was still defending the class action. Since 2017, the government had defended the robodebt scheme as a legitimate method of recouping money owed by welfare recipients, despite a string of cases in which inaccurate debts were issued. Until November, it had sought to improve the scheme, but stood by its general premise. The tax office and Robert have been contacted for comment.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe are a colony. That\u2019s how we are treated.\u201d In 22 years on this island, Gordon Thomson, president of Christmas Island shire and head of the island\u2019s workers\u2019 union, has fought and lost too many battles with the commonwealth of Australia for diplomatic niceties. \u201cThe commonwealth is all-powerful on this island, and they are exerting all of their authority to run this operation,\u201d he says of the latest incarnation of the island\u2019s immigration detention centre, as a quarantine station for Australians evacuated from the global centre of the coronavirus, Wuhan in China. \u201cThe whole world is looking at Australia and seeing again that people are being incarcerated on Christmas Island. It\u2019s a hysterical response, and it\u2019s going to be ruinous to our tourist industry.\u201d Thomson may be firebrand in his rhetoric. But he is not alone in his sentiment. Through Christmas Islanders, runs a streak of independence. Born perhaps of a community forged in isolation, a colonial history that saw Malay and Chinese workers brought to work on British-run mines in the late 19th century, those who now live on Australia\u2019s most remote inhabited territory have a keen sense of their own island identity, one keenly distinct from that on \u201cthe mainland\u201d. CI has its own number plates, its own robber crab road signs, its own time zone. Ever-present here is a sense of being separate ... even separatist. The island itself rises imperiously from the waters of the Indian Ocean, sharp green hills of dramatic rock escarpment dripping in dense and unforgiving forest. Human settlement clings, almost apologetically, to the narrow edges. It is a land dominated by nature not by humankind. Hidden at the farthest point of the island is the Australian government\u2019s immigration detention centre, repurposed this week as a quarantine facility, housing 270 Australian citizens and permanent residents who have been evacuated from Wuhan, in China\u2019s central Hubei province, the centre of the global coronavirus epidemic. More could yet join. Before Thursday, the centre had fallen into something of a torpor: staffed by more than 100 people, it housed the loneliest asylum seekers in Australia\u2019s arcane system: the Murugappan family \u2013 Nades, Priya and their Australian-born children Kopika and Tharunicaa \u2013 far from their home in Biloela, Queensland as they await a court hearing on the mainland. A surprising number of islanders tell Guardian Australia they\u2019ve never been to or seen the centre, but, to the outside world, the immigration detention centre has become almost representative, almost definitional: the one thing that is known about Christmas Island. The immigration detention centre is absent from day-to-day life on Christmas Island, the remotest part of an already remote part of the world. But while the island and the centre are separate, they are almost inextricably bound. VIRUS ISLAND, the front page of the West Australian screamed in 100-point type the morning the first planeload of evacuees touched down. The reaction on Christmas Island was apoplectic. Local message boards lit up in furious response. \u201cVery, very unfair,\u201d a Malay woman who has lived for decades on Christmas Island, tells Guardian Australia, declining to give her name because of employment sensitivities. \u201cOther people are angry that our island is being used for this.

In a judgment handed down on Wednesday, Justice Michael Lee found AMP was \u201cthe right place\u201d for greed and said it was arguable the penalty \u2013 which was more than Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) asked for \u2013 was \u201can inadequate reflection of the seriousness of the conduct\u201d exposed in the case, but the law limited the fine he could impose. The Asic filed the lawsuit in June last year after the banking royal commission exposed AMP for allowing its planners to \u201cchurn\u201d customers into new insurance policies when there was nothing wrong with the old one. By writing a new policy, instead of continuing the old one or arranging a transfer into a new one, the planners earned large commissions and put clients at a financial disadvantage. AMP initially admitted 40 clients might have been ripped off in this way but has subsequently identified an additional 626 clients who might have been exploited by their advisers, the court heard. Concerns were raised within AMP about the conduct of one planner, Rommel Panganiban, as early as December 2012. But no action was taken against him, and he even earned what Lee called a \u201cremarkable\u201d \u201cgreen 4\u201d rating, the second highest possible, during a routine audit in 2013. At another routine audit the following year, Panaganiban again earned the second-highest mark available, a \u201cB\u201d. \u201cOne might interrupt the narrative to remark that the mind boggles to envisage what one needed to do to get an \u2018E\u2019,\u201d Lee said in his judgment. He was eventually sacked in September 2014. A panel made up of senior AMP executives decided that the company did not need to report the issue to Asic, and instead reported Panganiban to the regulator as a \u201cbad apple\u201d. This was \u201can exercise in damage control\u201d, Lee said. \u201cOn the evidence before me, in the absence of a proper and thorough investigation, there was no basis, let alone a reasonable basis, for the idea to be conveyed to Asic that there was an isolated \u2018bad apple\u2019,\u201d he said. Asic\u2019s investigation uncovered five other planners who had done the same thing. Lee rejected AMP\u2019s assertion it made a good faith effort to comply with its legal obligations. \u201cAlthough there is no finding of dishonesty by those who should have taken prompt action, their insouciance is striking,\u201d he said. When managers were warned of Panganiban\u2019s behaviour, \u201cone would have thought alarm bells would have rung (indeed bellowed); as it happens, the lack of an effective response is an illustration of how badly things had gone wrong within the organisation\u201d, he said. \u201cThis was not a case of a \u2018rogue\u2019 falling through the narrow cracks of an otherwise well-built compliance system,\u201d he said. \u201cPanganiban, though undoubtedly a rogue, fell through holes in what may well have been an expensive, but was an inadequately operated compliance system. \u201cGiven Panganiban was evidently motivated by greed, he was in the right place.\u201d In addition to the fine, Lee found that AMP\u2019s existing program to compensate such clients was inadequate and ordered it to undertake a new program, overseen by the court. He said the penalty handed down assumed AMP did this properly. \u201cI will trust, but then verify,\u201d he said. Asic permanently banned Panganiban from the financial services industry in September 2016.",

Earlier this week, Flatiron Books, an imprint of Macmillan Publishers, faced heavy criticism over its controversial novel, American Dirt, a book many say unfairly profits off the suffering and trauma of Mexican immigrants.

      "bodyText": "Barnes &amp; Noble, America\u2019s largest bookseller, has withdrawn a new series of \u201cdiverse\u201d classic book covers following a backlash from writers who say it does nothing to address the publishing industry\u2019s underlying diversity problems. The new \u201cDiverse Editions\u201d series was announced on Tuesday to honor Black History Month and due to hit shelves on Wednesday. The project saw 12 classic young adult novels receive new covers, the protagonists now \u201cculturally diverse\u201d. Frankenstein\u2019s monster has brown skin, not green, while a kissing Romeo and Juliet have darker skin tones and kinky hair textures. \u201cFor the first time ever, all parents will be able to pick up a book and see themselves in a story,\u201d the company explains on the back cover of the books. But prominent authors were quick to lambast the company, saying that simply changing the skin color of characters from Romeo and Juliet or Frankenstein is a superficial fix, and that the publishing industry should do more to promote writers of color. Writers including Roxane Gay, the author of Bad Feminist, and The Hate U Give writer Angie Thomas, viewed the covers as a superficial fix to a larger problem. \u201cThe only thing you\u2019re disrupting is #BlackHistoryMonth and the literary dignity of communities of color,\u201d David Bowles, a Latinx children\u2019s writer and poet, wrote to Barnes &amp; Noble on Twitter. \u201cSo disappointed in you.\u201d \u201cThis fake diversity nonsense (where they replace white characters with people of color) is disgusting,\u201d the Hugo-winning fantasy writer Nnedi Okorafor wrote. \u201cIt is not sincere or a solution. New stories by people of color about people of color is the solution \u2026 Stop using us and get out of the way!\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, Barnes &amp; Noble said: \u201cWe acknowledge the voices who have expressed concerns about the Diverse Editions project at our Barnes &amp; Noble Fifth Avenue store and have decided to suspend the initiative. The covers are not a substitute for black voices or writers of color, whose work and voices deserve to be heard. The booksellers who championed this initiative did so convinced it would help drive engagement with these classic titles.\u201d The company also clarified that the covers were designed by artists of different ethnicities and backgrounds. The decision of which book covers to redesign was made using artificial intelligence to analyze the text from 100 of the most famous titles in western literature, searching the texts to \u201csee if it omitted the ethnicity of primary characters\u201d. The 12 classics found to meet this criteria were: Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, Moby Dick, Emma, The Secret Garden, Treasure Island, The Count of Monte Cristo, Frankenstein, Peter Pan, The Wizard of Oz, The Three Musketeers, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and Romeo and Juliet. Justina Ireland, the acclaimed writer of YA novel Dread Nation, pointed out the flaws of this approach. She called it a quick attempt to \u201cmake a buck\u201d. Ireland wrote: \u201cAnd this says nothing to the assumption that a little white girl raised in India as a colonizer (Secret Garden) would be culturally the same as a little Asian or Indian or Black girl raised anywhere else ever. Erasing cultural differences is not diversity \u2026 Because what it says is that at the end of the day people of color want to be white. And fam, that ain\u2019t it.\u201d Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s swift apology comes as the publishing industry confronts increasing debates around race. Earlier this week, Flatiron Books, an imprint of Macmillan Publishers, faced heavy criticism over its controversial novel, American Dirt, a book many say unfairly profits off the suffering and trauma of Mexican immigrants. Flatiron made a commitment to hire more Latinx staff and publish more books by Latinx authors. A new study by Lee and Low Books found that, despite concentrated efforts and initiatives by the industry, publishing is just as white as it was four years ago. Bowles told the Guardian on Wednesday that he confronted Sanyu Dillon, the director of publicity of Penguin Random House, the publisher that collaborated on the project, outside a Barnes &amp; Noble location on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue. \u201cDillon said she and three other people of color were in the room,\u201d Bowles said, arguing that people of color in positions of power can also make serious blunders around representation. \u201cThis was not a decision by white higher-ups. POCs are not automatically exempt from being dumbasses.\u201d Bowles said he was tired of the publishing industry\u2019s blunders, and had met with Macmillan executives about improving its relationship with the Latinx community after publishing American Dirt. He added that he was putting his career on the line by protesting against Barnes &amp; Noble, which sells a disproportionate amount of his books. \u201cIt\u2019s people from communities of color who are being villainized,\u201d he said, calling for white authors and editors to become more vocal. \u201cIt\u2019s bothersome they just wait for us to get pissed off and be in front of the drama.\u201d In response to the outrage, Penguin Random House announced it will donate $10,000 to the Hurston Wright Foundation, which works with up-and-coming black authors. They are also launching a Twitter donation campaign, giving a dollar to Hurston Wright each time someone tweets the hashtag #BlackStoriesHavePower. Color of Change, a racial justice organization, called Diverse Editions \u201cliterary blackface\u201d and told the Guardian it is planning \u201ca series of actions in response to the offensive initiative\u201d. Barnes &amp; Noble still plans to honor and participate in Black History Month this year.

In real life Spartacus was killed on the battlefield. This classic scene was invented by the film\u2019s screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/16/dalton-trumbo-hollywood-blacklist-mitzi-trumbo-bryan-cranston\">the blacklisted author</a> who had to work under aliases and found no solidarity in Hollywood. Yet Douglas himself, as the film\u2019s producer, stood up for the writer. He put Trumbo\u2019s real name in the credits and helped end the McCarthyite hysteria.</p> <p>Really, the main reason the scene is so potent is its extraordinary irony. Who on earth could claim to be Spartacus when Spartacus looked like that? Douglas was a one-man Hollywood Rushmore, almost hyperreal in his masculinity. He is now the movie world\u2019s lost Colossus of Rhodes, a figure of pure granite maleness yet with something feline, and a sinuous, gravelly voice. Douglas was a heart-on-sleeve actor, mercurial and excitable; he played tough guys and vulnerable guys, heroes and villains. And as a pioneering producer he brought two Stanley Kubrick movies to the screen: Spartacus (he hired Kubrick to replace Anthony Mann) and the first world war classic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/paths-of-glory\">Paths of Glory</a>, in which he was superb, playing a principled junior officer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6dce4f94-6b67-4d01-96ef-9e02ac3c4373\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/23/1411480493355/fade99b4-f3d9-4630-92fa-e496f88b6554-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kirk Douglas in Spartacus film\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hyperreal masculinity ...

Champion had stunning images and a notable slo-mo scene: it is much admired by Martin Scorsese and transparently an influence on his Raging Bull.

The scene is from the 1960 movie starring Kirk Douglas, the last major survivor of the Hollywood golden age who died on Wednesday aged 103: he was impossibly handsome, virile and inimitably dimpled. A crowd of defeated slave rebels in the pre-Christian Roman empire are told their wretched lives will be spared but only if their ringleader, Spartacus, comes out and gives himself up to be executed. Just as he is about to sacrifice himself, one slave, Antoninus (played by Tony Curtis) jumps up and claims to be Spartacus, then another, and another, then all of them, a magnificent display of solidarity, while the man himself allows a tear to fall in closeup. It is a startling variant on the Christian myth \u2013 in the face of crucifixion, Spartacus\u2019s disciples do not deny him \u2013 and it is a pointed political fiction. In real life Spartacus was killed on the battlefield. This classic scene was invented by the film\u2019s screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo, the blacklisted author who had to work under aliases and found no solidarity in Hollywood. Yet Douglas himself, as the film\u2019s producer, stood up for the writer. He put Trumbo\u2019s real name in the credits and helped end the McCarthyite hysteria. Really, the main reason the scene is so potent is its extraordinary irony. Who on earth could claim to be Spartacus when Spartacus looked like that? Douglas was a one-man Hollywood Rushmore, almost hyperreal in his masculinity. He is now the movie world\u2019s lost Colossus of Rhodes, a figure of pure granite maleness yet with something feline, and a sinuous, gravelly voice. Douglas was a heart-on-sleeve actor, mercurial and excitable; he played tough guys and vulnerable guys, heroes and villains. And as a pioneering producer he brought two Stanley Kubrick movies to the screen: Spartacus (he hired Kubrick to replace Anthony Mann) and the first world war classic Paths of Glory, in which he was superb, playing a principled junior officer. Kirk Douglas was born Issur Danielovitch, the son of a Moscow-born Russian Jewish ragman in upstate New York, with an uncle killed in a pogrom. In his 1988 memoir, The Ragman\u2019s Son, Douglas describes the casual antisemitism that he faced almost throughout his career. Rebranding yourself with a Waspy stage name was what actors and indeed immigrants had to do to survive and thrive in the US. After a start on the Broadway stage, he made his screen reputation playing the driven fighter Midge Kelly in an exhilarating boxing movie, Champion (1949), which earned him the first of his three Oscar nominations. Champion had stunning images and a notable slo-mo scene: it is much admired by Martin Scorsese and transparently an influence on his Raging Bull. In Detective Story (1951), directed by William Wyler, Douglas gave a grandstanding star turn in a melodrama set in a police station, playing the vindictive, violent Detective McLeod, an officer with an awful secret. It was a movie that laid down the template for all cop TV shows, including The Streets of San Francisco, which was to star his son Michael. But it was in Ace in the Hole (1951), directed by Billy Wilder, that Douglas gave his first classic performance, as the sinister newspaper reporter Chuck Tatum who prolongs the ordeal of a man trapped in a cave to create a better story.

We\u2019re calling to ask how you guys are managing while stranded and in quarantine at sea.</strong></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re well. A bit confused, a bit worried but, all in all, we\u2019re doing well. We were supposed to disembark yesterday and to finish our 15-day tour. They informed us that it seems that we have an epidemic. They examined all of us. This morning they informed us that they had found ten people who were infected. As of 6:30 this morning, we\u2019ve been asked not to leave our rooms. We\u2019re inside the rooms. </p> <p>They\u2019ve given us food and beverages. They gave us free internet access beginning yesterday or the day before, when they announced that they were beginning the examinations. This morning they informed us that we were going to have to remain on board the ship for at least 14 days in quarantine. It isn\u2019t clear to us whether we\u2019re going to have to remain in our rooms for 14 days or on board the ship. For the time being, we\u2019re in our rooms and we\u2019re not allowed to leave them.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Q: Are any of the people who were diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus Israeli?</strong></p> <p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t given us information about who the people who got sick are. Out of the Israelis, we\u2019re a family with ten people, and I know that there are another two [Israeli] couples. We saw them completing the tour. As far as I can tell, none of the Israelis have been infected.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Q: How anxious are you, finding yourselves quarantined inside a cabin on board a ship out at sea? That must be an unpleasant experience.</strong></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep our sense of humour and our cool. This is just the first day. As long as we\u2019re healthy, and aren\u2019t sick, and we\u2019re getting food and beverages and the TV works\u2026 we\u2019re trying to remain optimistic and to remain calm. </p> <p>\u201cTo tell you that this isn\u2019t something that makes me anxious?

      "bodyText": "Here are the main points from today so far: The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government is \u201ctaking no chances\u201d and adopting a science-led approach in its response to the outbreak. He added that the government was expecting further cases in the UK. All arrivals to Hong Kong from mainland China will face \u2018compulsory quarantine\u2019. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said all people entering the semi-autonomous territory from the mainland, including Hong Kong residents, will be required to undergo 14 days of quarantine because of the outbreak of the new virus. Thousands of medical staff in Hong Kong have gone on strike in a bid to get the government to completely seal the border with mainland China. The medical union wants the government halt cross-border travel and prevent the spread of a new virus. Thousands of people face spending the next fortnight stuck on a luxury cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama, after initial results showed 10 passengers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Australia confirmed its 14th case of coronavirus. Home affairs minister Peter Dutton flagged that Australians being evacuated from Wuhan in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak could be sent to isolated mining camps if Christmas Island reaches capacity for people being quarantined. The Department of Health said 468 people in the UK have now tested negative for coronavirus. All the 1,500 people who arrived on direct flights from Wuhan in January have either left the UK or are now outside the 14-day incubation period for the virus. Turkey will now also be taking temperatures of all arriving airline passengers in new prevention measures aimed at halting the spread of a virus outbreak that has killed hundreds of people in China, AP reports. Turkish health minister Fahrettin Koca said thermal cameras installed at Turkish airports would begin screening all arriving passengers Thursday. Previously, Turkey was screening travelers from China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and Malaysia. Turkey joins Italy, which announced earlier today that they would be screening all passengers. Last week, Italy barred all commercial flights to and from China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, the same day two Chinese tourists from hard-hit Wuhan tested positive for the new type of coronavirus in Rome. To boost precautions, the Italian health ministry and civil protection agency announced they would use thermo-scanners on all arriving passengers. \u201cIt is clear that this is a temporary measure, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio told The Associated Press. The Department of Health said 468 people in the UK have now tested negative for coronavirus, according to a report by PA Media. All the 1,500 people who arrived on direct flights from Wuhan in January have either left the UK or are now outside the 14-day incubation period for the virus. Rachael Maskell, the MP for York Central, has criticised the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. York Press reports that Maskell called on the Government to \u2018get a grip\u2019 after it emerged that the York student with coronavirus spent a night in student accommodation. \u201cThe student did access student accommodation\u2014Vita Student accommodation\u2014despite our being told they had not,\u201d she said through a point of order in the House of Commons. \u201cThere is confusion over how information is being gathered and shared, which could have a serious impact on public confidence in how the coronavirus is being managed.\u201d Maskell added: \u201cThe government need to get a grip as we may be in the early stages of the management of this infection.\u201d Sean, who didn\u2019t want to give his last name, said it was \u201cincredibly eerie in Beijing today\u201d. The 34-year-old manager of an English language school said there was heavy snow and few people on the street. \u201cI worked from a cafe today, and was the only one inside.\u201d He described the Foreign Office\u2019s advice to \u2018leave China\u2019 last night as \u201ca huge over-reaction and disregard for expats that actually live here and call China their home\u201d. Sean added: \u201cIt\u2019s not simply a matter of hopping on a plane, it\u2019s a huge undertaking. It seemed to be a decision disconnected from the reality.\u201d He pointed out that Beijing is thousands of kilometres from Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak. \u201cIt seems strange to refer to China as a whole, we are talking about a country almost the size of Europe, and to evacuate the entire territory seems a bit much,\u201d Sean said. A Southampton student who went into isolation after feeling ill after returning from China has been given the all-clear from the new coronavirus, PA media reports. Paramedics were sent to the Mayflower halls of residence at the University of Southampton on Monday to take the student to hospital after they contacted the NHS saying they felt ill. The student has since been discharged and allowed to return to their accommodation. The student\u2019s flatmates have been told to self-isolate as a precaution and communal areas of the flat and lifts were deep-cleaned. A university spokesman said: \u201cThe student concerned at our Mayflower halls has tested negative for the new coronavirus, so has the all-clear.\u201d Here\u2019s an explainer on what self-isolation actually means. Thousands of medical staff in Hong Kong have gone on strike in a bid to get the government to completely seal the border with mainland China, AP reports. Hong Kong\u2019s hospital authority says 4,600 medical staff, mainly nurses, didn\u2019t turn up for work on Wednesday. The medical union disputes the authority\u2019s figure and said about 7,000 people took part in the strike. The group wants the government halt cross-border travel and prevent the spread of a new virus. Opposition lawmakers have criticised the decision of Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, to quarantine all people arriving from the mainland for 14 days instead of shutting the remaining two land border checkpoints. They said it could lead to more people from the mainland coming to Hong Kong to seek treatment that would further burden the city\u2019s already taxed medical facilities. Some Britons in China have been in touch with the Guardian to say they have no plans to leave the country any time soon. Sharon Moan, a chemistry teacher who lives with her husband and two children in Shanghai, said she is baffled by the foreign office\u2019s advice. \u201cLife here is very calm. We have few restrictions and feel that everything the local government has put in place is for everybody\u2019s benefit. We actually only began to panic when we read Western media news reports that do not reflect what is happening here. We don\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary and many of our colleagues feel the same. \u201cWe feel unsupported by the consulate as there is no clear explanation as to why they have made this announcement. This is our home and the foreign office hasn\u2019t actually given us a good reason to leave it. We have no plans to leave and will carry on regardless.\u201d Dr Rob Burton, a 65-year-old academic living in a state of self-quarantine in Hangzhou with his Chinese wife, said he is under no illusion that she would be allowed entry to the UK. \u201cI have a life here and my semester at the Communication University of Zhejiang is due to start on 24 February. I feel that the attitude by the foreign office towards British nationals who are married to foreign spouses is toxic. I\u2019m not going to say goodbye to my wife and leave her stranded on her own. Who would do that? It would actually be easier for me to get my English dog, Snooky, and Chinese cat, Fluffy Bum (named in honour of Spike Milligan), home than it would my wife. \u201cI was actually in Wuhan in November so have had a few weeks of wondering if I have been infected. We have been inside for 15 days now and have only been to the supermarket twice. It becomes a psychological test as you become more stir crazy as the rumours mount up. That said, there is a huge effort going on by ordinary Chinese people which I don\u2019t see much about in the foreign press.\u201d Israeli media is reporting around 15 Israeli citizens are on the cruise ship. The public broadcaster, Kan Radio, interviewed one of the Israeli passengers on board. Q: Hello Nicole Ben-David. We\u2019re calling to ask how you guys are managing while stranded and in quarantine at sea. \u201cWe\u2019re well. A bit confused, a bit worried but, all in all, we\u2019re doing well. We were supposed to disembark yesterday and to finish our 15-day tour. They informed us that it seems that we have an epidemic. They examined all of us. This morning they informed us that they had found ten people who were infected. As of 6:30 this morning, we\u2019ve been asked not to leave our rooms. We\u2019re inside the rooms. They\u2019ve given us food and beverages. They gave us free internet access beginning yesterday or the day before, when they announced that they were beginning the examinations. This morning they informed us that we were going to have to remain on board the ship for at least 14 days in quarantine. It isn\u2019t clear to us whether we\u2019re going to have to remain in our rooms for 14 days or on board the ship. For the time being, we\u2019re in our rooms and we\u2019re not allowed to leave them.\u201d Q: Are any of the people who were diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus Israeli? \u201cThey haven\u2019t given us information about who the people who got sick are. Out of the Israelis, we\u2019re a family with ten people, and I know that there are another two [Israeli] couples. We saw them completing the tour. As far as I can tell, none of the Israelis have been infected.\u201d Q: How anxious are you, finding yourselves quarantined inside a cabin on board a ship out at sea? That must be an unpleasant experience. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep our sense of humour and our cool. This is just the first day. As long as we\u2019re healthy, and aren\u2019t sick, and we\u2019re getting food and beverages and the TV works\u2026 we\u2019re trying to remain optimistic and to remain calm. \u201cTo tell you that this isn\u2019t something that makes me anxious? It does make me anxious. Yes, it does. But we don\u2019t really have much in the way of choices.\u201d A hotel worker in the northern Italian city of Verona has tested negative for coronavirus. The woman, who was isolated after coming down with a fever, is a member of staff at the same hotel where a Chinese couple being treated for the virus in Rome stayed for one night. Doctors at Rome\u2019s Lazzaro Spallanzani hospital for infectious disease said the couple were in a \u201cstable\u201d condition after their health deteriorated on Tuesday. Twenty people who had contact with the couple, from Wuhan but who have not shown symptoms of the virus, are still under observation at the hospital. Meanwhile, Italy\u2019s three-month suspension of flights from China, Hong, Macau and Taiwan sparked a diplomatic row with Taiwan. A representative from the Taiwanese government has urged Italy to drop the ban, arguing that the island is not part of China and that cases of the virus there have been limited. Italy on Wednesday began scanning passengers arriving on all international flights at its airports. Thermal scanners had previously only been used on passengers arriving from areas affected by the virus. At Rome\u2019s Fiumicino airport, the checks have also been extended to domestic flights. Here\u2019s a report from Josh Taylor, a Guardian reporter based in Melbourne, that the Australian government is considering sending its citizens evacuated from Wuhan to isolated mining camps if Christmas Island reaches capacity for people being quarantined. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, admitted there is the possibility that Christmas Island could reach capacity if the outbreak continues to spread. He said one option would be for people to share rooms, or potentially even open up other locations away from the rest of the Australian population. \u201cThere are isolated mining camps or the prospect of hotels that you could take over. But I think we\u2019ll look at all of those in order of what we think is the best response, but all of this is in the spirit of preparation.\u201d Australia has confirmed its 14th case of the coronavirus. Dr Jeannette Young, the chief health officer, said the latest case was the fourth confirmed positive test of novel coronavirus in Queensland. She said: The 37-year-old man, a Chinese national from Wuhan (Hubei province), is currently isolated in the Gold Coast University hospital (GCUH). The man is a member of the same tour group travelling with the previously confirmed cases \u2013 a 44-year-old man, a 42-year-old woman and an eight-year-old boy. All four people who have been confirmed to have novel coronavirus are stable. The five others from the same tour group remain in isolation in GCUH. African governments remain under pressure from citizens to arrange their evacuation from China amid fears of the outbreak reaching the continent. So far, most have resisted the calls but Kenyan officials have said they will evacuate 85 of their citizens who are under lockdown in Wuhan city, when restrictions on movements are lifted by Chinese authorities. The Star newspaper in Nairobi reported the decision along with comments from Kenya\u2019s ambassador to China, Sarah Serem, who last week said Kenya \u201cwill not risk further infection by flying any citizens back from China on the basis that it would be better if Kenyans in China were monitored and protected as China found a way to terminate the highly infectious virus. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kenya is ready to deal with the virus. The government of China is in a better position to deal with the virus and bringing Kenyans in China back to Kenya will only further expose the rest to the danger of infection,\u201d the newspaper quoted the ambassador as saying. Serem\u2019s comments underline the significant concerns over the potential consequences of an outbreak of the virus in Africa. The World Health Organization said yesterday the coronavirus outbreak \u201cis a high risk globally and Africa has close ties with China and other Asian countries\u201d. Dr Michel Yao, the emergency operations programme manager in WHO\u2019s regional office for Africa, said health officials were prioritising stopping transmission from affected countries and ensuring that capacity exists to isolate and to provide appropriate treatment to any confirmed cases. \u201cWhat we are emphasising to all countries is that at least they have early detection because we know how fragile is the health system in the African continent and these systems are already overwhelmed by many ongoing disease outbreaks,\u201d Yao told reporters. Many airlines have suspended or restricted flights to China from Africa, where there is yet to be a confirmed case of the virus. An Australian on a flight out of virus-struck Wuhan to Auckland has written for the Guardian on the stress of his evacuation. He wrote: I said my goodbyes to my grandparents at the house, they were holding back tears. My dad sent me into the airport. After he sat around for a few minutes I told him to go home, and I\u2019ll look after myself from there on. There were a lot of us evacuating, with two or three other countries including us. Everyone\u2019s wearing masks, and it was nerve-racking being around so many people in such close proximity. Hearing about a lot of evacuations with confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the flight, it was definitely not ideal to be around so many people at the airport. British nationals on holiday have spoken of their frustration and anxiety of not being able to return to their homes in China. Gareth Gough, a teacher who lives in Shenzhen with his wife, got in touch to say they are both stuck in Thailand. \u201cThere is no certainty when or if we should return and all our stuff is in our apartment,\u201d he said. Gough described the Foreign Office travel advice as \u201cfrustrating\u201d and said it\u2019s not clear what it\u2019s grounded in. \u201cA lot of people may not be able to or afford to leave \u2013 what about them? Matt Hancock says British people should leave on commercial operations, but also if you come home and have symptoms then stay at home \u2026 so which is it? I appreciate its infectious but they have not been very helpful!\u201d Christopher Halkou was on holiday in Vietnam when the Foreign Office changed its advice, \u201cinvalidating my insurance if I return to China for work as an English teacher in Shanghai\u201d. The 25-year-old said after he had two flights cancelled from Vietnam to Shanghai, he made the decision to return to London to assess the situation from there until it was deemed safer to return. Halkou added there was a \u201cfeeling of uncertainty and precariousness about when I\u2019ll be returning to Shanghai. I have valuables in my flat and rent to pay for so I have to return in some capacity to sort things there even if I decide to terminate my work contract.\u201d Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s report on the luxury cruise ship carrying 3,700 quarantined passengers off the Japanese port of Yokohama, after initial results showed 10 passengers have tested positive for the coronavirus. The Diamond Princess has been prevented from sailing on Monday after an 80-year-old passenger who had travelled on the vessel late last month tested positive after he arrived home in Hong Kong, according to Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kat\u014d. Of a further 273 people onboard who have since been tested following health screenings, 31 results had come back \u2013 and of those 10 were positive. Hong Kong\u2019s leader has released more information on the recently announced quarantine for all those arriving from mainland China. Carrie Lam said all people entering the semi-autonomous territory from the mainland, including Hong Kong residents, will be required to undergo 14 days of quarantine because of the outbreak of the new virus, according to a report by AP. Lam said the measure will take effect on Saturday to allow Hong Kong day travellers to make necessary arrangements. She added that two cruise ship terminals, including one where a ship is under quarantine, will be shut down. Lam said the government is looking for more quarantine facilities in addition to the three camps in use and stressed the authorities have remained vigilant and will not shy away from introducing stringent measures to stem the spread of the virus. There\u2019s been praise for the British embassy in Beijing, which is supporting the evacuation process. Paul Maloney, who works for the British Council in China, tweeted he was grateful the embassy was able to help evacuate his family, including his young son Theo, who needed an emergency passport in order to travel. AFP is reporting that travellers from mainland China will be forced to face \u201dcompulsory quarantine\u201d when they arrive in Hong Kong. More readers have got in touch in response to the Foreign Office\u2019s advice urging UK nationals to leave China. Liam Dutch, a 26-year-old teacher in Shenzhen, said he was \u201cconflicted\u201d about the British government\u2019s advice to leave China. \u201cMany of us have spent a lot of time building new lives here, it is not simply a case of \u2018booking a flight home to then return at an unknown date\u2019. \u201cIt would be like putting my life on pause. Firstly, it\u2019s highly expensive to travel 10,000 miles home, and then come back again. Secondly, we do have contractual obligations, rent to pay, friends and girlfriends and of course, our general everyday lives, which we have become accustomed to.\u201d Andy Roberts, a university lecturer, said he is currently housebound with his wife in Ningbo. Roberts has been married to his wife, a 39-year-old Chinese national for 14 years. She has previously lived in UK for 10 years. The 59-year-old said they are restricted to staying in their apartment and only one family member is allowed to visit the supermarket every two days. \u201cThe UK advice is not very practical as getting to an airport and finding a flight would be difficult right now. And if I did go back where would I go? My home is here in China. We are keeping our spirits up; I\u2019m cycling everyday on my indoor trainer, escaping to Zwift virtual worlds, while my wife is working out from YouTube Zumba clips. The cats aren\u2019t fussed. \u201cAt the moment we can still walk round the compound as long as we have masks on and we stop and chat to neighbours, albeit from a distance.\u201d Stock markets have staged a rapid reversal in the last few minutes, after reports of an effective treatment for coronavirus. The reports remain unconfirmed. The FTSE 100 is up by 0.5% at about 7,477 points, having previously been down by 0.3%. The Euro Stoxx 600 index, which measures large companies across Europe, is up by 0.5% for the day, having previously dipped. Reuters reports that traders have cited a Chinese TV report that a research team at Zhejiang University has found an effective drug to treat people with the new coronavirus. Oil prices, weighed down by concerns on coronavirus\u2019s impact on demand, have gained a dollar after the reports. Brent crude oil futures prices jumped from a low of $54.12 per barrel just after 8am to over $55.1 an hour later. They are now up by 2.2% for the day. Cathay Pacific has asked its 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave in the next few months as Hong Kong\u2019s flagship carrier reels from coronavirus outbreak, according to a report by South China Morning Post. \u201cI am appealing to each and everyone of you to help,\u201d said Augustus Tang Kin-wing, the company\u2019s CEO, in a taped video recording, adding the situation the company faced was \u201cjust as grave\u201d as the global financial crisis of 2009. \u201cPreserving our cash is now key to protecting our business,\u201d he said. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government was expecting further cases in the UK. He insisted the government was \u201ctaking no chances\u201d and adopting a science-led approach in its response to the outbreak. In an unexpected announcement on Tuesday, the Foreign Office urged UK citizens to leave China because of the coronavirus. Asked how, logistically, Britons are expected to return to the UK, Hancock told BBC Breakfast: \u201cThere are still commercial flights available. The principle that we are taking is that we want to take no chances with this virus. We want to take a science-led approach.\u201d \u201cThe approach we have been taking is very much driven by the advice of the chief medical officer. This is a very serious virus and having a very serious impact in china,\u201d Hancock added. \u201cThere are two cases only here in the UK but we do expect more, so we are taking no chances.\u201d The two people confirmed to have the virus in the UK remain in quarantine, while a Briton has tested negative after falling ill on a flight back from China. Hancock said people returning from China would not be quarantined and should instead remain at home and call medics if they express symptoms. \u201cThe advice is that if they have symptoms then they should stay at home, self-isolate as it\u2019s called, and call 111, not go to the GP or to the A&amp;E because there\u2019s a risk of spreading the virus,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast. Owen Moone, a British teacher in Shenzhen in Guangdong province, said he was stuck in Vietnam because his flight back was cancelled. The 34-year-old was on holiday in Vietnam for the lunar new year. \u201cLuckily it\u2019s a cheap country, but I only have a 30-day visa. I\u2019m not sure when flights will be reinstated to Hong Kong or mainland China, but I need to return either to work or get my stuff,\u201d Moone said. \u201cPart of me is tempted to go home or to Canada where my girlfriend is visiting family. Not sure when the situation will change as there is currently a lot of ambiguity and things are changing by the day.\u201d Moone added his school was due to start back on 10 February, but has now been delayed until 17 February. \u201cIt\u2019s the ambiguity and lack of clarity that is frustrating for me, although I am of course sympathetic that it is a rapidly changing situation so certainties are hard to come by,\u201d he said. The spread of a new coronavirus could throw \u201ccold water\u201d on the 2020 Olympics, senior organisers have warned. Toshiro Muto, the chief executive officer, sounded a grave note speaking at a meeting with officials of the International Paralympic Committee, according to a report by AP. \u201cI am seriously worried that the spread of the infectious disease could throw cold water on the momentum toward the Games,\u201d Muto said. \u201cI hope that it will be stamped out as soon as possible.\u201d Saburo Kawabuchi, the mayor of the Athletes Village, where 11,000 Olympians will stay, was also apprehensive. \u201cI truly hope that the infectious disease will die down somehow so that we will be able to operate the Paralympics and Olympics smoothly,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the worst case we will do our utmost for the athletes so that they will be able to concentrate on performing their best.\u201d I want to hear your news, experiences and questions about the Coronavirus outbreak. You can email me at aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com, or reach me through my Twitter profile, @aamnamohdin Good morning, this is Aamna Mohdin taking over the blog from Martin Farrer. LG has become the first major technology company to pull out of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) due to take place in Barcelona over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. PA Media reports that the Korean firm would not be attending the technology convention, one of the largest events in the industry calendar, to announce its latest gadgets. The company will instead hold separate events in the near future. A number of other technology companies, including Sony, Samsung, Huawei and Microsoft are still due to appear at MWC. LG said in a statement: LG Electronics is closely monitoring the situation related to the novel coronavirus outbreak, which was recently declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization, as the virus continues to spread outside China. With the safety of its employees, partners and customers foremost in mind, LG has decided to withdraw from exhibiting and participating in MWC 2020 later this month in Barcelona, Spain. This decision removes the risk of exposing hundreds of LG employees to international travel, which has already become more restrictive as the virus continues to spread across borders. In lieu of its participation in MWC, LG will be holding separate events in the near future to announce its 2020 mobile products. LG Electronics thanks its supporters and the public for their understanding during these difficult and challenging times.\u201d That\u2019s about it from me for today. I\u2019m handing our rolling coverage to my colleague Aamna Mohdin. Thanks for joining me. Here are the main points from today so far: The death toll from novel coronavirus has climbed to 490 in mainland China. There remains one additional fatality in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. There are now 24,505 confirmed cases around the world, 24,292 being in mainland China. Thousands of crew and passengers onboard a cruise ship in Japan are being held in quarantine for at least two weeks after 10 people tested positive for the virus. Hundreds more people have been tested and results are awaited. A British passenger, David Abel, said the Diamond Princess was like a \u201cghost town\u201d. Passengers and crew on another cruise ship, the World Dream, are also being quarantined in Hong Kong after 30 crew members showed symptoms of coronavirus, including fever. Britain is sending a final evacuation plane to Wuhan this weekend where it is understood that about 165 Britons remain. Japan is sending a fourth plane. A plane carrying New Zealanders, Australians, Britons and people from several Pacific nations has landed in Auckland from Wuhan. They will be quarantined for two weeks. The economic impact on China is mounting as more cities went into lockdown. Oxford Economics say two percentage points could be knocked off the country\u2019s growth this quarter. United and American Airlines have suspended flights in and out of Hong Kong. The World Health Organization says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to halt the spread of the disease. Financial markets in Asia have rallied again on Wednesday as investors continued to believe that the economic impact of the crisis will be limited. Economists have warned that the Chinese economy faces a severe hit in the first quarter of the year as huge parts of its manufacturing and service industries remain shut down. \u201cThe inopportune timing of the outbreak around Chinese New Year, a time of increased transport and economic connectivity... as well as the lockdown of affected regions all add to the equation,\u201d Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics told AFP. Oxford Economics believes the virus could knock at least two percentage points off China\u2019s growth in the first quarter before it bounces back in April-June. It cut its full-year outlook to an expansion of 5.4%, which is well down from its previous estimate of 6%. AFP says that 56 million people in Hubei province alone are in lockdown as the government tries to stop the spread of the disease. The annual new year holiday was due to end last weekend but has been extended for many factories until 10 February to limit contagion. Hangzhou near Shanghai has imposed severe restrictions on residents. Some three million people in the city, the home of Alibaba, one of China\u2019s biggest companies, have been told only one person per household will be allowed outside every two days to buy necessities. At least three other cities in eastern Zhejiang province - Taizhou, Wenzhou and parts of Ningbo - have imposed the same measures, affecting some 18 million people, AFP says. Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which is based in Wuhan and is one of China\u2019s biggest carmakers, said its factories remained shut and would only reopen dependin \u201con the prevention and control of the epidemic\u201d. The team at Capital Economics said there was very little data coming out of China to make a proper judgment but they said that the number of confirmed cases within China has continued to rise and is now almost four times the number recorded in the Sars outbreak in 2003. Capital said: If the disruption fades soon, there is still a chance that employment and incomes will be relatively unaffected. In this case, consumer spending may simply be deferred temporarily, resulting in a strong rebound in domestic demand later this year, as happened with SARS. But the longer the outbreak drags on, the greater the risk of a hit to employment and a more permanent loss of output. A third case has been confirmed in the Philippines. The WHO says a 60-year-old Chinese woman has coronavirus. And in another development, Uzbekistan is evacuating 84 people from Wuhan, according to Uzbekistan Airways. The central Asian nation joins a host of other countries to send planes to rescue its citizens. Reuters has reported some fascinating detail about an international business meeting held in Singapore in Janaury that reveals something about the way in which the virus has spread around the world. Officials in Malaysia said on Tuesday that its first citizen to be infected with the virus - a 41-year-old man - had attended the meeting that had also included several international delegations, some from China, Reuters says. On Wednesday officials in South Korea said a 38-year-old Korean who came into contact with the Malaysian when he travelled to Singapore for a conference has also been infected. The South Korean man had a meal with the Malaysian man, as well as several other South Koreans during the conference, South Korea\u2019s Joongang Ilbo newspaper reported. Singapore\u2019s health ministry said on Tuesday that the meeting involving the Malaysian took place at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, adding the city-state was working to identify individuals in close contact with the cases. Peter Beaumont, a senior reporter on the our global development desk, has been looking at whether it\u2019s fair to criticise the World Health Organization for its handling of the crisis. Critics have said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been guilty of doing China\u2019s bidding by not declaring the virus a world health emergency quickly enough. A smiling Ghebreyesus has been pictured in Beijing with Chinese president Xi Jinping leading to accusations that Beijing was not being pushed hard enough to come clean about the extent of the contagion. Beijing is a large donor to the WHO. But Beaumont argues that it is still difficult for the WHO to push its diplomacy with China too hard for fear of being shut out. He quotes one source as saying: \u201cChina was very quick to let the WHO know what was happening on 31 December. The organisation\u2019s goal was to get as much information about what was happening in China to inform what the rest of the world would need to do.\u201d Read his whole piece here: A new documentary Netflix series called Pandemic has been released with horribly appropriate timing. It explores what can be done to tackle the spread of diseases such as Sars and swine flu. Our feature writer, Brigid Delaney, says it \u201cmoved her to tears\u201d. Hong Kong health officials say 90% of passengers on the ship are Hong Kongers and that none have had contact with three mainland Chinese who developed symptoms of the virus while on board between 19 and 24 January. Three passengers developed the virus after leaving Guangzhou on the ship on 19 January, Genting Cruise Lines, which owns the operator Dream Cruises, said. They disembarked in Vietnam for treatment and the ship returned to Guangzhou on 24 January. The South China Morning Post and the Chinese website TenCent reports that authorities in Zhaoqing, a city in northern Guangdong, said a person who was on that cruise was diagnosed with coronavirus on Saturday. Health officials in Zhaoqing said another 41 people on the cruise should quarantine themselves at home or get in touch with dooctors if they develop a fever. They added that there were 108 people from Hubei on the cruise, including 28 from Wuhan. Hong Kong\u2019s health department says 30 crew on the World Dream cruise ship docked in Hong Kong have symptoms of the coronavirus. It added that department staff are conducting tests on 1,800 crew and passengers on board the ship. It was refused a berth in port in Taiwan on Tuesday and returned to Hong Kong. Medical workers in Hong Kong have begun a third day of strike action over concerns that the city\u2019s government is not doing enough to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Hong Kong recorded its first death from the outbreak on Tuesday and has 18 confirmed cases, bringing more calls for the authorities to seal the last remaining routes in and out to the mainland. \u201cAs the disease is spreading rapidly in our community, and locally infected cases are steadily increasing, we are dangerously close to a massive community outbreak comparable to Sars,\u201d a newly formed union called the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) said in a statement. On Wednesday, dozens of medical representatives including the chairwoman of HAEA, Winnie Yu, marched to government headquarters to press their demands for the border to be sealed. Carrie Lam, the city\u2019s chief executive, has kept open three routes to China, arguing that to close them would be \u201cinappropriate, impractical and discriminatory\u201d. The UK\u2019s Press Association agency has spoken to a British man in Wuhan who fears he contracted the virus at the end of November but is not sure how he will get out of the city. So news of another evacuation flight may give hope to Jamie Morris, a 23-year-old teacher from New Tredegar in South Wales. He said he had not been able to make the recent flights back to the UK because his passport had been given to the Chinese government to extend his residency permit. He said the Foreign Office\u2019s crisis team in London had told him \u201cto be patient and they will be in touch if anything changes\u201d. The Japanese foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, said on Wednesday that Japan would send a fourth chartered flight to Wuhan tomorrow to bring back about 200 passengers. The passengers could include Japanese nationals as well as their Chinese spouses, Motegi told reporters. Japan has already sent three planes to Wuhan to evacuate hundreds of its citizens. Reuters reports that a Canadian man on a flight from Toronto to Jamaica falsely announced to passengers that he had the coronavirus, forcing the plane to return to the airport where he was arrested. The incident occurred on Monday during a WestJet Airlines flight from Toronto to Montego Bay. The Boeing 767 was carrying 243 passengers. \u201cA male was causing a disturbance on the flight, saying he had been to China and had the coronavirus,\u201d said Sarah Patten, a spokeswoman for police in the town of Peel, close to Toronto\u2019s Pearson international airport. After the plane landed, the 29-year-old man was checked by medical staff who concluded he did not have the coronavirus. He was arrested, charged with mischief and will appear in court on 9 March. Julie-Anne Broderick, a passenger on the plane, said she saw the man taking a selfie and announcing he had the virus. \u201cThe flight attendants came, gave him a mask and gloves and just told him that he had to move to the back of the plane,\u201d she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The captain then told passengers he thought the incident was a hoax but had to return to Toronto, she added. The UK government is chartering a final flight to bring British nationals back from Wuhan. After Britons in mainland China were controversially urged to leave the country, the Foreign Office said the plane was expected to leave in the early hours of Sunday morning local time and will land at RAF Brize Norton. It added that the government wanted to ensure that all British nationals in Hubei province contact the Foreign Office to register if they want to leave on the flight. According to the Press Assocation new agency, 165 Britons and their dependants remain in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, while 108 people have requested assistance to leave as of the early hours of Wednesday. A total of 94 UK nationals and family members have already been evacuated to Britain from Wuhan on two flights which arrived on Friday and Sunday. One passenger was taken to hospital in Oxford after telling medics he had a cough and a cold, while the rest of those who came back are in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral. Passengers on another cruise ship are being tested for the virus. World Dream, which is run by Dream Cruises, was denied entry to the southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung aon Tuesday and docked in Hong Kong on Wednesday. All passengers and crew are undergoing health checks, Cable TV reported, according to Reuters. The ship visited Taiwan\u2019s northern Keelung port on Monday, Taiwan\u2019s health authorities said, and some passengers were allowed to disembark. The death toll from novel coronavirus has climbed to 490 in mainland China, with one additional fatality in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. There are now 24,505 confirmed cases around the world, 24,292 being in mainland China. Ten people on board a cruise ship anchored off Yokohama in Japan have tested positive for the virus. In total, 273 people of the 3,700 on board the Diamond Princess have been tested, with only 31 results in so far. The infected people have been taken to hospitals onshore for treatment. The ship and all those on board is being quarantined for at least 14 days. Read our full story on the stricken vessel here. United and American Airlines have suspended flights in and out of Hong Kong. Nearly 200 people \u2013 mostly New Zealanders and Australians \u2013 are on their way to Auckland on a specially chartered plane from Wuhan. The World Health Organization says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to halt the spread of the disease. Financial markets in Asia have rallied again on Wednesday as investors continued to believe that the economic impact of the crisis will be limited. The Chinese government continues to try to put a positive spin on the crisis that has seen millions of people forced to stay in their homes. The state news agency Xinhua tweeted some suggestions today about how families can amuse themselves in the confines of their homes. My colleague Alison Rourke detailed some of the other positive message put out by Beijing here: The number of cases of novel coronavirus around the world has reached 24,505, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker site. The vast majority \u2013 24,292 \u2013 are in mainland China with 213 around the world. (Those figures from the university don\u2019t include the 10 on the Diamond Princess in Japan.) The Carnival statement said the infected people will be taken ashore to Yokohama by the Japanese coastguard and taken to local hospitals. The ship will remain under quarantine off Yokohama for at least 14 days, as required by the ministry of health. The statement also said: The ship will go out to sea \u201cto perform normal marine operations\u201d such as the production of fresh water and ballast operations before picking up food, provisions and other supplies from Yokohama. Passengers will receive free internet and telephone to stay in contact with their family and loved ones. The crew is working to keep all guests comfortable. Princess Cruises \u2013 part of the UK-listed Carnival \u2013 \u201cwill continue to fully cooperate with and follow the instructions of global medical authorities and the Japanese government\u201d. Carnival has cancelled the next two Diamond Princess cruises departing Yokohama (yesterday and 12 February). There are 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew currently onboard. Approximately half the guestsare from Japan. Two Australians are among the 10 people who have tested positive for coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the cruise company Carnival have confirmed. The other people infected are three Japanese, three from Hong Kong, one American and one Filipino crewmember. Justin McCurry has been finding out more information about the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is being quarantined off the coast of Yokohama in Japan after an outbreak of coronavirus on board. Ten people have tested positive for the virus out of 31 results that have come back so far from 273 tests. David Abel, a British passenger who is on board the ship with his wife Sally, described the situation on his Facebook page. We are now officially in quarantine. It appears that our quarantine is on board the ship, that we will not be taken off to a hospital. The 10 people that are affected, they are being taken off very soon by the local coastguard into a medical facility. We are to remain on board the ship and we are confined to our cabins. The ship is like a ghost town, it\u2019s really weird. I went for a walk around a part of the ship that is normally really busy \u2013 the musicians were still out playing, but where there normally would have been crowds of people, I saw maybe 20. Even the shopping areas where it would be packed are empty. We\u2019ll have a full report soon. In Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, the authorities are converting an additional eight buildings, including gymnasiums, exhibition centres and sports centres, into hospitals, the official Xinhua news agency has reported. That\u2019s on top of three conversions already announced. Together the process will add an extra 10,000 beds to the city\u2019s hospital capacity. There have been 8,351 confirmed cases in the city, according to the Chinese news website TenCent. A new hospital in Wuhan with 1,000 beds opened to patients on Monday. And here\u2019s a timelapse video of how that first emergency hospital was built in a matter of days. There\u2019s also another 1,600-bed hospital being built. The economic impact of the outbreak appears to be building. We\u2019ve already heard about a widening lockdown in China, with Hangzhou being the latest city to restrict movement. That kind of measure will inevitably hurt the economy but foreign companies are also feeling the impact and deepening the effects by suspending operations in China and Asia generally. The latest companies to warn about the impact, or to flag closure of some operations include: American Airlines and United Airlines are suspending all flights to and from Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific Airways which said on Tuesday that it will cut around 30% of its capacity over the next two months. The carmaker Hyundai is suspending production in South Korea because of disruption to the supply of parts. Nike, which has closed around half its stores in China, says its operations will continue to be hurt by the lockdown seen across China. Nevertheless, the financial markets appear fairly sanguine about it all. All the major stock markets are up quite a bit today. The ASX200 in Sydney is up 0.43%, the Nikkei is up 1%, Seoul is up 0.74%, Hong Kong is up 0.87 and Shanghai is 1.11% to the good. Oil also shook off its problems. Brent crude oil futures rose US44c, or 0.8%, to $54.40 a barrel on the prospect of production cuts by Opec this month. The World Health Organization says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The WHO has declared the outbreak a global health emergency but it said on Tuesday night that the lockdown put in place by the Chinese government to limit the spread from the epicentre of Wuhan offered a chance to halt transmission. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday: While 99% of cases are in China, in the rest of the world we only have 176 cases. That doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t get worse. But for sure we have a window of opportunity to act\u201d More on the Japanese cruise ship from our correspondent in Tokyo, Justin McCurry. Tests for the virus have been carried out on 273 of the 3,700 passengers and crew on board the Diamond Princess after an 80-year-old man who had been on the ship last month tested positive when he arrived home in Hong Kong. Justin writes: Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said only passengers and crew who had been in close contact with the infected man or were feeling unwell had been tested. Of the 273 people tested, 31 results had come back \u2013 and of those 10 had tested positive, Kato said. The 10 infected passengers, who include three Japanese nationals, are being transferred to a hospital. It was immediately not clear if health authorities planned to test other passengers. Kato said the remaining passengers and crew would be required to stay on the vessel for 14 days \u2013 the maximum incubation period of the respiratory illness. Carnival Japan, the local unit of the British-American cruise operator, said on Tuesday the turnaround of the ship had been delayed by about 24 hours. It was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. The 10 new cases bring the total number of confirmed infections in Japan to 33. The suspension of flights by airlines into China has now spread to Hong Kong. The two biggest carriers in the United States, American Airlines and United Airlines, said late on Tuesday US time that they won\u2019t fly in or out of the territory for two weeks. An American Airlines spokeswoman said its suspension of its Hong Kong flights to and from Los Angeles and Dallas had begun on Tuesday and would continue until 20 February. United Airlines said falling demand meant it was suspending its flights, also until 20 February. The carrier\u2019s last US flight to Hong Kong will depart San Francisco on Wednesday and the last return flight to San Francisco from Hong Kong will depart on Friday. The US government has already placed severe restrictions on travel from China into the US. Last week American Airlines suspended its flights to and from mainland China until 27 March. United has now suspended US-bound flights from mainland until 28 March. Ten people onboard a cruise ship docked off the port of Yokohama have tested positive for coronavirus, the Japanese health minister said on Wednesday morning. Hundreds more of the 3,700 passengers and crew on the Diamind Princess ship have been tested and are awaiting results. So far 273 people have been tested and 31 results have come back. The ship is run by the UK-listed Carnival cruise company. It said on Tuesday night that the departure of the ship had been delayed by 24 hours. The health checks began on Monday evening after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man who sailed on the vessel last month tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus, Reuters said. Back to the Air New Zealand flight that left Wuhan on Wednesday morning. Radio New Zealand is reporting that one person was stopped from boarding the plane because they were found to be unwell after the screening process for passengers. RNZ reports that New Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry said about 60 people who registered for the flight did not turn up at the airport. This is the full list of nationalities on the plane: 54 New Zealand citizens and 44 New Zealand permanent residents on Chinese passports 23 Australian Citizens and 12 Australian permanent residents on Chinese passports 17 Timor Leste 17 Papua New Guinea 8 Britain 5 Samoa 4 Tonga 2 Fiji 1 Kiribati 1 Federated States of Micronesia 1 Uzbekistan 1 Netherlands Our reporter Ben Doherty is on Christmas Island where Australian evacuees are being taken for quarantining. There are 35 Australians on board an Air New Zealand plane that left Wuhan for Auckland on Wednesday morning local time, along with 100 New Zealnders, some Britons and also people from several Pacific nations. The Australians will then be flown from Auckland to Christmas Island, which is on the other side of Australia in the Indian Ocean, making for a journey of 17,000km. Ben has sent this report on the extraordinarily roundabout route the Australians are being forced to take and it includes this excellent map. It\u2019s worth noting that the number of deaths in China rose by 65 from 425 on Tuesday to 490 today. That\u2019s an increase of 15.3% compared with a percentage increase of 18% the day before. So perhaps there are signs that the rate of fatalities is slowing. The number was closer to 30% on some days last week. The latest figures show that 490 people have died in mainland China from the virus. According to the very reliable Johns Hopkins University tracker, there are now 23,680 confirmed cases in the mainland meaning the mortality rate from the virus is 2.07% nationally. Of the deaths, 479 have now occurred in Hubei province where the capital, Wuhan, is the eipicentre of the deadly outbreak. There have been 16,678 confirmed cases in the province making for a death rate of 2.87% in the province. The next highest number of deaths is two in the provinces of Henan, Chongqing and Heliongjiang, showing how concentrated the outbreak has been. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll start by outlining the main developments today: The death toll in the Chinese province of Hubei has risen to 479 as of the end of Tuesday local time. There have been 3,156 new cases reported in the epicentre making 16,678 in the province. The mainland China total is now 490 deaths, with 23,680 recorded cases. There has also been one death in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines, bringing the global total to 492. Almost a dozen people on a cruise liner at the Japanese port of Yokohama have tested positive for coronavirus, Reuters is reporting. All British nationals have been advised to leave China in a move criticised as leaving people to fend for themselves. An eight-year-old boy has become Australia\u2019s 13th confirmed case. He is isolation in a hospital in Queensland. An Air New Zealand evacuation has left Wuhan carrying 193 passengers, including 100 New Zealanders, 23 Australians and 70 people from Pacific countries such as Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Kiribati, Tonga, Fiji and the Federated States of Micronesia. Hyundai is suspending production in South Korea because the outbreak has disrupted the supply of parts from China. Nike became the latest multinational company to warns that it expects its business to be damaged by the outbreak. Global financial markets rallied for the second day in a row on Tuesday as invesorts shrugged off concerns that the virus could damage the world economy. BeforeI bring you more details on all these developments, here is a roundup some of the precautions being taken by countries around the world:",

      "bodyText": "UK taxpayer funds totalling $750m (\u00a3577m) have been invested in new fossil fuel projects in developing African countries despite the government\u2019s public commitment to tackling the climate crisis, according to an international watchdog. Global Witness found that a London-based investment group raised $1bn from the UK government over 16 years and spent three-quarters of this supporting oil and gas projects in some of Africa\u2019s poorest countries. The Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), which relies on the UK taxpayer for two-thirds of its funding, committed $750m to fossil fuel projects between 2002 and 2018, including recent investments in heavy fuel oil power plants in Senegal and Mali. Since then, the group\u2019s investments have included $24m for a gas plant in Togo and $31m for a gas plant expansion project in Ivory Coast. Adam McGibbon, a campaigner at Global Witness, said \u201cnot a penny of public money\u201d should be used on fossil fuel infrastructure. \u201cThe British public will quite rightly be appalled to know that their tax money is being used to finance some of the world\u2019s dirtiest fossil fuels, ultimately contributing to climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt flies in the face of claims by the UK government, ahead of hosting a major UN climate summit this year, that the UK is a global leader in fighting climate change.\u201d The report is likely to reignite concerns that UK international aid designed to help support infrastructure in developing countries is instead increasing reliance of those states on oil and gas. Last year the government was taken to task by the environmental audit committee for sending billions of pounds overseas to help build fossil fuel power plants while claiming a climate victory on home soil. Global Witness said the government should immediately end all fossil fuel investments and commit to using UK taxpayer money solely to fund clean energy. A spokeswoman for the PIDG said the fund was \u201cacutely aware that infrastructure development has the potential to lock in future carbon emissions patterns\u201d and that the countries it invested in were \u201cthe most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change\u201d. The fund has said it would prioritise renewable energy projects in its investment plans, and had already invested a total of $711m in renewable energy infrastructure in recent years. It has also banned investments in coal, to align with global commitments made through the Paris agreement on climate change. But the investor would continue to use UK taxpayer funds to support oil and gas infrastructure in countries where the need for electricity is urgent, the spokeswoman added. The Global Witness report says: \u201cIt is difficult to see how supporting further fossil fuel projects is in any way in line with Paris agreement commitments. Fossil fuels hinder, rather than help, development \u2026 there is no longer any justification for supporting fossil fuel power generation with aid.\u201d A Department for International Development spokesman said: \u201cWe know developing countries rely on energy from a range of sources and the UK can help them move towards clean energy.

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia is using a secretive special court set up for terrorism-related cases to systematically prosecute human rights activists and other dissenting voices who defy the country\u2019s absolute monarchy, a new report has found. The human rights watchdog Amnesty International spent five years investigating 95 cases heard at the Specialised Criminal court (SCC) in Riyadh, concluding in a report published on Thursday that the court is routinely used as a weapon to silence criticism despite the kingdom\u2019s recent attempts to cultivate a reformist image. Since 2011, overly broad counter-terror and anti-cybercrime laws have been used by the SCC in unfair trials to hand down prison sentences of up to 30 years and in some cases the death penalty to human rights defenders, writers, economists, journalists, religious clerics, reformists and political activists, particularly from the country\u2019s Shia minority, Amnesty said. \u201cEvery stage of the SCC\u2019s judicial process is tainted with human rights abuses, from the denial of access to a lawyer, to incommunicado detention, to convictions based solely on so-called confessions extracted through torture,\u201d said Heba Morayef, Amnesty\u2019s Middle East and North Africa regional director. Saudi Arabia has embarked on a series of wide-reaching social reforms since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was appointed heir to the throne in 2017, allowing women to drive, curbing the powers of the country\u2019s notorious morality police and granting women the freedom to travel without the permission of a male guardian. The reforms, however, have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, including the detention of high-profile activists such as Loujain al-Hathloul, who campaigned for women\u2019s right to drive. Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record has also faced renewed international scrutiny since the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom\u2019s Istanbul consulate in 2018. The SCC was established in 2008 to try individuals accused of crimes related to membership and support of al-Qaida. However, citing court documents, government statements and national legislation, as well as interviews with activists, lawyers and individuals close to the cases documented, Amnesty alleges that the court has morphed into a \u201cmockery of justice\u201d that targets freedom of speech and peaceful political activity. One of the most disturbing findings shows that the SCC is heavily reliant on confessions extracted under torture conditions. At least 20 people have been sentenced to death, 17 of whom have been executed. Hussein al-Rabi, a defendant in a mass trial of protesters from Saudi Arabia\u2019s restive Shia-majority Qatif province, was executed in 2019 despite telling the court that his interrogator had hit him and threatened hanging and electric shocks unless he confessed. Rabi refused to do so, so the interrogator denied him food and water, leading to his hospitalisation. \u201cThe presumption of innocence is not part of the Saudi Arabian judicial system,\u201d said Taha al-Hajji, a lawyer who has represented many defendants before the SCC. In response to Amnesty\u2019s investigation, Saudi Arabia\u2019s official human rights commission offered a summary of the relevant laws and court procedures but failed to address any of the individual cases raised.",

      "bodyText": "It would take Boris Johnson two full terms as prime minister to fulfil his pledge to \u201clevel up\u201d the British economy, according to one of the UK\u2019s leading economic thinktanks. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said Johnson\u2019s plans would probably take more than a decade to raise the level of economic output across the country, due to capacity constraints. In a warning before next month\u2019s budget, Britain\u2019s oldest economic thinktank said the government\u2019s plan to raise investment in infrastructure projects by about \u00a320bn per year would have only a modest impact on the UK\u2019s dismal productivity levels. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is expected to outline plans for a rise in government spending in order to meet Johnson\u2019s promise made before the election. In a central plank of the Conservative party campaign, Johnson pledged to invest in new transport projects and other large public works to narrow the gap between the UK\u2019s wealthiest cities and poorer regions. However, NIESR said the plan would take a decade to deliver and would fail to offset the damage to economic growth from Brexit. The positive impact on the economy from higher spending on infrastructure would be less than 0.5% of GDP over the long run, compared with an estimated 3-4% cost of Brexit, it added. Faced with employment at record levels and labour shortages for companies, the thinktank said the government could struggle to implement its plans. It warned that a rapid increase in spending risked driving up inflation, which could lead to the Bank of England raising interest rates. It also cautioned that a slower increase in spending risked disappointing voters who expected an immediate impact from the Tories\u2019 election promises. However it said spending could be targeted at parts of the country where unemployment rates are above the national average, including the north-east of England, Yorkshire, the Midlands and Wales. In a blow to the chancellor, NIESR said Javid would also fall short of achieving his growth target of 2.8% per year, while his new budget rules made before the election would probably be trashed by public spending at the levels promised in the campaign. GDP growth is expected to be 1.3% this year, the same as in 2019, before a rise to 1.6% in 2021. Javid outlined spending rules to balance the government\u2019s current account budget \u2013 which would match day-to-day government spending with tax income \u2013 by the middle of the next parliament, and to set a limit on borrowing for infrastructure investment of no more than 3% of GDP. However NIESR said the rules appeared arbitrary and were at risk of being broken unless tax increases are brought in, therefore clashing with the levelling-up strategy. Jagjit Chadha, the director of the NIESR, suggested the government needed to be more honest about the speed with which it could tackle longstanding regional divisions and drive up living standards.

      "bodyText": "BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme has increased its audience despite threats of a boycott from listeners who claim to be exasperated by the broadcaster\u2019s political coverage. The morning show continues to divide opinion about its interviewing style after the departure of the long-serving presenter John Humphrys, but its audience rose to 7.2 million listeners a week in the final three months of 2019, aided by interest in the general election campaign. Since then Today\u2019s editor Sarah Sands has resigned after the announcement of cuts to the BBC\u2019s news output, while ministers are maintaining an increasingly uneasy boycott of the programme on the basis that No 10 believes it does not speak to the voters the government needs to win over. The official quarterly radio listening figures from Rajar also show that Zoe Ball\u2019s BBC Radio 2 breakfast show has lost about a million weekly listeners since she took over the slot from Chris Evans \u2013 whose rival Virgin Radio show has attracted about a similar number to the digital-only station. Radio 1\u2019s audience has hit a record low, as the station fights to attract younger listeners who are being lured away by other forms of listening. The station still reached 8.8 million listeners a week in the final three months of 2019, but is increasingly having to use different ways to reach its future audience. Research from the regulator Ofcom this week showed that radio use among five- to 15-year-olds has fallen from 26% to 22% in the space of a year. The BBC\u2019s head of radio, James Purnell, said: \u201cThe latest figures show some of the challenges we face across the radio industry with retaining a live listening habit amongst young people, whose audio consumption is rapidly changing.

Smart speakers such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa are increasingly shaping listening habits, with many people replacing their kitchen radio set with such devices. This can change which stations people listen to, as users have to verbally prompt for their preferred station every time they turn the speaker on \u2013 rather than just leaving a radio set tuned to the same station. The BBC\u2019s national stations continue to dominate headline listening figures but commercial beneficiaries of changing habits include talk radio station LBC, which now reaches 2.7 million listeners a week and Absolute Radio, which has grown the audience its network of stations playing different music from every decade from the 1960s to the 2000s.",
